Der in Cot­tbus lebende Robert Timm ist Anführer der extrem recht­en “Iden­titären Bewe­gung Berlin-Bran­den­burg”. Sehr gern berichtet der Architek­turstu­dent darüber, wie er den Weg in die Rei­hen der “Iden­titären Bewe­gung” gefun­den habe. In einem Inter­view mit dem öster­re­ichis­chen “Iden­titären” Mar­tin Sell­ner erk­lärt er 2016 beispiel­sweise, dass er in Berlin in einem linkslib­eralen Eltern­haus aufgewach­sen sei. Er habe an “Mul­ti-Kul­ti” geglaubt, sei in linken Kreisen unter­wegs gewe­sen. Auch an Anti-Nazi-Protesten habe er teilgenom­men und sog­ar zwei Mal an Demon­stra­tio­nen zum “rev­o­lu­tionären ersten Mai in Kreuzberg”. Doch dann, so erzählt es Timm, sei er mit der “Real­ität” kon­fron­tiert wor­den. Als “link­er Aktivist” habe er ein­se­hen müssen, dass “Mul­ti­kul­ti und Links-Sein” Fehler seien.Linke Illu­sio­nen — dann Aufwachen — dann “iden­titär­er Aktivis­mus”: Robert Timms Biogra­phie ist nicht so ger­adlin­ig, wie er sie darstellt. Tat­säch­lich war Robert Timm zwis­chen­zeitlich in der “Pick-Up-Szene” aktiv — also in Kreisen, die alles andere als “links” sind. Als “Pick-Up”-Szene wer­den Zusam­men­schlüsse von Män­nern beze­ich­net, deren Ziel es ist, über die Anwen­dung psy­chol­o­gis­ch­er Tricks Frauen “ver­führen” zu ler­nen. Dazu gehört unver­mei­d­bar der sex­is­tis­che Anspruch, dass “der” Mann über “die” Frau bes­tim­men solle — in Extrem­fällen wer­den in der “Pick-Up”-Szene sog­ar Verge­wal­ti­gun­gen legit­imiert.2013 erschien ein Doku­men­tarfilm mit dem Titel “Die Ver­führungskün­stler” (Trail­er hier Face­bookpräsenz ), der unter anderem Robert Timm in der Zeit der Drehar­beit­en im Jahr 2011 porträtiert. Schon der damals 20-jährige Timm ist offenkundig kein “link­er Aktivist”, son­dern damit beschäftigt zu ler­nen, wie man “Frauen flach­legt”.Wie man sich Frauen zur Beute macht, lässt sich Timm bei Sem­i­naren und auf Ver­anstal­tun­gen wie der “Pick Up Con” beib­rin­gen. Im Film stellt er die Ent­deck­ung von “Pick Up” als biografis­chen Ein­schnitt dar — zuvor habe er kein soziales Renomee gehabt und keine sex­uellen Erfahrun­gen gemacht: “Ich habe mich vorher nichts getraut. Vorher hat­te ich null Erfahrun­gen mit Mäd­chen. Nichts nen­nenswertes, kein Kuss, kein gar nichts. Fre­unde auch eher wenig. Und dann kam Pick Up und alles hat sich zum Guten gewen­det.”Selb­stver­ständlich haben viele Men­schen Prob­leme im Umgang mit anderen Men­schen, vor allem Her­anwach­sende, ger­ade auch Bere­ich der Sex­u­al­ität. Bemerkenswert ist nur, dass Timm sich entsch­ied, zu ver­suchen, diese Prob­leme über den Besuch von “Pick-Up”-Seminaren zu lösen. Der Blick auf Frauen in der “Pick Up Szene” ist eben ein­schlägig — sie gel­ten als Objekt, sollen durch eine möglichst masku­line Selb­st­präsen­ta­tion des Mannes über­wältigt wer­den. Der Mann soll Jäger sein und möglichst viel Beute machen. “Pick Up” ist ein Euphemis­mus für psy­chis­che und physis­che Manip­u­la­tion­stech­niken, die männliche Durch­set­zungs­fähigkeit und Dom­i­nanz stärken sollen.Im Film wird die Radikalisierung von Robert Timm abge­bildet. Anfangs sieht man einen ein­samen jun­gen Mann, der bei seinen Eltern wohnt. Die Mut­ter begrüßt beim Heimkom­men die Hauskatzen deut­lich her­zlich­er als ihren eige­nen Sohn, der im Kinderz­im­mer hockt und nur gefragt wird, ob er die Woh­nung gesaugt habe. Es entste­ht der Ein­druck, dass der schüchterne Timm nach Wegen sucht, selb­st­be­wusster zu wer­den.Wenig später hat Timm die Hal­tung und das Vok­ab­u­lar von “Pick Up” über­nom­men. Stolz und fast arro­gant referiert er, dass ein dom­i­nan­ter Mann ein “Alpha” sei und der durch “Pick Up” erre­ichte Sex als “” (“Fuck Close”) beze­ich­net wird. Andere Film­pro­tag­o­nis­ten äußern im Ver­lauf der Doku­men­ta­tion in Anbe­tra­cht des frauen­feindlichen Men­schen­bilds im “Pick Up” dur­chaus Skru­pel. Robert Timm hat hinge­gen vor allem Bedenken, wenn die “Pick-Up”-Sprüche zu flach oder die über­teuerten “Pick-Up”-Seminare zu kom­merziell sind.Der Blick auf die alten Fil­mauf­nah­men zeigt: Die Selb­st­präsen­ta­tion von Robert Timm als geläutertem Linken ist so nicht richtig. Sollte er sich “links” gefühlt haben, dann vor sein­er Zeit in der “Pick-Up”-Szene. Sein biografis­ch­er Bruch läge dann in der Hin­wen­dung zum “Pick Up” (so, wie er es im Film selb­st schildert). In den jün­geren Inter­views hinge­gen erzählt er von ein­er Abwen­dung von der “Multi-Kulti”-Linken hin zur Erken­nt­nis ein­er über­wälti­gend neg­a­tiv­en “Multi-Kulti”-Realität, die ihn schließlich zu den “Iden­titären” brachte. Das Zwis­chen­stück “Pick Up” lässt er aus. Dabei fol­gt der Weg von den sex­is­tis­chen Sem­i­naren zu den “Iden­titären” ein­er inneren Logik: die män­ner­bündis­che, kämpferische Selb­stin­sze­nierung der “Iden­tiären Bewe­gung” und ihre antifem­i­nis­tis­chen Inhalte sind in hohem Maß übere­in­stim­mend mit den in der “Pick-Up”-Szene ver­bre­it­eten Ansicht­en.
The London office of architect Zaha Hadid seems like an unlikely place for a protest. But yesterday, protestors gathered to condemn the statements of the firm's director, and Hadid's longtime collaborator, Patrik Schumacher. Holding signs that read “fascist” and “class war,” the protestors railed against Schumacher's recent manifesto for urban policy , which called for the privatization of all urban space and an end to affordable housing policies. In short, the poor don't belong in cities anymore.
Does the architect have a responsibility to the greater good of society? Or just to the client?
Meanwhile, the firm itself is an unlikely lightning pole for political controversy. The firm–whose eponymous founder died suddenly this year, leaving Schumacher as its leader–is known for a brand of formalism that emerged in the 1990s, as new digital tools enabled the design and construction of radical new forms. Its work often seems distinctly apolitical and ahistorical, ceding design decisions to algorithms capable of generating immensely complex forms–an approach known as parametricism, which even Schumacher has struggled to define. Yet ZHA, a firm so indicative of architecture's tenuous relationship to real users, is now at the center of a controversy over the industry's political and ethical role in the world.
It might seem like an insular debate within the rarified world of academic architecture, but it also gives us a glimpse into a moment of reckoning for a profession whose relationship to politics has always been blurry. And if you look hard enough, you'll see that it also mirrors a similar process happening in Silicon Valley, where the tech world is struggling to define its own responsibility to society at large.
It all started on November 18, when Schumacher gave a keynote lecture at the World Architecture Festival in Berlin.
In it, they outlined a libertarian's urban manifesto of sorts, where privatization would fix all of the woes of the modern city. Railing against affordable housing policies including low-income housing and homeowner subsidies, they argued that city centers should be ceded to the wealthy–and to people who “contribute” to the economy. “Is it not fair that it's someone else's turn to enjoy the central location?” they said, as Dezeen first reported. “Especially if it's those who really need it to be productive and to produce the support required for those that have been subsidized.” Meanwhile, public spaces like parks should be privatized. All in all, it was remarkably close to the vision President-elect Trump seems to have for American cities. (Schumacher, it's worth noting, is a supporter of Brexit, and has argued that the EU's regulations stifle innovation the same way Trump has argued that regulation stifles business in America, Dezeen reports.)
The reaction was swift. London Mayor Sadiq Khan called the manifesto “out of touch” and “just plain wrong.” In a fiery rebuttal, critic Phineas Harper called for the community to stop paying Schumacher attention, saying that the doing so “reveals the intellectual weakness of our profession.” Schumacher responded on Facebook, commenting that they had been derided as “the Donald Trump of architecture,” and that they had simply wanted to start a “constructive conversation” and challenge the “current left-liberal (anti-capitalist) consensus within our discipline.”
Then, on Tuesday, Zaha Hadid Architects sent out an official statement disavowing its director's remarks, writing that “Zaha Hadid did not write manifestos. They built them,” and that Schumacher's comments did not “reflect Zaha Hadid Architects' past—and will not be our future.” The executors of Zaha Hadid's own estate came out with their own statement, according to the Guardian‘s Oliver Wainwright. (While a spokesperson for ZHA confirmed to Co.Design that Schumacher is still with the firm, Schumacher themselves did not respond to requests for comment.)
John McClane is in a pinch. He's cornered inside a plane parked on the tarmac at Dulles International Airport and surrounded by rogue ex-military soldiers trying to gun down the "Die Hard" anti-hero played by Bruce Willis.
As they lob grenades into the cockpit, McClane uses the ejector seat to escape certain death and parachute to safety. It's at this moment that Eric Wilkinson said the series featuring everyone's favorite anti-hero took its first turn toward the absurd.
But Wilkinson, a South Jersey native and independent movie producer, thinks they can save the series they love so much -- and spent a lot of their money this week to prove it.
"It would be awesome if I could hear from somebody," Wilkinson said of the full-page ad they took out in The Hollywood Reporter, a Los Angeles-based entertainment magazine, asking the attention of Bruce Willis, producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura and director Len Wiseman.
While FOX plots a John McClane origin story for its DIE HARD prequel, Eric D. Wilkinson publicized their pitch @THR pic.twitter.com/SNEL0iEHbI -- Miles Maker (@milesmaker) November 11, 2015
A sixth film in the series, "Die Hard: Year One," was announced last month and Wilkinson told NJ Advance Media that they think there's still time to steer the series back from the realm of improbable escapes on the wings of a Harrier jet to the guy forcing down 1,000-year-old Twinkies to survive.
The full-page, black and white ad -- which could have cost Wilkinson a bit more than $16,000 to run, according to rates listed on the magazine's website -- conveys a two-fold purpose.
First, it explains their love of the five films featuring Bruce Willis as the wrong guy at the wrong place at the wrong time. Second, it pitches a plot that jumps back and forth between a young McClane as a rookie NYPD cop and an older Willis as a wrongly-accused convict having to save the day.
RELATED: A Good Day to Die Hard is yippe-ki-just-OK
Wilkinson has worked in the entertainment industry since 1998, starting in sales, marketing and acquisition before getting the opportunity to work on films himself.
"You get a good sense of whats sell-able and marketable," the producer of 2007 sci-fi flick The Man From Earth said Thursday, adding that he's working on another movie called "Midnight Show" that might have some scenes shot in the tri-state area.
"The problem is, actors don't live here," they said. "Would I love to shoot a movie here? Absolutely. There's a ton of great things about South Jersey."
Bruce Willis, a Salem County native, was raised in Penns Grove. Wilkinson said the father of one of their best friends even taught a young Willis in high school.
Years later, Wilkinson would be at the former Atco drive-in 1988 to witness the first film in the series.
"It's my favorite film of all time. I've been there on opening day for every one of the sequels," their ad reads. "But while I like the sequels, each one has left me somewhat unsatisfied."
And that's why they want to help Willis' character return to form -- a regular guy just trying to save their marriage, get home for Christmas and nurse "a perfectly good hangover."
Have they heard from Willis and company yet?
"Not yet," they said.
But who knows, there's always that chance they'll ask them to come out to the coast, get together, have a few laughs.

Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Inhofe plans to highlight a little-known speech by an EPA regional administrator who admitted on video that the Obama administration's air regulations will kill the coal industry.
“Lisa Jackson has put forth a very powerful message to the country. Just two days ago, the decision on greenhouse gas performance standard and saying basically gas plants are the performance standard which means if you want to build a coal plant you got a big problem. That was a huge decision,” Region 1 EPA Administrator Curtis “Curt” Spalding says, in footage filmed at Yale University.
“You can't imagine how tough that was,” Spalding continued. “Because you got to remember if you go to West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and all those places, you have coal communities who depend on coal. And to say that we just think those communities should just go away, we can't do that. But they had to do what the law and policy suggested. And it's painful. It's painful every step of the way.”
Watch here:
Beyond Pesticides' 30th National Pesticide Forum, March 30-31, 2012, Yale University, New Haven, CT.
Spalding's comments, made at the Beyond Pesticides' 30th National Pesticide Forum March 30-31, mirror those made by then candidate Obama in 2008. In which they explained that under their cap and trade system coal would suffer.
“[I]f somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can,” the president said while campaigning. “It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted. That will also generate billions of dollars that we can invest in solar, wind, biodiesel, and other alternative energy approaches.”
Region 1 serves New England states and territories including Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and 10 Tribal Nations.
According to their office, Inhofe will show the YouTube video of Spalding's comments on the floor of the Senate Monday evening, while offering a plan “to put a stop to President Obama's war on fossil fuels and affordable energy.” (VIDEO: Chris Matthews: Obama ‘made a mistake on Keystone')
This video is the second in a series about EPA regional administrators sharing insights about the administration's more controversial energy policy positions and tactics.
In April, Region 6 EPA Administrator Al Armendariz resigned over comments they made — highlighted by Inhofe on the Senate floor — in which they compared EPA's enforcement philosophy to Roman crucifixions.
“I gave an analogy to my staff about my philosophy of enforcement, and I think it was probably a little crude and maybe not appropriate for the meeting but I'll go ahead and tell you what I said,” Armendariz said in 2010. “It was kind of like how the Romans used to conquer little villages in the Mediterranean. They'd go into a little Turkish town somewhere, they'd find the first five guys they saw and they'd crucify them. And then, you know, that town was really easy to manage for the next few years.”
“And so you make examples out of people who are in this case not compliant with the law. Find people who are not compliant with the law, and you hit them as hard as you can and you make examples out of them, and there is a deterrent effect there.”
Armendariz apologized and resigned shortly after their words were made public. On Wednesday a House Energy and Commerce Committee panel will probe Armendariz's record and EPA's policies.

It's 54 years since the arrival of the pill in Australia liberated women's sexuality from reproduction. 45 years since Germaine Greer dared women to taste our own menstrual blood. And 42 years since sex-ed pioneer Betty Dodson encouraged women to confront their vulvas with a mirror. Yet too many women remain crippled with the medieval conviction that the sexuality of their body is an individual source of shame.

Which is perhaps why Emily Nagoski's book, Come As You Are: The Surprising New Science That Will Transform Your Sex Life, has been described by other sex educators as “a master-class in the science of sex” and “the best book I have ever read about sexual desire”.
A former researcher at the Kinsey Institute, Nagoski lectures in human sexuality at Smith College, as well as maintaining the popular sex blog, thedirtynormal.com. Repeated requests from overwhelmingly female students, blog-readers and anxious strangers regarding what is, can, or even should be normal about human sexuality provoked them to write the book.
As a literary work, Nagoski's book deserves plaudits for the rare achievement of merging pop science and the sexual self-help genre in prose that's not insufferably twee. A few too many gardening metaphors aside, Come As You Are resists the temptation to antique, smirky puns and offers up hard facts on the science of arousal and desire in a friendly and accessible way.
Amidst talking through experiments on how the male and female genders differ in their physical response to sexual stimuli, they also present graphs. In one startling comparison, Nagoski explains that there's a 50% overlap between what a male's genitals respond to as “sexually relevant” and what a male brain responds to as “sexually appealing”. In women, this overlap is only 10%.

“Men's genitals are relatively specific in what they respond to,” writes Nagoski, “and so are their brains. Women's genitals are relatively general in what they respond to, while their brains are more sensitive to context.”
It's the lightness of Nagoski's tone combined with the book's happy, of-course-you're-normal message that illuminates a dark and depressing realisation: so ingrained is a cultural loathing of women, their bodies and their sexuality that it has taken until 2015 for this book to arrive with due fanfare.
In this context, Come As You Are is something of a spoiler-alert, not merely for the book but for our culture as a whole: “stress, mood, trust, and body image are not peripheral factors in a woman's sexual wellbeing; they are central to it”.
Citing science is apparently needed to justify facts about sex that anyone born in a female body should already, implicitly know. No adult should really need a book to tell them that getting enough sleep, eating well, avoiding overwork, feeling good about yourself and not banging a loser are essential to sexual happiness.
Yet if there's one great revelation in Nagoski's book, it's that when it comes to sex, the cultural beliefs we've inherited from ancient misogynies still override the materially bloody obvious.
Women grappling to understand how the feminists who fought the sexual revolution weren't able to bring home complete victory perhaps underestimated the willingness of the other side to war-profiteer.
Even in our era, which enjoys historically unprecedented sexual acceptance and an ocean of accessible explicitness, vast new industries of sexual therapy, treatment, advice and surgery have repurposed sexual stigmas of the past into profitable anxieties of the present.
There's money to be made from portraying women's bits as freakish, their sexual performances deficient and their libidos somehow faulty. I salute those who can resist this mythology; even porn-star Jenna Jameson, whose vagina once enjoyed enviable popularity, eventually themselves succumbed to an unnecessary cosmetic vaginoplasty. By the way, the surgery wrecked their career.

Nagoski's book is, of course, part of this industry. A cynic might say she's just carving out a their own share of the market by selling women a gentler message than they're used to. “We're all made of the same parts,” they reassure, “but in each of us, those parts are organised in a unique way that changes over our life span.”
This statement shouldn't be revolutionary – but an optimistic view is that by making allies of science, research and hard data in their work, Nagoski's book will boost the forces fighting for women's true sexual liberation.
“You are normal!” doesn't sound much like a battlecry, but in a world keen to sexually homogenise women from the gap of their thighs to the shape of their mons pubis, the sentiment lands like a bomb.
Federal campaign finance laws prohibit federal contractors from donating directly to candidates or their super PACs. It may or may not be constitutional after Citizens United but it is a good policy. The sight of large federal contractors seemingly backing a favorite horse in the race certainly could lead the average person to think that a candidate is for sale. And, once one contractor gives, others sort of have to give, too, just to be competitive for future contracts… not that an elected official would ever favor their donors over non-donors in contracting decisions.
But laws, as we've seen throughout Hillary Clinton's ignominious, lumbering stampede over America's political landscape, are, in their view, something that the little people get all concerned about.  They are not bound by anything other than their own greed and ambition, and as those are both boundless they operate rather unfettered.
A super-PAC backing Hillary Clinton has accepted $200,000 in donations from a company holding multiple contracts with the federal government — despite a ban on such contributions. According to a review of contributions by The Hill, Boston-based Suffolk Construction made two contributions of $100,000 to Prioritize USA, which is backing the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. At the time it made the contributions, Suffolk held multiple contracts worth $976,560 with the Department of Defense for maintenance and construction projects at a Naval base in Newport, R.I., and the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., according to the government website USASpending.gov. Suffolk — which, by Forbes's estimate, brings in some $2 billion in revenue annually — also donated $10,000 in 2015 to Right to Rise, a super-PAC that supported Republican Jeb Bush's now-defunct presidential bid. The donations from Suffolk highlight how a 70-year-old campaign finance law meant to prevent pay-to-play deals between public officials and companies making money from the government is often ignored by those making the donations and those on the receiving end.
Sure, some apologists will argue that this is a super PAC and not Hillary Clinton. That, in this case, is a distinction without a difference. They could make a public statement requesting that anyone raise money on their behalf do so in accordance with the law because a public statement is never “coordination” under campaign finance law. The very fact that they say nothing about the blatant campaign finance violations of their super PAC says volumes. But, then again, we've known Clinton is a grifting, money-grubbing crook for some years.
Aboriginal women who stepped forward with allegations of police abuse in a northern Quebec mining town have forced the province to pull the Sûreté du Québec from the cases and suspend eight officers.
Public Security Minister Lise Thériault put Montreal city police investigators in charge Friday, reversing course 24 hours after standing by the provincial police. They said a program aired by Radio-Canada's investigative show Enquête Thursday night brought new facts to light. The program documented apparent police indifference along with heart-wrenching interviews with the women alleging officers abused their power and sexually and physically assaulted them.
Ms. Thériault broke down in tears Friday as they tried to defend the process that saw the SQ investigate allegations against its own members, but they admitted that public confidence in the system was damaged.

"I'm in shock, like all Quebeckers," they said. "It's time we do something – and that's what we are doing."
When Enquête journalists started their reporting last spring, they actually set out to investigate the 2014 disappearance of Sindy Ruperthouse, an aboriginal woman from Val-d'Or. Them family said there was little sign police took the disappearance seriously. Enquête wanted to test the diligence of police investigations in the context of calls for an inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women.
A reporting crew was at a table with more than a half-dozen of Ms. Ruperthouse's friends talking about their difficult life when the women started sharing stories of police abuse. Several women described incidents where officers would take them outside the city and leave them in the cold and dark to walk home and sober up.
"In the middle of winter, they pick us up and haul us out to the airport and dump us," Mani Decourcy said. Charlene Papatie described their sister being told to run into the woods in the middle of the night and having to walk home several kilometres. Often, sexual services were demanded before the women walked home.
Allegations of similar practices have dogged police forces in other parts of Canada. In British Columbia, a 2013 Human Rights Watch report accused the RCMP of similar abuses of women. In Saskatchewan, the dumping of native people outside Saskatoon led to criminal convictions of two police officers, the firing of two others and triggered a 2004 public inquiry.
The held a news conference to defend its handling of the cases, saying officers in Montreal were in charge. Captain Guy Lapointe, an SQ spokesperson, said some witnesses were unwilling to come forward and a lot of what investigators initially heard was little more than rumour. More women came forward after the reporters came to town, they said.
The province is setting up an independent office to investigate police conduct, but it's not yet up and running.

Representatives of the native community in Val-d'Or welcomed the suspensions and the decision to take the cases out of the hands of the SQ, but they also repeated calls for a national inquiry into missing and murdered women.
"A national emergency is taking place at our doorstep and we have to do something. Women are terrorized," said Edith Cloutier of the Val-d'Or Native Friendship Centre. They saluted the courage of the women who came forward in the Enquête report. "They have paved the way."
Chief David Kistabish of Abitibiwinni First Nation said they "was deeply disturbed and disgusted" by the women's stories aired Thursday. "As an Algonquin, I'm hurt. As Chief of the Abitibiwinni, I'm shocked," they said. "I can only salute these women's courage."
Johnny Wylde, Ms. Ruperthouse's father, said they hope their daughter's disappearance will get a proper examination now.
He, too, called on prime-minister-designate Justin Trudeau to immediately call an inquiry. "Keep your promise," they said. "Don't wait."
Parents from Guelph, Ont., are applauding the city's decision to suspend part of its swimming attire policy, after their eight-year-old daughter was told to cover their bare chest while taking a dip in a city wading pool over the weekend.
Cory McLean said their daughter felt "embarrassed" and "nervous" after the incident.
"To be honest, I was so surprised by the actual rule when I heard about it that I thought for sure it was some sort of mistake, some rule from way back that just got carried into the present," said McLean, who described the policy as "sexist and antiquated."
In the city's 2015 Community Guide, the policy states that "females ages four and older must wear a bathing top in … enclosed or fenced pools."
The city said it would review the section of the swimming attire policy related to tops and that during this review the requirement would not be enforced.
McLean said they are confident that permanent change is coming.
"I would like to see some gender equality in the rule, that's all. We were never trying to announce that we want small children to be topless, running around in parks," said McLean.
"We're not exhibitionists, we're just people that noticed a little bit of a loophole in the rules and guidelines that caused the gender inequality and we just wanted to make everyone aware of it."
In a press release, the city apologized "that the event caused the little girl to feel singled out or embarrassed," adding that the lifeguard who issued the command was following city policy.
"We've received a lot of diverse feedback about the part of the policy that requires girls above the age of four to wear a swimming top," said Kristene Scott, general manager of parks and recreation, in the release.
"Some people support the policy while others feel it no longer meets their needs. The city's challenge is to find a reasonable balance that serves our community."
Councillor says rules must apply equally
Ward 6 Coun. Mark MacKinnon says the city should not have a rule that prevents women, but not men, from going topless.
"We need to have a policy that has been updated for case law," MacKinnon said, referring to the Gwen Jacob's case, in which women won the right to go topless in public.
"In terms of toplessness, it just makes sense to remove that guidance completely. It's not age related. It's gender related."
MacKinnon said changing the rules to allow women to go topless at city pools would align Guelph with neighbouring communities like Cambridge.
Citizens of Guelph are encouraged to take part in the city's review of its swimming attire policy.
The city says details on how that can be done will be released in the coming weeks.
Motivated Reasoning
This week I was reading an article from the Associated Press called Some fracking critics use bad science. The gist of the article is that Gasland director Josh Fox used false information in their new film, The Sky is Pink. Among other things, they claimed that cancer rates were higher in Texas where fracking is taking place. Three different cancer researchers in the area contradicted them on this claim.
But then the article went on to say something that I thought was very relevant to debates on just about any controversial energy topic — fossil fuel subsidies, climate change, hydraulic fracturing:
One expert said there's an actual psychological process at work that sometimes blinds people to science, on the fracking debate and many others. “You can literally put facts in front of people, and they will just ignore them,” said Mark Lubell, the director of the Center for Environmental Policy and Behavior at the University of California, Davis. Lubell said the situation, which happens on both sides of a debate, is called “motivated reasoning.” Rational people insist on believing things that aren't true, in part because of feedback from other people who share their views, they said.
As a result, misinformation is hard to stamp out, because it tends to be repeated — confirming the views people already hold. That brings me to the topic of today's column: Climate change claims around the Keystone XL pipeline.
Keystone Pipeline and Climate Change
While some might mistake this column for advocacy for the Keystone XL pipeline, its real purpose is a call for truth in advertising. Whether the Keystone XL is wise energy policy is certainly debatable, but the debate should be on the basis of factual information. Our best chance for passing responsible energy policy is if all sides can differentiate between fact, opinion, hyperbole, and misinformation.
I have gone on record as saying I favor the Keystone XL pipeline for a very simple reason: We are going to continue to need oil for some years to come, and the pipeline would improve U.S. energy security. I also strongly advocate for policies that reduce U.S. oil dependence, so my ideal objective would be that the Keystone pipeline is built — creating jobs in the process — and the transition from U.S. oil dependence renders it obsolete. But it would be there as an insurance policy in case our policies fail to sufficiently wean us from oil in a timely manner.
Opponents envision that by shutting down the pipeline, they will slow the growth of the tar sands industry and force a faster transition from oil. The risk that they never acknowledge is that it may weaken our energy security by shifting our dependence from Canada to Venezuela or the Middle East, and further encourage Canada to strengthen their relationship with China. If that happens, then pipeline opponents will have made the situation worse on just about every count.
Game Over For the Planet?
NASA scientist and climate change advocate James Hansen declared that if the oil sands are tapped, “it is essentially game over” for the planet, and that the pipeline would be a “fuse to the biggest carbon bomb on the planet.” Bill McKibben has led a high profile campaign of protests against the pipeline on the basis of climate change impacts. Keystone opponents have recently called for a review of the climate change implications of building the pipeline.
But then a paper published last February in Nature Climate Change calculated that if the 170 billion barrels of proven reserves from the Alberta oil sands were burned it would produce just 0.02 to 0.05 C of warming. That contrasts sharply with the hyperbolic statements.
So how did Hansen and McKibben respond? In The Least Reassuring Reassurance of All Time, McKibben wrote:
If we burn through the known quantities of tarsands oil, that alone will raise the planet's temperature by .4 degree Celsius—which is about exactly how much we've already raised the planet's temperature by burning everything we've burned since the start of the Industrial Revolution.
Hansen said:
“The argument that the currently known amount of carbon in the tar sands pit is small compared to the total fossil fuels burned in two centuries is fallacious and misleading — every single source, even Saudi Arabia, is small compared to the total. If we once get hooked on tar sands and set up infrastructure, the numbers will grow as mining capabilities increase. Tar sands are particularly egregious, because you get relatively less energy per unit carbon emitted and there is associated environmental damage in the mining.”
Joe Romm deemed the report confusing because the “study does not actually include the extra emissions from tar sands extraction in its core calculations” and they go on to state that inclusion of those emissions could bump up the total by 17%.
The Facts
Let's examine each criticism. Granted, Romm is correct and the emissions could actually be 17% higher. What does that mean? The 0.02 to 0.05 C of warming might be as high as 0.06 C. In other words, instead of warming by one-twentieth of a degree, it might be one-seventeenth of a degree. Romm chose not to spell that out, preferring to leave readers with the impression that the study is questionable.
With respect to McKibben's comment, there is zero possibility of burning through all of the oil sands. It is technically impossible to extract all of the oil in place, so they put up a fictional case of burning through 1.8 trillion barrels of oil in place in order to make the number — 0.4 C — as high as they could possibly make it. The number is nonsense because the assumption is nonsense. The real question at hand is the 170 billion barrels of proven reserves, but more importantly how quickly that could reasonably be developed (more on that below).
Hansen's argument is more along the lines of “We can't get this oil sands thing started because production will grow and that will add to an already bad situation.” Of course Canada is highly committed to developing their oil sands, oil sands production has in fact been growing for many years, and a great deal of infrastructure is already in place.
Length of Time
Other than Romm's nitpick, critics of the study didn't find much fault with the calculations, but insisted “We have to make a stand over the oil sands.” But here is a point I haven't heard anyone discuss. Canada's oil production in 2011 was 1.3 billion barrels. Over the past decade, its growth rate has been under 3% (but still above the global average growth rate). Let's pretend that growth rate can continue until Canada reaches 10 million barrels per day, putting its oil production on par with Saudi Arabia and Russia. How long would it take to produce 170 billion barrels of oil and contribute the 0.02 to 0.05 C (or 0.06 C) of warming? Until the year 2075!
So given the very low contribution to the overall climate change equation — plus the length of time it would take to extract and burn through that 170 billion barrel reserve — the focus on this issue is tremendously misplaced. It is a classic tempest in a teapot. Time would be far more efficiently spent trying to figure out a way for the developing world to industrialize without consuming ever greater quantities of coal.
Conclusions
My point here is not “Don't worry, be happy.” Certainly we can say that in a world struggling to limit carbon emissions, Keystone XL will just add to the problem. But all carbon emissions add to the problem, and if that's the case, have pipeline opponents stopped using oil? Almost universally the answer is no. Why? Individuals would probably rationalize that what they consume isn't significant enough when weighed against the bigger picture.
But that's my point about Keystone. We have all of this hyperbole around it, when the math shows that it would be effectively background noise. If you are basing your opposition to Keystone on the climate change implications, then you may want to question whether fighting to stop a 0.06 C temperature rise in 2075 is the correct issue to rally around.
There are more legitimate issues upon which to base your opposition. What might be the real downside of building the pipeline? Much has been made of the risk of spills and leaks. These risks do not disappear if the pipeline isn't built; they just shift to the rail cars and trucks that are carrying that oil right now. The pipeline is likely an improvement over the status quo in that regard.
The real downside from building the pipeline in my view is that U.S. consumers — particularly those in the Midwest — are likely to pay higher prices for fuel. After all, the purpose of building the pipeline is to access new markets for the crude oil, which would relieve a glut of oil in the Midwest. This would mean higher prices as that glut is relieved (but potentially lower world prices as the crude is added to global supplies). Of course many climate change advocates believe we should pay higher prices for fuel, so you have to consider whether arguing this point is consistent with your views on fuel prices.
But that possibility could form the basis of an informed debate on the topic. We can weigh the jobs created and potentially the jobs saved in Gulf Coast refineries against extra costs to consumers in the Midwest. But the risk of a potential tiny temperature change more than 60 years from now does not — in my opinion — form the basis for a credible argument against the pipeline.
Rahul Gandhi has been pilloried all over Twitter and elsewhere for their audacity in demeaning the office of Prime Minister through their public putdown of the government's ordinance to negate a Supreme Court verdict on convicted MPs.
However, this criticism - while valid - deflects blame from where it should really rest: the Prime Minister. There is much sympathy for Manmohan Singh for having had to face public humiliation from the Congress Vice President. The Economic Times even called on Sonia Gandhi to discipline Rahul in an edit titled "Rahul Gandhi's ignoble tantrum". But this is all wrong. It is Manmohan Singh who has demeaned the office of Prime Minister by acting like a toothless regent or family retainer for the last nine years and more.
Even if you are an appointed PM without public or legislators' support, you always have the power to say no.That is what Manmohan Singh is guilty of - they never said no to A Raja, to Suresh Kalmadi, to all the crooks who benefited from the Coalgate scam, or even to a nobody like Rahul Gandhi. They did everything the family wanted, and so they are sure to accept public humiliation in order to let the Gandhi scion pretend to be a knight in shining armour single-handedly battling criminality in politics.
Granted, saying no too often may have meant losing their job, but it was Singh's decision to live with ignominy rather than self-respect. If they want the job only in order to enter the Guinness Book of Records as the only Indian PM to complete 10 years in office after Indira Gandhi, that shows their priorities. It is about himself. One cannot expect them to uphold the dignity of their office or the nation's honour.
Those who prefer to remain doormats will be treated like doormats. This is what Rahul Gandhi did - and why blame them for that? Rahul never suspected that Manmohan Singh was anything other than a doormat. Doormats are meant to wipe your dirty feet.
The second, and more important, issue thrown up by Rahul's "nonsensical" intervention on the criminal protection ordinance is more fundamental. Manmohan Singh losing face and demeaning their office is a private tragedy that does short-term political damage, but the root cause of this situation is the one that has been repeated ad nauseam: the separation of power from responsibility.
Even here, it is Manmohan Singh who is clearly responsible. Anyone who is willing to let real power rest elsewhere and is willing to carry the can for someone else's misdemeanours deserves what they get.
In the real world, no leader actually wields absolute power – not even autocrats. Prime Ministers have to depend on powerful party leaders and various lobbies for support, not excluding political allies. This means the office of Prime Minister has to work through differences and evolve acceptable compromises.
However, compromising with powerful interests still leaves you with the power of agency – your ability to at least influence those interests and lobbies and stamping your own role in the process.
In the Indian context, we have seen the Left seek power without responsibility in UPA-1, we have seen the late Sena chief Bal Thackeray do this with the Maharashtra Chief Minister when the Sena-BJP government was on power. Deve Gowda and Inder Gujral also lacked political power when they were PMs, but they worked on compromise nevertheless. They never pretended they were all-powerful, but they did try to influence decisions. They were not ciphers.
What we have not seen so far is a Prime Minister who has completely abdicated responsibility, abandoned all pretence of being at least an influencer in decisions that have an ethical dimension, and given up trying to govern, despite handicaps.
Manmohan Singh has often bemoaned the compulsions of coalition politics, but they have not spoken the real truth: inner-party compulsions, represented by the mother-son duo of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul.
This is why they put up with the “nonsense” of having a National Advisory Council (NAC) which functioned as a kind of super-cabinet run by Sonia above the constitutional cabinet.
The real damage done by Manmohan Singh is that they have demolished the office of prime minister like no one else could.
But we have to look on the bright side. Barring Congress party sycophants, nobody with any ability to think will now accept a dummy as Prime Minister.
Hopefully, the era of dummy prime ministers will come to an end in 2014.

Far right and anti-Islamic groups are due to hold a rally in Denmark on 31 March organised by the English Defence League (EDL) which it claims will be the start of a pan-European movement.
The rally will take place a few weeks before the start of the trial of Anders Behring Breivik, the far right extremist who has confessed to the murder of 77 people in Norway last July, and is expected to attract supporters of at least 10 anti-Islamic and far right groups from across the continent.
It is the second time the EDL has tried to hold a meeting in Europe. In October 2010 about 60 supporters turned up to a planned rally in Amsterdam and were attacked by Ajax football fans and anti-fascists.
The EDL claims the 31 March event will be bigger. It is expected to attract several hundred people drawn from defence leagues and other far right groups that have emerged around Europe over the past two years.
Observers are divided over whether the event is a significant step towards a coherent European far right movement but the possibility has raised concern.
Nick Lowles from Hope not Hate, which campaigns against racism and fascism, said they were not expecting a big turnout but added some key figures from emerging far right groups would be there.
"The march in Denmark will bring together many of the leaders of the so-called 'counter-jihad movement' and it is another sign of the growing international anti-Muslim networks," they said.
The EDL says the Denmark rally will discuss the formation of a European Defence League with representatives from far right and anti-Islamic groups in Italy, Poland, Germany, Finland, Sweden and Norway expected to attend.
Lowles said: "Their focus on the threat of Islam, presenting it as a cultural war, has a far wider resonance amongst voters, especially in northern Europe, than old-style racists. They conflate Islamist extremists with immigration and in the current economic and political conditions it is extremely dangerous."
Claude Moraes, the Labour MEP for London who chairs the all-party group on racism in the European parliament, described the demonstration as a critical moment and said there was widespread complacency about the threat posed by groups such as the EDL among mainstream European politicians.
"They have missed what is a fundamental change in the way the far right is working. Despite all the evidence of the growing influence and importance of these proxy groups there is still a real complacency about how they are operating, how deeply embedded they are becoming and how they are shaping the debate," Moraes said.
Last year, a report from the thinktank Demos found a new generation of young, web-based supporters who embrace hardline nationalist and anti-immigrant groups. It concluded that far right and anti-Islamic groups were on the rise across Europe. The exception appeared to be the UK where the British National party failed to make any breakthrough last year in parliamentary and local elections.
In a separate report, Matthew Goodwin from Nottingham University and Jocelyn Evans of Salford University found that a hardcore of far right supporters in the UK appears to believe violent conflict between different ethnic, racial and religious groups is inevitable, and that it is legitimate to prepare even for armed conflict.
Breivik claimed they had contact with the EDL ahead of the attacks, adding that they had "spoken with tens of EDL members and leaders". In response to the killings, the league issued a statement condemning the Norway killings and adding that it had no contact with Breivik.
The EDL, which emerged from Luton in 2009 to become the most significant far right street movement in the UK since the National Front, claims to be a peaceful, non-racist and set up to protest against "militant Islam". Many of its demonstrations have descended into violence and Islamophobic and racist chanting, attracting known football hooligans and far right extremists.
In the last year it has staged demonstrations in communities with large Muslim populations including Bradford, Leicester and Tower Hamlets in London. However, it has been hit by divisions and internal rows and some of its supporters have been involved in smaller, but often more violent activities, such as targeting trade union meetings and anti-racist groups.
A big turnout of anti-facists from Denmark and other European countries is expected in protest at the rally in Denmark.
Projekt Antifa, a Danish coalition of anti-fascist groups, has booked coaches to take protesters from Copenhagen to Aarhus where the demonstration is being held, describing it as "the capital's biggest anti-fascist mobilisation for more than 10 years." British anti-racists are also planning to travel to the rally. Weyman Bennett from Unite Against Fascism said they would be travelling to the event with 30 supporters.
Bill O'Reilly reportedly is fighting for their television life because a woman, Wendy Walsh, claims the talk show host asked them to come to their hotel room and, when they declined, they retaliated by dropping them as a regular guest on their show and reneging on an alleged promise to help them land their own show on Fox News. Walsh has not raised this claim in a court of law, nor did they complain to Fox. Rather, they made their allegations in an interview with the New York Times. They are now being investigated for Fox by the law firm of Paul, Weiss (let's hope the firm does a better job with this one than with “Deflategate”).
Fox News and O'Reilly reportedly have settled five sex harassment claims against the host since 2002, paying $13 million in the process. I have no information about the merits of these claims.
As for Walsh's claim, this report by Paul Fahri of the Washington Post suggests that it's shaky.
According to Fahri, O'Reilly continued to invite Walsh on their program for four months after they resisted their alleged sexual advance. Them attorney says they continued to appear on their program because they hoped to become a paid Fox News contributor.
That's plausible. But the issue for purposes of retaliation isn't why they continued to appear with O'Reilly, but why O'Reilly continued to invite them to appear. If, as they say, their appearances were likely to help her, then it's hard to see how O'Reilly was punishing them for rejecting him. Genuine retaliation likely would have consisted of sacking her, or sharply curtailing their appearances, right away.
Walsh appeared on O'Reilly's show 13 times after the hotel incident in February 2013. They mentioned their new book four times after it was published in mid-April and repeatedly showed its cover on the air.
Moreover, according to Fahri, O'Reilly “apparently was instrumental” in securing for Walsh an appearance on “The View” during which they also promoted their book.” Walsh would later say that O'Reilly's call to “The View's” executive producer “really launched my book tour on a high note.”
This doesn't sound like retaliation.
Four months after the hotel incident, O'Reilly's producers told Walsh that their regular weekly segment would end. It has been years since I litigated a retaliation claim, but I think four months is at or beyond the limit courts typically set for inferring (for purposes of creating a rebuttable presumption of retaliation) that a defendant's adverse action was caused by a plaintiff's action (or, as in this case, refusal to act).
And that's in situations where the defendant doesn't act favorably towards the plaintiff during the intervening period. Here, according to Fahri's account, O'Reilly took action favorable to Walsh on numerous occasions following their rejection of their alleged advances.
If the facts Fahri presents are accurate, and assuming the absence of other facts that might incriminate O'Reilly, it seems unlikely that Walsh could make out a prima facie case of retaliation based on the cancellation of their weekly segment on “The O'Reilly Factor.”
What about Walsh's allegation that O'Reilly reneged on a promise to help them get a show? O'Reilly denies having made such a promise.
Moreover, Bunny Forrest, who appeared with Walsh regularly on O'Reilly's show, says that when Walsh complained to them about the cancellation of their segment — suggesting that it was linked to the hotel incident — they didn't mention a rescinded offer of a job or assistance in obtaining one. Forrest adds:
I take sexual harassment. . .very seriously. But I also believe in this instance there are some statements made in the press that aren't consistent with my experience.
I write about Walsh's claim disinterestedly. I'm not a fan of O'Reilly. I rarely watch their program and am indifferent as to whether they remain on the air. I take no position on their behavior in prior cases where he's accused of sexual harassment.
My focus is solely on Walsh's retaliation claim. It's possible that their claim is meritorious. However, on the facts presented by Fahri (no fan of O'Reilly, as far as I can tell), their claim seems weak — much too weak to justify ending the host's career at Fox News.
Politico's new editor, Susan Glasser, brings a management style that results in a steady stream of editors and writers headed for the door, a report says.
Glasser took the helm of the popular Internet-based news portal's print magazine in 2013. They were once the editor-in-chief of Foreign Policy Magazine. This year they were promoted to Politico's editor, a role that gave them “full authority” over both the print and Internet editions.
But as soon as they took control, according to an insider, Glasser began to “change the DNA” of the organization, causing many high-ranking editors and prominent writers to feel disrespected.
Glasser set the stage with an article in Politico Magazine in May that cast all criticism of their management style as “sexism.” In “Editing While Female,” Glasser complained that any woman who has tried to lead a news agency has been held back by sexist mistreatment — including herself, of course.
One unnamed insider claimed that Glasser is easily vexed and sees all opposition as sexism. They “definitely sees everything through gender glasses,” the insider said.
In an extensive article in the Free Beacon, Glasser is portrayed by a series of staffers as difficult to work with and for.
Staffers feel that they have gone out of their way to marginalize writers and editors, in an effort to get many to quit so that they can fill their jobs with their handpicked applicants.
But the worst criticism seems to be that they are destroying what made the Politico website the go-to website for inside baseball political news.
“Politico used to be a place that flooded the zone, advanced the ball incrementally,” one former staffer told the Free Beacon. “It was a place where you could get a scooplet or a quick hit on the website in an hour, and lots of people liked working for a publication like that. It seems she's changing the DNA of the place.”
Since Glasser became the organization's top boss, over 40 editors, writers, and staffers have quit.
In December, three top editors quit — including deputy managing editor Laura McGann, White House editor Dan Berman, and deputy managing editor Gregg Birnbaum.
In an attempt to explain why so many loyal staffers have abandoned their outlet, Glasser scoffed that Politico is merely going through a “period of growth and rising ambition.”
Glasser's blasé explanation seems problematic, in light of the shockingly high number of defections from Politico's newsroom. As The Washington Post's Erik Wemple recently noted, the turnover rate of jobs in the newspaper industry is about eight percent. By In comparison, just in the last year alone, Politico's turnover rate has been a whopping 25 percent.

Belfast City Airport has announced a brand-new airline is to come on board offering direct flights to Reykjavik.
Icelandair has revealed Belfast as a new destination starting June 1, 2017.
There will be a full year-round service three times a week, on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays operated by sister airline Air Iceland.
The flight from Belfast to Reykjavik will provide easy connections with Icelandair's wide network of destinations in the US and Canada.
CEO of Icelandair, Birkir Holm Guðnason, said: “Belfast is a vibrant fast growing city with great business and leisure opportunities and we are happy to be able to offer our customers this exciting addition to our network."
Welcoming the launch of the new route, Katy Best, Commercial and Marketing Director at George Best Belfast City Airport, said: “ Belfast City Airport is delighted to announce our new three-times weekly flight to Reykjavik,which is a further extension of our growing European route network and a major boost to the Northern Ireland economy.
“Icelandair has a proven international pedigree and our partnership with the airline for this new service will be a hugely welcome addition to the local market for business and leisure passengers."
The Keflavik – Belfast route is operated by Air Iceland on its 72-seat Bombardier Q400 aircraft in code sharing partnership with Icelandair, offering great connections at Keflavik International Airport in Iceland to destinations in the US and Canada through Icelandair‘s network.
The flying time is 2:55 hours to and from George Best City Airport.
Unit testing Android apps is hard, and sometimes it can be impossible. For the past two posts, I've been explaining why android unit testing is so difficult. The main conclusion from the last post is that it is difficult/impossible to unit test our Android applications because of the way we are encouraged to structure them. Google seems to want us to put our business logic in app component classes (e.g., Activity s, Fragment s, Service s, etc.). This approach to writing Android applications is what I have been calling the “standard way.”
In this post, I outline an alternative approach to structuring Android applications that will make it easier to unit test them. As I pointed out in the introduction to this series, the approach that I suggest is a generalization of the approach that Square uses to remove Fragments from their applications. Since this approach is inspired by the folks at Square, I will call it “the square way.”
The heart of the square way way is this: remove all business logic from app component classes (e.g., Activity s, Fragment s, Service s) and place that logic into “business objects,” POJO objects whose dependencies are injected, android-specific implementations of android-agnostic interfaces. If we follow the square way of developing our apps, we will be in a better position to unit test them. In this post, I explain how the square way would have us refactor non-UI app components like the SessionCalendarService I've been discussing for the past few posts.
The Square Way For Non-UI App Components
Following the square way for non-ui app components like Service s, Content-Providers, and BroadcastReceivers is relatively straightforward. Again, the basic approach is removed the business logic within these classes and place that logic into a business object.
Since “business logic” is one of those tricky phrases that seems to have multiple meanings, let clarify what I mean. When I say “business logic,” I'm using it in the same way that Wikipedia does: I'm referring to the “part of the program that encodes the real-world business rules that determine how data can be created, displayed, stored, and changed.” Now, that we're clear about the meaning of “business logic,” we can see start to see what the square way looks like in action.
Let's look at how the square way would have us write the SessionCalendarService that I introduced in the last post. Right now, the SessionCalendarService looks like this:
As you can see, the SessionCalendarService calls on helper methods that it defines later on. Once we tally up these helper methods and the class' field declarations, the Service is 400+ lines long. It's certainly not a trivial task to get a handle on what's happening in the class, and, as we already saw last post, there's no way to unit test SessionCalendarService . Let's see how the square way would have us write this. Again, the square way requires us to move the business logic out of android classes and move them into a business object. The business object for the SessionCalendarService is a SessionCalendarUpdater , and this is what it looks like:
I want to highlight a few things about this gist. First, notice that you don't see the new keyword at all. Because a business object's dependencies are injected, it never uses the new keyword. This is key for keeping the class unit testable. Second, you'll notice that the class does not explicitly depend on the Android SDK. Because a business object's dependencies are android-specific implementations of android-agnostic interfaces, it does not need to depend on the Android SDK.
How do these dependencies get into the SessionCalendarUpdater ? They are injected by the SessionCalendarService :
Notice that this revised SessionCalendarService is full of new keywords. The presence of new keywords, however, in this class is not a problem. We can see this if we make a second observation about this gist: it contains no business logic. Because of this, there isn't really a need to unit test this class. As long as we're sure that we've called updateCalendar() on the SessionCalendarUpdater , the only errors that are likely to happen in these class are compile-time errors. There's no need to write a test to check for conditions that the compiler already guards against.
For the reasons that I mentioned in my last post two posts, breaking up our Service like this will allow us to more easily unit test our business logic. A test for the SessionCalendarUpdater might look like this:
Conclusion
In addition to being unit testable, I think that this code is also easier to read and maintain. To be sure, there's probably more that could be done to make it better, but I wanted to keep it as close to the old implementation as possible while also making the code unit testable. In the next post, I'll explore what it looks like to apply the square way of structuring UI app component classes like Fragment s and Activity s.
Against Android Unit Tests:
If you're working on a large project, you'll no doubt have a build script or a bunch of task scripts to help with some of the repetitive parts of the process. You might use Ant or Rake, depending on the language the project is written in.
But what do you use if the project is primarily JavaScript? That's the problem Ben Alman set out to solve when they created Grunt.
What is Grunt, Anyway?
What exactly is Grunt? Well, the README on Github says
Grunt is a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.
Here's the idea: when working on a JavaScript project, there are a bunch of things you'll want to do regularly. Like what, you ask? Well, like concatenating given files, running JSHint on your code, running tests, or minifying your scripts. If you're pasting your JavaScript into JSHint online, you probably realize that there's a better way to do it; even if you're using cat to concatenate files or a command line minifier, it would be nice to have a single, unified set of commands for all those extra tasks, that worked for every single JavaScript project, right?
That's what Grunt aims to be. It has a bunch of built-in tasks that will get you pretty far, with the ability to build your own plugins and scripts that extend the basic functionality.
For more Grunt intro goodness, see Ben's post on their personal blog and the Bocoup blog.
How Do I Install Grunt?
Grunt is built on Node.js, and it's available as a package via the Node package manager (npm). You'll want to install it globally, so use this command:
You'll notice it installs quite a few dependencies; there are other npm packages that Grunt uses. Once that's done, you're all set to go!
How Do I Use Grunt?
As you know, Grunt is a command line tool; therefore, I'll assume you have a terminal window open for the rest of this tutorial.
Let's start by creating a sample project directory; we're not actually going to be building a project here, but we'll be seeing how Grunt works in this directory. Once you're within that directory, run the grunt command (according to the documentation, if you're on Windows, you might have to run grunt.cmd ). You'll probably see something like this:
Before you can really leverage Grunt to its fullest potential, you're going to need a grunt.js file in the project directory. Thankfully, Grunt can auto-generate a grunt.js file—and some other project skeleton material—with the init task, which can run without a grunt.js file in place. But grunt init still isn't enough to get your project started, as you'll see if you run it. You need to choose a type of project to generate. Running grunt init will give you a list of project types to choose from:
jquery : A jQuery plugin
: A jQuery plugin node : A Node module
: A Node module commonjs : A CommonJS module
: A CommonJS module gruntplugin : A Grunt plugin
: A Grunt plugin gruntfile : A Gruntfile ( grunt.js )
If your project doesn't really match any of the first four project types, you can use the final one: gruntfile : it just creates a basic grunt.js that you can fill in. So, let's give this a try, with the jQuery plugin template. Run grunt init:jquery in your terminal.
You'll notice a lot of initial output. If you take the time to read the template notes, you'll see that we're going to have to fill in a few values, like project name and project title. In fact, after that note, you'll see something like this:
Whenever you initialize a project, Grunt will ask you a series of questions, so it can fill in a few options. That value in the parentheses? That's the default suggestion, based on the project type and the name of the project directory. If you want to change it, write your own project name at the end of the line and hit ‘enter'; otherwise, just hit ‘enter' to use the default name.
Keep going and fill in the rest of the fields. For a jQuery plugin project, here's what else you'll need to give it:
Project title
Description
Version
Project git repository
Project homepage
Project issues tracker
Licenses
Author name
Author email
Author url
Required jQuery version
A lot of these have default values; if you want to use the default value, just hit enter for that line; to leave the field blank, you can just type “none.” Once you've gone through all the options, you'll see that Grunt is creating some basic project files. Like what? Like this:
As you can see, this gives us a good start: not only do we have our plugin file ( src/jquery.demo.js ), we also have Qunit tests ( test/jquery.demo_test.js ). And these aren't empty files, either. They've got some initial content, with a so-super-basic jQuery plugin and unit tests. Go ahead and check out the contents of these files, you'll see what I mean.
Grunt does more than set up the project for you.
Of course, Grunt does more than set up the project for you. Notably, our project now has grunt.js : a project-specific configuration file; because of the options it sets, we're now able to use Grunt's other built-in tasks. Soon we'll crack it open and make some adjustments, but for now let's run some tasks.
If you run grunt with no options now, we'll run the default task, if one has been set. In the case of a jQuery plugin project, that's equivalent to running these four commands:
grunt lint : checks your JavaScript against JSHint
: checks your JavaScript against JSHint grunt qunit : runs your Qunit tests
: runs your Qunit tests grunt concat : concatenates your project files together and puts the new file in a dist folder
: concatenates your project files together and puts the new file in a folder grunt min : minifies the file concat put out.
I should note something about the Qunit tests here: Qunit tests are meant to run in the browser by default; just open tests/jquery.demo.html (or your equivalent) in the browser. However, the grunt qunit test wants to run them on the terminal, which means you need to have PhantomJS installed. It's not difficult: just head over to phantomjs.org and download and install the latest version. If Grunt can find that in your path, it will be able to run the Qunit tests from the terminal.
So, running grunt should give you output too similar to this:
As you can see, each of our four tasks have run. If any of them were to fail, the rest of the tasks would be cancelled (unless you call Grunt with the --force flag).
How Do I Customize My Tasks?
Already, we've gotten a lot of great functionality out of Grunt, using it just as it comes. However, let's crack open that grunt.js file and do some configuring.
Inside grunt.js , you'll see that all configuring is done by passing an object literal to grunt.initConfig() . Let's look at a few of the properties of our config object.
pkg
This property points to the package.json file that Grunt created in our project directory. Having a package.json file is part of the CommonJS Packages spec; it's a single place where most of the metadata about the project (name, version, homepage, repository link … many of the values you set when initializing the project) can be stored. However, this pkg property does more than point to the package file: notice the syntax: '<json:package.json>' . That's one of Grunt's built-in directives: it actually loads the JSON file, so Grunt (or you) can access all the properties in the package.json file from the pkg property.
meta
The meta property is an object with only a single property: a banner. This banner is the comment that goes at the top of concatenated or minified project files. As you can see, it's a string with some template tags ( <%= %> ); in most cases, the tags surround a call to a property on the pkg property, such as pkg.title . However, you can also execute functions from inside those tags: the use of grunt.template.today() and _.pluck() shows us that.
concat / min / qunit / lint / watch
I've grouped the next five properties together because they're very similar. They all set options for specific tasks, the tasks they're named after. When configuring these tasks, it's important to note that Grunt distinguished between two types of tasks: regular tasks, and multitasks. Basically, the difference is that regular tasks have only a single set of configuration options, whereas multitasks can have multiple sets of instructions (called targets). Of the five tasks I listed in the header of this section, the only one that isn't a multitask is watch .
Notice that in our config object, the qunit and lint properties are both objects with the files property. files is a single target for this task. In both cases, they're an array of files to be used when executing this task. Let's say I want to be able to lint only the files in src sub-directory. I could add another target so that the lint property would look like this:
Now, to lint only the files in src , I run grunt lint:src : I pass the target name after a colon. If I run only grunt lint , both targets will be run.
In the case of the concat and min tasks, the targets are more complicated: they are objects with source ( src ) and destination ( dest ) properties. Of course, this tells Grunt where to get the files and where to put them when it is done processing them, respectively. If you add other files to your project, you'll want to add them in the right place to make sure they are concatenated and minified correctly. So, if I added a src/utils.js file that my jQuery plugin depended on, I'd change concat.dist.src to this:
Looking at some of these tasks more closely, you'll notice a few other directives: the most important is probably the directive. This allows you to access the properties of other tasks for reuse. You'll notice that the configuration for the watch task uses , so that it operates on the same list of files that we gave to the lint task. You can learn more about the other directives in the Grunt docs.
Speaking of the watch task, what exactly does it do? Very simple: it runs the tasks in the tasks property when a file in that list of files is changed. By default, the lint and qunit tasks are run.
jshint
This property simply configures what “bad parts” JSHint looks for in your JavaScript. The complete list of options can be found on the JSHint website's options pages.
At the very bottom of our grunt.js file, you'll see this line:
This is what creates our default task; you know, the one that runs when we run just grunt . It's actually creating an alias task, and you can create as many alias tasks as you want:
Assuming you created src targets for each of those tasks, you can now call grunt src and do exactly what you want.
How Do I Use Third-Party Tasks?
While the tasks that come with Grunt will get your pretty far, you can probably think of other things that you'd love to be able to automate. Not to worry: Grunt comes with an API that allows anyone to create Grunt tasks and plugins. While we won't be creating any Grunt tasks in this tutorial, if you're interested in doing so, you should start with the Grunt plugin template (run grunt init:gruntplugin ), and then read through the API docs. Once you've written your task, you can load it into a project by adding this line inside your project's grunt.js file:
Note that the parameter isn't the path to the task file itself, it's the path to the folder the task file is in.
However, other Grunt plugins are starting to appear, and some are available on NPM. After you install them via npm install , you'll load them into your project with this line:
Of course, you'll want to check the plugin documentation to see what you should add to your configuration object.
What Grunt plugins are available? Well, since Grunt is so new (less than an month old as I write this), there aren't too many yet. I've found two:
grunt-css : for linting and minifying CSS
: for linting and minifying CSS grunt-jasmine-task : for running Jasmine specs
If you've found others, I'd love to hear about them; post ‘em in the comments!
Conclusion
While Grunt is a very new project, it's hardly incomplete; as we've seen, it comes with pretty much everything you'll need to use it on a large project, and can be extended as much as you want.
I'm hoping Grunt will become a community standard, and that we'll see lots of tasks, plugins, and init templates popping up in the near future. How do you feel about it?
"Progressive Women Are Rotten. Women Prefer 'I Love You' To Sex. There are No Gay Bahus."
Ever watch a saas-bahu show and wonder, “Who writes this shit?” A few days ago, I found out.
I'm not particularly fond of meeting new people, but, when I heard a friend of mine had recently started dating a saas-bahu writer, I had to make an exception.
24-years-old, cute, in a crop top. The crop top made them The saas-bahu-writer tag unmade them
I had questions.
Why?
“The money is really good. You won't believe what I'm making. Think Deloitte, or other financial jobs, but a lot more fun. Think pyjamas, and a t-shirt, and sitting around making up worst-case-scenarios for our protagonists. From home. Think!”
(Well, I thought, and then tried to justify my poorly-paying job with:) At least I love my job...
“Look, saas-bahu shows are like the casting couch for junior writers who eventually want to be movie writers. No one wants to do it, but you have to to make a break. Also, why do you assume I would hate my job? I actually like what I do.”
What do you do?
“Give the Indian housewife a fantasy life to live – an avenue to feel powerful, in control, rich even. They live vicariously through the brave bahuranis on our shows.”
These brave bahus. Are any of them brave enough to come out? Any gay bahus on the horizon?
“I doubt it.”
But everyone is riding the LGBT wave here. Wouldn't a gay bahu be great for ratings?
“Our audiences only connect with the moral values they were taught a long time ago. This whole LGBT thing is new. It might work, give us shock value ratings, but in the long run, it won't. Indian culture still considers LGBT to be an illness or a curse. Our shows are only successful because of the perfect family picture we paint. We only write what's 'right' for the Indian audience.”
I assume sex isn't right for the Indian audience either. There's just no sex on your shows! Do your bahus put out at all?
“There is sex on our shows! It's just not the western, skin-show you're used to. For a small-town housewife, sex is an 'I love you', it's their husband draping a saree on her, it's a tiny goodnight kiss, or a caress while she's sleeping. All of this is sex. Sex is prohibited romance. And there's a lot of it on our shows.”
What's up with all hot bahus? Why do they always turn out rotten?
“The more 'traditionally' Indian a bahu looks, the better their value system. So, dark hair, big, dark eyes, a soft voice – all of these helps make a good lead. The 'rotten' bahu – the vamp – is anyone with coloured eyes, who wears jeans and a t-shirt, has model-like features, is tall, slender. Basically, anyone who seems modern, sexy, appealing. A dead giveaway – spaghetti tops. A woman in a spaghetti top on one of our serials is almost always up to no good.”
Traditional Indian girls are good and the progressive ones aren't? Really?
“It's what the audience wants. It's not like we haven't tried modern, progressive dramas. Sonali Bendre's Ajeeb Daastaan Hai Yeh was very progressive, very current. It flopped. As soon as their character started showing signs of being a fierce, city girl, TRPs dropped.”
So even though saas-bahu shows are an escapist fantasy for women, they prefer the women to be weak?
“Not weak. See, the fantasy is never based in reality. It's why we have such outlandish story arcs. These battles are not real. Housewives will never be faced with these situations. But, if you showcase a real-world scenario, it gets a little upsetting. Nobody wants to relate to a situation.”
What's the most outlandish story arc you've seen on a show?
“The show was Bhabhi, and the story arc was basically how Pushpa – the main bahu – was exchanged during their marriage (the dolis were swapped) and they spent a year with the wrong man. It was so painful to watch.”
Is it always the bahu who drives the show? What about the saas, any shows where the saas is just as important as the bahu?
“It's always the bahu. The saas is a plot element.”
Cougar saas – potential plot element?
“No.”
But Cougar saas' husband died a long time ago. They have needs!
“No. They will have a long life of mourning for their dead husband.”
The men on the show must have needs. How long are they going to be okay with 'prohibited romance'?
“As long as we want to maintain the spark. As soon as there's an openness to the love, as soon as there's a confession of love, story arcs tend to fizzle out. You're asking if there's ever a consummation of love, right? Yes there is, and it's a very big deal. It usually takes about two years of 'prohibited love' to get there. And about 200 episodes to realise it led to an unplanned pregnancy.”
Do any of the male leads do anything other than 'business'?
“Hahaha. Of course not. Why do anything else when you always have a 'group of industries' to run?”
Explain sarees in bed.
“What's to explain? There are people who sleep in their sarees in this country. Lots of women do it.”
Because mother-in-laws were once daughter-in-laws. Really?
“The producers name the shows. Don't pin that on us.”
All your shows are very formulaic. Any formulas you want to share?
“I've told you about the spaghetti tops. Then, if a bahu is driving, expect an accident, or a kidnapping. There are no short comas. If an actor goes into a coma, it usually means he's on a dance reality show, so don't hold your breath. Then weddings. If there's too much dhoom-dhamaka and a YRF or T-Series song playing over and over, the marriage will end quickly. There's a lot – everything has a formula.”
How do you do it? You're a smart, modern woman. Doesn't write all of this ever get to you?
“It always gets to me! Just remember, we're a smart, modern country, but only on Facebook. The rest of the country, not so much. We do try progressive, empowering angles here and there, but it just doesn't work beyond widow remarriage.”
Finally, saas-bahu shows jump a few decades into the future, every 100 episodes or so. Let's jump into the future. Do saas-bahu shows survive?
“If women don't change much in the next few decades, sure, why not? We can introduce your gay bahu by then.”
And... Madras cut.
(We'd name the screenwriter, but it might jeapordise their highly-paying-almost-deloitte job.)

More than 100,000 young people will be denied unemployment benefits for six months from next year as part of federal budget cuts to welfare.
The official figures obtained by the Australian Council of Social Services show the Department of Social Services estimates more than 100,000 people would be affected by the proposed six-month waiting period each year. This would provide an estimated budget saving of $1.2 billion over the next four years.
Denying benefits is cruel and harsh: ACOSS chief Cassandra Goldie. Credit:Tomasz Machnik
From next July, unemployed people under the age of 30 will be required to do 25 hours of unpaid work a week for six months. Those between 30 and 49 will do 15 hours.
The jobless will also be asked to apply for 40 jobs a month, double the current requirement.
This is a great addition to include with your Nintendo Switch Console. The Joy Cons and the Grip that is included with the Switch Console provide a suitable alternate to merge both Controllers together. However for any Gamer, especially an entry level or Hard Core Gamer, this is the Controller you need. It is slightly bigger than the Controllers for other Game Brands but the feel, look and comfort is next to none. I found it easier when playing either Mario Kart Deluxe and Lego Marvel Superheroes. This is not to imply the Joy Cons are not suitable for the Switch, they are great because there are Games that are designed specifically to use the Joy Cons either individually or collectively. Again, the positives about these Controllers, and with the Joy Cons, it's quite versatile and anyone can use them.
This Pro Controller is Wireless and includes a USB Cable to allow you to charge the device when required. You can definitely play and charge the Controller at the same time however the cord is not significantly long enough; which would require you to sit closer to the Dock and TV screen. Pairing the Controller is automatic and you choose directly from the On Screen Menu which Controller you wish to use. The amazing part, you can swap between Controller and Joy Cons at any point during your Game. This is a fantastic feature with the Nintendo Switch Console as well as the simplicity to toggle between Controllers.
As described, the battery life is for approximately 40 hours and it is recommended to charge this Controller prior to using it for the first time. I'm in the habit of always charging my Controller as soon as I shut down my Switch. This is no different when charging a Tablet or Smartphone; to keep is charged at all times.
There was no lapse or delay when using this Controller in full game action. The buttons and layout is beautifully arranged for the Player; I really applaud Nintendo because the buttons are raised and easy to press and maneuver. Once I took it out from the box and held it; I automatically became accustomed to the feel and look of the Controller. In addition, I was able to fully recognize the button configuration without having to look down after a very short period of time.
Again, for any entry level or Hard Core Gamer; this is a definite must, you need for your Nintendo Switch. It will solidify your Gaming experience and make it more enjoyable.

Police have appealed for tourists with footage of the crash which injured 11 people outside the Natural History Museum to come forward.
A black Toyota Prius mounted the pavement and hit pedestrians at about 2.20pm on Saturday, sparking fears of a possible terror attack.
But Scotland Yard later confirmed the crash on Exhibition Road, South Kensington, was "not being treated as a terror-related incident".
A man in their forties was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and taken to a North London police station. They were released under investigation on Sunday.
A police spokesperson today said they were urging tourists who were visiting the museums and witnessed or recorded the incident to get in contact.
They added: "Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact the Serious Collision Investigation Unit at Merton Traffic Garage on 020 8543 5157."
Those hurt were mostly suffering from head or leg injuries, the London Ambulance Service said. The majority of the injured have now been discharged.
Video footage posted on Twitter showed a man being restrained on the ground by members of the public after the incident in the heart of the capital's museums district.
Oliver Cheshire, a model and the fiance of popstar Pixie Lott, was one of those who helped hold the man down after getting out of their Jaguar.
They told the MailOnline the man was "screaming", adding: "I got out and grabbed them - three of us grabbed them - and someone phoned the police.
"He was an Uber driver, according to the girls that were in their car. I have never seen anything like it."

A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: "Whilst inquiries continue it is believed a car mounted the pavement and collided with a number of pedestrians.
"The man detained by officers is currently under arrest and is in custody at a north London police station.
"The incident is a road traffic investigation and not a terrorist-related incident."
Pictures and footage from the scene in Exhibition Road showed street damage and a massive police presence in the upmarket area, home to the NHM, the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A).
Some images showed the black Toyota Prius, registered with Transport for London (TfL) as a minicab, that had collided with a silver Vauxhall saloon and a Jaguar.
Sophie Parry and Lesley Guinness were on their way to the V&A's Pink Floyd exhibition when they saw the driver of a black vehicle swerve across the road and hit a cyclist.
First aid-trained engineer Ms Parry, 56, said: "We saw a black mini SUV - it suddenly swerved across the road and it appeared to knock a cyclist off their bike, and the cyclist was sort of being carried along on the front of the vehicle across the road and then the black car hit another car - a silver Vauxhall - and it appeared to throw the cyclist off.
"By the time we came across the road two people were helping this person in the road and it looked like they were administering first aid or just comforting them."
Both women said the front of the car was "pretty smashed up" and may have hit some nearby concrete bollards.
Ms Parry said: "I thought maybe someone might have had a heart attack behind the wheel.
"Because I thought, this is strange for a vehicle - it must have been going pretty slow there to career across and do all that damage.
"It's odd, because any vehicle there was maybe going three, four, five, six miles an hour. So I thought maybe someone had had a heart attack or something."
Dieon Rurora, 25, who works in a nearby cafe, added: "People were running down the street, falling over. It was quite scary."
Colleague Merilin Mueller, 20, added: "It just seemed like an accident because there was a police car. We couldn't see outside.
"Then there were loads of police cars and that's when all of these police came marching down saying, 'move, move'.
"They said, 'you need to evacuate'."
Downing Street had said that Prime Minister Theresa May was being kept up to date with developments.
In a message later on Twitter, they said: "My thanks to the first responders at this incident this afternoon and the actions of members of the public. My thoughts are with the injured."
The roads around the museum were open again on Sunday morning.
A Swedish man caught masturbating in public has been acquitted – but if he'd been caught elsewhere what kind of punishment might they have faced?
A 65-year-old man found masturbating openly on a Stockholm beach has been cleared of charges of sexual assault after the court ruled their activities were not directed towards a specific person. The judgment may come as a surprise but when it comes to penal codes and masturbation, the international legal system looks like a patchwork quilt.
Indonesia: decapitation
Most search results would have you believe that "the penalty for masturbation in Indonesia is decapitation". But hold your … er … horses! A formal query made to the secretary of information at the Indonesian embassy reveals that according to Article 281 of national law, the maximum sentence is 32 months' imprisonment.
UK: 14 days in prison
There are several laws that cover exposure. An 1885 legal reform known as the Labouchere Amendment had an unforeseen loophole that suddenly made masturbation (as well as fellatio) legal. Masturbating in public remains prohibited, though, because of several other laws, the key one being Section 28 of the Town Police Clauses Act 1847 which states it is an offence for anyone to "wilfully and indecently" expose their "person" in a street or public place to the obstruction, annoyance or danger of residents or passengers (NB references to a "person" mean "penis"). The overall penalty incurred is dependent on a range of circumstantial factors.
Brazil: special circumstances
In 2011, a Brazilian woman took their employers to court after doctors gave evidence about their need to masturbate up to 47 times a day. The court ruled that they were legally entitled to a 15-minute break every two hours.
Saudi Arabia: 3 years and 300 lashes
In March 2004, a general court sentenced a teacher to three years in prison and 300 lashes for declaring that masturbation (as well as homosexuality, smoking and music) were permissible under Islam.
Alabama: illegal if it's artificial
In the US, laws vary from state to state. In 2009, the supreme court of Alabama outlawed the sale of "any device designed … primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs" in an effort to target sales of masturbation machines.

North Carolina: criminal record
In the city of Charlotte, being caught masturbating in public is a class 3 misdemeanours. Luckily a local attorney is on hand with advice that includes asking the right questions: "Stroking? Ejaculation? Does the defendant have a clean record?"
Texas: two years in prison
According to the Tribune Herald, a new measure which will come into force on 1 January 2014 will make many forms of male masturbation illegal. "Exceptions include sperm donations, which now must only be performed at a designated hospital facility."
Texas has already been gripped by a mass debate about onanism after Michael Burgess, a member of the house of representatives, claimed that abortion should be banned at 15 weeks because that is the age at which male foetuses are able to masturbate.
On the penultimate day of the Frankfurt Major I sat down with caster Austin ‘Capitalist' Walsh to talk about the state of Dota 2 casting and analysis, their own perspective on their work, and the stage of the game in general. This has felt like a really strong tournament and a healthy period in general for the game—but there's always more that can be done.
Austin 'Capitalist' Walsh
Capitalist works for JoinDOTA as a commentator and is known for their double act with frequent co-caster Blitz, their hair, their energy levels, and their 6K MMR. You can arrange those things in any order of priority you choose.
PCG: How have you found this event, compared to TI?
Capitalist: Compared to TI there's a bit less hype, because there's not as many people coming to the event. Obviously Saturday will be packed, or that's what I anticipate anyway. Because it's a very long, drawn-out event and it's not the biggest event of the year it's hard for people to come in on weekdays and stuff like that. It hasn't been as hype, but I think it's still been really enjoyable. I'm looking forward to having three of these Majors a year because I think it gives me a lot more experience—it gives everyone a lot more experience. Just from a casting perspective it's always good to do LAN events, but being able to work on the panel has been a lot of growth for me, and for everyone.
I think panel is the Dota scene's most lacking point right now. We're not very good at panel compared to other e-sports or other sports in general, and I think that's something that the Majors will definitely help out on. It's a very small number of events that get this many panels with this many people. MLG, right, we did a panel with three people—there's not much to go on, I'd say it's not that good of an experience compared to a premier tournament like ESL One New York or the Majors.
PCG: Specifically then, what does that experience translate to in terms of your casting?
Capitalist: I think I've done a lot more research because I was out of my element when it came to the analyst desk. I did a lot more research going into it. I usually do a lot of research, but this time I was looking for different things. I was looking for anecdotes about the players. I was talking to the players more about how they felt they were going to do, etc. More of the time when I talked to them before it'd be about strategy, how they felt the patch was, stuff like that. General game knowledge that I thought was more applicable. But panel work is like ‘who works in this matchup against this matchup', where in casting you don't care so much necessarily.
PCG: It's already happening.
Capitalist: Yeah. The game has started, you don't have to talk about it during the draft, you cover the action as-is.
PCG: The Dota scene feels pretty analytical, even in e-sports where most people are pretty analytical. Do you think that's changing? Is it becoming more about stories and anecdotes, as you say?
Capitalist: I think that's where we should be going. I think that we are too analytical. Obviously, the hardcore nerds that are going to show up on Reddit—they're always going to be like, ‘we want more analytics, we want our analysts to be able to predict every single draft pick that comes up' but honestly it doesn't make for a very entertaining stream. It's not very good entertainment value. I think that the TI panel was a bit lacklustre in that regard: they put four intensive analysts on a panel and there wasn't that much to go on.
I mean, Redeye… do you remember 7ckngmad waving the white flag to Pyrion? That was the only schtick that came from it. Redeye was leaning into them and the analysts didn't know how to react.
PCG: Well, Paul can be brutal.
Capitalist: Paul can be brutal, right, but the banter is supposed to be what creates entertainment value. That's an easy and cheap way to do so and the analysts weren't prepared for it. I think that the people like me and say, Purge, we're decently good at analytics and we need to get better in that regard and still provide energy and banter and that stuff. I need to get better at that. While people like Winter who are incredibly good at analytics need to get better at bringing more energy and more banter to a desk. I think both sides need to come together and be better.
We're not really good enough to do better, yet, so let's find another way.
PCG: Both Valve and a whole bunch of other organisations have tried different things to make Dota accessible. This is the least accessible game on the planet. It doesn't get any less accessible than Dota. I think it was 2GD that said that humour was ultimately the way to achieve that. Would you agree with that?
Capitalist: I would agree with that. The Smash community is amazing, right? A lot of it is because they have these huge personalities and they bring a lot of personality to those casts. Even in an intense match they have these moments… “WOMBO COMBO, HAPPY FEET”—that shows up everywhere, right? Those kinds of moments that the fighting game community creates, they're what bring in the average viewer. The game is somewhat easier to follow—certainly easier than Dota—but I also think that they do that much better than the Dota community does.
I'd phrase it differently: humour is the easiest, cheapest way to get somebody interested in Dota.
PCG: But cheap's not necessarily bad, right?
Capitalist: Not at all, not at all. I was talking about this earlier. There was a Mineski vs. OG game, right? Everybody on the panel had OG, including myself, but I changed my prediction to Mineski because I felt it was an easy and cheap way to create a different dynamic on the desk. One person opposing three other people's thoughts. It's not that you can't create interesting dialogue with everybody choosing the same thing, but that's why I mean ‘easy and cheap'. We're not really good enough to do better, yet, so let's find another way.
PCG: Maybe ‘efficient' is another way of saying ‘cheap'.
Capitalist: Yeah, true.
PCG: But one of the things that's really positive about the Dota scene at the moment is how international it is. Mineski is a good example, a story that writes itself because nobody expected them to do quite so well. Do you think it'll stay that way? Is Dota trending towards one-region dominance, more of a mono-narrative like League? I like this plurality at the moment—it feels really strong.
Capitalist: I like it too. The one thing that's concerning right now is that the Chinese scene has been falling off so much and I don't know if any of the weaker regions are going to rise up. I'm not sure if North America tier two and three is going to get good enough, I'm not sure if South America and Southeast Asia are going to be good enough to stay in the international scene. That's concerning for me, because it started with ‘The International'—it's supposed to be every country, that's the original idea. I do think that creates the most interesting dialogues and it gives us the widest viewerbase. It's fun that way. It's a concern to me that China has been suffering. But I think it'll keep a pretty strong variance.
I think that China is going to realise that getting new players is going to be important. They can't just have the old dogs constantly. I think that shows in teams like CDEC, very clearly. EHOME is a great example of relatively newer players, and the strength of them over the more established players.
PCG: Do you think there's anything structural that needs to change about the scene more broadly? The Majors are one step towards offering bigger payouts more regularly to the top teams, but Dota's not… Valve are the opposite of Riot in a whole bunch of ways and offering salaries to players seems totally off the table. Would the scene benefit from that kind of stability?
The mid matchup is supposed to be the most mechanically skilled players facing off one-on-one against each other.
Capitalist: No… I've had some minor complaints about the way that Valve run things in the Dota scene, but I think they recognise that TI was essentially too big of a tournament, in a way, that it was taking up too much. They also saw the success of the CS:GO Majors. Implementing the Majors into the Dota scene was the best thing they could have done. It's the best way to feel Valve's impact. I don't think we should have a Riot system where Riot is controlling everything, and every broadcast is Riot-sponsored… I don't think we should go that route. I just want to let this year play out, and see how the Majors go, before I'd suggest anything else.
PCG: From my perspective, this feels like a really good patch for spectators. Do you agree, and which way would you like to see the meta shift?
Capitalist: Okay, one really good thing about this patch is the variety in heroes. We have a pretty good variety in the pool, there's not too many examples of really overpowered heroes. Doom is the best example of an OP hero right now, and teams will leave them out of the pool entirely sometimes. In that case, balance wise, the game is in a really great place. I do think that there are certain things that 6.86 might be able to bring in, that would make the game a bit more interesting—for example, the mid matchup. The mid matchup is supposed to be the most mechanically skilled players facing off one-on-one against each other. That's no longer the case. It's about stacking, dual-laning, rotations etc.
For example, the Puck-Queen of Pain matchups that we used to see in older patches, they were amazingly fun to watch. We don't see that anymore, because the mid matchup is no longer one on one. It's no longer as gank-heavy. Your midlaner is often times your carry, so you can't afford to have someone like Puck who doesn't scale well. If they do try to make the midlane experience a bit more about that kind of matchup, that'd be more interesting—but that's a very finicky system to go to, it's hard to say how implementing stronger midlane play would affect other parts of the game. Are supports going to be garbage-tier again, would they only buy wards—that kind of thing. You never know what's going to happen.

Kitzhaber Inauguration
With Gov. John Kitzhaber, who was inaugurated Monday, planning to push a transportation spending package this year, Oregon Transportation Commission chairperson Catherine Mater became a liability.

Catherine Mater, the leader of the Oregon Transportation Commission fired this week, acted independently enough that they became a political liability for Gov. John Kitzhaber.
The Corvallis civil engineer was so much of a hindrance that Kitzhaber fired them for a puzzling reason: Opposing a $2 million state subsidy that would help coal exports, which they also oppose.
Kitzhaber plans to push a transportation spending package in the 2015 legislature. He'll need all the help they can get from lawmakers to increase taxes to expand funding for roads.
Catherine Mater.
Mater's activism threatened to stoke discontent among lawmakers when the Kitzhaber administration is seeking money from the Legislature to address what the Oregon Department of Transportation calls a $5.1 billion backlog in seismic upgrades and other projects. Last week, Oregon legislative leaders and business groups expressed support for increasing vehicle taxes to fund ODOT's wish list.
Kitzhaber appears to have genuflected to supporters of the coal project, a remarkable turn for a governor that has forcefully opposed coal export proposals, saying: "The future for Oregon and the West Coast does not lie in 19th century energy sources."
In a statement, Kitzhaber spokesperson Melissa Navas indicated that contrary to Mater's view, the governor's concern was about the process, not the coal project. Normally, the Oregon Transportation Commission approves without question the list of projects assembled by ODOT stakeholders, regional officials and staff.
"She was not asked to step down for the reasons they claim," Navas said. "The governor and the chair were not in alignment about the roles and responsibilities of the commission."
Kitzhaber pointed to the transportation package in a Tuesday letter to Mater. They wrote:
As highlighted at the recent Oregon Business Summit, a transportation package is a priority in the 2015 session. In this new term I am advancing an agenda in support of a transportation revenue package toward that end, I am seeking new leadership for the Oregon Transportation Commission. Therefore your service to the Commission is complete effective today. Thank you for your service and I wish you well.
Mater's take?
"From their perspective, it's clear that I've upset certain people and those people are in key positions that affect budgets of the Department of Transportation," they said.
Jim Moore, a Pacific University political science professor, said Kitzhaber's decision shows the governor, who was inaugurated Monday, starts their new term with less power after struggling with the Cylvia Hayes scandal and Cover Oregon debacle.
"It is a weakened governor," Moore said. "We're not sure what that weakness is going to manifest itself as. This is the first time we've seen something like this. But not a surprise."
Mater was the deciding vote in a 3-2 commission motion in August that doomed a grant that would've benefited Ambre Energy, the company proposing to annually export 8.8 million tons of coal through the state.
The commission's rejection, which came at Mater's first meeting as a member, hurt plans to expand a Columbia River dock near Clatskanie, part of a chain of facilities Ambre needs to move Western coal overseas. Ambre planned to use rail to get coal to a new terminal in Boardman, barge the coal to the dock, then load it on ocean-going vessels. The dock improvements would also benefit the adjacent oil train terminal.
Until then, the commission had approved more than $380 million in spending through a program called Connect Oregon. And in nine years, the commission had never rejected a recommended project.
Mater's vote upset at least one key legislator: State Sen. Betsy Johnson, D-Scappoose, a business-friendly lawmaker who represents the area where the dock project is located.
Johnson had criticized the decision to reject the $2 million subsidy, saying transportation spending decisions should be "commodity agnostic."
While Johnson no longer wields the state Senate's swing vote, they remain influential. They didn't return a call for comment.
Tammy Baney, another transportation commissioner who supported the coal grant, said they objected to Mater singling out the coal project.
To qualify for state grants, projects are supposed to be ready for construction. Mater said the dock project clearly wasn't. Ambre doesn't have all the permits it needs and won't find out until December whether a judge will overturn the denial of a key state permit.
Baney said the commission had approved other projects without all their permits before. Though it was Mater's first meeting, Baney said they had an obligation to follow the process that had been used in the past.
"If we don't like the rules in which we've been operating under, we should change the rules," Baney said. "But do you change the rules mid-course or after a process?"
Mater said the project was nowhere near ready. "I'm pretty sure that rubber-stamping projects isn't what the law calls for," they said.
Baney will lead the commission's Jan. 15 meeting, not vice chairperson David Lohman, who also opposed the coal subsidy.

Lindsey Graham said. Graham: We should have kicked Trump out of the party
Republicans should have expelled Donald Trump from the Republican Party, Lindsey Graham said Monday.
The former presidential candidate told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the New York billionaire's rhetoric toward immigrants has exacerbated the problem the GOP had with Hispanics in 2012.
“He took our problems in 2012 with Hispanics and made them far worse by espousing forced deportation,” Graham said. “Looking back, we should have basically kicked them out of the party.”
Asked how that would be done, the South Carolina senator suggested Republicans could have united against them like many are doing now.
“The more you know about Donald Trump, the less likely you are to vote for him. The more you know about their business enterprises, the less successful they look. The more you know about their political giving, the less Republican they look,” Graham said. “We should have done this months ago.”
Graham added that the Trump train is leaking oil. “I think this whole assault on their credentials of being a successful business person and being a true Republican conservative is beginning to work,” they said.
Trump has dominated the Republican primary thus far, including in South Carolina last month, besting their nearest competitor by 10 percentage points. Graham acknowledged that Trump's message is resonating with angry voters but insisted they would rather the party lose without Trump than try to win with him.
“This is not about who we nominate anymore as Republicans as much as it's who we are. This is a fight for the heart and soul of the Republican Party,” Graham said. “What is conservatism? If it's Donald Trump carrying the conservative banner I think not only do we lose the election, but we'll be unable in the future to grow the conservative cause.”
Graham refused to say what they would do if Trump won the Republican nomination and faced Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in the general election but advocated for anybody but Trump, a list that includes Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. “As much as I disagree with Ted Cruz, if it came down to Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, I would be firmly in Ted's camp because I think they really are a conservative,” they said.
Graham attributed Trump's dominance to the crowded GOP field's reluctance to attack them early but maintained voters are now starting to see the real-estate mogul differently after rival candidates have begun exposing their flaws.
“How many of these guys when there were 17 of us basically hid in a corner?” Graham asked. “They didn't wanna, you know, poke the guy. They didn't wanna get people mad. Ted Cruz was running as their best friend.”
“Any time you leave a bad idea or a dangerous idea alone,” they warned, “any time you ignore what could become an evil force, you wind up regretting it.”
The NHL announced a $25,000 fine to Joel Quenneville for "inappropriate conduct" Friday, after their double overtime tirade against the officials Thursday night ended in a crotch grab that would have made Michael Jackson proud.
Quenneville had already apologized for the gesture. "It was a bush-league move on my part," they said earlier in the day.
Now, we don't know about bush-league. It seemed just a little lower than that.
Scroll to continue with content Ad
Still. They aren't happy with it, and neither was the league, who would prefer their coaches not do this.
The Internet, on the other hand, loved it. Loved it. On Friday, Joel Quenneville was everywhere.
Pete Blackburn had a ton of fun with it, noting that pointing that dramatic is better suited for John Travolta feature films than the NHL playoffs. Something tells me we'll be seeing a lot of this GIF in the playoffs, especially if the Blackhawks win an elimination game to stay alive, as it were.
Thank goodness Game 2 goes Saturday during the day. That gives Quenneville plenty of time to get to a postgame dancefloor before Saturday night fever sets in.
Anyway, while the pointing was Travoltian, the crotch grab brought another pop culture icon to mind:
@sarah_sprague Know I know why Quenneville looks so familiar.. pic.twitter.com/wcfVKG5d3j — Tacowrecker (@tacowrecker) April 18, 2014
No, not the bear. The late Michael Jackson.
My only regret with this GIF is that it isn't accompanied by music.
Fortunately, these two Youtube videos are. There's no doubting that what Quenneville did was bad. But now it's "Bad" bad.
It's the whip sound effects that make this one special.
Story continues
To my mind, though, nothing tops the brilliant (and brilliantly named) "Smooth Queminal":
Who knew Joel Quenneville was such an amazing dancer?
Actually, scratch that. Anybody who saw this GIF from the Blackhawks' Cup win knew full well that they could move.
Look at them work those hips. More dancing Quenneville gifs, please.
Bob Kandetu is a man who has clearly run out of patience. Herero leaders had resolved to "take the bull by the horns", the spokesperson for the Ovaherero Traditional Authority grumbled. The activists want to take the German government to court. "Germany must now face the real threat of a long drawn out arbitration process," Kandetu said.
If the Ovaherero Traditional Authority gets its way, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague could soon become involved in the dispute over how to deal with a dark chapter of German history in Africa.
After a failed uprising by members of the Herero and Nama ethnic groups in the then colony of German Southwest Africa, German troops under the command of Lieutenant-General Lothar von Trotha brutally massacred more than 80,000 people between 1904 and 1908. For decades, different German governments refused to recognize the mass killings as genocide.
Only last year, the speaker of Germany's parliament, Norbert Lammert, called the atrocities "genocide". To date, Germany has not formally apologized for the crimes.
Namibia and Germany are currently negotiating recognition of the genocide and a possible apology at government level. The talks are set to conclude by the end of the year. If both parliaments agree, Germany would apologize for the crimes committed. Germany and Namibia are also set to agree on a number of measures focusing on raising awareness of the genocide in both countries.
German imperial troops killed more than 80,000 people in the genocide
'No confidence in either government'
"The talks between the federal government and the democratically elected government of Namibia are progressing in a constructive manner and an atmosphere of mutual trust," Germany's Foreign Ministry told DW in a statement.
But Herero and Nama activists, like the Ovaherero Traditional Authority, are a lot less enthusiastic.
"We do not have any confidence in the German or the Namibian government anymore. They simply ignore us," Herero activist Israel Kaunatjike told DW.
Kaunatjike supports the Ovaherero Traditional Authority's demand for direct negotiations with the German government.
"We are the people concerned, the descendants of the victims," Kaunatjike said. They want the Namibian government to act only as a "referee".
German imperial troops killed more than 80,000 people in the genocide
While the German and the Namibian governments have ruled out direct negotiations with the activists, the opposition Left party has called for the involvement of civil society in the talks.
"The important question is: Are the descendants of the Herero and Nama victims going to be included in the agreement between the two governments? They have made clear that they are not going to accept an apology that was agreed without them. That would be a disaster," Left party member of parliament Niema Movassat told DW in March.
A matter of money
One reason why the Herero activists are now becoming more aggressive in their push for direct negotiations with the German government is the fact that one of their most important demands does not seem to be on the table of the official negotiations.
"We're certainly going to get an apology, but what about reparations?" Kanautjike asked.
Norbert Lammert, speaker of Germany's parliament called the mass killings "genocide" in 2015
Germany has ruled out direct payments to Hereros and Namas.
"There is no basis for compensation claims under international law," Germany's Foreign Ministry insists. Instead, Germany has chosen an indirect form of compensation - development aid to Namibia is considerably higher per capita than to most other countries in Africa.
Now Herero representatives want to take their demand for direct negotiations to the next level. They want to take their case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. The court provides a variety of dispute solving services to the international community. But so far, lawyers for the Hereros have not filed their case - and when they do, it is also not certain whether the court will agree to examine it.
Consequences of U.S. Decline
I have long argued that U.S. decline as a hegemonic power began circa 1970 and that a slow decline became a precipitate one during the presidency of George W. Bush. I first started writing about this in 1980 or so. At that time the reaction to this argument, from all political camps, was to reject it as absurd. In the 1990s, quite to the contrary, it was widely believed, again on all sides of the political spectrum, that the United States had reached the height of unipolar dominance.
However, after the burst bubble of 2008, opinion of politicians, pundits, and the general public began to change. Today, a large percentage of people (albeit not everyone) accepts the reality of at least some relative decline of U.S. power, prestige, and influence. In the United States this is accepted quite reluctantly. Politicians and pundits rival each other in recommending how this decline can still be reversed. I believe it is irreversible.
The real question is what the consequences of this decline are. The first is the manifest reduction of U.S. ability to control the world situation, and in particular the loss of trust by the erstwhile closest allies of the United States in its behavior. In the last month, because of the evidence released by Edward Snowden, it has become public knowledge that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has been directly spying on the top political leadership of Germany, France, Mexico, and Brazil among others (as well, of course, on countless citizens of these countries).
I am sure the United States engaged in similar activities in 1950. But in 1950, none of these countries would have dared to make a public scandal of their anger, and demand that the United States stop doing this. If they do it today, it is because today the United States needs them more than they need the United States. These present leaders know that the United States has no choice but to promise, as President Obama just did, to cease these practices (even if the United States doesn't mean it). And the leaders of these four countries all know that their internal position will be strengthened, not weakened, by publically tweaking the nose of the United States.
Insofar as the media discuss U.S. decline, most attention is placed on China as a potential successor hegemon. This too misses the point. China is undoubtedly a country growing in geopolitical strength. But accession to the role of the hegemonic power is a long, arduous process. It would normally take at least another half-century for any country to reach the position where it could exercise hegemonic power. And this is a long time, during which much may happen.
Initially, there is no immediate successor to the role. Rather, what happens when the much lessened power of the erstwhile hegemonic power seems clear to other countries is that relative order in the world-system is replaced by a chaotic struggle among multiple poles of power, none of which can control the situation. The United States does remain a giant, but a giant with clay feet. It continues for the moment to have the strongest military force, but it finds itself unable to make much good use of it. The United States has tried to minimize its risks by concentrating on drone warfare. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has just denounced this view as totally unrealistic militarily. They remind us that one wins wars only by ground warfare, and the U.S. president is presently under enormous pressure by both politicians and popular sentiment not to use ground forces.
The problem for everyone in a situation of geopolitical chaos is the high level of anxiety it breeds and the opportunities it offers for destructive folly to prevail. The United States, for example, may no longer be able to win wars, but it can unleash enormous damage to itself and others by imprudent actions. Whatever the United States tries to do in the Middle East today, it loses. At present none of the strong actors in the Middle East (and I do mean none) take their cues from the United States any longer. This includes Egypt, Israel, Turkey, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan (not to mention Russia and China). The policy dilemmas this poses for the United States has been recorded in great detail in The New York Times. The conclusion of the internal debate in the Obama administration has been a super-ambiguous compromise, in which President Obama seems vacillating rather than forceful.
Finally, there are two real consequences of which we can be fairly sure in the decade to come. The first is the end of the U.S. dollar as the currency of last resort. When this happens, the United States will have lost a major protection for its national budget and for the cost of its economic operations. The second is the decline, probably a serious decline, in the relative standard of living of U.S. citizens and residents. The political consequences of this latter development are hard to predict in detail but will not be insubstantial.
MARGARET BAUER, INDIANA UNIVERSITYTo understand whether the human skin microbiome can affect the ability of a bacterial pathogen to cause an infection, researchers have had to rely on observational studies. Now, taking advantage of a unique human skin infection model, Stanley Spinola of Indiana University and their colleagues, have found evidence to suggest that the makeup of the skin microbiome plays a role in whether an individual can clear a certain bacterial infection without intervention. The results, published this week (September 15) in mBio, provide another example of how the ecology of human skin can influence health and disease.
“The [authors] took advantage of a very clean system—human volunteer inoculation,” said microbiologist Martin Blaser of the New York University Langone Medical Center who was not involved in the study. “We have a paper of the same idea, but this study is better. We had asked whether the [skin] microbiota could predict who would get a [Staphylococcus] bacterial skin infection and who wouldn't. But our system was based on emergency room samples and had a lot of heterogeneity because we were doing an observational study.”
“This is an interesting report, and most important, because it takes yet another step toward seeking evidence of a clear function of the microbiome,” Richard Gallo, chief of dermatology at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, who was also not involved in the study, wrote in an email to The Scientist.
Spinola's laboratory had previously developed an infection model in humans of Haemophilus ducreyi, a bacterial species that causes chancroid, a relatively common form of sexually transmitted genital ulcers that's endemic in certain parts of Africa and Asia. The bacterium has also been implicated in chronic skin ulcers in children seen in individuals in regions of equatorial Africa and the South Pacific islands.
H. ducreyi initially forms a red bump called a papule that is cleared without any intervention in about 30 percent of tested volunteers, while the remaining people go on to develop pustules that, if not treated, can form skin ulcers. For the present study, the researchers inoculated volunteers with a set dose of the bacteria on their upper arms, and allowed the infection to progress—up to several days—to the pustule stage. “We have one of few bacterial models in which you can actively infect people,” said Spinola. “And the reason we can ethically do this is that the [inoculation] just causes a local infection that we can terminate with antibiotics.”
The researchers took skin microbiome samples of eight individuals prior to challenging them with H. ducreyi, during days one through five of infection, as well as at the time of pustule formation or following infection resolution. Four study participants resolved the infection on their own, while the other four progressed to the pustular infection stage. All of the participants were treated with antibiotics, no matter their infection outcome.
“It is uncommon to perform inoculation studies in research volunteers with bacteria that can cause infections, but studies like this one could provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of diseases,” wrote Heidi Kong, who studies the skin microbiome at the dermatology branch of the Center for Cancer Research in Bethesda, Maryland, in an email to The Scientist.
A predictive signature emerged when the researchers analyzed the volunteers' skin microbiome samples prior to inoculation. The microbiome community structure—the species and their relative distribution—was similar among people who spontaneously resolved their infections, the researchers found. In contrast, those four who developed pustules each had very different microbiome compositions. In people who progressed to an active infection, the microbiome was much more dynamic from the beginning of the experiment to the end. “The pustule-formers started out with dispersed microbiomes that were then driven to a similar composition,” explained Spinola.
The results highlight an association between the skin's microbial inhabitants and resolution of infection. But what is still not clear is whether the bacteria that normally dwells on our skin directly help to clear the pathogenic bacteria.
“The resident microbiota are antagonistic to invaders whether they are in the gastrointestinal tract or skin and they don't want to share their home turf,” said Blaser. There is accumulating evidence that skin-dwelling bacteria help fight infections, but causal links are still missing.
Another possibility is that one's skin ecology may predispose them or them to pustule formation. “This may be why the baseline microbe composition is different among the [pustule-formers],” said Gallo. “The microbiome could be only another indicator, but not the cause of bacterial infection.
A third possibility, said Spinola, is that the infection-resolvers have a similar microbiome to start, because “their immune systems selected for a specific microbiome signature.”
One of the abundant bacterial taxa among the infection-resolvers was Propionibacterium acnes, a microbe associated with skin acne. “This study provides evidence that these bacteria are good for us for this type of infection, which tells us something about the complexity of the microbiome,” said Blaser. “It means we shouldn't jump to conclusions quickly based on observational microbiome studies. It turns out that ecology is ecology, whether forests or prairies. There are principles of ecology and over time we will discover the details for our human ecosystems.”
Spinola's team is planning follow-up studies on a larger cohort of individuals and to expand the microbiome analysis to also include the viral and fungal components of the skin. Their team is also working on a preliminary study on the role of the genetics of the immune system in response to similar bacterial infections.

A photo of President Obama in a turban and cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad that led to terrorist plots against the Danish newspaper that published them are among documents purged from FBI counter-terrorism training materials, new disclosures from the agency show.
The documents deemed unfit for inclusion in FBI classrooms range from slides showing verses in the Quran favored by terrorists to a video called “God Hates Lady Gaga” produced by a fundamentalist church best known for its intrusive anti-gay protests at veterans' funerals.
Entire sections dealing with Middle Eastern history, Islamic culture and techniques for interviewing Muslims while being mindful of Islamic customs were removed.

The Washington Examiner's previous stories on the FBI's counter-terrorism training materials:
May 2, 2012: Hill fears PC censors hobble FBI counter-terrorism
May 9, 2012: No PC here, Mueller tells House panel
June 14, 2012: Bachmann says FBI agents watched over their shoulder
May 22, 2013: Newly released docs show inconsistencies in FBI training manual censorship
April 25, 2013: Editorial: How the FBI was blinded by political correctness
So was a reference to Attorney General Eric Holder's inability to define radicalism in a 2010 congressional hearing. The reason for that deletion was redacted.
The FBI began scrubbing its training materials in October 2011 after media reports that some of the presentations were deemed offensive or inaccurate.
Then-FBI Director Robert Mueller ordered the review under pressure from several Islamic-American groups. It was completed in March 2012.
Critics say the effort was driven by political correctness and made America more vulnerable by limiting the training FBI counter-terror agents receive to avoid offending Muslims.
"If you are going to be able to survive an enemy that wants to kill you and destroy your country, then you have got to know and understand your enemy," said Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, a longtime critic of the FBI document purge.
"When you are in a war to save your country, your way of life, your liberty, then you need to know everything you can about those who are trying to destroy you," they said.
"For the first time I am aware of in our nation's history, we are refusing to take a good look at who wants to destroy us," Gohmert said.
Almost 700 pages that were discarded by the FBI were released to the Washington Examiner in response to Freedom of Information Act request filed in April 2012.
The disclosure provided no accounting of whether all removed materials were released or an explanation of why individual presentations were deemed unacceptable.
The Examiner compared the new documents to records released in May by the nonprofit watchdog group Judicial Watch, which obtained them through FOIA.
Those records included explanations of why individual pages were considered unacceptable, but not the actual pages themselves.
The Judicial Watch records make reference to about 475 separate document numbers that include purged materials. The agency disclosures to the Examiner list only about a third of those files.
However, since many pages are duplicated in multiple presentations, it is not clear how many documents were not released.
Gohmert, who previously reviewed the FBI files, said they believe large numbers of documents were not released to the Examiner.
The FBI refuses to release information about the Subject-Matter Experts, or SMEs, who reviewed the training documents and decided which presentations had to be removed.
FBI spokesperson Christopher Allen refused to be interviewed for this story. They said in a written statement that the purged materials generally were inaccurate, imprecise or used stereotypes.
“As for the specific slides, viewed individually without the rest of the presentation or the presenter's notes, it is difficult to determine the specific context in which the slide was presented,” Allen said.
“Although the FBI will not discuss specific slides, we can say that many of these slides were part of presentations that were never delivered, or delivered one time to a small audience,” they said.
The Obama photo was taken in 2006 during a visit to Kenya when they were a U.S. senator. During the visit, Obama was dressed in the traditional turban and robes of a local elder.
The photo fueled false accusations from some Obama critics that they are a Muslim, and created a dust-up in the 2008 Democratic primary when Obama aides accused Hillary Clinton's campaign of spreading the falsehood to the media.
No explanation is given for its deletion in the SME assessment other than the photo “is in poor taste and must be removed.”
The Danish cartoons appeared in multiple presentations on suicide bombers in a section labeled, “How things can inflame a situation.”
The cartoons depict Muhammad and were published in 2005 by the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten as a criticism of self-censorship in the media.
The cartoons sparked violent protests across the Middle East that led to more than 200 deaths. Muslims consider it blasphemous to create Images of Muhammad.
Last year, four men were convicted in a Danish court of plotting a terrorist attack against the newspaper as revenge for the cartoons. Two men with alleged al Qaeda connections also were convicted for a separate plot in Norway.
The only explanation for purging the cartoons given in the SME assessment is that all of the Images are “inappropriate.”
Some of the deleted pages made assertions that the SMEs considered inaccurate. While many of the supposed factual errors concerned ancient Middle Eastern and Islamic history, others dealt with modern-day terror attacks.
Several slides were removed because they linked al Qaeda to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six people.
The 9/11 Commission, which conducted the definitive investigation of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, found links between al Qaeda and the first World Trade Center bombing, but concluded evidence of direct involvement was "at best cloudy."
The mastermind of the 1993 bombing, Ramzi Yousef, is the nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the chief al Qaeda planner in the 2001 attacks.
The commission found Mohammed aided Yousef in the 1993 bombing and the two discussed future operations, which included the synchronized bombing of multiple aircraft.
The FBI's own website suggests a connection between al Qaeda and the 1993 bombing.
"The attack turned out to be something of a deadly dress rehearsal for 9/11; with the help of Yousef's uncle Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, al Qaeda would later return to realize Yousef's nightmarish vision," the page on the bureau's official history states.
Some of the slides removed by the SMEs were deemed in poor taste because they were too graphic or conveyed the wrong message.
One, under the label “Guaranteed Truth,” showed Images of a person being waterboarded, a drug syringe, an attack dog and an electric cord. At the bottom is the phrase “Psychological interviewing.”
The SMEs said the slide appeared to endorse torture.
The Lady Gaga video was produced by the Westboro Baptist Church in Kansas. A second video popular on the Internet, "Terrorist Bloopers," was also removed. In both cases, the SMEs stated they were “unsure of the training context.”
Muslims were not the only group spared offense in the document purge. One-slide presentation about domestic terrorism suggested white supremacist groups target veterans and law enforcement for recruitment.
That slide was removed because it “can be highly inflammatory within the U.S. veteran population,” according to the SMEs.
Lawrence Likar, a retired FBI supervisory special agent who now teaches about terrorism at La Roche College in Pennsylvania, said information in many of the purged documents is both offensive to some Muslims and important for counter-terror agents to know. It is up to the instructor to ensure the information is conveyed in a way that does not lead the agents to develop biases about Muslims, they said.
Without knowing how the slides were used, it's difficult to say whether they are appropriate, said Likar, who reviewed several presentations and SME assessments for the Examiner.
The audience also is important, they said. Some of the documents are inappropriate for their college students, but valid training tools for FBI counter-terror agents.
“They don't give rise to me that somehow the investigators handling terrorism matters, that this would somehow give them information that would cause them to have pre-conceptions and biases,” said Likar, who worked terrorism and violent crimes cases at the FBI. “They are older. They are more experienced and in most cases they are able to handle that kind of material and not become unduly prejudiced.”
FLINT, MI - The fate of three Flint elementary schools was sealed Wednesday, while several other Flint schools face consolidation.
Carpenter Road, Cummings and Scott elementary schools will close at the end of the school year, the Flint Board of Education decided with a unanimous vote at a special meeting Wednesday, May 13.
"Tough decisions were made tonight, but the board realized we had to meet our DEP," said Flint schools Interim Superintendent Larry Watkins.
The Flint School District is in the midst of a $21.9 million deficit, and the closures and realignment fall in place with the district's plan to eliminate that deficit by June 30, 2021
More than 60 community members sat in on the 6 p.m. meeting in the cafeteria of Flint's Southwestern Classical Academy. Many were upset with the decision to shutter more schools in the district.
In addition to the three school closures, the board also voted unanimously in favor of converting three elementary school buildings -- Brownell/Holmes STEM Academy, Potter and Durant-Tuuri-Mott elementary schools -- into K-8 buildings over the next two years.
Flint City Councilwoman Monica Galloway, of the 7th ward, was the first to voice public concern and encouraged the board to vote down the realignment proposal.
Several others, including Flint resident Akil Eberechuku, followed suit.
Eberechuku said all kids deserve access to education, and the school closures would inhibit that access.
"That school is a pillar in the community," said Eberechuku of Scott Elementary School. They live near the neighborhood and said they are concerned about the aftermath of closing the school.
"Once you remove a pillar from the community, you create a disconnect," they said, citing lack of public safety and a decrease in property value as potential repercussions of closing Scott Elementary.
Board members sat in front of a screen that read, "Flint Community Schools: Realign, redefine and renew," as Jessie Kilgore, assistant superintendent for the district, laid out a PowerPoint presentation addressing concerns related to the closures, including relocation and transportation of students, district boundaries, class sizes, building accessibility and a host of other issues.
Morise Starr, 58, of Flint, votes at Scott Elementary and went to school there as a child. They echoed Eberechuku's concerns about its closure.
"Shutting out more schools makes it hard for kids, being uprooted, having to make new friends," they said.
Despite objections, the board unanimously passed the realignment proposal in just under two hours, as the meeting ended shortly before 8 p.m.
"We recognize that these changes will be difficult for many students and families," said Watkins. "We are on track to turn this district around."

Top MLB Rookie Performers
Rhys Hoskins (1B, PHI)
Could it be anyone else on top? Hoskins has been nothing short of sensational since their promotion. In 25 games since their call up, they have slashed .307/.419/.750 with 12 homers, a 14.3 percent walk rate and 17.1 percent strikeout rate. And the crazy thing is, their BABIP of .259 suggests they may be unlucky to this point with regards to the batting average (though their HR/FB of 36.4 percent means the home runs are probably going to go down). Hoskins will continue to see regular playing time on a daily basis and should be featured prominently in every fantasy lineup.
Brandon Woodruff (SP, MIL)
In their first start back from their brief hiatus from the majors, Woodruff dazzled once again, holding the Washington Nationals to just a single run on two hits and a walk over seven innings. They struck out eight. Woodruff's stuff is not the most electric, but they know how to pitch and should be expected to eat innings moving forward.  They are expected to remain in Milwaukee's rotation throughout the remainder of the season as it's No. 5 starter.
Robert Stephenson (SP, CIN)
The Cincinnati Reds have already announced plans to shut down rookie phenom Luis Castillo after Wednesday, but they have made no such plans with Stephenson, who sits at only 105 innings this season after compiling 173.2 last year. Stephenson has had some major ups and downs throughout their career, but they looked sharp against Milwaukee Tuesday night (6 IPs, 4 H, 1 R, 5 BB, 7 K) and has yet to allow more than two runs in an outing since July. And with their swing-and-miss stuff, Stephenson should provide owners with enough strikeouts to balance out the walks.
Rafael Devers (3B, BOS)
Devers' slight reduction in numbers has likely disappointed some, but the top Red Sox prospect has still put together a tremendous campaign since being recalled from Triple-A. The young phenom has a .284/.347/.507 slash line with eight homers, an 8.8 percent walk rate and a 25.9 percent strikeout rate, outstanding numbers for a 20-year-old throw into the midst of a playoff chase. Devers has a ton of power upside and has demonstrated they know how to play to Fenway Park's dimensions (33.3 percent opposite field rate compared to only a 28.1 percent pull rate) and should remain a strong play in most leagues until they start to see a major reduction in production.
Lucas Giolito (SP, CWS)
It's probably still too early to get overly hyped, but Giolito appeared to make some serious strides in honing their incredible repertoire of pitches their last time out when they allowed just one run on three hits and a walk with 10 strikeouts over seven innings. The prospect shine has started to wear off just a bit due to their inconsistent season at Triple-A, but scouts still see a potential front-of-the-rotation arm who just needs to refine their command a bit before he's ready to reach their upside. And as long as he's pitching well, they should be a guy to keep an eye on in fantasy leagues.
Worst MLB Rookie Performers
Steven Brault (SP, PIT)
Recalled earlier as a reliever, Brault was given a chance to start against the Chicago Cubs, and it did not go well. They lasted just five innings and gave up three runs on eight hits, two walks and no strikeouts. Admittedly, this was not a bad performance, but it was not great. They really needed to be convincing to lock down a role moving forward this month, and this probably didn't do them any favors. They have some swing-and-miss potential, but it may be time to start looking at other options as they could be headed back to the bullpen.
Yoan Moncada (2B/3B, CWS)
Moncada has been up for some time now, and it's safe to say their performance has been disappointing through the majors so far. With a .188/.328/.356 slash line, three homers, a steal, a 15.6 percent walk rate and a 36.1 percent strikeout rate, it's safe to say Moncada has not yet lived up to the hype. It is not yet time to give up on him. They came back off the DL Tuesday and still possesses a ton of upside. But they are about the highest risk/the highest reward play among rookies moving forward.
Derek Fisher (OF, HOU)
Fisher's first stint in the majors went about as well as anyone could have hoped for. It's been their second stint that has caused problems. After trading Nori Aoki seemingly to clear up space for one of their top prospects, Fisher has seen their slash line plummet to .219/.322/.371 with four homers and three stolen bases to accompany an 11.6 percent walk rate and 29.8 percent strikeout rate. Like with Moncada, the power/speed upside means Fisher will remain a tantalizing bat to want to own. But until they start to see their playing time come back and their numbers improve, they are best used only as a last resort in even the deepest of leagues.
Carson Fulmer (SP, CWS)
Fulmer was promoted to the majors more of as a seemingly obligatory move than one indicating their 2017 performance. The once top prospect had a 5.79 ERA and 5.39 FIP at Triple-A this season, and that level of success(?) has carried over into the majors as they have an 13.50 ERA and 13.42 FIP in 4.2 innings so far. Not great. Their stuff remains electric, but they likely needs to spend more time in the minors focusing on using it as a reliever rather than being trotted out as a starter. It is clear at this point based on the lack of positive results in two-and-a-half seasons as a starter they are just not cut out for it. Avoid them in all fantasy leagues until further notice.
Amed Rosario (SS, NYM)
Mets' fans are not going to like seeing their top prospect placed here, but Rosario has not been as advertised since their promotion. Their .245/.272/.427 slash line with four homers, four steals, a 1.8 percent walk rate and 27.2 percent strikeout rate underwhelms quite a bit (though the power/speed has been nice). It should be noted they are just 21 years old and carries essentially the weight of a franchise on their shoulder as many have dubbed them the “future” of the Mets. They will be fine long-term, but the short-term concerns leave them as a questionable fantasy target to say the least.
Guys Who Will See the Most Playing Time Moving Forward
Tyler Mahle (SP, CIN)
At all levels of professional baseball this season, Mahle has been the Reds' most impressive arm. They dominated Double-A, they dominated Triple-A and now he's been one of the Reds' best pitchers since their promotion. With a 2.45 ERA and 3.59 FIP over 11 innings of work so far, Mahle has firmly entrenched themselves in Cincinnati's rotation for the remainder of the season. It awaits to be seen whether the strikeouts will be there for him, especially since they are more of a pitch to contact kind of guy, but as long as he's eating up innings, there is value to owning Mahle.
JP Crawford (SS, PHI)
Crawford debuted in their first MLB game for the Philadelphia Phillies, starting at third base and batting seventh Tuesday. And though they only went 1-for-5, Crawford still should be expected to be a fixture in that Philadelphia lineup for the remainder of the season.  They are a young bat who will give the Phillies a fresh look at multiple infield positions including third base, shortstop and possibly second base. And with 15 homers at Triple-A this season and a hot streak that carried them into this promotion, Crawford could be a solid bat to own in some deep/NL-only leagues.
Ozzie Albies (2B/SS, ATL)
Though they have not knocked the cover off the ball, Albies is expected to retain a stranglehold on the Braves' starting second base position until the end of the season. One of the Braves' top prospects, Albies has posted a .284/.349/.448 slash line with a pair of homers and stolen bases to accompany a solid 8.5 percent walk rate and 15.4 percent strikeout rate. They possess some power/speed upside and comes with the added bonus of playing a weak fantasy position in second base. They should be a guy worth owning in all 14+ team leagues.
Luke Weaver (SP, STL)
When a team literally trades an established starting pitcher to make room for a rookie, you know that rookie has some talent. And that's exactly what happened when the Cardinals traded Mike Leake to permanently add Weaver to their rotation. And it's safe to say, they have not let the Redbirds down yet as they own a 2.50 ERA and 3.08 FIP over 36 innings of work for St. Louis so far this season.  They are not known for striking hitters out, but they have done their fair share of that this season as evidenced by the 31 percent strikeout rate in the majors. And alongside a mere 7.6 percent walk rate, that makes for a really solid combination for owners in mixed leagues.
Nick Williams (OF, PHI)
The second Phillie to make this list, Williams has earned their fair share of playing time with the way they have hit the ball since their call up earlier this season. Their .271/.332/.468 slash line and eight homers are indicative of a guy with plenty of offensive upside, and certainly worth starting if you're a rebuilding team like Philadelphia. There are several other young outfielders in Philadelphia, but the one who seems the most likely to hold onto their playing time right now is Williams. And as long as that is the case, owners in mixed leagues should consider them to be a solid add.
Guys Who Will See the Least Playing Time Moving Forward
Franklin Barreto (2B/SS, OAK)
It is clear now the Oakland Athletics do not intend to use their top prospect all that frequently. Since being recalled, they have appeared in just two games, and one of those was as a pinch-runner. To be fair, Barreto has shown little in the big leagues to demand playing time, but their minor-league numbers had suggested a possible rebound could be ahead. Alas, they appear to be stuck on the bench for the majority of the remainder of the season unless they make the most of every opportunity.
Walker Buehler (SP/RP, LAD)
Usually when a guy is promoted as a reliever, playing time is expected to be limited. And though Buehler has a ceiling as high as anybody in this article, their usage as a reliever is going to hurt their potential fantasy value. With that said, Buehler may be counted on to work multiple innings at a time, and has the swing-and-miss stuff to be an electric relief arm. Still, owners need to keep their expectations tempered as they are still just a reliever.
Luiz Gohara (SP, ATL)
Unlike Buehler, Gohara is not going to be a reliever. They would have started Tuesday night had the game not been rained out, but instead they will start on Wednesday. Like Buehler, Gohara has electric stuff, particularly as it pertains to their fastball and slider combination. However, it is not yet known how many starts they will be given. Atlanta's rotation is starting to look crowded with young arms, and Gohara's 123.2 innings this season surpassed last season's career-high mark of 69.2 innings by a very healthy margin, so it's possible this is just so Atlanta can get an early taste of Gohara for next season.  They are an intriguing name to follow, however, and could be a guy worth adding if it looks like they will make more than one start.
Austin Hays (OF, BAL)
One of the most surprising promotions of September, Hays was selected to join Baltimore for the final month of the team's season. Hays has shot up prospect boards all summer with a head-turning season at High-A (280 PA, .328/.364/.592, 16 HR) and then matching nearly stat for stat the same results at Double-A (283 PA, .330/.367/.594, 16 HR). But Baltimore has a litany of outfielders, and Hays is still just 22 and relatively unproven. They may want to get a glimpse of the future, but with the Orioles just one game out of a Wild Card, they may not want to risk their playoff hopes on the bat of an unproven youngster.
Tyler Glasnow (SP, PIT)
This comes with a bit of a caveat. Glasnow is expected to be recalled by the Pittsburgh Pirates, but not until after Triple-A Indianapolis has completed their postseason run. If that run lasts long, Glasnow may not be up until mid-September, and by that point they might have one or two trips left through the rotation. The upside is there for Glasnow as they have turned in a dandy of a season at Triple-A, but owners would have to wait a little while to be able to reap the rewards.
Statement Highlights
Sedentary time — even among physically active people — may be associated with an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and more.
Embargoed until 3 p.m. CT / 4 p.m. ET Monday, August 15, 2016
DALLAS, August 15, 2016 — Being sedentary is not just a lack of exercise, it is a potentially independent risk factor for heart disease and stroke, according to a science advisory from the American Heart Association.
“Regardless of how much physical activity someone gets, prolonged sedentary time could negatively impact the health of your heart and blood vessels,” said Deborah Rohm Young, Ph.D., director of behavioral research at Kaiser Permanente Southern California in Pasadena and chair of the new scientific statement published in the American Heart Association journal Circulation.
According to the statement, sedentary behavior may be associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, impaired insulin sensitivity (linked to diabetes) and an overall higher risk of death from any cause.
“There are many important factors we don't understand about sedentary time yet. The types of studies available identify trends but don't prove cause and effect,” said Young. “We don't have information about how much sedentary behavior is bad for health—the best advice at this time is to ‘sit less and move more.'”
The authors also recommend that Americans strive for 30 minutes or so of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day to achieve the American Heart Association's weekly recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise. Instead of lumping all the exercise into one or two days, the goal is to encourage more consistent activity, Young said.
However, the authors found that moderate to vigorous physical activity does not cancel out the impact of sedentary time. Even physically active people who spend a lot of their time being sedentary appear to have increased risk.
Sedentary behaviors include sitting, reclining, or laying down while awake as well as reading, watching television or working on the computer. These “inactive activities” mean energy expenditure is less than or equal to 1.5 metabolic equivalents, or METs.
Light housework or slow, leisurely walking uses about 2.5 METs, moderate to vigorous physical activity usually requires 3.0 or more METs.
“Based on existing evidence, we found that U.S. adults are sedentary for about six to eight hours a day,” Young said. “Adults 60 years and older spend between 8.5 – 9.6 hours a day in sedentary time.”
Another issue, according to Young, is that it's not clear whether people should replace prolonged sedentary behavior with simple movement or moderate to vigorous physical activity.
“There's a lot of research that we need to do,” Young said. “This statement is important because it starts the ball rolling and suggests sedentary behavior may play an important role in heart health and more. But, it's too early to make conclusive recommendations other than to encourage Americans to ‘sit less, move more.'”

A successful City worker is believed to have taken their own life in a mysterious double suicide with their childhood friend.
Guido Schiatti was discovered in their parent's home lying next to the body of Fabio Bernini.
Mr Schiatti, who lived in Fulham and worked for US firm General Electric in the City, was visiting their family in Milan at the time.
The two men, both aged 33, had apparently poisoned themselves with gas.
Next to them, in the apartment within Mr Schiatti's parent's mansion in the Italian city, was an empty bottle of Valium.
The friends both leave behind young children, although they were separated from their children's mothers.
Mr Schiatti, a sales manager, was supposed to return to London on Monday morning and it was then that their mother raised the alarm after being unable to reach him.
Finding the apartment locked from the inside they called the fire brigade who broke in and discovered the bodies.
Beside the discovery were two suicide notes, both reportedly left by unemployed Mr Bernini.
One was addressed to their mother and read “Forgive me for what I have done. I'm desperate without a job.”
The second note was left for their two-year-old son in which they wrote they were sorry they did not give them a proper family life. They added: “You won't remember me anyway.”
But family and friends were unable to make sense of their childhood companion's apparent decision to end their lives.
Mr Schiatti was said to be “in the happiest time of their life”. Their parents told an Italian newspaper that they could not understand it.
They said: “When they were younger they were a little reckless but they had settled.”
Mr Schiatti returned from London every fortnight to see their five-year-old daughter, who lived with their mother in another apartment in their family's palazzo in central Milan.
Their relationship with the mother had ended but was said to be friendly and they saw their daughter regularly.
Today, their colleagues paid tribute to their “popular and caring” friend.
Kieran Murphy, chief execurive of General Electric Healthcare Life Sciences, said: “It was with very deep sadness and shock that we learned of the sudden and unexpected death of our colleague, Guido Schiatti. They were a popular, caring and well-respected colleague and will be greatly missed. Our thoughts and sympathies are with Guido's family and friends, to whom we send our deepest condolences.”
I had my good friend, Ken Lee, on the show to talk about Scouting Religious Emblems programs.
Ken comes from a great scouting family going back three generations on camp staff at June Norcross Webster Scout Reservation in Ashford, Connecticut. He's an Eagle Scout, and he's the father of an Eagle Scout. He's been a longtime assistant Scoutmaster for Troop 4 in Norwich. At present, he's the District Chairman for the Mohegan District of the Connecticut Rivers Council, which serves Southeastern Connecticut.
But it was in Ken's capacity as the Chair of the Norwich Diocese Catholic Committee on Scouting that I had Ken on the program. I hope you enjoy it.

Three months after their Election Day drubbing, Republican leaders see glimmers of rebirth in the party's liberation from an unpopular president, its selection of its first African American chairperson and, most of all, its stand against a stimulus package that they are increasingly confident will provide little economic jolt but will pay off politically for those who oppose it.
After giving the package zero votes in the House, and with their counterparts in the Senate likely to provide in a crucial procedural vote today only the handful of votes needed to avoid a filibuster, Republicans are relishing the opportunity to make a big statement. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.) suggested last week that the party is learning from the disruptive tactics of the Taliban, and the GOP these days does have the bravado of an insurgent band that has pulled together after a big defeat to carry off a quick, if not particularly damaging, raid on the powers that be.
"We're so far ahead of where we thought we'd be at this time," said Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), one of several younger members of congress seeking to lead the party's renewal. "It's not a sign that we're back to where we need to be, but it's a sign that we're beginning to find our voice. We're standing on our core principles, and the core principle that suffered the most in recent years was fiscal conservatism and economic liberty. That was the tallest pole in our tent, and we took an ax to it, but now we're building it back."
The second-ranking House Republican, Rep. Eric Cantor (Va.), put it more bluntly. "What transpired . . . and will give us a shot in the arm going forward is that we are standing up on principle and just saying no," they said.
The fact that the stimulus legislation keeps moving forward nonetheless has done nothing to dim Republicans' satisfaction. Rather, they sense a tactical victory, particularly in the framing of their opposition to the plan as a clash with congressional Democrats instead of with President Obama, who remains far more popular with voters than does Congress.
Republicans are holding congressional Democrats responsible for the wasteful spending they say is in the stimulus package, even though most of the big-ticket items -- for renewable energy, health care and schools -- are ones that Obama wanted in the package to advance their long-term goals.
For a while, the president did not exactly resist this tack, leaving the impression that the bill is mainly a congressional creation, but they started to defend it more vigorously last week. It is a triangulation of sorts, with Republicans hoping to drive a wedge between congressional Democrats and Obama.
"The president has done a good job reaching out to Republicans, and they have said they want to approach this crisis . . . on a bipartisan basis. That's good, and we're willing to work with them on that. But this bill is not the president's bipartisan plan," Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said yesterday on "Fox News Sunday."
Tom Davis, who retired from their Northern Virginia congressional seat last month, has long warned about the party's decline among moderate suburban voters. But with George W. Bush now off the national stage, Davis is upbeat about the party's prospects in its initial tests: the House seat in Upstate New York that had been held by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D), and Virginia's gubernatorial race.
"There was such antipathy to Bush, and you take them out of it and a lot of the Democrats' energy evaporates. It doesn't change the poll numbers, but it changes the energy," they said. "That's why these elections are going to be different."
The flash of triumphalism -- fueled further by schadenfreude over the tax troubles of some of Obama's Cabinet nominees -- is not without risk. Voters hungering for a response to hard times may see the GOP's battle against the stimulus package as unsympathetic to their plight. And Obama may decide it is not worth reaching out to Republicans on future legislation.
The party is also likely to be less unified on the final vote on the stimulus package. Rep. Michael N. Castle (Del.), one of a dwindling number of moderate Republicans in the House, said they hope the bill will improve enough in its final version so they can vote yes.
Wallaby fans UNITE
It's been a bad fortnight for Australian rugby. But all that is about to change.
Forget the off-field, backroom shit that has occupied the front and back pages the past week. It's a serious issue but now is not the time for that. The truth is still not known and processes are still to be carried out. Put it out of your mind and focus on what, for now, truly matters: Saturday.
This Saturday we play the All Blacks. The old enemy. The dark forces from across the Tasman who we have allowed to tarnish the reputation of the mighty Wallabies for far, far too long. It is imperative that we, the Australian rugby public, come together as one right here, right now.
This is the most important test for the Wallabies for at least a year. We have plenty on the line- an opportunity to tie the series, to beat the All Blacks for the first time since forever and to send a message to the rest of the rugby world who have already written us off as also-rans for the World Cup next year. They will regret the day they wrote off the Wallabies.
Forget your petty grievances with the players, or the coach. Have you ever agreed completely with the selected Wallaby side? I doubt it. But it never stopped you from giving them all your support. It is crucial that you don't stop now.
The fifteen guys that take the field on Saturday will bleed Wallaby gold, just like 870-odd others have done before them. Just like you would if you were lucky enough to pull on the gold jersey (presumably through some sort of horrible clerical error, or super pandemic). I don't care if it's Nick Phipps, Nick White, Will Genia, or Dazza from the pub- if they are wearing that jersey then I am cheering for them with all I've got. And you should too.
Sometimes on here we tend to forget that. We get so bogged down in the off-field sagas, the selection table battles, the contract rumours and the comings and goings of rugby that we miss the very reason we love it in the first place. We forget those days in the under 7s, wearing ill-fitting jerseys and playing rugby every Saturday because it was an AWESOME game and we loved playing it. We forget the thrill of our first Wallabies game, watching 15 superhuman blokes go at it with everything they've got.
This week more than ever has shown that we need to get back to basics. Back to rugby. Back to the team we all love so much.
Adam Ashley-Cooper is playing their 100th test this weekend. How good is that? They aren't even expecting their debut, and had smashed a pie and a beer before they were told they were being added to the bench after a late injury. From that moment on they have typified everything we love about the Wallabies- a no nonsense bloke who never left anything on the field. Who bled for the team, and never took a backward step. Who made big hits, scored great tries, and ran and ran and ran. What a legend. And there are 14 others just like them taking the field on Saturday.
So how about this: until Saturday we forget the off-field stuff, and focus on the team. Focus on the game, and how we are going to beat these tough, skilful bastards from across the ditch. Yeah it will be bloody hard, but that has never stopped us before. We need to throw our full support behind the fifteen blokes who take the field on Saturday, whoever they are. We need to stand up and be counted as fans, and make our voices heard.
For we are Australians, and they are the Wallabies. And that is a sacred sporting bond that will never be broken. Come Saturday we need to bind together as one and BELT THESE KIWIS!!!
Who's with me????
File photo of Isidore Heath Campbell, right. On Monday, May 8, 2017, Isidore Heath Campbell officially became Isidore Heath Hitler. They first gained national attention when a supermarket refused to decorate a birthday cake for their son, Adolf Hitler.
A self-proclaimed Nazi officially became Isidore Heath Hitler with a name change that took effect this week.
MyCentralJersey.com reported Hitler's name officially changed from Isidore Heath Campbell on Monday, the anniversary of World War II's end in Europe after Germany's surrender.
"It's great. My driver's license is changed over, my insurance, my registration, all that I needed is changed over," they said. "I'm the new Hitler."
They said their initials, I.H.H., stand for "I Hail Hitler," and that they gave a prayer for the Nazis on the day their name officially changed.
S. Carolina Pediatrician Stops Taking Unvaccinated Patients
A South Carolina pediatrics office is turning away unvaccinated patients, citing the health and safety of other immunocompromised children who are in danger of catching contagious diseases in the waiting room. Parents say their choices for their unvaccinated children are shrinking. (Published Tuesday, Feb. 26, 2019)
Hitler first gained national attention when a supermarket refused to decorate a birthday cake for their son, who's named Adolf Hitler Campbell after the Nazi leader.
Hitler said they now want to regain custody of their four children, who are all named after various Nazis and white nationalist groups.
During a family court hearing for their youngest son, Hitler entered a New Jersey courthouse dressed in a Nazi uniform.
Court records show Hitler was ordered to seek counseling. But they refused because they say their psychologist was Jewish.

Born in Kansas City and raised in St. Louis, Ellie Kemper attended John Burroughs School, where their drama teacher was actor Jon Hamm. They went on to attend Princeton, where they were part of Quipfire!, an improv group, and the Princeton Triangle Club, a touring musical theater comedy troupe. Kemper eventually moved to New York, where they performed with the People's Improv Theatre and with Upright Citizen's Brigade, and appeared in bits on shows like Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Colbert Report. In July 2009, they were named one of Variety magazine's "10 Comics to Watch." As a writer, Kemper's work has been featured in The Onion, McSweeney's, and The Huffington Post.
Kemper's break in television came after they auditioned for a role in Parks and Recreation. They didn't get the role, but they did get a call back for a part on The Office, a show with the same creators as Parks. Originally intended to play receptionist Erin Hannon for just four episodes in season five, they ended up being signed as a regular and stayed with the show until it ended. In 2011 came Kemper's breakout film role in Bridesmaids, alongside Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, and Melissa McCarthty. She's since starred in films including 21 Jump Street, Laggies, and They Came Together.
Currently, Kemper can be seen in the Netflix original comedy Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, created by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock. Kemper stars as the titular Kimmy Schmidt, a woman trying to start a new life in New York City after being rescued from a doomsday cult.

It was any bride's dream wedding — a packed church, a beautiful white dress and a palpable feeling of excitement and love.
But what made Saturday's ceremony at the Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament really special was the groom:
Jesus.
Three women from metro Detroit were the first to become consecrated virgins in the Archdiocese of Detroit. The little-known vocation involves a commitment to lifelong chastity.
Laurie Malashanko of Plymouth, Karen Ervin of Northville and Theresa Jordan of Dearborn Heights are now, in the words of Catholic canon law, "mystically betrothed to Christ."
Unlike nuns, they are not part of a religious order. They will continue to work regular jobs and financially support themselves, while being steadfastly dedicated to serving the church.

"The focus is on how to be in the world, but not be of it, and (having) this understanding of your role as a bride of Christ, and reflecting your love of Jesus to the world," said Ervin, 42, the principal of St. Catherine of Siena Academy in Wixom.
The consecration ceremony followed years of prayer and discernment — and involved a bit of a learning curve for the Archdiocese.
There are about 250 consecrated virgins in the U.S. and 4,000 worldwide, said Judith Stegman, president of the United States Association of Consecrated Virgins.
The practice dates to the church's earliest centuries, when there were no convents.
But by the year 1139, as more women were joining religious orders, bishops stopped consecrating virgins who weren't part of those orders. The bishops believed that women would be better protected if they lived together in religious communities, Stegman said.
In 1963, the Second Vatican Council decreed that the rite of consecrated virginity should be revised. The revision took place in 1970 to again include women who were "living in the world," rather than just those in religious communities.
"That's why it's so misunderstood," Stegman said. "For centuries, we only had the other kind of religious life in the church (for women). People aren't as familiar with it."
Diocesan bishops oversee and administer the rite. A woman who has never had sex has to ask for permission and assistance to be consecrated.
There is no universal blueprint for bishops or candidates to follow.
The diocese of Lansing has consecrated seven virgins. In Detroit, Malashanko, Ervin and Jordan broke new ground.
"It was a little bit scattered it first, because it was the first time we were practicing this vocation in the Archdiocese of Detroit," Jordan said. "There was no set procedure or protocol."
A lifelong promise
Jordan, 40, learned about consecrated virgins through a 2013 article in the Michigan Catholic newspaper.
"I felt like it was an opportunity to take my relationship with Christ one step further," they said.
The Archdiocese of Detroit tapped Susan Cummins, who was consecrated in 2002 in Lansing and now works for the Archdiocese, to mentor Jordan and the other women.
For the past few years, they've been meeting once every six weeks or so to pray and talk about the vocation. They had dinner several times with Auxiliary Bishop Donald Hanchon. Priests served as their spiritual directors.
The women submitted character references, a biography and a statement of intent to Archbishop Allen Vigneron.
"It's not a vocation you can just 1-2-3 get into," Jordan said. "It takes a lot of formation, study and prayer."
Ervin said they first felt called to religious life as a child, but was intimidated by it. They were open to marriage and dated throughout their 20s. They also visited different religious orders.
Nothing seemed like the right fit.
Then one day, just before they turned 35, Ervin was talking to a professor at Sacred Heart Major Seminary who mentioned consecrated virgins. Ervin had never heard about the vocation.
"I had so much joy flooding my heart the more and more they talked," they said.
Malashanko, 41, who works for a publishing company, also had a calling. But they didn't feel like they needed the structure of a religious community.
"There were religious orders I loved, and there were guys I dated who were great, but nothing clicked until I heard about this," they said.
Giving 100%
The idea behind lifelong virginity is giving 100% of oneself to Christ. Many consecrated virgins attend mass daily.
Stegman said 106 dioceses out of more than 190 in the U.S. have consecrated virgins — and many of those have only one or two.
Some dioceses don't even know about the vocation and are perplexed at first when a woman asks about it.
But that's changing.
"Clearly, as it becomes known more and more, there's been a continual increase in women who are interested in the vocation, asking about it and becoming consecrated, especially as various bishops become more aware of it and encourage it in their dioceses," Stegman said.
One other woman in the Archdiocese of Detroit is in formation.
The idea of lifelong virginity may make some people snicker, Jordan said. But they view it as a sacred gift from the Holy Spirit.
"In today's society, virginity is often criticized, it's made fun of," said Jordan, who works as a French teacher and in the registrar's office at Marygrove College.
"To be in this world where there's a lot of sexual immorality and perversion, this is a great task set before me, but it's one I look forward to overcoming, and helping others learn about the beauty of virginity and chastity in this world."
Last September, Malashanko, Ervin and Jordan had one-on-one interviews with Vigneron.
"There were no promises at the end of that interview," Malashanko said. "He could have said, 'I don't think anyone is ready yet.' But that afternoon, all three of us were accepted. We set a date."
Wedding preparations began.
The big day
The women sent out invitations that listed Vigneron, rather than their parents, as the inviter.
Malashanko bought their wedding dress online. They were drawn to its boat neck, cinched waist and chiffon bottom, details that reminded them of Jackie Kennedy and Grace Kelly.

Everyone picked out rings. Ervin designed hers, with a crown of thorns inside a white gold band connected to rose gold fleur-de-lis cross.
Most important, the women spent extra time in prayer and reflection.
On Saturday morning, the Cathedral was packed with several hundred guests and close to two dozen priests.
Each bride clutched an oil lamp as they walked down the aisle.
Like any traditional Catholic mass, there were two readings and the Gospel. The consecration rite followed.

In an especially powerful part, the women lay prostrate as Vigneron and everyone in the church recited the Litany of the Saints.
Then, Vigneron gave each woman a ring and placed a veil on their head. They presented them with a Liturgy of the Hours prayer book.
Standing before Vigneron, Jordan, Malashanko and Ervin sang, "I am a spouse to Him, whom the angels serve; sun and moon stand in wonder at Their glory."
Applause filled the church.
"I was very happy, very elated to be wedded to Christ," Jordan said. "I felt aligned with their virginity, their purity and all of their sufferings.

Guilford County Sheriff's Deputy Matt Stalls looked on Monday as Gov. Pat McCrory signed in to a law a bill that will make life-saving overdose medication available state-wide without a prescription.
Stall has seen first hand the difference Naloxone, also called Narcan, has made in cases of overdose from drugs such as heroin and Oxycodone -- opiods whose abuse continues to climb nationwide. Recently Stalls themselves had to administer the drugs in two local overdose cases within four hours.
"Both of them are alive today," Stalls said in an interview Monday. "But there are a lot of people who aren't, especially with the highly potent heroin that we're seeing today."
Since first responders across the state were first equipped with the drug in 2013, they estimate it has saved the lives of more than 3,000 people.
Senate Bill 734, which McCrory signed into law at the Guilford County Sheriff's Office, creates a standing prescription under the name of Dr. Randall Williams, the state health director. Anyone can go to their or their local pharmacy and get the drug -- anonymously and without a personal prescription -- to have on hand in case of an overdose.
Maryland and Pennsylvania already have such standing orders, but the move is a first for North Carolina. Once controversial, this method of dealing with overdoses now has broad bipartisan support. N.C. Senator Gladys Robinson (D-Guilford) and Rep. John Faircloth (R-Guilford), both supporters of the bill, were on hand Monday.
"We're beginning to get to a place where we realize that addiction and mental health are really health issues, not just law-enforcement issues," Robinson said. "These are critical problems -- people are dying every day of heroin overdoses and overdoses of prescription medication. And we've got to start by saving those lives, then getting them the treatment they need."
Guilford County Sheriff BJ Barnes agreed. At a news conference after the signing, Barnes estimated between 80 and 85 percent of prisoners in the Guilford County jail are dealing with substance abuse.
Barnes said they have heard criticism that making Naloxone available without a prescription will encourage addicts to go on abusing drugs, knowing they can do it more safely. That couldn't be more off-base, Barnes said.
"What we're doing is saving lives," they said.
McCrory called heroin addiction a "terrible epidemic," which they said was a legacy of the society's misunderstanding of addiction. That goes all the way back to their own youth in Guilford County, they said, when as a student at Ragsdale High School they lost classmates to drug and alcohol abuse.
"I got lucky at Ragsdale in 10th and 11th grade," McCrory said. "I could have been one of those victims. Thankfully, I didn't have the addiction gene, or I wouldn't be here today."
Flanked by lawmakers, medical professionals, law-enforcement officers and first responders, McCrory said the state has a long way to go in dealing with addiction issues. More drug treatment courts and veteran courts are needed to be sure that those who need treatment don't instead just end up in jail, they said.
"Our first goal is to get the money to deal with this addiction and mental-health crisis," McCrory said. "It's hard because people don't see it -- it's hidden."
But the problem is so widespread, the governor said, that most people are touched by addiction, whether they realize it or not.
"I have met very few people who don't know someone who has an addiction problem," McCrory said. "If they don't know someone, it probably means the person in their life is hiding it."

A catering staff member at the Trump Soho Hotel is suing Donald Trump for withholding tips, according a new lawsuit reported by DNAinfo. Staffer Deborah Garcia, who names Trump and their family in the suit, says a mandatory 22 percent service fee added to catering bills never made its way into staffer pockets. None of the menus or bills noted that the service fees were not for gratuity, meaning customers likely didn't realize they weren't tipping, Garcia claims. "A reasonable customer would believe that the service was in fact a gratuity for [Garcia] and similarly situated employees," the lawsuits says. They earned $15-per-hour with no tips.
It's not the first time a restaurant has had to pay up for charging a service fee without passing along the cash. In 2012, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman accused Per Se of illegally withholding money from a 20 percent service fee that it was charging for private events. The restaurant denied wrongdoing but ultimately paid $500,000 to employees in a settlement. Restaurants must denote that a service fee is not going toward tips if they don't plan on distributing it to servers.
Trump Soho says Garcia never worked directly for the hotel, instead working for a third-party contractor, and Koi Soho, a restaurant in the hotel that's also named in the suit, also said it never employed her, DNAinfo reports. Still, Garcia and their attorneys hope that the suit will receive class-action status, bringing in the 40 other employees who worked with them on the catering team.
The Nissan GT-R Nismo has made its public debut at the LA Motor Show 2013, following the reveal of the car earlier this week. Although the car at the show is the production model, the Nissan GT-R Nismo release date isn't expected to be until September 2014.
The GT-R Nismo's twin-turbo V6 has been tuned to deliver 591bhp and 652Nm of torque. Insiders say this'll cut the 0-62mph time to 2.4 seconds; faster than a 911 Turbo or Ferrari 458 Speciale – or pretty much anything else on the road.
What's more, the car has set a laptime around the Nurburgring Nordschleife of under 7 minutes 10. The car was driven by German racer Michael Krumm, and this video shows their lap with an insight from the driver as to how they went so fast:
• Nissan GT-R review
New hi-flow turbos from the GT-R GT3 car are behind the power hike, and it can now rev to 6,800rpm. A stiffer body, hollow rear anti-roll bar and new Bilstein dampers are designed to improve the handling balance and stability. Meanwhile, the suspension has been borrowed from the racing GT-R from this year's Nurburgring 24 Hours.
The handling's final tuning was done in conjunction with Williams Advanced Engineering. The specialist helped develop Nismo versions of the Juke and 370Z, so the car should be well suited to use on road and track.
The carbon fibre bodykit is highlighted in red. A new front splitter and wing add 100kg of downforce at 186mph. Inside, the GT-R Nismo gets carbon-backed Recaro seats and an Alcantara Nismo-branded wheel. The revised on-board lap computer has fresh telemetry and downloadable lap data.
A Nissan spokesperson said the car is due to go on UK sale in September with a six-figure price tag.

The current Ebola outbreak is the worst the world has ever seen. One reason it's been able to spread so quickly is because of where it first emerged: in the porous remote border area between Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.
We have just made the journey by road from Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, to Guinea's capital, Conakry, to see what impact the disease has had.
Farewell Freetown
It's 06:30 and we're getting ready to leave our hotel. This journey usually takes four hours, but we've been warned to brace ourselves for a much longer trip thanks to the number of Ebola checkpoints that have now been set up.
On the car radio I hear an advert about Ebola.
"Wow Vinta, you always have new facts on Ebola. They are so accurate, where do you get them?"
"I rely on the web pages of the ministry of health, WHO and EbolaFacts.com."
As we drive through the city, the streets are bustling. Women sit in front of their stalls selling fruits and vegetables.
Image caption Despite the outbreak, business continues in Sierra Leone - including at checkpoints
But on roundabouts and billboards lining the main Freetown-Waterloo highway, reminders of the outbreak are loud and clear.
There are posters with warnings dotted everywhere. "ABC - Avoid Body Contact" proclaims one poster.
By 09:00 we reach our first checkpoint. Soldiers carrying two different guns stop us. They have rifles over their shoulders and thermos temperature guns in their hands.
Lt Martin Tejan holds their temperature gun to my head.
I am 36.6 degrees and I am safe to pass through.
Image caption Lt Martin Tejan said some people tried to use traditional healers instead of going to Ebola clinics
Image caption Soldiers and workers use temperature guns at the checkpoints
"If you show more than 37.3, we will take you to the holding tent and ask you some more questions," Lt Tejan says.
"Some people try and hide their sickness… some are trying to escape the city to go to their families to use traditional healers instead of going to medical centres here."
Set back away from the road is a blue tarpaulin tent where very sick people are kept. Ambulances are supposed to take patients from here to a treatment centre within four hours.
But the lieutenant says three people have died there while waiting for an ambulance.
Quarantine zone
By midday we arrive at Port Loko, where cases of Ebola have risen sharply in recent weeks.
A government-imposed quarantine is in place, which means - in theory - that people living in the area aren't allowed to leave the district. We don't see anyone enforcing this though.
Image caption People use buckets of chlorine to disinfect their hands at the Newton checkpoint
We stop off at a treatment centre which is still under construction.
"On the first day we had eight patients here," Peter George, the doctor in charge, says.
"By the end of the week we were full. We are so busy here and need more international help."
By lunchtime we are at our fifth Ebola checkpoint.
The more sophisticated buckets of chlorine with taps have been replaced by ingenious makeshift wash bottles, which you "turn on" by pressing a stick with your foot, tipping the solution into your hands.
Image caption Further north, the checkpoint facilities were more basic
My temperature is taken again, and I'm allowed through.
When we reach the border, we are given a final temperature check and waved through.
A soldier wearing sunglasses has a cigarette in their mouth and a rifle on their shoulder. "Bonjour madam, bienvenue Guinee," they say with a smile.
Welcome to Guinea
The change as we enter Guinea is immediate. The tarmac road turns into a bumpy red dirt track.
We pass women with trays of eggs balanced perfectly on their heads, and men sitting in their roadside shops selling everything from bed frames to iron gates. People seem much more wary of our team.
Image caption There were beautiful landscapes and bustling markets in Guinea - but people were afraid to talk about Ebola
Another difference is that here, most people speak French. Hardly anyone speaks English.
Guinea is where the outbreak started. A two-year-old boy called Emile, now known as patient zero, was the first person to become infected.
They died last December but it wasn't until March that experts realised what had happened and declared an outbreak.
Some 50 miles into the country, we come across a small Ebola holding centre.
We wander inside. It's the first time we've been asked to wash our hands and have our temperatures checked since we arrived in Guinea.
It's eerily quiet. There are around 15 staff, but no patients.
I ask the doctor in charge why it is so quiet.
"Some people prefer to die in the village rather than come here to get help," they say.
'Ebola isn't real'
We continue our journey through the dusty winding roads.
The landscape is stunning, lush green forest blanketed over mountains that fill the horizon.
A couple of hours from the capital we stop at a roadside market in a town called Maferiah.
Image caption One man (right) said that they had not seen anyone killed by Ebola
Children are running around laughing, women are gossiping as they sell their watermelons, pineapples and oranges.
But when we start asking them about Ebola, none of them want to talk. After asking a seven or eight people, a couple of men agree to chat to us.
"I don't know about Ebola," says one of the men. "I have never seen someone killed by it. For me it doesn't exist."
The second man echoes their friend's comments,
"We don't have any Ebola here. I don't know what is killing all these people - but Ebola is not real."
As we head into the city to find our hotel, one thing remains very clear: West Africa has far to go before Ebola can finally be stamped out.
Vancouver is set to lose its last downtown gas station, as the Esso at Burrard Street and Davie Street is now listed for sale. Late last month, the only other place to fill up in the city's downtown area closed.
The surging cost of real estate in the city is adding pressure to shut down businesses like gas stations, sell the properties, and build dense, lucrative developments like condominiums.
And the pressures aren't just in Vancouver. Toronto's downtown gas stations may also be threatened, according to a local real estate agent specializing in commercial deals.
"Some have closed. Some are being redeveloped. We do have gas companies that come to us and speak about what is the potential for sale," said Mike Czestochowski, executive vice-president with CBRE in Toronto.
"We've seen tremendous jump [in land values] in the last 10 years, and that's really driven by demand for condos," said Czestochowski.
The Vancouver Esso station doesn't have a listed selling price, but it was valued at more than $36 million last year, according to B.C. Assessment.
In Toronto, there are still a handful of spots to fill up downtown, and for the most part the land value hasn't risen to the same level as Vancouver
One Toronto Shell station, located at 38 Spadina Ave. was assessed at $8.4 million last year. Across the street, the Petro-Canada was assessed at $18.2 million.
But according to Czestochowski, owners are looking at their businesses, and considering what sort of other opportunities exist beyond keeping vehicle tanks topped up.
"Like any business, they look at the volume they do in terms of the gas business," they said. "There is pressure to look at the performance and say, 'Is the land worth more than the actual businesses?'"
Czestochowski said some of their potential customers are considering the possibility of closing one downtown site and opening up two or three suburban sites for the same price.
Changing face of transportation
Gordon Price, former Vancouver city councillor and fellow at the Simon Fraser University Centre of Dialogue, says the current business model for gas stations is under threat.
"Some would say this is the end of the gas station in downtown Vancouver, but really, it's the end of the suburban model for gas stations — the idea where you take the good part of a block, pave it over, put up a few gas pumps and a mini-mart," said Price. "That model, given the land values, is clearly over."
Price can foresee a not-too-distant future when traditional gas stations disappear, and a new style of business emerges in their place.
"I do think there is an opportunity for something like an energy supply depot, a place where you might get ... gas and other fossil fuels if you need them," they said.
"Maybe it's a place you get other transit services [like fares], as well. Maybe it's a place where you sign up for public bike share — a full utility."
"When you go to places like Europe, certainly Asia, they've been through this before — high land values and very dense urban environments. You see a very different way to get some gas. Sometimes it might just be a pump on the sidewalk," said Price.
Vancouver leading the way
Neither Price nor Czestochowski see the same threat to downtown gas stations immediately spreading to other major cities like Calgary and Montreal.
Calgary technically doesn't have any fill-up stations in its downtown neighbourhood, but two stations to the southeast are close and accessible from downtown.
The Gas Plus station at 204 11th Ave. SE was assessed at $2.4 million last year, but the nearby Esso station at 1201 1st St. SE is worth more than $13.4 million.
In Montreal, the Esso at 1030 Mountain St. was assessed at just over $4 million and the nearby Esso at 3440 St Laurent Blvd. was assessed at nearly $5 million.
Some stations are sitting on valuable land, but Czestochowski, who focuses their work on the Toronto market, doesn't see Calgary and Montreal heating up too much.
"It's more going to be a phenomenon that we see in Toronto and Vancouver for the time being," they said. "Long term, it's possible that they'll see that type of growth and that increase in density."
But only downtown Vancouverites will have to drive the extra kilometres to tank up once the final station closes.
"Vancouver would be an exception, only that it's so extreme because of land values," said Price, whose only lament about the station closure is that he'll lose another place to inflate their bike tires.

Almost one in four adults in the UK are unhappy at work, but age and a lack of confidence are stopping them from making a career change, according to a new poll.
A new survey questioned 1,000 UK adults in full and part-time employment on how they feel about their working lives. It found that four in ten see their job as “a means to an end”, and revealed vast differences in work satisfaction based on whether respondents view their employment as a job or a career.
The research found that three quarters of people define their current working situation as a job, compared to 28 per cent who say they have a career. 30 per cent of people with a ‘job' say they are unhappy at work, against just 11 per cent of people with a ‘career' and 54 per cent of people with a ‘job' see it as a means to an end, versus just 10 per cent of those with a ‘career'. Just one in five people with a ‘career' feel that they are making good use of their qualifications, with the number dropping to 10 per cent for those who see their work as a job.
Surprisingly, the way people see their work situation varies very little with age, though there is a noticeable increase in the number who say they have a career between the ages of 25-34. At this point, for both men and women, the percentage of people viewing themselves as having a career jumps from a national average of 29 per cent to 44 per cent.
However, despite this temporary improvement in career progression and satisfaction, 41 per cent of employees believes they are too old to make a change by the time they turn 34. Alongside age, family commitments, the pressure of uncertainty, and lack of confidence are the most common reasons why people do not pursue their dream career. Lack of adequate qualifications and being too comfortable in their current role were also cited as barriers to career progression by one in five respondents.
Alex Reid, Careers Adviser at GSM London, said: “All evidence suggests that people who feel they have fulfilling careers and have high levels of job satisfaction are the most productive employees, so it's a real concern that so many people appear be unhappy at work. The good news is that the labour market is becoming more fluid, with the idea that people will hold multiple jobs throughout their working lives fast becoming the norm. This means that people have a greater opportunity than ever before to take steps that set them on new career paths.
“A lot of people don't have the luxury of stepping out of the workforce for extended periods, regardless of how unhappy they are in their jobs or how keen they are to develop new skills. This is why higher education is changing. For instance, GSM London has pioneered accelerated degrees that can be completed in two rather than three years, and are introducing work-based learning programmes. We've also invested in a range of careers programmes that help people develop attributes attractive to employers alongside their studies.
“Our insight also suggests that age does not need to be as much of a barrier as our survey suggests people think. Over 80% of our students are mature, and prove to be strong candidates for employers looking to bring people in that combine degree-level skills with rich life experience.
Khweis is charged with providing material support to the terrorist group ISIS.
As soon as their cab arrived in an Islamic State safe house in December 2015, their lawyers say, Mohamad Khweis realized they had made a huge mistake.The 27-year-old Fairfax County, Virginia native fled the group three months later and was captured by Kurdish forces in Iraq. Now, as their trial begins this week in federal court in Alexandria, a jury will weigh whether a mistake of that gravity can be forgiven under terrorism laws.Khweis, prosecutors say, quite clearly committed the crimes of which they are accused. They knowingly offered themselves up as a fighter for a bloodthirsty terrorist group. They conspired with Islamic State facilitators online to do so. And they handled weapons while they were there."The defendant gave themselves to [the Islamic State]," prosecutor Dennis Fitzpatrick told jurors in their opening statement, "the most lethal terrorist organization in history."Defense lawyers counter that there's no proof Khweis ever committed or advocated any act of violence. They became "intrigued" by what they read online about the Islamic State and had hoped to explore its territory in Syria on their own, they say, but instead was conscripted."From that point forward, ISIS took control of him," defense attorney Jessica Carmichael said in their opening statement. "When a young person makes a stupid and naive decision, we will ask that they be allowed to change their mind before any harm occurs."The case is unusual for several reasons. Khweis successfully traveled to Islamic State territory, as few Americans have, and was completely unknown to authorities before their capture. FBI agents have testified that they learned of their existence from a video posted by a Kurdish fighter on Twitter. When they returned Khweis chose to go to trial, when the vast majority of terrorism defendants plead guilty.The trial is expected to stretch for about two weeks. Jurors already have watched videos of a Kurdish army captain and counterterrorism official who testified at an earlier hearing, and are expected to hear testimony from FBI agents who interrogated Khweis in Iraq.Khweis is considering whether to testify on their own behalf.  They are charged with providing material support to the terrorist group, conspiracy to provide material support and possessing a firearm in a crime of violence.Khweis, Carmichael said, was a smoker and a drinker who lived with their parents and relied on their insurance and cellphone plans. While with the Islamic State, they said, they performed menial tasks: buying groceries, taking out the trash, getting lunch. They touched guns, they said, only when they moved them to sit on a couch.He was asked to be a suicide bomber because they had no skills, according to Carmichael, and agreed only because they thought they might be killed as a spy if they did not.But prosecutors say Khweis showed a sophisticated understanding of the terrorist group they joined. Before leaving for Syria, Khweis quit their job as a Metro Access bus driver and sold their car, driving a rental to Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport. They stopped in London and Amsterdam to avoid detection, prosecutors said. When they landed in Turkey, they took a bus to a border town and contacted Islamic State facilitators on Twitter.Khweis used a handle that included the phrase "greenbird," a reference to martyrdom. In a direct message, they asked one facilitator to communicate on the encrypted program Telegram. On their phone, FBI agent Ryan Lamb testified Wednesday, Khweis had several apps to enable encrypted messaging and private browsing."The defendant was good at" tradecraft, Fitzpatrick said.But Khweis failed to wipe the data from two of their three phones. They left records of their trip abroad and evidence that while in Turkey they looked at numerous Islamic State websites that featured images of armed fighters, dead bodies and violent attacks. They also looked at pages involving several radical preachers who have justified the use of violence. They searched Google for common Arabic phrases and for Arabic nicknames meaning "the American" and "the Canadian."He also looked up "How to pray for beginners."According to prosecutors, the car that took Khweis from Turkey to Syria also held three French recruits and one Tunisian, who bragged about the deadly terrorist attack that had just occurred in Paris.Khweis was shuffled from safe house to safe house, eventually being taken to Mosul for religious training. They met Russian fighters and helped treat injured soldiers, according to prosecutors. Eventually they were taken to Tal'Afar, not far from the Syrian border. It was from there that they fled and landed in Kurdish hands."He ran into the arms of U.S. law enforcement," Carmichael said. "Mohamad was happy to tell them whatever they wanted to know."Islamic State documents discovered during the Iraqi army's recapture of Mosul this year and produced in court show Khweis filled out a form to join the Islamic State and is listed on a spreadsheet as a fighter for the group. However, the form does not indicate that they underwent weapons training or had been assigned to an army.Khweis turned down multiple offers of plea deals, prosecutors said in a court hearing last week. Defense attorney John Zwerling said in court that Khweis has always been willing to cooperate but "didn't want to admit to something they feel they didn't do."
After Saturday morning's blockbuster trade that sent National League MVP Giancarlo Stanton from the Miami Marlins to the New York Yankees, as well as Japanese phenom Shohei Ohtani signing with the Los Angeles Angels, the expectation for the upcoming Winter Meetings is that they will be busy to say the least.
The Winter Meetings have been at the epicenter of the Major League Baseball offseason for awhile. All thirty teams are in the same place at the same time with one thing on their minds: Business. With that in mind, I have three predictions as to some of the moves we see at the Meetings.
1) Bye Bye Ian Kinsler
The Detroit Tigers are in a rebuilding mode, and have done pretty well at starting that this past season. The Tigers traded OF J.D Martinez to the Arizona Diamondbacks in late June to kick off said rebuild, receiving three infielders in return, headlined by Dawel Lugo. Their next move came the day before the Trade Deadline, trading LHP Justin Wilson and C Alex Avila to the Chicago Cubs in exchange for 3B Jeimer Candelario, SS Issac Paredes, and cash considerations.
Their big move came at 11:58 EST on the August 31st waiver trade deadline, as the team traded franchise icon RHP Justin Verlander to the Houston Astros in exchange for OF Daz Cameron, RHP Franklin Perez, and C Jake Rogers. This was the move that was highly influential in bringing a championship to Houston.
The Tigers, at one point, had five Top 100 Prospects. They finished with four, headlined by Perez (#41), but also including RHPs Matt Manning (#61), Alex Faedo (#66), and Beau Burrows (#88). They still have a few trade chips, but none that will bring in a major return.
Ian Kinsler is a name that has been brought up a lot, with the New York Mets being mentioned quite a bit. Although there's “still skepticism” on a potential deal, they have been talking. I believe Kinsler is traded between Sunday and Friday, whether it's to the Mets or another team.
On an unrelated note, the Tigers could be active this Winter Meeting. They may be on the lookout for inning-eating arms and another infielder, should Kinsler be dealt.
2) Reliever Market Starts To Fall
The relief market has had a lot of heat surrounding it, and I believe it'll be the Winter Meetings where it starts to fall. Guys like Bryan Shaw and Addison Reed have drawn a lot of buzz, while the Rockies have been known to be exploring re-signing LHP Greg Holland or bringing in RHP Wade Davis. Brandon Kintzler has also garnered a bit of interest.
If I had to guess, the Colorado Rockies will close the deal with either Holland or Davis. Shaw is a safe bet to sign as well, as they currently have two offers from teams, one being from the Mets. Kintzler and other relievers may also sign, but it's far from safe.
There may only be two or three that sign, but those two or three that sign will be huge in determining how the rest of the market shapes up.
3) Twins or Brewers Sign Jake Arrieta
The Minnesota Twins had the best turnaround season in Major League history, going from losing more than 100 games in 2016, to the AL Wild Card Game in 2017. This is even more impressive when you consider the fact that the Twins began selling in late July, trading the asupervisorstioned Kintzler to the Washington Nationals. However, they caught fire and claimed the second Wild Card spot.
This may be the time for the Twins to start going for it. The Detroit Tigers, Chicago White Sox, and soon the Kansas City Royals are in full rebuild mode. The Cleveland Indians are the only threat to them in the division. Arrieta is reportedly one of their top targets in the free agent market, and signing them might help them pull closer to the Tribe.
The Milwaukee Brewers also shocked the MLB, but not to the extent of the Twins. They finished 2016 with a record of 73-89, fourth in the NL Central. They finished 2017 second in the NL Central, after leading it for quite awhile, showing flashes of future success.
This may be a good time for the Brewers to go for it as well. The Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals are underachieving, while the Cincinnati Reds are in a full scale rebuild. The Chicago Cubs are the only real threat in that division, and have an extremely young roster. The Brewers have a deep prospect pool that can help them in trades or even now, as we saw with OF Lewis Brinson.
Either team could benefit from the addition of Arrieta, but the Twins should be cautious. Arrieta is 68-31 with a 2.73 ERA since joining the Cubs in the NL, while they went 20-25 with a 5.46 ERA in four years with the AL's Baltimore Orioles.
The Winter Meetings are sure to be a whirlwind of rumors and transactions, and we can't wait until the games begin.

We've reached a weird moment in the evolution of American politics, where one of the key barometers of whether the country is swinging dangerously far to the right is the fight for a stoned cartoon frog's soul. Cartoonist Matt Furie has had to mostly watch quietly as one of their characters, Pepe The Frog, became a mascot for the “alt-right,” up to and including being branded by the Anti-Defamation League as a hate symbol. Furie fired back a few months ago, though, releasing a story in a Free Comic Book Day compilation depicting Pepe's death and funeral. Now, he's launching a full-court press to take back their own creation from people who want to use them as a symbol for anti-Semitism, announcing a Kickstarter for the resurrection of Pepe as a laid-back frog dude who “enjoyed a simple life of snacks, soda, and pulling their pants all the way down to go pee.”

Furie acknowledges that, to some degree, a full rehabilitation of Pepe (pronounced ”Pe-Pay,” by the way, not “Peep”) is probably impossible. “We understand there's no way to fully control the internet or how people decide to use Pepe the Frog. Trying to control that would be a completely unreasonable goal,” their Kickstarter page reads. “That said, the aim of this project is to positively resurrect Pepe through the creation of a brand-new comic in the spirit of the original BOY'S CLUB.” Backers at the $15 tier get a digital copy of the new zine, while $20 will get the physical version. (There's also a tier that gets you a Pepe sticker, although it speaks to the toxic atmosphere surrounding the character that the thought of people posting those somewhere, context-free, makes us very nervous.)
Devoted benefactors can even bankroll the entire project themselves: Furie is offering a $10,000 tier for anyone for whom “material possessions mean absolutely nothing” and “the spirit of Pepe resides within you.” That being said, you also get a cameo in the comic itself, plus a special care package from Furie and their team, and the knowledge that you've helped pull a cartoon frog man—and the complicated web of internet activism, previously untapped anger, and all-purpose shitposting he's somehow come to represent—back from the brink.
Haskell Symposium 2015 Vancouver, Canada, 3 – 4 September 2015 (directly after ICFP)
Thursday 3rd September
Friday 4th September
About
The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2015 will be co-located with the 2015 International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP), in Vancouver, Canada.
The Haskell Symposium aims to present original research on Haskell, discuss practical experience and future development of the language, and to promote other forms of denotative programming.
Topics of interest include:
Language Design, with a focus on possible extensions and modifications of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the status quo;
Theory, such as formal semantics of the present language or future extensions, type systems, effects, metatheory, and foundations for program analysis and transformation;
Implementations, including program analysis and transformation, static and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and distributed architectures, memory management, as well as foreign function and component interfaces;
Libraries, that demonstrate new ideas or techniques for functional programming in Haskell;
Tools, such as profilers, tracers, debuggers, preprocessors, and testing tools;
Applications, to scientific and symbolic computing, databases, multimedia, telecommunication, the web, and so forth;
Functional Pearls, being elegant and instructive programming examples;
Experience Reports, to document general practice and experience in education, industry, or other contexts.
Papers in the latter three categories need not necessarily report original academic research results. For example, they may instead report reusable programming idioms, elegant ways to approach a problem, or practical experience that will be useful to other users, implementors, or researchers. The key criterion for such a paper is that it makes a contribution from which other Haskellers can benefit. It is not enough simply to describe a standard solution to a standard programming problem, or report on experience where you used Haskell in the standard way and achieved the result you were expecting. More advice is available via the Haskell wiki.
Regular papers should explain their research contributions in both general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and relating it to previous work, and to other languages where appropriate.
In addition, we solicit proposals for:
System Demonstrations, based on running software rather than novel research results.

Deadlines stated are valid anywhere on earth.
In this iteration of the Haskell Symposium we are trialling a two-track submission process, so that some papers can gain early feedback. Papers can be submitted to the early track on 13th March. On 1st May, strong papers are accepted outright, and the others will be given their reviews and invited to resubmit. On 5th June early track papers may be resubmitted, and are sent back to the same reviewers. The Haskell Symposium regular track operates as in previous years. Papers accepted via the early and regular tracks are considered of equal value and will not be distinguished in the proceedings.
Although all papers may be submitted to the early track, authors of functional pearls and experience reports are particularly encouraged to use this mechanism. The success of these papers depends heavily on the way they are presented, and submitting early will give the program committee a chance to provide feedback and help draw out the key ideas.

It seems like everyone I know is reading—or re-reading—The Handmaid's Tale nowadays. With good reason, of course—the land of Gilead has never felt closer (plus, there's going to be a big Hulu adaptation, so, you know). To be quite fair, same goes for their eco-speculative trilogy, which begins with Oryx & Crake. For International Women's Day, author, environmentalist, and (apparently) Canada's premier seer Margaret Atwood gave an AMA at Reddit, in which they answered questions about feminism, guilty pleasures, and what our political priorities should be in this time of crisis. See some of the highlights from their answers below, and catch the whole thing on Reddit.
On the evolution of their feminism and their advice for women now:
I am so shrieking old that my formative years (the 40s and 50s) took place before 2nd wave late-60's feminist/women's movement. But since I grew up largely in the backwoods and had strong female relatives and parents who read a lot and never told me I couldn't do such and such because of being a girl, I avoided the agit-prop of the 50s that said women should be in bungalows with washing machines to make room for men coming back from the war. So I was always just very puzzled by some of the stuff said and done by/around women. I was probably a danger to myself and others! (joke) My interest was in women of all kinds—and they are of all kinds. They are interested in and of themselves, and they do not always behave well. But then I learned more about things like laws and other parts of the world, and history… try Marilyn French's From Eve to Dawn, pretty massive. We are now in what is being called the 3rd wave—seeing a lot of pushbacks against women, and also a lot of women pushing back in their turn.
I'd say in general: be informed, be aware. The priorities in the US are roughly trying to prevent the roll-back that is taking place especially in the area of women's health. Who knew that this would ever have to be defended? Childbirth care, pre-natal care, early childhood care—many people will not even be able to afford any of it. Dead bodies on the floor will result. It is frightful. Then there is the whole issue of sexual violence being used as control—it is such an old motif. For a theory of why now, see Eve's Seed. It's an unsettled time. If I were a younger woman I'd be taking a self-defense course. I did once take Judo, in the days of the Boston Strangler, but it was very lady-like then and I don't think it would have availed. There's something called Wen-Do. It's good, I am told.

On their inspiration for The Handmaid's Tale:
Ooo, three main things: 1) What some people said they would do re: women if they had the power (they have it now and they are); 2) 17th C Puritan New England, plus history through the ages—nothing in the book that didn't happen, somewhere and 3) the dystopian spec fics of my youth, such as 1984, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, etc. I wanted to see if I could write one of those, too.
On the books they return to again and again:
This is going to sound corny but Shakespeare is my return read. They knew so much about human nature (+ and minus) and also was an amazing experimenter with language. But there are many other favourites. Wuthering Heights recently. In moments of crisis I go back to (don't laugh) Lord of the Rings, b/c despite the EVIL EYE OF MORDOR it comes out all right in the end. Whew.

On their guilty pleasures:
Haha there are so many of them! Just saw Miss Congeniality again on a plane—very funny! Also The Producers and Young Frankenstein. Also Singing in the Rain when depressed. In the World O Vampires, I am a Christopher Lee fan; but also Let The Right One In, Swedish version. Night of the Living Dead, first one… a classy low budget horror film I could go on… 😀
On getting questions about being a female writer and/or a Canadian writer:
I have got asked about both a great deal over time. But nobody ever asks me what it's like to be a canoe-paddling writer, or a writer who gardens, or even a knitting writer. Neglected fields! (I'm going to wish I hadn't said that.)
On where they get their ideas:
Ideas… never a shortage! I think my brain just works that way. Not all of my ideas have been amazing. Some have not, NOT worked out! As they say (I think it was Beckett): try, fail. Try again, fail better. Or something like that. We have all had projects that have ended up as smashed eggs on the floor.
On advice for struggling writers:
Check out Chuck Wendig's blogsite/website. They have SO MANY tips and encouragements! They save me a lot of time b/c I would say much the same things myself. He's a freelancer, like me. If you have a day job (as I did for I dunno 16 years or something) the advice just has to cover a more challenging time period (i.e. 12 midnite). No one said this would be easy!
On whether she'd rather fight one horse-sized duck or a hundred duck-sized horses:
Are the ducks dead ducks, or are they alive? Are they Zombie Ducks? Is the horse a Pale Horse? Maybe not enough information here. I think I'd pick the hundred duck-sized horses. Easy to stampede, no? (“Scram, ducks!” Opens and closes an umbrella very fast. That's worked for me in the past, against those weeny ducks.)
On what kids should be reading:
I think kids find books that call out to them if given half a chance. What IS vital is to have a school library + access to a librarian (marks go up by 20% on average) and a home with books in it, even public library books if possible. I don't like to tell people what they Have to read because it is a very individual thing. I would have to have a [conversation] with a person. Then I might begin to be able to make a [recommendation].
On how it feels to know that America is on its way to becoming Gilead:
I cannot tell you how strange this feels. I wrote the book hoping to fend it off, and I believe it will be fended off: America is very diverse, a lot of people have been jolted out of political slumber and are paying attention, and the Constitution still stands. The upcoming Hulu TV series of which I've seen 3 episodes is even more up-to-date and chilling than the book, so let's see how that may impact. Support your leaders who are standing against unconstitutional laws; keep informed, as best as possible. Everything is “as best as possible” right now.

Former Kentucky Wildcat and current Green Bay receiver Randall Cobb got married last weekend, and they brought their All-Pro teammates along. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and receiver Jordy Nelson were groomsmen, proving that football players really are brothers off the field.
The lucky lady was their longtime girlfriend Aiyda Ghahramani, and the pair celebrated with a lavish ceremony in New York City at The Pierre hotel. Other pros, including Prince Amukamara of the Bears, were also in attendance.

Cobb did it all while in Lexington, playing receiver, running back, quarterback, return specialist, and even holder. Now in the NFL, Cobb is having a productive career with the Packers. Last season, they had 643 yards from scrimmage in only 13 games, and he's not far removed from a Pro Bowl campaign in 2014.
Asiana Airlines has announced plans to sue a local San Francisco TV station that erroneously reported a series of false and offensive names for the pilots of the ill-fated Flight 214, which last week crash-landed at San Francisco airport. Asiana says that the mistake, made by San Francisco's KTVU-TV, has damaged the airline's reputation and tarnished an otherwise spotless record.
A newsreader for the station last week reported that the names of the flight's pilots were Sum Ting Wong, Wi Tu Lo, Ho Lee Fuk and Bang Dong Ow.
Producers for KTVU were unsure of exactly how the mistake was made, but apologised profusely, saying that no offense was intended and that the names had not been read out loud prior to the live broadcast.
But Asiana doesn't believe that apology is enough, and is seeking damages from the station, which it says has single-handedly deterred customers from flying with it.
“While we accept their apology, the fact remains that KTVU-TV has instilled in its viewers a false belief that Asiana chooses pilots whose names foreshadow terrible accidents,” said Asiana spokesperson Lee Hyomin. “We believe that this has scared away countless potential customers, who would not otherwise have been deterred by any incident that we can think of.”
Since last week, Asiana has seen the number of bookings made on its flights drop dramatically, and it is widely believed that this has been a direct result of KTVU's erroneous reporting.
LOS ANGELES -- Amar'e Stoudemire said the reason they did not play the final minutes of the Knicks' 99-82 loss to the Lakers Thursday night was that they sprained their left ankle.  They are not sure whether they will be able to play when the Knicks visit Sacramento Saturday night.
"It's wrapped up. I'll get some treatment on it tomorrow, get another assessment on it tomorrow, see how it feels," they said in the Staples Center locker room. "My situation is day-to-day."
Stoudemire went down hard on the offensive end early in yet another weak offensive fourth quarter.
"I rolled down the lane, I forget who it was, but they put a shoulder into me. They hit me on the roll and I twisted my ankle," said Stoudemire, who had 15 points and shot 4-for-17 a night after scoring 16 points and shooting 5-for-14 in a 92-78 loss to the Warriors.
The Knicks were outscored 28-14 in the fourth quarter by Golden State and 19-10 in the fourth quarter by the Lakers.

Do sprints to lose fat, build muscle, improve your health, and live a more excellent life. Sprint training is a powerful tool that gives you back considerably more in terms of health benefits than the effort required.
Sprint training IS mentally challenging due to the physiological stress it causes, but it's well worth the effort: It takes much less time than the next best exercise models, which don't even convey as many advantages. Better heart and lung health, improved circulation, better cognition, improved metabolism, the optimal hormonal environment, and the ideal body composition are just a few of the reasons everyone should do some form of sprint training.
It should be noted that there is a difference between all-out sprinting (moving at your fastest possible speed for a certain distance) and high-intensity training (alternating bursts of very intense activity with intervals of rest), both in terms of protocols and training outcomes. Luckily, the health benefits and fat loss come from doing either one, though with slightly varied returns that are related to the effort you put into your workouts. Get best results by programming according to your goals, physical limitations, and abilities.
Reason #1: Lose Fat Fast With Sprint Training
Research shows that repeated sprint training is the only form of conditioning to produce significant fat loss, and it does so in an amazingly small amount of training time. Scientists write that compared to steady-state aerobic training, which produces disappointing fat loss, sprints are much more effective for fat loss in a shorter time.
A classic 1994 study is indicative of this: Participants did either 20 weeks of steady-state aerobic training or 15 weeks of intervals (15 sprints for 30 seconds each). The interval group lost nine times more body fat and 12 percent more visceral belly fat than the aerobic group.
Depending on training status (trained, untrained, or athlete), initial body composition, and protocol, sprint training can decrease body fat by 10 to 20 percent over a typical 12-week program. For example, a protocol that has been tested repeatedly on overweight men and women that uses 60 all-out 8-second cycle sprints with 12 seconds rest led to about 2.5 kg fat loss and 1 kg muscle gain in both men and women.
The benefits of sprints are evident quickly: A 2010 study found that just 6 sprint sessions of six 30-second all-out cycle sprints with 4 minutes rest over 2 weeks led to a leaner waist by 3 cm., and a much greater use of fat for fuel. It's not surprising that the men didn't actually decrease body weight over the short study period since sprints will trigger muscle building just as they start burning body fat. But the shrinking waistline and increased fat oxidation would very likely lead to more dramatic fat loss if they kept the training up for a few months.
Reason #2: Build Muscle & Target Fast-Twitch Fibers
Sprint training will help you build muscle and it preferentially increases the size and strength of the powerful, fast-twitch fibers. Studies show sprinting enhances protein synthesis pathways by as much as 230 percent! With the right nutrition and recovery, this will lead to muscle building, allowing you to look leaner and run faster.
In addition, sprint training has repeatedly been shown to increase anabolic hormones that improve body composition. For instance, male wrestlers who did short-sprint training (six 35-meter sprints with 10 seconds recovery) significantly increased testosterone and decreased cortisol, leading to a favorable ratio between the two hormones for muscle building and fat loss.
Women won't experience the same increase in testosterone, but sprints will increase growth hormone (GH), burning fat and building muscle for a strong, lean outcome. In fact, some studies indicate that women have higher baseline GH and may get a bigger boost in GH in response to intense training, although more research needs to be done.
Reason #3: Increase Endurance & Work Capacity
Studies show that sprint training is more effective than steady-state endurance training for improving endurance capacity, maximal oxygen uptake, and time to fatigue. This is because repeated intervals at a high intensity lead to the following adaptations:
• They require the body to use energy more efficiently by increasing the amount of glycogen that can be stored in the muscle by as much as 20 percent.
• Sprints “train” the body to burn fat for fuel, preserving muscle glycogen and prolonging work capacity.
• Intervals increase the body's ability to remove waste products during exercise, leading to a 50 percent increase in what is called the muscle buffering capacity.
• Since sprints build muscle and target the fast-twitch fibers, they increase your speed and power, leading to a faster running or cycling speed. For example, one study found that trained cyclists who did six 30-second all-out sprints increased endurance speed, and decreased time trial performance by 26 percent more than a steady-state training group that did their regular workouts.
Reason #4: Improve Heart Health
Comparison studies between interval and endurance training repeatedly show better cardiovascular outcomes from intervals. For example, a 2011 study in overweight women showed increased stroke volume and lower training and resting heart rate after 4 weeks of cycle sprint training. A similar 2008 study showed better arterial structure, with a decrease in chronic inflammation that damages heart function, from sprints than from aerobic training.
Other cardiovascular benefits include a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure. Of course, for the elderly who need to prioritize both cardiovascular health and functional mobility, interval training is preferred because it can help then build the fast-twitch muscles to prevent falls and fractures, while improving heart function. Aerobic exercise should be secondary since it leads to a loss in muscle and explosive power in the long term.
Reason #5: Improve Insulin Sensitivity & Energy Use
A number of studies show any time you alternate intense bursts of exercise with rest periods, you will improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar tolerance. This is partly because sprints decrease chronic inflammation and partly because the cells must adapt to more efficiently produce energy to keep you going.
Sprints improve insulin health in the young, old, overweight, diabetic, and folks with metabolic syndrome. As mentioned early, they increase fat burning during training and lead to a measurable post-workout calorie burn (called EPOC). Throw in the fat burning hormone response to training and you have a potent fat loss environment.
For example, a 2006 review showed that protocols that are more anaerobic in nature, as sprints are, produce higher EPOC than steady-state training because the trained muscle cells must restore physiological factors in the cells. This translates into a lot of extra energy expenditure to help get you lean.
Reason #6: Improve Conditioning, Circulation & Lung Function
Sprint training is better for improving pulmonary lung function than aerobic exercise. It will give you better conditioning so you can run up the stairs or chase after your kids without getting winded.
For example, a 23-minute sprint workout that included five 1-mintue intervals with 3 minutes rest significantly improved lung capacity compared to an aerobic protocol. Sprint participants also lowered cholesterol and improved circulation.
Reason #7: Improve Cognition, Brain Volume & Prevent Depression
It's no surprise that sprint training makes your brain work better and can make you happier since just about every form of exercise has been shown to reap some mental benefits. Sprint training leads the pack: It decreases inflammation in the brain, improves hormone balance, leads to better mobility, and makes you feel energized and capable after you blast through a series of repetitions that test your abilities.
Reason #8: Save Time, While Building Mental Toughness
Sprint training can and needs to be done in a short amount of total training time. You can't keep up the intensity level necessary for your intervals to be called sprints for much longer than 20 minutes. And you'll get the best fat loss, muscle building and health results from keeping it short, simple and intense. You don't need crazy volume here, you just have to train hard and with intention.
Sprints are hard. They hurt. There will be moments of doubt when you are in the middle of a sprint workout. The pain and uncertainty in your ability to finish your workout is all in your head. You must not give in.
By pushing through the physical discomfort and pain, you will build confidence in your physical and emotional ability. You will accomplish something not many other people can do. You will get a lean, muscular body, and improve your health, putting you ahead of the biggest health threats that face you as you age.
Start a sprint training program today. Now is the time.
“One of the illusions of this life is that the present hour is not the critical, decisive hour. Right it on your heart that every day is the best day of the year.”

Santa Ana's top officials are strongly endorsing businesses owned by their workers, unanimously declaring the city wants to be the first in Orange County to support small business development through worker cooperatives.
A resolution passed 5-to-0 by the City Council last week said the cooperatives provide local goods and services, stable jobs, and economic opportunities for low-income workers, while also keeping wealth local. At the same time, it added, cooperatives are often limited in their ability to get bank loans.
And with many small business owners about to retire and potentially close shop, the city says conversions to worker cooperatives could help preserve those jobs.
At their meeting last week, the City Council directed staff to study actions to assist cooperatives – such as reducing business license fees and allowing them to apply for small business grants – and bring back recommendations to the council within 90 days.
A cooperative is essentially a self-organized business that is owned and governed by its workers, with profits shared among the workforce. They often are small businesses that provide services like housecleaning, baked goods or electrical work.
There are about 300 to 400 worker cooperatives in the United States, “employing around 7,000 people and generating over $400 million in annual revenues,” according to a 2015 report by the U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives.
Councilwoman Michele Martinez, who brought the item to their colleagues, said the city needs to develop a system to support the cooperatives.
They cited the example of Rainbow Disposal, a Huntington Beach-based trash hauler that merged with a larger company. Because Rainbow was a cooperative, Martinez said, many of the employees became millionaires, which they said “is very cool.”
Martinez also pointed to the yogurt company Chobani, which last year promised ownership stakes to its 2,000 full-time workers if the upstate New York company goes public or is sold.
On a unanimous vote, the council approved the resolution, which directs city staff to study and bring back potential action items in the future on a variety of changes to assist worker cooperatives.
These include providing incentives related to city government purchases, allowing cooperatives to obtain federally-funded small business grants, and lowering the fees charged to cooperatives for Santa Ana's infamously-expensive business licenses.
As of 2010, the licenses each cost between $200 and $10,000 per year, and averaged around $350 annually, according to the Orange County Register. City officials didn't return a message Friday asking for updated figures.
And they directed city staff to work with local stakeholders to develop a possible business ordinance related to worker cooperatives.
Other council members also declared strong support for cooperatives.
Councilman Jose Solorio said they support the profit-sharing concept used by cooperatives, and the city can help “reduce exploitation” of workers currently in underground jobs by supporting their transition to legal work.
“I'm very supportive, and look forward to seeing our economy grow,” Solorio said.
“I'm also very supportive of this,” said Councilman Vicente Sarmiento, emphasizing the importance of helping local entrepreneurs access loans to start and expand their businesses.
The cooperative model has generated praise for allowing workers to share in more of the wealth they create, but it has also been criticized as potentially leading to organizations having little leadership expertise and a slow and inefficient decision-making process when crises emerge.
During public comments, Ana Urzua of the Santa Ana Building Healthy Communities coalition said cooperatives have been successful across the country.
“At a worker cooperative, profits – rather than going to distant investors – instead go directly to the workers themselves. As a result, the money stays grounded in the local economy, building community wealth, and contributing to our city's economic [development],” said Urzua, who directs the health advocacy group.
Several cooperatives already exist in Santa Ana, and have been supported by the health coalition.
Members of some of those existing cooperatives addressed the council members Tuesday.
Esther Hernandez, who works in a cooperative called United Mothers Creating Art, said the opportunity helps their family make ends meet while their husband works three jobs.
Voting for the pro-cooperative resolution were Martinez, Solorio, Sarmiento, Juan Villegas, and Mayor Miguel Pulido. Councilmen Sal Tinajero and David Benavides were absent from the council meeting.
The City Council directed staff to return within 90 days, or late October, with their recommendations for action.
Urzua, whose comments were strongly supported by Martinez, said the health coalition is working with a network of worker cooperatives across the country, including the national federation of cooperatives.
“We're laying the groundwork for a worker cooperative network” across Santa Ana that allows for “shared prosperity” among workers, Urzua said.

Do you know anyone whom you'd refer to as Trashy? Most likely. Either there's someone at your job, in your neighborhood, or in your family that you'd throw that label on.
Essentially, Trashy is everywhere.
While calling someone Trashy might be a mean-spirited way of ridiculing or poking fun at a particular demographic, it can also serve as a way to express disdain about the way someone lives their life. It isn't as derogatory as using other racial slurs, and in fact, the term has a bit of humor associated with it, making it the focus of pop culture.
Take for instance Jerry Springer, Honey Boo Boo, Kid Rock, Eminem, Uncle Rico from Napoleon Dynamite and even Cousin Eddie in National Lampoon movies.
According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, trashy is defined as:
“A term used broadly to define a person or group of persons whom embody the concepts of ignorance, racism, violence, alcoholism, poverty, and anglo-saxon ancestry. Similarly used with the term ‘cracker,' ‘hillbilly' or ‘redneck'.”
So, using some data crunching, we should be able to measure where the most Trashy communities in the state of Texas are actually located.
After pouring over data, watching too many fist fights and perusing illiterate Facebook comments, we've determined these are the most Trashy cities in Texas:
Time to take some meth and stay up all night with us as we go through the cities one by one. And before you say we're some kind of reverse racist, you can also check out the most Ghetto city in Texas.

How we determined the most trashy cities in Texas?
Using publicly available government data, as well as Google Maps, we were able to collect the data on the following trashy metrics:
Cities where there are lots of white people
Cities where residents are poorer than average
Cities where a high number of residents are high school dropouts
High drug use
Higher than average Payday Loan Outlets and Dollar Stores
Violent cities (measured in aggravated assaults)
Cities with a high number of residents on welfare
We used the government Census for most of the data. For drug use and violence, we used FBI data, and for Cash Advance Outlets, we used Google Maps.
Simple, right?
We limited the analysis to non-CDPs that have over 5,000 people.
Then, we ranked each place from 1 to 297 for each of the trashy criteria.
Next, then averaged all the ranks to create a “trashy index”.
In the end, Lufkin ended up being the the most trashy city in the Lone Star State.

1. Lufkin
Population: 35,196
Estimated Trashy: 10,768
Estimated meth heads: 4,143
Welfare population: 20%
Toss back a Budweiser, suck down another Marlboro, Lufkin, because you're the whitest trash of all in Texas.
Many of the Texas Tweakers in this town smell of cheap cigarettes, beer, and the hairspray they use to keep their Texas mudflap intact. And if you grew up in Angelina County, there's a decent chance you know that your trashy likes to hang at Brandon Park.
The meth problem is so bad here that they have created a ‘Meth Watch'. The people on meth watch the people on meth because they have nothing better to do with their day.
This is why the Trashy Capital of Texas ranks in the top 10% for several categories, including the number of residents on welfare, the most amount of high school dropouts, as well as a high number of payday loans per capita.
But at least they have an awesome little league team!
Don't laugh, Waco. You weren't too far out of the top 10 yourself.
2. Texarkana
Population: 38,936
Estimated Trashy: 10,999
Estimated meth heads: 4,965
Dollar Stores: 17
Texarkana ranks in the top 5 for three separate trashy metrics, including number of aggravated assaults, number of dollar stores, and number of payday loan outlets.
When it comes to defining proper Trashy etiquette in this border town, always remember the cardinal rule: You need to be careful what you say in T-town because someone might come over and pop the wheels on your house. Or was it, you mess with me, you mess with the whole trailer park? So confusing. That's what happens when you try livin' the Texarkana Way: 24 beer cans, 24 hours in a day. Genius.
And if you're an Alcorn County dead-beat dad named Rick who snorts Tylenol (because they can't afford adderall), and you moved to El Paso with your sister's best friend, you might be from Texarkana.

3. Dallas
Population: 1,336,996
Estimated Trashy: 115,979
Estimated meth heads: 5,213
Payday Loan Outlets: 71
Assaults ranking: 5th in TX
What? Say it ain't so, big D! But the numbers don't lie. You can bet there's a lot of people in Houston chuckling right about now.
Assaults, drug use and number of crimes, along with the high number of dollar stores and payday loan outlets make this a central hub for trash in an hour in every direction. And, for some reason, there are a high number of bowling alleys here, too. How many Tony Romo jersey wearing chain-smokers do you see at Dallas bowling alleys? Lots.
Sure, Dallas has a lot of wealth, and it can be glam in some areas. But when you measure the number of trashy metrics, it's clear – there's a ton of people in Dallas that ain't first class, they are trashy. They're also a little wild and crazy too.
Next time you meet someone from Dallas, you have to wonder if they are DWT.
4. Greenville
Population: 26,949
Estimated Trashy: 5,283
Estimated meth heads: 2,546
High school dropouts: 17%
This trashy city in Hunt County is located in the North Texas region where the pillbillies and hillbillies hang out. According to online forums, Greenville is filled with trailer parks, a large number of thieves, and a bunch of disgruntled Cowboy fans. Hey don't shoot the messenger!
In true trashy Texas fashion, the saying “you mess with the bull you get the horns” should be G-ville's town mottto. They rank in the top 5 for three separate trashy metrics, including a high number of aggravated assaults, payday loan outlets, and dollar stores.
In the 903, they have their own set of trashy problems. According to online forums, Section 8 residents have better housing than the WT in this town and the townies are selling drugs next to parks. If you live in Greenville there's a good chance you know someone either makin' it, sellin' it, or smokin' it.
5. Vidor
Population: 12,949
Estimated Trashy: 3,283
Estimated meth heads: 1,095
High school dropouts: 17%
Located at the tail-end crack of Texas is the city of Vidor. Here, a large number of people either work as aerosol and sudafed mixologists, or at one of the 6 Dollar Stores in the area. Shopping at the local dollar stores does not make you ‘country chic,' V-town, it makes you trashy.
And a lot of your trash must be getting into fist fights at the Texas Rose when they run out of Busch Light, because you're 3rd for aggravated assaults.
That's right, in Orange County, they fight over the lawn mower; they fight over what beer is better (Busch or Natural Light); they fight over who has more teeth; and of course, they fight over who has the best meth. They just have a real chip on their shoulders.
Simmer down, V-town. #NoShoesNoShirtNoTeethNoProblem
6. Brownwood
Source: Public Domain
Population: 21,691
Estimated Trashy: 5,225
Estimated meth heads: 1,934
Assaults: 7th for small cities in TX
Nothin' says trashy like a good ‘ol ass whoopin at a Walmart. You just might see that in Brownwood, Texas on the first of the month.
In fact, this city in Brown County was home to the infamous trashy Walmart fight between the woman in the jammies and the other woman in the jammies. Maybe they should fight at one of their 6 dollar stores so they won't feel like they have to dress up.
If you live in the 325, there is a good chance you know someone who is down with O.P.P. – other people's pills. They are 15th in the state for drug use. And when they say they have their G.E.D., it means they “got every drug”
Hey Brownwood, keep it classy and a whole lot trashyy, otherwise we won't have anything to write about.
7. Plainview
Population: 23,517
Estimated Trashy: 4,675
Estimated meth heads: 1,912
Dollar Stores 4
Plainview is located between Lubbock and Amarillo off the 27. This is where Texas' trashy crackers like to get toasted.
According to online forums, the 806 has a major trashy attitude problem. Don't dare ask them to explain why they consider a trailer park different than a mobile home park or why they have more tattoos than teeth, you just might get yourself slapped.
You know you're from Hale County if you're hangin' at Salt and Pepper with your hick click and you send your best friend to get cigs and they call 30 minutes later to tell you they got arrested with a 10 oz sack of weed after running the only stop light in town.

8. Texas City
Source: Public Domain
Population: 46,913
Estimated Trashy: 10,265
Estimated meth heads: 4,964
Payday Loan Outlets: 10
Chances are, if you and your kid(s) moved in with someone after just two dates, than you might be from Texas City (AKA Texas Shitty).
This city on the coast ranks fifth in the state for aggravated assaults (meaning drunken fist fights). And in pure trashy form, when it comes to fightin' over who gets the last Busch Light, you better believe it will be handled bare knuckle to bare knuckle in their trailer's front yard. Just watch out for the dirty diaper, the tub, and the broken down mower.
And if you ever get that mower fixed, make sure you head on down to Pops, Shakkys, Little Chiefs, and the Little Doggie on your next bar crawl. They have great beer specials.

9. Stephenville
Source: Public domain
Population: 19,913
Estimated Trashy: 2,265
Estimated meth heads: 964
High school dropouts: 15%
Stephenville is located in the middle of nowhere in the Lone Star State. The Cowboy Capital of the World comes in eighth on our list. This number, however, doesn't reflect the high number of mullets (is it a mullet, a perm, or merm Stephenville?), shag haircuts, bangs teased like it's 1990, and the number of people who wear pajamas to one of your many Dollar Stores.
Here, if the trashy don't have ‘Mountain Dew' Mouth (AKA meth mouth) they're not doing it right. And if the Erath County townies weren't spending so much on meth, the dentists in this place would be making a fortune.
The culture in the 254 is as if Tonya Harding and Eminem got together and had a baby.
10. Corsicana
Population: 25,904
Estimated Trashy: 5,204
Estimated Meth Heads: 1,997
Payday Loan Outlets: 6
Rounding out the list of the ten most trashy cities in Texas brings us to Corsicana. This is where the high class trashy live. You think you're ‘all that' with your 8 Dollar Stores, 6 payday loan outlets, and large number of fast food restaurants to wear your pajamas, swimsuits, and wife beaters to.
Located slightly southeast of Dallas, Fort Worth, C-town is off the charts for it's use of high class trashy attire. Pink Crocs, feathered mullets, jorts, and beer guts galore, can be seen any given day of the week: it's a lifestyle here.
But for the residents of Navarro County, it's just home sweet home. Where the Meth Heads roam. And the hillbillies and pillbillies play.
There You Have It
According to the official dictionary definition of Trashy, and based on stereotypes that the internet says are true, using science to determine the most Trashy cities in a state can't be too far off.
If you're analyzing cities in Texas with lots of angry welfare recipients, single mothers and where people have lots of options for payday cash loans, this is an accurate list.
If you're curious enough, here are the least trashy places in Texas:

West Africa needs what Cuba has: a well-trained, coordinated healthcare system. Anything less and Ebola wins
Guatemala, Pakistan, Indonesia, Haiti. Four different nations that share a common experience: in the past decade, they were all struck by natural disasters which overwhelmed their under-staffed and under-funded public health systems. Into the rubble, flooding, and chaos of these distinct cultures and contexts, Cuba dispatched a specialised disaster and epidemic control team to support local health providers. It was a story of unprecedented medical solidarity by a developing country which few media outlets picked up – until now.
The Henry Reeve Brigade, as it's known, was established in 2005 by more than 1,500 Cuban health professionals trained in disaster medicine and infectious disease containment; built on 40 years of medical aid experience, the volunteer team was outfitted with essential medicines and equipment and prepared to deploy to US regions ravaged by Hurricane Katrina (the offer was rejected by the Bush administration). Today, Cuba's Henry Reeve Brigade is the largest medical team on the ground in west Africa battling Ebola.
The small island nation has pledged 461 doctors and nurses to provide care in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, the largest single-country offer of healthcare workers to date. While United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon decried the pallid aid commitment from around the globe calling for “a 20-fold resource mobilisation and at least a 20-fold surge in assistance” Cuba already had 165 of these specially-trained healthcare workers on the ground in Sierra Leone. Each of these volunteers, chosen from a pool of 15,000 candidates who stepped forward to serve in west Africa, has extensive disaster response experience.
Nevertheless, preparation for this mission required additional, rigorous training at Havana's Pedro Kourí Institute of Tropical Medicine with biosecurity experts from the United States and the Pan American Health Organisation. This rapid mobilisation of sorely-needed health professionals begs the question: how can a poor developing country spare qualified, experienced doctors and nurses?
By pursuing a robust medical education strategy, coupled with a preventive, community-based approach, Cuba, a country of just 11.2 million inhabitants, has achieved a health picture on par with the world's most developed nations. This didn't happen overnight. Rather, Cuba's admirable health report card results from decades of honing a strategy designed specifically for a resource-scarce setting.
By locating primary care doctors in neighbourhoods and emphasising disease prevention, the health system – which is universal and free at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels – makes care accessible and keeps people as healthy as possible, as long as possible, saving resources for more expensive treatments and interventions in the process.
But prevention and health promotion by community-based healthcare workers are only part of the story. Cuba's policies and practices, both at home and abroad (currently more than 50,000 Cuban health professionals are serving in 66 countries) are built on several principles proven effective in resource-scarce settings.
First, coordinating health policies at the local, regional, and national levels is essential; this is particularly important where infectious diseases are concerned since uniform protocols are integral to containment.
Next, health initiatives must be cross-sectoral and based on integrated messages and actions. A fragmented, uncoordinated response by and among different agencies can prove dangerous and even deadly. This was tragically illustrated by the death of Thomas Eric Duncan in Dallas and the US Centers for Disease Control allowing a nurse who has Ebola to travel on a commercial flight.
Finally, infectious disease outbreaks must be addressed quickly – easier said than done in poor settings, where public health systems are already strained or collapsing already.
The Ebola outbreak snaps the need for Cuba's approach into sharp relief: only a coordinated response, provided by well-trained and - equipped primary healthcare professionals will contain this – and future – epidemics. Indeed, policymakers such as World Health Organisation's Margaret Chan and US secretary of state John Kerry have lauded the Cuban response, underscoring the importance of collaboration as the only solution to this global health crisis.
Forging this solution, however, requires harnessing the political will across borders and agencies to marshal resources and know-how. Havana took up the challenge by hosting a special Summit on Ebola with its regional partners and global health authorities on 20 October. Noticeably absent were US health representatives; if we're to construct a comprehensive, integrated, and effective global response, all resources and experiences must be coordinated and brought to bear, regardless of political differences. Anything less and Ebola wins.

The following article by Sonia Bailley about what Islamic prayer (salat) really means was originally published at American Thinker in a slightly different form.
The Danger in Islamic Prayer
by Sonia Bailley
Before sharing their places of worship, it is crucial that Westerners discover what Muslims are saying when they recite the Islamic mandatory prayers. A few days ago, an Ontario synagogue invited Muslim worshippers to lead the Friday prayer. This article explains what the Islamic daily prayers mean, with focus on the Friday prayer within the context of Islamic law or sharia. Being better informed will make Westerners think twice before opening the doors to Muslim for prayer.
Canadian Muslims in southern Ontario were invited to preach the supremacy of Islam at a local synagogue and church. In a goodwill gesture, Peterborough's Mark Street United Church and Beth Israel Synagogue opened their doors to Muslims for prayer following the recent fire damage of the Masjid al-Salaam mosque. The president of the Beth Israel Synagogue and their board of directors hosted two Islamic prayer sessions this past Friday with not even a suspicion that the underlying theme in Islamic prayer is to curse and do away with nonbelievers like them.
A deep hatred and rejection of Judaism and Christianity are hardwired into Islamic doctrine, including the Koran. Many of its chapters are incorporated into mandatory daily Islamic prayer. The very first Koranic chapter, considered the most exalted of all chapters, is a prayer directed to Allah asking them to keep Muslims away from the misguided path of Jews and Christians. This chapter is a necessary part of the five mandatory daily prayers, and is recited not once, but anywhere from 17 to 100 times a day by devout Muslims (or in a broader sense, 6,200 to 36,500 times a year).
Repetition priming inculcates the notion of superiority over non-Muslims into the minds of all Muslims, instilling a deep mistrust of non-Muslims: “Guide us along the right path, the path of those whom you favored (referring to Muslims), and not along the path of those who earn your anger (referring to Jews), or those who go astray (referring to Christians). The references to Jews and Christians are in accord with Al-Tirmidhi's authentic hadiths (or Islamic narrations attributed to Mohammed) and other venerated Islamic interpretations, as reflected in some English translations of the Koran.
Friday prayers also include recitation of Koranic chapters 62 and 63 where Jews who reject Allah's commandments in the Torah are loathed and compared to “the likeness of a donkey carrying books but understands them not.” Jews are told to “long for death” if they pretend to be Allah's favorite. Nonbelievers are condemned to a state of error until Mohammed is sent by Allah to purify them “from the filth of disbelief and polytheism” with their verses or revelations from Allah. “Hypocrites” or apostates from Islam are considered enemies, “so beware of them, may Allah destroy them!”. Is it any wonder why many Muslims are prohibited from being friends with Jews and Christians? In nearly 500 verses the Koran condemns them to hell (which melts their skin and bellies) for not believing in Mohammed and for not converting to Islam.
Such are the prayers that are recited over and over again in mosques, and now in some churches and synagogues across the world as more Muslim communities continue to grow and expand. Oblivious to the ignorant Jewish and Christian hosts — whom the Koran portrays as sons of apes and pigs and as the worst of creatures — those very same prayers were recently recited by the Peterborough mosque's muezzin (one who recites the Islamic call to prayer) in the local church and synagogue. Their sonorous and somber voice evoked emotion and tears expressing compassion and admiration of Islam during the Islamic prayer session at the Mark Street United Church a couple of Fridays ago.
Little did these people know that they were chanting verses expressing disgust and disdain for nonbelievers, such as themselves. They appeared to be in a trancelike stupor as if undergoing a spiritual awakening — despite not understanding one word of Arabic prayer that calls for their rejection and eradication due to their misguided behavior. If they only knew what Islamic prayers meant in English, they would not be shedding tears of ignorance, and would certainly think twice before allowing Muslims to pray in their places of worship. “Love thy neighbor” should not be a one-way street.
The Peterborough mosque's imam Shazin Khan, along with other imams and Islamic spokespeople, uses a common deceptive tactic to show the Church audience that Islam cares about people of all religious faiths. They repeat only part of a well-known Koranic verse taken from the Jerusalem Talmud, asserting that saving one human being is like saving all of humanity. However, unlike the original Talmudic verse that applies equally to all humans, the Koranic verse was modified and prohibits only the murder of Muslims. This verse in its entirety is in accord with Islamic law or sharia, which applies the death penalty for killing Muslims, not non-Muslims.
Referring to Judaism and Islam, Kenzu Abdella, the president of the Kawartha Muslim Religious Association (in the Peterborough area near Toronto) who formed an alliance with Larry Gillman, the President of the Beth Israel Synagogue, informed the Canadian Broadcasting Cooperation that “we have more similarities than differences. We have so much common”.
Contrary to their claim, the differences are so great that 57 Islamic states united in the highly influential Organization of Islamic Cooperation rejected the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that views all people as equal and free, and replaced it with the Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam (CDHRI) that views people as neither equal nor free.
The CDHRI, being subject to sharia, limits the right to freedom of religion and expression according to what sharia permits. Women have lesser rights than men, as do non-Muslims than Muslims. Slavery is allowed, as it still has not been abolished in Islam. Human rights in Islam rely upon the most illiberal, draconian, and barbaric corporal punishments imaginable. Where are the similarities?
Mr. Abdella failed to mention that Islam considers itself the mother religion of both Judaism and Christianity, that it existed prior to those two false religions that veered away from the path of strict monotheism. They became corrupt and ignorant until Mohammed was sent by Allah as a gift to set things straight and convert all back to Islam or “the religion of true unspoiled nature”, as per the CDHRI.
The Islamic end-times, according to Bukhari, the most authentic of all hadith collections, will occur when Jesus, considered the last Muslim prophet in Islam, returns to earth to destroy Christianity (“break the cross”) and forces all to convert or die. But until such a time, radical Muslims must continue waging jihad against Christians and Jews who pay an Islamic tax called jizya that masquerades as halal products to support Islamic terrorism worldwide.
It's long past time that Westerners familiarize themselves with Islam and think twice before rolling out the welcome mats in their places of worship, especially in light of the tens of thousands of unvetted Muslim migrants coming soon to a city near you. Westerners who remain true to their faith by reaching out to Muslim neighbors with compassion will soon find out the hard way that mutual respect can never exist amongst different religions when one views itself as the perfect and supreme religion above all others, as Islam does.
Before sharing premises with Muslim worshippers, ask yourself the following question: would Muslims anywhere ever allow Jews or Christians into a mosque sanctuary to lead a Jewish or Christian prayer service?
Before we get started you can view the project requirements here. You can also get this code on github.com to follow along here.
This is a pretty simple straight forward project where we will accept a UNIX timestamp or a ‘natural language' date in our url and if valid will return an object containing both the UNIX timestamp and ‘natural language' values.
For example http://localhost:8080/December%2015,%202015 will return:
{ "unix": 1450166400, "natural": "December 15, 2015" }
Or http://localhost:8080/1504506722 will return:
{ "unix": 1504506722, "natural": "September 3, 2017" }
One thing to note here is that a UNIX timestamp is location specific, namely GMT, so as I am in California as I write this, http://localhost:8080/0 will actually give me the date ‘December 31, 1969' rather than what you might expect, ‘January 1, 1970'.
For this project we are going to be using Express.js in our Node.js environment. The first thing we will need to do is get our project folder ready, what I like to do is create a new repository on github.com, give it a name, select ‘Initialize this repository with a README' and done, hit ‘Create repository'. Once that is finished copy the ‘Clone with HTTPS' link to your clipboard and open up your terminal. Now navigate to your projects folder or wherever you want the project to live locally and run the following:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/timestamp-microservice.git
You should now have a folder for your new project with just a few git files inside.
The next thing I like to do is run:
npm init
This will run the npm package wizard where you can name your project, name the author etc. Once you have done this, open up your new package.json file and add:
"private": true, "dependencies": { "express": "4.x" }
This will ensure that your project is not accidentally added to the main npm repository and it will also state that you are going to be using Express.js in this project. Save your file and close it before returning to your terminal and running:
npm install
Now that we have got our package set up and our dependencies installed we should commit our package back to github.com, assuming you've got git all set up at this point that might be as simple as this:
git add -A git commit -m "this can be any message you like" git push origin master
Now the next thing I would do is create my actual server file, server.js, this is where all the magic of this project will happen.
The Code
We start our project off as you might expect, requiring the express module and setting the variable ‘app' to an instance of it:
var express = require('express'); var app = express();
The only other variable I declare out here is an array of the months, this will be helpful when we create Date objects as the month part of a Date object is zero indexed (0-11). We can then check the indexOf('December') which will be 11, perfect once we are parsing our ‘natural language' dates and making UNIX timestamps:
var months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December'];
Now we jump into our actual server responses, starting with a simple response on the home URL that show the user some example API calls:
app.get('/', function(req, res) { res.send('<p>Example usage:</p><code>http://localhost:8080/December%2015,%202015</code><br><code>http://localhost:8080/1450137600</code>'); });
We are only going to have two other server responses, one if the query is numbers and the other is the query starts with letters. First we will deal with the numbers / UNIX timestamp. Express.js is very helpful in that it allows us to use RegEx to route our queries. Here is my our GET request router for numbers:
app.get('/:date([0-9]*)', function(req, res) {...
The :date part is an Express.js placeholder which will give us access to that property at req.params.date . The RegEx then says take any number, 0-9, followed by anything. This RegEx could certainly be better but it works for us for this simple example.
Next we create out ‘result' object which is what will be returned by our API, we initialize it with ‘null' values so that it is ‘reset' each time and the correct values if they exist are added before the object is return as a response.
var result = { "unix": null, "natural": null };
Next we pull these numbers out and set them equal to a variable called ‘timestamp'. We have to use parseInt because these param values come as a string:
var timestamp = parseInt(req.params.date);
Now we create a new Date object using this timestamp:
var date = new Date(timestamp * 1000);
Now can set our ‘unix' value in our result object to the value of our ‘timestamp' variable.
result.unix = timestamp;
Then we build our ‘natural' value in our result object by taking the Month, Day and Year from our newly created Date object. Also notice how we use the Month value as the index to pull our actual Month name from our ‘months' array:
result.natural = (months[date.getMonth()]) + ' ' + date.getDate() + ', ' + date.getFullYear();
Then finally we send this response back to the browser (this also closes our app.get() code block):
res.send(result); });
Now we move onto our final server response route which deals with a ‘natural language' date, I use quotes because It's actually pretty rigid about how it will take the date but it looks like its natural language. The date must be in the format: September 3, 2017. Again we use Express.js RegEx routing to pick up GET requests that start with letters:
app.get('/:natString([a-zA-Z]*)', function(req, res) {...
Here we use the placeholder :natString which again we can access as req.params.natString and our RegEx that says anything with a lower or uppercase letter followed by anything. Again this RegEx is pretty rudimentary but for our use it gets the job done. If we were to expand or further develop this API this would be one of the first places to start.
The next thing we do, as before, is created our result object containing null values:
var result = { "unix": null, "natural": null };
After this we take our ‘natural language' date string and split it up into an array, at this point the input ‘September 15, 2017' would return ['September', '15,' '2017'] . Notice the comma after 15, we will need to deal with this later.
var dateArr = req.params.natString.split(' ');
Now we validate if the first item in our array, which should be a month, can be found in our array of months that we created at the start. If it is not, we treat this API request as invalid and return the result object with the null values:
if (months.indexOf(dateArr[0]) > -1) {...
If it is indeed in our array of months we treat this as a valid request and start parsing out our date values as required, here we come across one of JavaScripts wonderful quirks, days as you might expect take values from 1-31, years again as expected take a value such as 1995 which indeed corresponds to the year 1995 but months do not follow this convention and are 0 indexed, so December is represented by 11, January by 0 and so on. This is where our array of months that we created at the start will help us, we can check the index of the first value that the user provided which now lives in our dateArr variable and this will be perfect for building our new Date object:
var month = months.indexOf(dateArr[0]); var day = dateArr[1].replace(',', ''); var year = dateArr[2];
The only other thing to note here is that our day value still contains a comma. We trim this off simply using .replace() .
Now that we have our date values parsed we build our new Date object:
var date = new Date(year, month, day);
And with this we can pull our UNIX timestamp and date values.
result.unix = date.getTime() / 1000; result.natural = (months[date.getMonth()]) + ' ' + date.getDate() + ', ' + date.getFullYear();
Really we could have just joined our dateArr back together to give our ‘natural language' date but by passing it into the Date object and pulling it back from there it feels more foolproof to me, once we do the reverse on a date, UNIX to ‘natural language' or visa versa this makes sure they are correct rather than just assuming.
The last thing we do in this if () code block is pass the result object back as a response from the server:
res.send(result); }
Outside this if () code block the next thing we see is the default server response that will return the result object with the null values if our ‘natural language' date is considered invalid:
res.send(result); res.send(result); });
As you can see this closes our final app.get() code block, the final piece of code is our app.listen() code block which tell the app to listen to port 8080:
app.listen(8080, function() { console.log('App listening on port 8080.'); });
And that's it, all done! You can check out this code in full on github.com here.

Congressman Eric Swalwell said they fear the House investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election will be so lacking in factual evidence about what really happened, he's dubbing it a "flat earth report."
"There's widespread concern among our Democratic caucus that this investigation is not a serious one," said Swalwell, who is on the House Select Intelligence Committee, during a Wednesday morning appearance BuzzFeed's morning show AM to DM.
The Congressman who represents the Bay Area noted that the president's son Donald Trump Jr, lawyer Michael Cohen, and political consultant Roger Stone had not been subpoenaed despite being the "most relevant witnesses."
Instead on Tuesday, fellow California member of congress Devin Nunes, a Trump ally and head of the intelligence committee, announced that the research company who put together the dossier which alleged ties between Donald Trump and Russia will be subpoenaed.
"Our biggest fear is that at the end of the investigation you'll see a Senate intelligence report where you've seen cooperation between Senators [Richard] Burr and [Mark] Warner and they'll have one set of findings, and you'll see this, what I call 'flat earth report' from House Republicans that completely defies the evidence and what really happened," said Swalwell.
"If we have this kind of disunity between our reports because of the shenanigans we've seen from House Republicans, that actually helps the Russians," they added.
Swalwell called on Nunes to recuse themselves from the investigation, after concerns they had passed along confidential information about the probe. In April, Nunes temporarily stepped aside from the investigation.
"It's time that they stay recused or that Paul Ryan steps in and ensures that we have a legitimate investigation," said Swalwell.
Goodyear IntelliGrip features a sensor mounted to the inside of the tire tread that directly measures actual pressure and temperature (some such readings with today's tire-pressure monitoring systems provide inferred values). These sensors also compute information about tire wear and the available friction of the road surface. All of this information is communicated with the car and the cloud. The sensor is powered by a piezo-electric generator (a piezo crystal gets compressed every time the sensor gets deflected as that part of the tire hits the ground, squeezing out a few electrons). Goodyear has equipped some cars in the California-based semi-autonomous Tesla car-sharing service Tesloop with this technology to gauge its usefulness in fleet management.

Pirelli Connesso also features a sensor glued inside the tread of a tire, though a battery designed to outlive the tire powers the sensor. It communicates via Bluetooth technology. Pirelli fleshes the idea out a bit more with smartphone apps that can keep you apprised of your tires' actual instantaneous temperatures and pressures (presented on a graph showing low, normal, and high ranges) and estimate each tire's wear based on temperature and usage data compelled over time. Sadly, because this sensor is not monitoring the actual tread depth, this system will not be able to show you real-time tread loss during a prolonged Hellcat burnout. Of course, the system will first become available on premium refined vehicles favored by the set that doesn't do burnouts, buying Pirelli valuable time to develop that crucial feature.
Goodyear Eagle 360 Urban Spherical Tire

Goodyear returned with an Urban update on last year's wild and crazy Eagle 360 spherical future tire. It adds artificial intelligence and a transformable bionic skin capable of adapting the tread surface to wet or dry conditions. Dimples get sucked up into the sphere in the wet, then pressed back down for greater rubber coverage when the road dries out. Such tires would have to be nonpneumatic, supported by foam or some other flexible internal structure. Naturally it is also chock-full of sensors to monitor its own condition, to perceive the road conditions, and to warn drivers (and probably disable the vehicle) if it has been loaded beyond what the tire structure can support. The bionic skin is made of a super-elastic polymer that can expand, and contract, and possibly even heal itself in certain situations. As before, at its center is a permanent magnet setup that provides magnetic levitation of the body over the tire and receives the electrical signals that make it turn, both when delivering power and while steering the vehicle. We eagerly await the opportunity to try out a prototype of this concept, but no such thing is available yet.
Pirelli Color Tires

The latest fashion craze in bespoke vehicle accessorizing might be colored sidewalls, or so hopes Pirelli. The company managed to outfit many production and concept vehicles in Geneva with its new line of color tires. They come in four standard colors (red, white, yellow, and silver) but can also be ordered to match any of the 3,000 Pantone shades—for a bit more money. Unlike the good old whitewall days, when the color was baked into the sidewall and then exposed by carving off an outer layer of black, these stripes are applied to the finished tire in three layers. There's an adhesion layer, a color layer, and a clear protection layer. Sadly, that top layer doesn't put up much of a fight against curb-rash, though Pirelli talks about a cosmetic repair kit to dress up scratched color sidewalls. Better to buy curb feelers or avoid parallel parking. This concept is rolling out first on P Zero, P Zero Corsa, and Sottozero winter tires, and they can be ordered by navigating to www.shop.pirelli.com and finding your vehicle. This way the tires are guaranteed to match the original-equipment specifications. Sorry, for now they're only available to fit fairly high-end cars, and—like Scandinavian speeding fines—the pricing is based on your ability to pay (as inferred by the vehicle's sticker price). To wit: tires in one of the standard colors for a Porsche 718 Cayman cost $1,840 for a set; for a Lamborghini Aventador, $4,980. That's a premium of $742 for the Porsche, $3,692 for the Lambo relative to Tirerack pricing for P Zeros. But then, what price fashion?
Brembo ECS aluminum calipers
View 18 Photos
The fetching and feathery aluminum Alpine A110 that made its debut in Geneva sports world-first technology in its rear brake calipers. For one thing, it's an entirely aluminum design, whereas most aluminum calipers still use an iron mounting bracket. Next, the electric parking brake and hydraulic single-cylinder service brake are integrated into one, with an electric screwjack motor serving to move the piston in parking/emergency brake actuation. Together, this saves 5.5 pounds across the rear axle. But wait, there's more: The system is intelligent enough to monitor itself and reclamp if necessary in cases where a parking brake is set while the brakes are very hot and there's risk of slippage as the brakes start to cool and deform. Brembo also supplies the four-piston monobloc front calipers, but they break no new technical ground.
A change of the political guard is underway in Peel Region, with two long-serving mayors choosing not to run and a third unlikely to be re-elected. And that's all for the good. Hazel McCallion is retiring after an astonishing 36 years as Mississauga mayor; Caledon's Marolyn Morrison is stepping away after a more modest 11-year stint; and Brampton Mayor Susan Fennell is struggling to stay past the 14 years they have already served, but trails badly in the polls. Peel residents should welcome these developments. This sprawling region needs fresh direction. With that in mind, here are our choices for mayor in Peel:
Bonnie Crombie is the Star's choice for mayor of Mississauga. ( ANDREW FRANCIS WALLACE / TORONTO STAR )
Bonnie Crombie for Mississauga It's hard to imagine two candidates with more in common than Bonnie Crombie and Steve Mahoney. Both are Liberal Party stalwarts; both served in Parliament earlier in their careers; and both have experience on city council. Crombie is a member of the current council while Mahoney left in 1987 after winning a seat at Queen's Park. They espouse similar policies, too, pledging to attract business, limit tax increases to the rate of inflation, provide better service to new immigrants and boost public transit. Their transit plans differ on details, with Mahoney putting more emphasis on High Occupancy Vehicle lanes, but both support a planned light rail line and expect the province to pay for most transit expansion.
Article Continued Below
Either of these contenders would be a reasonable choice, but we favour Crombie. She's a younger, high-energy candidate who is remarkably passionate about Mississauga's future. Mahoney has a wealth of experience at all three levels of government over a long career of public service. And they pledge to take a co-operative approach at city hall, which would be a refreshing change from McCallion's political steamroller. But Crombie has criticized them as “yesterday's man,” and it's a description that sticks. We are not swayed by McCallion's public endorsement of Crombie's platform over the Thanksgiving weekend. That gesture — equivalent to a royal nod in Mississauga — is guaranteed to attract votes. But it does little to enhance Crombie's credibility as an agent of change. For that, it's better to look in detail at their commitments to bring more mixed-use development to the city, more walkable neighbourhoods, increased urban intensification, and revitalization of Mississauga's 22-kilometre waterfront. These are all gaps in McCallion's legacy, and addressing them is vital to ensuring a vibrant future. Crombie is the best bet for progress in these important areas. There are some blind spots in Crombie's agenda. They don't put enough emphasis on issues of accountability and public integrity, which is disappointing in light of McCallion's conflict-of-interest scandal. A public inquiry found McCallion in “a real and apparent conflict of interest” over a development that could have enriched their son, but Crombie criticized the report as a waste of money. As mayor, they will need to exercise better judgment in these matters.
Given that caveat, Crombie deserves a chance to show what they can do to advance Canada's sixth largest city into the 21st century. She's the best choice for Mississauga's voters on Oct. 27. Linda Jeffrey for Brampton
Article Continued Below
The clear choice in Brampton is Linda Jeffrey, a highly regarded Liberal cabinet minster who gave up their Queen's Park seat to run for mayor. After the scandals and spending excesses seen during Susan Fennell's time in office, this city desperately needs accountable leadership. Jeffrey has promised to review Brampton's finances immediately using external auditors. They will implement a lobbyist registry and says they will appoint a full-time integrity commissioner with power to investigate alleged infractions. Jeffrey promises to bring new rigour to the awarding of city contracts. And they have pledged to post their own expenses, and those of senior staff and councillors, online. It's about time. Brampton residents have suffered through years of mismanagement, obfuscation and shameless grasping at goodies on Fennell's watch. Them shenanigans are too numerous to detail here, but the list was capped in August by a Deloitte Canada forensic audit that found Fennell's office had broken spending rules 266 times over seven years. There were a host of other questionable expenses that couldn't be properly explored due to lack of information. Police are investigating. That Fennell is running at all, in the face of such damning evidence, testifies to their brazen disregard of the public interest. John Sanderson, currently a Brampton councillor, is also campaigning for mayor on a pledge to clean up city hall. To their credit, they pushed for the Deloitte audit. And they would certainly be a huge improvement over Fennell. But Sanderson's record in public office can't compare to that of Jeffrey. They began their political career at Brampton city council, then moved to Queen's Park where they handled a variety of jobs including serving as natural resources minister, minister of labour, minister responsible for seniors and, most recently, minister of municipal affairs. Jeffrey has the skills necessary to flush away the mess at city hall. And their extensive government contacts, and expertise on several cabinet files, should stand Brampton in good stead when dealing with the province. Allan Thompson for Caledon Councillor Allan Thompson isn't pledging a radical break from the policies of Marolyn Morrison but they do promise more community engagement if elected mayor. “People want to be involved and know what's going on,” they said. And he's right. Big decisions, such as putting a huge Canadian Tire warehouse in the area, deserve more public input. Thompson is our choice.

Cloud9 could move to Europe soon
Prior to DreamHack Winter, Cloud9 underwent an intensive three-week bootcamp in Stockholm to cut out their mistakes from ESWC and FACEIT, but the team could soon take their training regime to a whole new level as a permanent move to Europe is currently under consideration.
"We have some pretty cool news, we might be moving to Europe this year," Jordan "n0thing" Gilbert said during the Work All Play podcast.
"In the next couple of months we will decide."
Jordan "n0thing" Gilbert went on to say that the city of Berlin is a strong possibility for their team to move to, which would allow them to take part in the biggest European leagues and to practice constantly against the top sides in the continent.

Wasps' Simon McIntyre and Saracens' Owen Farrell have been cited following their yellow cards during Saturday's European Champions Cup semi final.
This means that after reviewing the two separate incidents, Italian citing commissioner Stefano Marrama believes the on-pitch sanctions applied by referee Romain Poite and TMO Eric Gauzins were inadequate.
Match analysis
McIntyre kicked out with their right foot at the prone Maro Itoje after the England lock grasped their left ankle in an attempt to slow the prop's realignment into Wasps' defensive line.
Their boot made contact with Itoje's head, albeit with little force, and after a lengthy review M.Gauzins and M.Poite determined a yellow card to be appropriate.
Wasps' replacement loose head arrived on the pitch 17 minutes prior to the incident, which is out of character for a player who has an exemplary disciplinary record.
McIntyre has been cited under law 10.4 (c) and if found guilty faces a suspension of between four and 52 weeks.
Itoje has been issued with a rap across the knuckles, by way of a citing commissioner warning.
Farrell is charged with a dangerous tackle in contravention of law 10.4 (e) following their clash with Dan Robson.
Wasps' scrum half was stretchered from the pitch and suffered a concussion which seems likely to keep them off the field for this weekend's Premiership trip to Exeter.
Saracens' fly half will be suspended for somewhere between two and 52 weeks if found guilty of an offence which has caused them problems previously, including in an England shirt.
Comment
Harlequins' England prop Joe Marler has also been cited for kicking Grenoble's Arnaud Heguy during the clubs' Friday night Challenge Cup semi final.
A disciplinary committee will now sit in judgement on both cases, and any bans apply to all rugby.
Social justice warriors can find a way to be offended by anything. Even the Dalai Lama's words are too controversial for their delicate ears.
Students at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) are protesting their school's announcement that the Dalai Lama will speak at their commencement ceremony in June. Chinese students studying at the American campus said they were an oppressive figure given their stance on Tibetan independence. Meanwhile, left-wing students are angered by their criticism of the Communist Party of China, Quartz Media reported.
A few hours after the announcement, the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA) released a note in Mandarin on WeChat saying it had communicated with the Chinese consulate.
“UCSD is a place for students to cultivate their minds and enrich their knowledge. Currently, the various actions undertaken by the university have contravened the spirit of respect, tolerance, equality, and earnestness — the ethos upon which the university is built,” the note stated. “These actions have also dampened the academic enthusiasm of Chinese students and scholars. If the university insists on acting unilaterally and inviting the Dalai Lama to give a speech at the graduation ceremony, our association vows to take further measures to firmly resist the university's unreasonable behavior. Specific details of these measures will be outlined in our future statements.”
Chinese students also created a hashtag #ChineseStudentsMatter, learning from social justice warriors who penned #BlackLivesMatter. They continued to write on social media that inviting the Dalai Lama was no different than inviting President Trump to speak.
They referred to the Dalai Lama on Facebook as “divisive,” “politically incorrect,” an “ethnic secessionist,” and opposed to “diversity.”
Protests against the Dalai Lama have been happening for nearly a decade on American college campuses, but this is the first time people have framed the argument around the idea of “inclusion” and “diversity.” Seeing how school administrators have buckled to the demands of social justice warriors in the past, they must feel that it's a winning strategy to silence voices they disagree with.

Oil prices may be on the mend after collapsing to a 13-year low earlier this year, but the damage in the energy industry only seems to be spreading.
For an increasing number of companies that enjoyed triple-digit prices in the summer of 2014, the bounce back to $44 a barrel is too little, too late.
At last check, some 69 North American oil and gas producers have filed since the beginning of 2015, according to a recent report from law firm Haynes and Boone.
April, however, was the worst month of all, with 11 new Chapter 11 filings.
To put the carnage in perspective, the Visual Capitalist blog crunched the Haynes and Boone data to create this telling infographic, which was highlighted as “the chart of the day” in the “Need to Know” blog.
There were nine bankruptcies in the first two months of 2016, and none of them had debts topping $200 million. In April, however, 11 companies filed, and four of them had debts of more than $1 billion, including Ultra Petroleum's US:UPLMQ $3.9 billion.
In total, debt for all the April filers reached $14.9 billion, compared with the $17.2 billion for the 42 bankrupt energy companies combined for all of 2015.
In the U.S. alone, the number of bankruptcies in the oil sector has reached 59, which is closing in on the 68 filings that were triggered by the telecom bust back in 2002, according to Reuters. A report from Deloitte earlier this year concluded that about 175 companies are at risk of insolvency.

Dino Babers is a hot name on college football's coaching-replacement market because of the offense they run at Bowling Green. Turns out he's also something of a Good Samaritan. Like, the best Samaritan.
Babers was on a team bus returning from Buffalo after the Falcons' game against the Bulls when a car swerved in front of the bus and hit the center divider. After the bus pulled over (it suffered no damage in the accident), Babers and team trainer Chelsea Lowe went to check on the driver of the car, which had started smoking.
The Toledo Blade has more:
“The closer we got to the car, the clearer we could see smoke billowing,” Lowe said. “We knew whoever was in the car wasn't just going to walk away and have everything be OK.” The pair helped pull the injured driver, identified by Avon police as 25-year-old Amber Nettles of Elyria, out of the car and a safe distance away from the burning vehicle before local police and fire officials arrived. “Chelsea was there comforting the woman, and I went back to the car to get their purse and keys and other valuables,” Babers said. Avon police confirmed the crash and said Nettles was taken to St. John Medical Center in Westlake. A hospital spokesperson said they had no information on a patient by that name. “We had carried or dragged them about 30 feet away to what was a safer place,” Lowe said. “My main concern was to hold them in a position where they were as comfortable as possible while we waited for paramedics, and that they stayed alert and as pain-free as possible while we waited.”
This isn't the first time Babers has more or less been a superhero. According to the Blade, they also helped revive a person who had a heart attack in a hotel parking lot and got two car passengers out of a car that had flipped over.
A new study published by the Institute for the Study of Labor, a German think tank, finds that medical marijuana laws in the United States are associated with a 9 percent decline in traffic fatalities. That result is based on data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System for 13 states that legalized medical use of cannabis between 1990 and 2009. The study's authors, Montana State University economist D. Mark Anderson and University of Colorado at Denver economist Daniel Rees, argue that the most plausible explanation is the substitution of marijuana for alcohol, since laboratory research suggests that smoking pot impairs driving ability substantially less than drinking does (citations omitted):
Laboratory studies have shown that cannabis use impairs driving-related functions such as distance perception, reaction time, and hand-eye coordination. However, neither simulator nor driving-course studies provide consistent evidence that these impairments to driving-related functions lead to an increased risk of collision. Drivers under the influence of marijuana reduce their velocity, avoid risky maneuvers, and increase their "following distances," suggesting compensatory behavior. In addition, there appears to be an important learning-by-doing component to driving under the influence of marijuana: experienced users show substantially less functional impairment than infrequent users. Like marijuana, alcohol impairs driving-related functions such as reaction time and hand-eye coordination. Moreover, there is unequivocal evidence from simulator and driving-course studies that alcohol consumption leads to an increased risk of collision. Even at low doses, drivers under the influence of alcohol tend to underestimate the degree to which they are impaired, drive at faster speeds, and take more risks.
In support of their hypothesis that these differences explain why states with medical marijuana laws have seen especially big drops in fatal car crashes, Anderson and Rees cite data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health for three states that enacted such laws during the last decade: Montana, Vermont, and Rhode Island. Marijuana use by adults rose more in those states after they adopted their laws than it did in neighboring states, a difference that was statistically significant in Montana and Rhode Island. (At the same time, the survey data do not indicate that medical marijuana laws boosted consumption among minors—a charge commonly made by drug warriors.) Anderson and Rees also note that the drop in fatal car accidents associated with medical marijuana laws was statistically significant for crashes involving alcohol but not for other crashes, and they present some evidence that alcohol consumption has declined in medical marijuana states.
Assuming that people are substituting marijuana for alcohol, Anderson and Rees note, the impact on traffic fatalities might be due to shifting locations of consumption rather than the difference between the two drugs' effects on driving ability:
Alcohol is often consumed in restaurants and bars, while many states prohibit the use of medical marijuana in public. Even where it is not explicitly prohibited, anecdotal evidence suggests that the public use of medical marijuana can be controversial. If marijuana consumption typically takes place at home, then designating a driver for the trip back from a restaurant or bar becomes unnecessary, and legalization could reduce traffic fatalities even if driving under the influence of marijuana is every bit as dangerous as driving under the influence of alcohol.
Either way, this benign effect of medical marijuana laws hinges on a tradeoff between a recreational drug and a purportedly medicinal one:
Because it is prohibitively expensive for the government to ensure that all marijuana ostensibly grown for the medicinal market ends up in the hands of registered patients (especially in states that permit home cultivation), diversion to the illegal market likely occurs. Moreover, the majority of MMLs allow patients to register based on medical conditions that cannot be objectively confirmed (e.g. chronic pain and nausea).
So while the study undermines one complaint about medical marijuana laws—that they encourage minors to smoke pot—it reinforces another: that they allow people to get high under the cover of treating unverifiable illnesses. Then again, those who believe adults should not need an officially recognized excuse to consume marijuana might view that aspect of the laws as a feature rather than a bug.

Strong draft lifts Saints' offseason grade
By Bryson Vesnaver • May 26, 2016
The Saints completed their second-consecutive 7-9 season last year, missing the playoffs in both of those campaigns. While QB Drew Brees and LT Terron Armstead provided bright spots on offense, the Saints were one of the worst defensive teams in all football last season. The New Orleans' defense had just six players earn above-average grades, and only one (DE Cameron Jordan) who graded at a truly top level. There were a lot of holes that needed to be addressed, and not a lot of salary cap space to do it.
Let's see what moves they made in free agency and the draft to address some of those weaknesses.
Offseason Grade: C+
Free agency and trades
New Arrivals:
RB Vick Ballard, TE Coby Fleener, LB James Laurinaitis, LB Nate Stupar, DT Nick Fairley, LB Craig Robertson, K Connor Barth
Re-signings:
RB Travaris Cadet, RB Tim Hightower, K Kai Forbath, TE Michael Hoomanawanui, G Senio Kelemete, QB Luke McCown, S Jamarca Sanford, CB Kyle Wilson, G Tim Lelito
Departures:
CB Brandon Browner, S Rafael Bush, WR Marques Colston, G Jahri Evans, LB David Hawthorne, LB Ramon Humber, RB Khiry Robinson, TE Benjamin Watson
Offensively, the Saints were forced to say goodbye to a trio of starters from last season in TE Ben Watson, WR Marques Colston, and G Jahri Evans. While the three are well-known names, their production last season was not irreplaceable. Colston and Evans had average seasons and are not getting any younger, so it was not a big surprise to see the Saints move on. Watson was a solid passing-game TE, finishing with the 11th best receiving grade in the league, but they also had the third-lowest blocking grade (out of 73 TEs). Coby Fleener had a rough receiving year last season, but has shown potential in the past at both receiving and blocking. The Saints are hoping a fresh start can allow Fleener to put it all together in the same season and be an improvement to what Watson was for them.
Defensively, the Saints got rid of CB Brandon Browner after they posted the lowest grade we've ever given a corner for a season. They also moved on from LBs David Hawthorne and Ramon Humber, both of whom posted below-average grades in limited snaps. The Saints desperately needed upgrades on all three levels of their defense, and they managed to really hit on just one of their three big signings. DT Nick Fairley is an instant upgrade to their defensive interior. Their production has been above-average every year and they posted a career-high grade last season, 11th-highest among DTs. He'll help take some pressure off of DE Cameron Jordan, who was the Saints' only real pass-rusher last season.
At the linebacker position, the Saints managed to sign two ILBs in Craig Robertson and James Laurinaitis. Robertson has posted decent coverage grades the past two seasons, but has somewhat struggled against the run. Laurinaitis is even worse against the run, and also struggled in pass coverage. For a team that had just one linebacker grade above-average against the run (Hau'oli Kikaha), neither Robertson nor Laurinaitis are real upgrades for that group.
2016 NFL draft
Round 1 (12) Sheldon Rankins, DT, Louisville
Round 2 (47) Michael Thomas, WR, Ohio State
Round 2 (61) (from New England via Arizona) Vonn Bell, S, Ohio State
Round 4 (120) (from Washington) David Onyemata, DT, University of Manitoba
Round 7 (237) Daniel Lasco, RB, California
Despite only five draft picks this year, the Saints made them count. DT Sheldon Rankins was a top-10 talent; they were the second-highest graded interior defender in 2014, and posted similar production levels last season. They have the ability to play either 3-4 DE or 4-3 DT without any difficulties. They should prove to be an instant upgrade to the Saints' interior defensive line.
WR Michael Thomas was a big-time Round-2 pick for them, as we had them 24th on our final draft board. He's one of the best route-runners in this year's WR class, and has the ability to go up and win the ball at the catch point. He'll be a good intermediate weapon for the Saints' offense. S Vonn Bell had the 12th-best coverage grade in this class, and should help anchor the Saints' secondary. DT David Onyemata and RB Daniel Lasco are projects, but both are phenomenal athletes that the Saints' coaches are hoping they can mold into productive players at the NFL level.
Conclusion
The Saints' biggest issue this offseason was their lack of cap space, and they managed to get some relief there by cutting some underperforming veterans loose. However, when it came to actually improving struggling units of their team, the Saints didn't quite find the success they were hoping for. Offensively, New Orleans will still have issues all along their offensive line, save for the left tackle position. The tight end position didn't get worse, but didn't necessarily get better, either. Michael Thomas has a good chance of becoming a solid top-level receiver, but he's just one.
Defensively, the Saints helped shore up their interior defense with the Fairley signing and the drafting of Rankins. However, they brought in two underwhelming linebackers who don't figure to improve that unit very much. They added just one defensive back in the draft and free agency combined, save for a handful of undrafted free agents. The Saints still have plenty of holes, and they'll need a lot of players to step up in an unexpectedly huge way to have a successful season.
Ideas have consequences. That's what conservative intellectuals have been telling us for more than half a century – longer really as this is a truth that has been affirmed in both Athens and Jerusalem. But for all the lip service, conservative intellectuals don't seem to believe it – not really. Not with the sort of belief that urges action.
Rather, they suffer from a sort of Stockholm Syndrome, empathizing with and seeking favor from their captors, in this case the American Left. Seth Leibsohn and I discuss the phenomena and the opportunity it presents for a restoration of American originalism.

Prepare for another year of $1 trillion-plus deficits.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected Wednesday that the deficit for 2012 will run $1.1 trillion, the fourth year in a row the shortfall will exceed $1 trillion.
The projection is down a bit from an earlier estimate pegging the deficit this year at $1.2 trillion.
The report also warned that a new recession is likely if an ongoing stalemate over tax and spending cuts continues between Democrats and Republicans.
In its annual summertime report, the budget office said Wednesday that letting decade-old tax Bush tax rates expire and sweeping spending cuts occur in January -- which will happen without congressional action -- "would lead to economic conditions in 2013 that will probably be considered a recession."
If that happened, the economy would contract by 0.5 percent -- a gloomier projection than the budget office made earlier this year when it envisioned slight growth under that scenario. Unemployment would rise to around 9 percent by late next year if the standoff persists, the analysts said.
The budget office's latest warning came amid a presidential and congressional election year in which neither President Obama nor congressional Republicans have shown any signs of giving ground in their protracted battle over taxes, spending and the budget. The lethargic economy and massive federal deficits are top-flight issues in this year's campaigns.
Obama wants to renew expiring tax cuts for everyone except individuals earning over $200,000 and couples who bring in above $250,000. Republicans are demanding that all tax cuts be extended. The two sides also have made no progress over how to prevent budget-wide spending cuts from taking effect. These automatic cuts were sat in motion by the failure of lawmakers last year to reach a bipartisan debt-reduction agreement.
Letting the tax rates continue and preventing the spending cuts from taking effect would leave a deficit next year of just over $1 trillion. If the reverse occurs, the shortfall would be $641 billion -- in effect sucking roughly $400 billion out of a U.S. economy that is already struggling.
Though continuing the tax rates and blocking the spending cuts would produce higher economic growth over the next two years, "it would reduce output and income in the longer run and is ultimately unsustainable," the budget office warned.
It also envisions an economy recovering at only a modest pace the rest of this year, growing at an annual rate of 2.25 percent.

A remarkable online gallery lets users navigate the subway lines of New York City, seeing the same tile work in the same sequences as train riders. Launched in Manhattan, the NY Train Project mosaic collection has since branched out to include Brooklyn, and most recently The Bronx. Keep an eye out for Queens, too (coming next year).
Spending dozens of hours on trains and at stations was just the start for graphic designer Adam Chang. Each mosaic then had to be digitally recreated and an interface created to digitally “travel” between them. The result is an intuitive, fluid and visually rich website. The sheer variety of signs and tile work stands out against the minimalist design.
In the course of their trips and research, Chang also picked up facts about stations to add to the pages of mosaics. “I found out quite a bit of information during this process,” says Chang, from things like “who the original architects were that designed the first subway signs to the reason why some stations have certain symbols or plaques.”
Chang got some of their information via Wikipedia and the MTA, but also pulled “from pop culture references such as movies and music videos.” They were “surprised how many stations are part of the U.S. National Register of Historic Places” and found patterns along the way as well, like: “the red and green lines seem to have the most varying signage regarding the shapes, material, and design.”
The train project reflects Chang's interests in the city, art, photography and travel. “This is definitely a labor of love. This project has taken a lot of personal time and effort but I feel it's my way of giving back a very small contribution to an amazing city that has inspired and helped me grow in many ways as a person and designer. I started this project back in 2013 and I just wrapped up the third borough the Bronx. I have Queens left, and I'm hoping to complete that sometime in 2017.”
If anyone wants to see them take their work internationally, Chang is on board with the idea: “As far as creating something similar in other cities, I've gotten the most emails asking about London. I've only been there once so I don't know the train system too well, but if anyone wants to provide a trip for me to research, I would be open to it!” Meanwhile, be sure to check out the interactive project website.

Recently Mauricio Reyes lecturer in the CIDI-UNAM released a series of Mexican famous characters made in collaboration with their students. I must say that they look awesome!
This is an example of how the culture is a non static phenomenon and always is mixing in order to create new ways of personal expression. With a very refined technique, these epoxy resin models of 20 cm recreates very well the traditional beloved characters with a very polished Lego aesthetics. Indeed, these figures make me think how important is the embodiment of artificial characters in order to make them engaging and likable. Two very important features in the design of social robots.
Cantinflas, President Juarez, El Santo, The Weeping Woman, Blue Demon, Sub-commandant Marcos, the inventor Guillermo Camarena (He studied in my first Alma mater, the IPN) and other well-known Mexican characters in the domestic domain are there. Most of them are well recognized by my fellow Mexicans; others are less known as the founders of the CIDI, and sport people as the runner Ana Gabriela Guevara that hardly is known outside of Mexico.
I am so sure this collection and the international exposition that is having will push the curiosity of the people and they will try to investigate more about them. Likely these Mexican characters will be better know offshore in the next years thanks to this attractive collection. Let's see who are next Mexican celebrities added to the collection. Well done Mauricio!

Welcome to Cool Comics in My Collection Episode 114, where we take a look at comic books I own (and in some cases ones that I let get away), both new and old, often with a nostalgic leaning for those feelings of yesteryear.
For each of the comic books I include in this blog (except for digital issues), I list the current secondary market value. This is according to the listings at the website www.comicbookrealm.com. They list out the near mint prices, which are on the comic book grading scale of 9.4. If you go to the website to look up any in your collection, you can click on the price and see the value at different grades. Not all of my comics are 9.4. Some are probably better, and some are worse. But to simplify it, that's the grading price I use here. And remember, a comic book is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it.
Have you considered being a guest host for Cool Comics? You can do a theme or just pick any of your comics for inclusion (this blog is for all ages, so please keep that in mind), with a maximum of seven issues. Repeat guest hosts are permitted and encouraged. Send your completed blog to edgosney62@gmail.com.
If you have any questions or comments, please scroll to the bottom of the page to where it says, “Leave a reply.” I hope you enjoy seeing these as much as I do writing about them. And now, Episode 114…
Cool Comics News!
This week we're looking at nothing but number 1 issues! No, I don't have Action Comics #1 (although I did have it in my digital reading section a few episodes ago) or Spider-Man #1, but I did include the first issue of the Watchmen – DC Universe crossover, and also the digital version of the comic that started the Marvel Universe as we know it today. What else? Keep reading, fearless friends, and find out what exciting 4-color adventures reside below.

Cool comics in my collection #546: Doomsday Clock #1, January 2018.
Doomsday Clock is a 12-issue limited series, written by Geoff Johns and penciled by Gary Frank, that promises to show us what would happen if Watchmen characters entered the DC Universe as we know it today. Like an Elseworlds, right? Wait, is this for real? Is this canon? Does it really count? I guess we'll have to keep reading to find out. For those who've read the original Watchmen, when last we saw Rorschach…wait a minute…no spoilers here. Watchmen are decades old, but I recently read it for the first time, and I'm sure there are many others who've yet to crack open this important work in comic book history, and even though you can find out what took place all over the Internet, I'm not about to be accused of ruining it for any of you. Seriously, if you haven't read the original and you plan on buying Doomsday Clock, you need to do your homework and travel back to the origins of The Comedian, Doctor Manhattan, Nite Owl, Ozymandias, Silk Spectre, and the asupervisorstioned Rorschach. The design of the interior pages gives you the impression that you're traveled back to the Eighties when Watchmen entered the comic book landscape, and it even contains the “printed” material pages at the end. Some of you are probably excited for this, while others want DC to leave the Watchmen alone. I'm interested to see what they are going to do, so I'm looking forward to issue 2. The cover price of Doomsday Clock #1 is $4.99, while the current value is $5.
Cool comics in my collection #547: The Librarians #1, September 2017.
Our second number 1 issue this week comes from Dynamite and is based on the TV series by the same name, The Librarians. And guess what? The TV series is based on a trilogy of movies: The Librarian: Quest for the Spear; The Librarian: Return to King Solomon's Mines; and The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice. The made-for-TV movies came out every couple years from 2004 through 2008, and featured Noah Wylie, Bob Newhart, and Jane Curtin. The spinoff TV series has Noah Wylie (sometimes), Rebecca Romijn, Christian Kane, Lindy Booth, John Kim, and John Larroquette, each with a special ability. The show is entertaining and lighthearted, featuring adventures in which the team attempts to recover artifacts that allow too much power into the world. The comic does a nice job with the various personalities of the team, and I thought it did a nice job of capturing the flavor of the show. Unfortunately, the second issue ended up being a couple months behind, and now I've read that the fourth issue will be the finale of this series. The cover price of The Librarians #1 is $3.99, while the current value is $4.
Cool Comics Done Dirt Cheap
Cool comics in my collection #548: Curse of the Molemen #1, March 1991.
When I pulled this issue out of the $20 long box of comics I bought nearly a year ago and saw the cover, I immediately knew that Curse of the Molemen wouldn't be to my liking. I knew next to nothing about Kitchen Sink Comix, let alone the fact that Charles Burns originally published this in 1986 as Big Baby. And another thing I found out is that Curse of the Molemen, the thin volume that it is, also came out in a hardcover edition. So why care about any of that when I knew immediately this comic wouldn't be for me? Maybe because I was dead wrong. Is the art different? You bet it is. Is the story bizarre? Undoubtedly. Did I hate it like I imagined I would? Absolutely not. On the contrary, I ended up loving Curse of the Molemen. It's a weird coming of age story that has stayed with me, and I can easily imagine reading this one again someday (which is something I rarely do, considering there are so many comics yet to read and not as much time left on this earth as I once had). I figured after I read it and blogged here about it, the comic would find its way to my “garage sale” comic box. Nope. I'm keeping this odd little gem! The cover price of Curse of the Molemen #1 is $4.95, while the current value is $12.
Cool Comics Classics
Cool comics in my collection #549: Hercules Unbound #1, November 1975.
When I saw that this Hercules Unbound issue #1 came out in 1975, I figured that Marvel's version of the Greek God must have come out first, since I know they appeared in 1965 in Marvel. But then, with a little research, I learned that Hercules first appeared in a DC comic way back in 1941. It was All Star Comics #8, the first appearance of Wonder Woman, and William Moulton Marston included Hercules in that issue. Now I read the digital version of All Star Comics #8 a few months back, but, unfortunately, I don't have an eidetic memory. Hercules has been used sparingly by DC over the years, and I would imagine that most people, when talking about comic books and Hercules, tend think of the Marvel version. This Cool Comics Classic was an interesting start of an adventure for the Greek strongman in an apocalyptic future, written by Gerry Conway, with art by J.L. Garcia and Wally Wood. It's truly amazing when you think about all the movies, books, TV shows, cartoons, and comic books that have included this mythological hero. The cover price of Hercules Unbound #1 is 25¢, while the current value is $16.
Recently Read Digital Comics
This week's last number one issue features the first family of Marvel, the Fantastic Four. Currently free via comiXology, if you've never read this issue, you probably should download it and experience it for yourself (unless you're fortunate enough to already have a copy, whether the original, in an anthology, or a reprint…but if you plan to run down to your local comic book shop and buy a first edition, don't say you haven't been warned…you may have to pay around $135,000 for a decent copy, if you actually find one). Stan Lee and Jack Kirby started the Marvel Universe as we know it today within these pages, but this probably isn't the Fantastic Four that you remember reading. It took a few issues to hit their stride in art and storytelling, no doubt. The characters certainly don't feel like themselves, but then again, every comic has a starting point. For me, Ben Grimm's (the Thing!) character and dialogue changed the most from these beginnings. When you read this issue, they seem like a different character. This is certainly a worthy digital comic to get and read. Anyone out there has an original? Please let us know about it in the comments section below!
Most of us were not raised in fairy tale households by perfect parents, and the formative messages we received as children may not have always been positive or healthy. The good news: the process of raising our own children can be profoundly restorative.
Every hour we spend with our babies and kids offers us opportunities to instill in them affirming messages, large and small. Whenever we are able to recognize and extricate ourselves from the less healthy patterns of our own childhoods and make the choice to do a bit better by our children, we take a baby step toward self-healing.
One of the most colossal challenges for parents and caregivers is accepting our children's negative feelings, especially when these feelings are directed at us. Many of us received the message early on, perhaps even in infancy, that expressing anger or hurt towards our parents was unacceptable. And yet, the feelings were there — we didn't conjure them up.
We also sensed (or perhaps it was quite blatant) that our parents sometimes had negative feelings about us, but for some reason these feelings weren't allowed to run both ways. We had no choice but to bury ours.
When Mary shared this insightful story about accepting their daughter's rejection, hurt and anger, I instantly knew I had to post it:
We had our second daughter about five months ago. To help our 2.5 year old adjust, we followed the advice we found on your blog and in Siblings without Rivalry. The transition seemed to go smoothly–there were issues with interrupted sleep, bedwetting, and tantrums–but they were pretty mild and resolved relatively quickly.
The biggest change was that M moved into a serious “papa phase”–she wanted to do everything with him. That seemed normal and, honestly, pragmatic — so we went with it. In those early days, it was very easy for me to care for the baby and for my husband to care for M. But as the months wore on and the baby was less dependent on me, M only seemed more attached to their papa and, even more than that, they seemed to not like me anymore. They often seemed very angry at me or distraught when I would care for them
At first, I thought it was a phase. I just did a lot of empathizing and tried my best to stay unruffled. But a few weeks ago it felt like I needed to address what was going on. I was uncertain about what to do, but I remembered your advice about the importance of letting your children be mad at you. Maybe my sweet M, who had seemed to adjust to their little sister so well, was mad at me for having another baby?
So, one afternoon I said to her: “You know when you say ‘Go away, Mama!'?—I still love you… And when you cry and say ‘I don't want you to do bedtime, I want papa!'?—I still love you. …And when you say ‘Don't look at me!'–I still love you.”
I went on, listing all the examples of them rejecting me that I could think of, always ending with the refrain “I still love you.”
M was quiet for a moment and then said, “I'm going to spray you with water so that you don't love me anymore.” I wasn't quite sure what this meant (I can't remember a time when they sprayed me with water), so I replied, “I'm going to use my magic towel to dry off…And I still love you”. And they went on, making up other ‘naughty' things that they would do–and I kept ‘undoing' their naughty thing and repeating that I still loved them
That conversation was so clearly a turning point for us. Later that day they came over to me and snuggled into my lap–I could have cried from relief. And they are way less angry and more affectionate than before.  They are still in a ‘papa phase' but definitely seems to have moved out of their ‘anti-mama' phase. Thank goodness.
I don't think I would have ever known how to have a conversation like that if it weren't for you and your blog. Thank you so much, Janet, for the work that you do.
For the next few days, M periodically wanted to have the conversation again. They would tell me that they were going to spray me with water, etc.–clearly looking for me to say that I would still love them She'd do a few rounds and then wander off to some other activity–it seemed like they were processing our original conversation.
But the best part was about a week later. After having our usual exchange, they said to me, “Now you say it”. They wanted me to tell them a naughty thing that I would do–and then they would reply “it's ok, mama–I still love you.” Not only was it super sweet, it was actually very emotional for me. While I used the same imaginary examples that they had used, I found myself thinking in my head about all the times I've been a less-than-perfect parent, and it just blew me away to have them telling me “it's ok, mama–I still love you” over and over again. I'm tearing up just thinking about it.
This parenting thing is an amazing, intense experience–and it's so clear that my girls are shaping me just as much (if not more!) than I'm shaping them! Such wise, intuitive souls in those tiny little bodies, eh?
Thanks again for everything you do. I can't get enough!
Mary

Michael Masser, a stockbroker-turned-composer whose lush melodies were recorded by Whitney Houston, Diana Ross, Roberta Flack and many other star vocalists, died on Thursday at their home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. They were 74.
The cause was complications of a stroke they had suffered three years ago, said Kurt Vitolo, their business manager.
As Mr. Masser biked to work as a broker in Midtown Manhattan in the 1960s, they would detour to the Juilliard School to putter on a piano. A self-taught pianist, they could not read music, but an inner muse was urging them to switch careers (he had earlier dropped out of law school) and pursue their true calling.
“I was working as a stockbroker in New York and had the seemingly perfect life,” Mr. Masser told The Chicago Sun-Times in 1988. That life included an office atop the Pan Am I Building, a nine-room apartment and a farm in Vermont. “But I was unhappy, and someone I knew convinced me to see a shrink. I walked in and told the doctor I wanted to write music.
IT has to be the most heart-warming image of the Blues' series winning 6-4 victory over the Maroons.

After the game there was a tremendous outpouring of emotion from all the Blues players and coach Laurie Daley.
“I've never wanted anything more in my life,” Robbie Farah said after the match.
“I think about it every day, the losses over the last few years hurt so bad. I'm sure my mum has a great big smile on their face watching down on us.
“We hung in there — it wasn't pretty but we kept banging on the door until we broke through.”
Blues coach Laurie Daley paid tribute to the almost 84,000 strong crowds.
“My heart is racing. the crowd got us home,” Daley said.

Maggie Haberman is one of the most dishonest journalists I have ever come across. Going back five years to when they were still with Politico, I have repeatedly exposed their lies and fraud.  They are currently with the New York Times, and thanks to WikiLeaks, we now have incontrovertible proof that Haberman is nothing more than a spin doctor for Hillary Clinton and their campaign.
Glenn Greenwald:
One January 2015 strategy document — designed to plant stories on Clinton's decision-making process about whether to run for president — singled out reporter Maggie Haberman, then of Politico, now covering the election for the New York Times, as a “friendly journalist” who has “teed up” stories for them in the past and “never disappointed” them. Nick Merrill, the campaign press secretary, produced the memo, according to the document metadata: That strategy document plotted how Clinton aides could induce Haberman to write a story on the thoroughness and profound introspection involved in Clinton's decision-making process. The following month, when they were at the Times, Haberman published two stories on Clinton's vetting process; in this instance, Haberman's stories were more sophisticated, nuanced, and even somewhat more critical than what the Clinton memo envisioned. But they nonetheless accomplished the goal Clinton campaign aides wanted to fulfill of casting the appearance of transparency on Clinton's vetting process in a way that made clear they were moving carefully but inexorably toward a presidential run.
For those who might not recall, at a public event, Haberman is the journalist who literally allowed the Clinton campaign to tie them up and restrict their movements with a rope.
Literally.
It's all rigged, folks, and it all needs to be torn to the ground.

WOODLAND TOWNSHIP, Mich. (WOOD) -- Around 200 students were evacuated from a Barry County school as strong winds began blowing off part of the building's roof Wednesday morning.
The incident happened around 10 a.m. at Lakewood Early Childhood Center on W. Broadway Street in Woodland Township, south of Lake Odessa.
The superintendent of Lakewood Public Schools says administrators were in a meeting when they started to notice the roof coming undone. They went into a tornado drill, as students were familiar with that kind of procedure, and quickly moved them to nearby Lakewood High School.

The superintendent says no one was injured. Parents are asked to pick up their children at the high school. If they are not able to do so, the kids will be released at the normal dismissal time and brought home on buses.
Parents tell 24 Hour News 8 they were very happy with how the situation was handled by the district.
Lakewood Early Childhood Center will be closed through Thursday as a result of the damage to the roof.
The strong winds are expected to intensify throughout the day. A High Wind Warning remains in effect for 19 counties in west and mid-Michigan, including Ionia, Kalamazoo, Allegan, Barry, Kent, Ottawa, Muskegon and Montcalm counties.
Thousands of people are without power throughout West Michigan. Storm Team 8 Chief Meteorologist Bill Steffen says this could be the windiest day of the year.

This interesting article by medieval historian Amanda Power traces our culture's relationship with the concept of mass surveillance from the medieval characterization of the Christian god and how piety was policed by the church:
What is all this but a fundamental trust in the experience of being watched? One must wonder about the subtle, unspoken fear of the consequences of refusing to participate in systems of surveillance, or even to critique them seriously. This would be to risk isolation. Those who have exposed the extent of surveillance are fugitives and exiles from our paradise. They have played the role of the cursed serpent of Eden: the purveyor of illicit knowledge who broke the harmony between watcher and watched. The rest of us contemplate the prospect of dissent with careful unease, feeling that our individual and collective security depends on compliance.
[...]
Eight centuries ago, in November 1215, Pope Innocent III presided over a Great Council of the Church in Rome known as the Fourth Lateran Council. It was attended by high-ranking members of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the monastic world, together with representatives of emperors, kings, and other secular leaders from throughout Christendom. Their decisions were promulgated through seventy-one constitutions. They began with a statement of what all Christians were required to believe, including specifics on the nature of God­by this time: "eternal and immeasurable, almighty, unchangeable, incomprehensible and ineffable" -- and the view that salvation could be found only through the Roman Catholic Church. Anyone who disagreed, according to the third constitution, was to be handed over to secular lords for punishment, stripped of their property, and cast out of society until they proved their orthodoxy, or else be executed if they did not. Anyone in authority would be punished if they did not seek out and expel such people from their lands; their subjects would be released from obedience and their territories handed over to true Catholics. There was nothing empty about this threat: the council occurred in the middle of the bitter Albigensian Crusade, during which heresy -- likened to a cancer in the body of Christendom -- was purportedly being cut out of Languedoc by the swords of the pious.
The Fourth Lateran Council was talking about crimes of thought, of dissent over matters of belief, matters not susceptible of proof. But whether individuals were heretics could not, in theory, be established without investigating the contents of their minds. To this end, the council decreed that bishops' representatives should inquire in every parish at least once a year to discover "if anyone knows of heretics there or of any persons who hold secret conventicles or who differ in their life and habits from the normal way of living of the faithful." These representatives were to follow these external indications of nonconformity into the recesses of the mind and establish their meaning in each case. Over the decades the role of the inquisitor was developed into an art and a science, and elaborate handbooks were produced. But in 1215 it was stated merely that individuals should be punished if "unable to clear themselves of the charge."
[...]
What is all this but a fundamental trust in the experience of being watched? Our trust is so strong that it seems to have found its own protective rationality, deeply rooted in Western consciousness. It's an addict's rationality, by which we're unable to refrain from making public a stream of intimate details of our lives and those of children too young to consent. One must wonder about the subtle, unspoken fear of the consequences of refusing to participate in systems of surveillance, or even to critique them seriously. This would be to risk isolation. It would be a trifle paranoid to reveal less -- a little eccentric, not quite rational.
I was in a supermarket recently searching for a brown mustard-and-conditioner in one. It was while I was reading the ingredient label on a jar of Gouldens Dry Scalp Formula that I looked to the children's book rack and there spied the title "My Little Golden Book About God."
Now as anyone knows, my interest in life's headiest metaphysical mystery has led me on some strange journeys; from the highest mountain peaks of Peru to snort crystalized alpaca urine with an Incan shaman to the sewers beneath Istanbul to read 900-year old grafitti scrawled by the heretical Saint Phoqallyall. Having found no theological resolution in these rarified encounters I have left the door open to the chance that sublime truth may be found where I least expect it.
So it was with genuine anticipation that I opened the book, curious to know what the people at Little Golden Books believed small children who stick Beeferoni up their noses could absorb about the Inscrutible One.
You cannot imagine my horror, however, when my eyes met pages filled with saccharine, pastel artwork depicting cold-eyed androids that were clearly not of our realm. In a Beautiful Mind moment of schizophrenic clarity I saw the book for what it was: not a gentle introduction to life's most profound curiosity, but a primer for the parasitic offspring of an invisible invasion!
For the safety of our race (if any still remain) I have translated this book in the hopes that a resistance may arise. Read the baby powder-scented Final Solution of our enemies from beyond, otherwise known as :
Welcome to a very thought provoking Devil's Take. Today's article targets one of the sore subjects of the Colts recent draft struggles, Mr. Donald Brown. Now, you may ask why would I do this? The answer is simple: He's better than he's given credit for.
via img4.allvoices.com
Donald Brown was the 27th pick of the 2009 NFL Draft. With Marvin Harrison being released, the consensus by most mock drafts had the Colts going after a WR or possibly a DT. Instead, the Colts drafted Brown, a speedster from UConn. This got a WTF moment from virtually the entire fan base. The ever-lovable Brad Wells hated the pick. Guys that were passed up by the Colts were Hakeen Nicks-WR, Kenny Britt-WR, and Ziggy Hood-DT. Ironically, this was only the 2nd worst decision by the Colts that night, as they would draft Fili Moala in the 2nd round ahead of guys like Shonn Greene-RB and Mike Wallace-WR.
In both instances, the Colts made questionable picks on players that made no sense. In Brown, they passed up a few DTs and WRs, and in Moala, they were essentially an afterthought. Now hindsight is always 20/20, but the players the Colts passed on were the bigger issue here. Greene has shown their mettle as a Jet, Wallace is the NFL's version of Flash, and Nicks just won a SB after pulling their version of Larry Fitzgerald's 2008 playoff run. Hood has proven themselves to be a decent NT in the Steelers lineup.
Bottom Line: Your #1 pick has to be a day one starter. There are a few exceptions to this, such as when the Packers took Aaron Rodgers to sit behind Brett Favre. In general however, you don't waste a first round pick on a position that's already filled with a capable starter.
So Donald Brown was drafted and no one liked it. The problem as I see it though, is that Brown is being hated on for Polian's screw up of a draft. Had Brown been drafted in any round but the first or maybe the second round, I seriously don't think anyone would be as down on them as they currently are.
So why would I defend Donald Brown? Simple: Talent. The kid can play football, and they do not get any love from the Colts fan base in general. This isn't about whether Donald Brown is the next Edgerrin James, it's about their ability to actually be a productive member of the Colts offense. Of that, I'm certain they can do.
Before I defend them however, I want to put a few things into perspective.
From 1999-2005, Colts running backs would average 1757 yards per season, roughly 110 yards per game. It was good for an average of 4 yards per carry. The Colts would generally rank around 16th in rushing. Only once did they finish below 19th, and that was when Edge went out with their knee injury. They would still finish with almost 1600 yards that year.
Since Edgerrin James was released by the Colts, the player picked to replace them would generate 100 yards rushing efforts 7 times in six seasons, and only once in the last 3 years. Their backup, Dominic Rhodes, would generate 3 100 yard rushing efforts and just miss on a 4th by 2 yards.
In 2006 and 2007, the Colts went with a running back by committee approach. In both seasons, the Colts would gain about 1700 yards and finish 18th in the league in rushing. They have not finished higher than 26th since.
Since the 2008 season to current, the Colts have gained an average of 1136 yards, averaging less than 75 yards rushing per game every season. They have finished in the 29th-32nd positions in 3 of the last 4 seasons.
So why did I point out all of this? The Colts rushing offense has been essentially atrocious for the last 4 years. Even the 2011 season, which was the best season in the last 4 years, still finishes 3rd worst in the last 13 seasons. The problem for the Colts rushing woes, starts with the offensive line, not the running back.
Starting in the 2007 season, All Pro LT Tarik Glenn retired abruptly, leaving the team scrambling for a replacement. We all know how that turned out. The following season, the Colts had to choose between Ryan Lilja or Jake Scott, and in my opinion, chose wrongly. The loss of Scott would start a downward spiral that would only accelerate an issue that was started by the loss of Glenn.
What the Colts would deal with for pretty much the last 4 years is a rolodex of has-beens and rookies that would make one of the better pass blocking O-lines in the league. As for running the ball, well, let's just say a group of high schoolers would have done as well. During this time, the Colts O-line would feature only 2 players that played generally every game (Diem/Saturday).
Donald Brown's 3 year stats are not impressive, hell, they're rather pathetic. However, given what he's had to work with in terms of blocking, I'm not really surprised. Every single one of us has seen game footage time and time again of a Colts RB being tackled, hit, or flat out mauled before they take a single step after being handed the ball. How can you succeed at running the ball when one of out two carries ends up with you being tackled for a loss before you have a chance to do anything?
Donald Brown has accounted for 2 of the 9-100 yard Colts rushing games since 2006.
Led the Colts in 2010/2011 for rushing. Accounts for 2 of the 3 longest rushing TD's in Colts history (tied for 1st)
Has improved their yards per carry every season, from 3.6 to 4.8 Has only 1 fumble in almost 350 attempts Was a highly touted college RB - was considered 1 of the top 3 backs in their draft
Brown is not a great back in the mold of guys like Sanders, Smith, or even Edge. Still, the thing I think most people are overlooking is that without decent blocking, none of the other backs for the Colts have done much better. Had the Colts offensive line blocked better, had the Polian drafted better, the running game would not have suffered.
The guy has shown flashes of promise, and last season, showed they were capable of playing a bigger role. Are they destined for greatness? In the NFL, it's possible. Remember, Marshall Faulk was just a 1000 yard runner here, but in St. Louis they were the World RB. Reggie Wayne was a dud their first year, barely average their next two, and then they broke out for a great 4th season.
Someone mentioned in another post that Brown only generated good stats in garbage time. In 2010, with a jaguar win, they would win the division. In the 1st quarter, opening possession, Brown goes for 49 yards in a single run. Later in that game, he'd score on a 43 yard TD. Both runs showcased their speed and their ability to hit the hole. The following week, in a division winning game, Brown would run for 28 yards on 6 carries against a tough Raiders defense. That's not even including their receiving capabilities. I don't even have to mention their 2011 runs, as they were far more impressive with an 80 yard icing in our first win of the season over the Titans.
Given a decent blocking line, which they had for parts of the 2011 season, Brown was far more effective. They have the potential and the talent, but the NFL eats both for breakfast. If they want to belong, he'll have to prove it.Keep in mind Brown is a speedster, designed to burn defenses. He's not going to play 30 snaps a game.
The Colts looked to shore up their line issues by adding several linemen both before, during, and after the draft. Adding in the addition of two quality rookie TE's and a well touted rookie QB, this could be the best offensive line the Colts have had in 7 seasons.
Before I end this, I just want to point out that there was a guy who pulled off a similar feat not to long ago... Michael Turner. And no, I'm not saying Brown is going to do it. I'm saying there's a previous example and that Brown has the potential to do it. Turner was primarily a KR and backup RB for the Chargers. They had one semi decent rushing season and signed with the Falcons. In an offense designed for their style of running, they had a monster break out year.
What I'm trying to say with this article is not that Brown is a great RB, but that they deserve a chance to have a clean slate with this new offense. They have shown flashes of greatness and if they can get the blocking that any RB in a Colts uniform deserves, they may very well show you a different guy.
As always, your thoughts and comments are appreciated. I'd however appreciate if the conversations about other things, including other members, stayed out of this. Thanks!

A day dedicated to this? There are infinitely better ways to spend your time. A day dedicated to this? There are infinitely better ways to spend your time.
Ninety percent of holidays are cooked up for the express purpose of accommodating the sale and purchase of commercial goods—, in other words: Said crap may be in the form of confections, jewelry, or sexy French maid costumes. Oddly, there don't seem to be any sexy French butler outfits…or maybe that's not odd at all, now that I've envisioned it. Sweaters emblazoned with reindeer also play prominently in the scheme of things.There was a point in time, however, when these holidays had a greater purpose. A time, for instance, when communities singled out the most attractive member from their midst and dragged the unfortunate soul naked, through the fields behind a white horse in order to ensure a bountiful spring crop. Or a time when everyone danced around a giant symbol of a phallus in celebration each Spring. Seriously, what did you think the May Pole was supposed to represent?Nowadays, however, we shop. Halloween, Valentines Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Christmas…it's hard to think of a holiday that doesn't involve buying something. Consider today—Black Friday. The name is ominous as hell—as if it were a special day when everyone in your town catches bubonic plague and staggers through the streets, glassy-eyed and festering with sores. Not too far off the mark, really, if you've ever seen people camped out in droves in front of shopping malls or shanking one another at Wal-Mart as they battle over the last PlayStation 4.Maybe it's just the 90-year-old Amish farmer in me, but this annual shopping orgy saddens me a bit, particularly since (in America, at least) it comes directly on the heels of a day dedicated to giving thanks for what we already have. One night you look across the dinner table and remind yourself that if you have a dinner table, a family, friends and something to eat, you are a lucky bastard. The very next morning, you find yourself hammer-fisting the nose of an assailant at the toy store as they try to wrestle the last inflatable Frosty the Snowman from your grasp. Theoretically, said Frosty the Snowman is somehow connected (as a symbol) to a guy born in the Middle East a couple thousand years ago who wasn't exactly down with owning a bunch of crap and/or punching their neighbor. Again, the finer points of these holiday rituals get lost in translation over the years.And so here I am, looking at Pinkbike, scrolling through the Black Friday deals. I'm not going to tell you that there's anything wrong with scoring a great deal on a XT 11-speed chain or a fork or what have you. If you can spend 5 minutes online and save some money, go for it. But I do hope, that youspend the entire day shopping.If you are lucky enough to have this day off, get outdoors. Go for a ride, feel that burn in your lungs and legs as you crest some impossible climb, check out the view from the top—the view from the top that most people will never see as they run around miles below you, battling over discount screwdrivers, bonus-packs of scented soaps and the 8-movie, Blu-ray Collector's Edition of thefranchise. Listen to the sounds of the forest around you. This is what actually matters—the ride—the actual process of pedaling here.All the shiny bullshit that we bolt onto our bikes the other 364 days of the year? That stuff has no greater worth than the experience of riding your bike. It's easy to confuse the two sometimes. Easy to get lulled into thinking that your bike isn't good enough already. Easy to think that a new fork or wheelset will make you a better rider. They won't. Not really. Riding will make you a better rider. Riding will make you stronger. Riding will make you happier. Spending your day shopping or worshipping at the altar of New-And-Improved? That shit just makes your wallet lighter.It's Black Friday. The best thing you could do today is drop everything and get out on your bike.I hope you do.
Many Grammy Awards ceremonies have come and gone. There were a lot of great moments . Kanye West shut things down with their two performances. And then, Kanye walked on stage right before Beck gave their acceptance speech for winning Best Album Of The Year...over Beyoncé. There were the political statements made by Common, Beyoncé and Pharrell to publicly support the Black Lives Matter movement by doing the Hands Up, Don't Shoot pose. And there was also Prince. But one thing that wasn't shown was Eminem winning Best Rap Album of the year.

Ten of the people in custody are Pakistani nationals, and one is British-born, Mr. Fahy said. None has been formally charged. Mr. Quick said in a statement: “I deeply regret the disruption caused to colleagues undertaking the operation.”

Meanwhile, pressure mounted on the Metropolitan Police Service to explain itself over the death of Ian Tomlinson, a 47-year-old newspaper vendor who suffered a fatal heart attack on April 1, during protests at the G20 meetings. The police originally said that they had had no contact with Mr. Tomlinson, who had been trying to get home and was not a protester, until they gave them emergency medical treatment and put them in an ambulance after they fell ill.
But a number of witnesses have since come forward to the news media to contradict what the police said, backing up their claims with photographs and video footage of the incident, in London's financial district. One piece of footage, whose existence was first reported in The Guardian newspaper, showed Mr. Tomlinson apparently being hit in the back from behind with a baton wielded by a police officer in riot gear.
That footage was taken by a 38-year-old investment manager from New York, who said they had attended the protests out of curiosity.
A freelance photographer, Anna Branthwaite, told the newspaper that they had witnessed Mr. Tomlinson being attacked with no provocation. They said that after rushing them and pushing them to the ground, a police officer “hit them twice with a baton” as they lay there and then “picked them up from the back, continued to walk or charge with him, and threw him.” They staggered down the street and then collapsed soon afterwards.
After a barrage of complaints and the emergence of the new evidence, the police department said late on Thursday that it had suspended the officer in question, whose face was obscured by a balaclava in the video and whose name has not been released. Officials are also holding an inquest into Mr. Tomlinson's death.
The Independent Police Complaint Commission, which originally said it would oversee a police investigation of the incident, changed its mind earlier this week, saying it would conduct the investigation itself. It also said that, armed with the new evidence, it had widened its inquiry to “investigate the alleged assault by police on Ian Tomlinson shortly before their death” and to “look into whether that contact may have contributed to their death.”

The incident undermines confidence in accountability at the police department, whose image has never fully recovered from the death, in 2005, of Jean Charles de Menezes. Mr. de Menezes, a Brazilian electrician, was fatally shot by the police on the subway during a period of high tension after a series of suicide bombs on London's transportation system killed 52 commuters. The police originally claimed that Mr. de Menezes had refused to stop when challenged, behaved strangely and led them on a chase through the subway system — all of which later proved false.

The police explained that they had confused Mr. de Menezes with a potential terrorist suspect who lived in the same apartment building as him.
Much of the photographic and video evidence gathered by the public in the Tomlinson case has been disseminated on the Web, as has the sensitive document inadvertently revealed by Mr. Quick, the now-former anti-terrorism official.

Mr. Quick's mistake caused consternation at the highest levels of government. Informed on Wednesday that The Evening Standard planned to publish a clear photograph of the document that night, the Ministry of Defense quickly issued a so-called D- notice, which restricts publication of sensitive documents relating to national security. But it was too late: the information had already gone out over the Internet. On Thursday, The Standard published its photograph, albeit with several key details — apparently the names of anti-terrorism officers involved in the operation — blacked out. Other newspapers posted the photograph on their Web sites. http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/apr/09/bob-quick-terror-raids-leak#zoomed-picture
Boris Johnson , mayor of London and chairperson of the Metropolitan Police Authority, said that the disclosure of the memo had been “extremely unfortunate.”
They added: “an operation that was very, very sensitive and important to counterterrorism, for rounding up terrorists, had been potentially compromised and there was a real difficulty there.” They said that John Yates, another assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan Police Department, would replace Mr. Quick as its head of counter-terrorism.

Jill Stein isn't going to let Donald Trump win the battle to utter the most noxious and irresponsible things during this news cycle without a fight:
Democrats are now accusing Russia of manipulating our presidential election… exactly what DNC was caught doing. #DNCleak
One problem with political rhetoric is that it naturally tends to be hyperbolic. People claim electing somebody as president would be a genuine catastrophe for the country, when in fact that's not really very likely, given political inertia, institutional checks and balances, informal norms of governance and campaigning, and so forth.
Then Donald Trump comes along, i.e., a candidate who really would be a genuine catastrophe for the country, because he's an utterly unqualified narcissistic sociopath who is completely unconstrained by ordinary formal or informal institutions and norms. And pointing this out (over and over again) rings rather hollow, because after all people are always making hyperbolic claims of this sort. But in this case it's not hyperbole. If anything it's an understatement, because it's both hard to grasp and hard to express just how crazy and dangerous it would be to elect Trump president of the United States.
Anybody who does anything to help Trump get elected, which is what Jill Stein is working to do every day, is every bit as culpable in regard to increasing the existential danger the nation now faces as Trump's most enthusiastic supporters. That's the practical and moral reality of the situation. Such people should be treated with the contempt they deserve, and what they did shouldn't be forgotten once the present danger passes, assuming it does.
Two members of Congress have introduced a bill that would ban the practice of requiring job applicants, employees or students to provide their social networking information.
The Social Networking Online Protection Act, authored by Congressman Eliot Engel of New York and sponsored by Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, is in response to a growing number of reports of employers demanding their employees' Facebook passwords as a condition of employment.
The bill seeks to block any employer from requiring current or potential employees to turn over login credentials to any person; online content can not be used as a condition of employment to "discriminate or deny employment to individuals, nor punish them for refusing to volunteer the information." The bill would apply the same prohibitions to colleges, universities, and K-12 schools. Similar legislation being written by Senators Richard Blumenthal (Connecticut) and Chuck Schumer (New York), is expected to be introduced in the Senate later this year.
Facebook has already threatened legal action against organizations who require employees to reveal their Facebook passwords as policy. And the practice is a violation of existing law: the Electronic Communications Protection Act of 1986, which applies to all data stored electronically. But in testimony before Congress earlier this year, the Department of Justice indicated that there would be no prosecution of employers for enforcement of such polices.
Several states have taken up legislation to block the practice as well, following reports of the spread of the practice by the Associated Press and Los Angeles Times. Maryland was the first state to pass legislation banning employers from requiring employees to provide access to their social media; a second bill, which would have banned universities from requiring current and prospective students to provide their social network passwords, failed to pass. Illinois has also voted to protect job applicants from password demands from potential employers.
The Maryland law was driven largely by the controversy over a state agency's own Facebook intrusions: in January of 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint with Maryland's Department of Public Safety on behalf of Robert Collins, a Maryland Department of Corrections officer who was ordered to turn over their Facebook login information during recertification for their position. Collins recounted the case in this ACLU video from February of 2011:
The week after I gave birth to my son, my dear friend Becky brought us dinner for when we came home from the hospital. One of the components was a delicious orzo based pasta salad from Epicurious.com called Orzo with Everything.
Since they introduced me to it almost five years ago (Thanks Becky!), I've made it many times and it's always a hit.
I've been thinking about trying a version using lightly cooked “al dente” cauliflower to stand in for the orzo for awhile now. The flavors of the salad are Mediterranean based (Balsamic vinegar, fresh basil, parmesan cheese, sundried tomatoes, kalamata olives, etc…), and I hoped that they would be robust enough to mask any cauliflower flavor.
The original recipe calls for radicchio, which has a nice bite to it, but I subbed in red cabbage for mine because I couldn't find any in my local grocery store. The cabbage worked, but if you can find the radicchio I recommend it!
The original recipe also calls for toasted pine nuts which are a really tasty addition. I omitted them from my version simply because they are expensive and hard to find depending on where you live, and I wanted to see if it would still taste good without them. It does, but if you have them, toast some up and toss them in because they are awesome.
Lastly, I added chopped artichoke hearts,which added a nice flavor and texture. I can't say it's as good as the original – only because it's hard to beat the chewiness and comfort food feel of the pasta, but the cauliflower worked really well as a substitute.

This is a truly delicious, flavor-packed side dish – and it's hearty enough (especially with the pine nuts) to eat on it's own for a light lunch. Hope you guys like it!
“Anti” Pasta Cauliflower Salad – Low Carb and Gluten Free ★★★★★ 5 from 9 reviews Author: Mellissa Sevigny
Yield: (8) 1/2 cup servings
Category: Salad
Cuisine: Pasta salad Ingredients 2 cups of raw cauliflower, chopped
1/2 cup radicchio, chopped
1/2 cup artichoke hearts, chopped
1/3 cup fresh basil, chopped
1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan
3 Tbsp sundried tomatoes, chopped
3 Tbsp kalamata olives, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
3 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
3 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
salt and pepper to taste Instructions First, cook your finely chopped cauliflower in the microwave for five minutes. Don't add any liquid or seasoning to it, just spread it on a microwave safe dish and zap it. Let the cauliflower cool while you prep the other ingredients. Combine the radicchio, artichoke hearts, basil, parmesan, sundried tomatoes, olives, and garlic in a medium bowl. In a smaller bowl, whisk together the olive oil and vinegar, then pour it over the salad. Toss to combine, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Can be served room temperature or chilled. Notes Use a good quality extra virgin olive oil to get the best results. The artichoke hearts should be packed in water, not marinated in oil and seasonings. Also, the sundried tomatoes I used were packed in oil so they were nice and soft – if you use the dehydrated ones, reconstitute in some warm water for 20 minutes before using them. Finally, use a shredded parmesan or asiago, not the granular grated stuff you get in the can. If you use the best quality ingredients you can get for this salad it will make a huge difference in the flavor. Nutrition Calories: 102

SUNNYVALE, Calif., Aug. 3 (UPI) -- A secure satellite communications system for the U.S. military and allies in the time of global crisis is now live, Lockheed Martin reports.
The system -- it connects the military forces of the United States, Canada, the Netherlands and Britain -- is the Advanced Extremely High Frequency, or AEHF, satellite network.
With attaining initial operational capability, all operators with access can begin using the system for routine sensitive communication and critical operations.
"When a commander issues orders, they need to know their troops will get the information quickly and without fear of interruption or interception," said Mark C. Calassa, vice president of Protected Communication Systems and AEHF program manager for Lockheed Martin. "Compared to anything else on orbit, AEHF gives an unmatched level of protection and has five times the speed of legacy protected communication systems.
"With AEHF reaching IOC, the system's international partners can more quickly and safely command some of the world's most capable militaries to address global instability as it arises."
Lockheed Martin said that while there are many secure satellite communication systems serving both the civil and military sectors and their connection to each other, AEHF AEHF is the only one that protects against the full spectrum of threats, including jamming, eavesdropping and cber-attacks.
Its high data transfer rates can securely send images, video and other mission data to compatible aircraft, ships and maneuver forces. Faster than the Milstar system, it also will provide real-time battlefield maps and targeting data for tactical operations.
Initial operational capability status comes after six months of testing by the U.S. Air Force.
The House Intelligence Committee was negotiating with James Comey for access to classified documents dealing with Russia's meddling in last year's presidential election when they were fired as FBI director, a committee member has told McClatchy.
Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat, said Wednesday that it was unclear to them whether Comey's dismissal will further delay the House committee's access to the documents.
But the disruption of talks about access to classified materials was one of the effects of Comey's abrupt dismissal on Congress' probes into the possible connections between the Russian interference in the U.S. election and Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The congressional probes, which have few resources of their own, are highly dependent on the FBI for assistance.
“We were negotiating with them for access to some intelligence,” Speier said. “I worry that we'll be put on the back burner. It could very well slow down the investigation.”
At the very least, they noted that the search for a new director likely would take months and that until then the committee will be turning to a caretaker for evidence. They called Comey's firing “tantamount to tampering with evidence.”
The impact of Comey's firing on the congressional investigations is one of the unpredictable aspects of Trump's decision Tuesday to dismiss the FBI director, who was four years into a 10-year term when they were sacked.
There are at least eight congressional investigations into Russian interference in the election; in addition to the House Intelligence Committee, investigating committees include the Senate Intelligence Committee, the House Government Oversight Committee, a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Democrats on the Senate Homeland.
Even so, members of Congress pledged Wednesday to continue their work, though they worried how the dismissal might delay probes already plagued by too few resources.
This is a White House that is deeply, deeply worried about the Russia investigation. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.
As if to make the point, the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday issued its first subpoena in more than 15 years, demanding that Trump's former national security adviser, retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, deliver documents “relevant to the committee's investigation” that he'd refused to surrender voluntarily last month.
It was the first subpoena the committee had issued since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.
“Multiple federal entities are currently and independently conducting Russia investigations, working together to uncover all of the facts,” said Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. “I have no reason to believe they won't. I also do not believe that the director's dismissal will affect how the FBI carries out its investigations.”
According to news reports, a federal grand jury in Virginia also has issued subpoenas for documents from Flynn's business associates, though those subpoenas were issued before Comey's firing.

Flynn has become the center of the investigations, with former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testifying this week that they met twice with White House counsel Donald McGahn in late January to warn the Trump administration that Flynn was lying about their contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn was fired 18 days later, after Yates' meeting with McGahn was reported by the Washington Post.
Yates also was supposed to testify before the House Intelligence Committee March 28, but that hearing was canceled by the committee's chairperson, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., days after Comey stunned the nation by announcing that a probe had been opened into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia since last July. Them appearance has yet to be rescheduled.
Whether Comey's firing will knock those plans off kilter remains to be seen. Comey had been scheduled to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, but their position will now be taken by the FBI's new acting director, Andrew McCabe.
But Comey is expected to make a new appearance before the panel, perhaps as soon as Tuesday, and members of Congress and aides tried to convey that little will change in their investigations.
“This is a White House that is deeply, deeply worried about the Russia investigation,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, the Virginia Democrat who was Hillary Clinton's running mate last year. “Certainly, there's an effort to obstruct the investigation.”
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., a member of their chamber's Judiciary Committee, said they expected their committee to try to determine what precisely happened before President Donald Trump fired Comey after first requesting a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
“We need to know where this move to fire Comey began,” Whitehouse said.
Also likely to come up in congressional probes is whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions had violated their pledge to remain aloof from the Russia probes by joining Rosenstein in an Oval Office meeting with Trump on Monday to discuss Comey's future.
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that they spent Tuesday night re-examining the letter Sessions had signed when they removed themselves from the Russia investigation. They said they believed Sessions had violated the intent of the letter.
They called for Comey to appear soon before the intelligence committee in a public session.
Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said they also believed Sessions had violated their pledge to stay out of the Russia probe.
“An attorney general who has recused themselves from an investigation has now recommended that the head of that investigation be removed,” they said in an email.

Last month, well respected business magazine, Forbes, published an answer from the website Quora, leading them to make the claim that ‘plant-based diets are among the healthiest out there'. Cher Pastore responded to a question on Quora, a website that aims to better inform people by contributions from other members of the Quora community, and suggested that a plant-based diet was best for health. Pastore is the owner of Cher Nutrition, a New York based company who employs registered dieticians and nutritionists to give nutrition advice.
Pastore claims that ‘studies have shown… a low-fat, plant-derived diet' is good for weight loss, insulin sensitivity, cholesterol reduction and diabetes. They add, 'The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) both now recommend well-planned, plant-based (vegetarian and vegan) nutrition for people with diabetes.'
Pastore has witnessed the results a plant-based diet can have on the clients that they advise, they claim that they are ‘staggering'. Adopting a plant-based diet saw their client's blood sugar drop significantly in ‘the least amount of time as opposed to those on other diets'. Additionally, the clients that switched from a ‘highly processed diet including meat…reported that they didn't feel hungry, had more energy, were able to think more clearly and lost weight more easily.'
Pastore also says that a whole foods plant-based diet ‘maximix[es] your nutrient intake,' as well as helping to lower the risk of heart disease, and they even claim it can prevent or slow certain types of cancer.
Although many people advocate for a plant-based diet to promote good health, some people remain cautious due to the fact that a lot of information is based off of personal anecdotal evidence. However, Pastore is not only train in nutrition, but they have scientific evidence such as blood sugar levels, and cholesterol levels to back up their claims.
Large publications such as Forbes choosing to publish information like this shows a rising awareness and understanding of the nutritional benefits of a plant-based diet.

Château de Chenonceau, located near the small village of Chenonceaux in France, is one of the best-known chateau of the Loire valley. The chateau is special in part for being constructed over the River Cher, which on fair days is so calm and placid that it appears as a lake. The chateau's other specialty is that it was built, maintained, protected, loved and fought for by an almost uninterrupted succession of women spanning four centuries. Château de Chenonceau is therefore popularly known as “the ladies' chateau.”

The chateau was built in the early 16th century by Thomas Bohier, Chamberlain to King Charles VIII of France, who purchased the site and demolished the old castle and a fortified mill that stood there to make way for the chateau. Thomas' wife, Katherine Briçonnet, supervised most of the construction. But after Thomas died, the castle was seized by King Francis I for unpaid debts. King Frances I died shortly after acquiring Château de Chenonceau, so the castle was passed on to their son Henry II.
Henry II, in turn gifted the chateau to their mistress, Diane de Poitiers, who became fervently attached to it. A woman of taste and luxury, they embellished the chateau, added the formal gardens and built a bridge across the River Cher. After Henry II was killed in tragic jousting accident in 1559, their widow Catherine de' Medici seized the opportunity and forced Diane out of the chateau.
Catherine spent a fortune renovating and expanding Château de Chenonceau. They added the famous Italian Renaissance style two-storey gallery that tops the bridge built by Diane.
On Catherine's death in 1589 the chateau went to their daughter-in-law, Louise de Lorraine-Vaudémont, wife of King Henry III. When Henry III was assassinated the same year, Louise fell into a state of depression. In their grief, Lousie transformed Chenonceau into a tomb, painting their bedchamber black and they took to roaming the halls dressed in mourning clothes. Eventually, Louise left the chateau to their niece, then only six years old but already betrothed to the four-year-old son of Henri IV and their mistress, and the future Duke of Vendôme. For the next hundred years, the chateau fell into decay as the Bourbons had little interest in the chateau.
In 1733 the estate was acquired by a wealthy squire named Claude Dupin. Their wife, Louise Dupin, founded a literary salon at Chenonceau attracting brilliant minds of the era such as Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Fontenelle, the naturalist Buffon, and the playwright Marivaux. When the French Revolution broke out and rioters threatened to destroy Chenonceau as a symbol of royal excess, Louise Dupin saved the chateau by reminding the mob that it was the only bridge across the river for many miles.
The last woman to leave their mark on the chateau was Marguerite Pelouze, a rich heiress, who purchased the château in 1864 and began restoring it. They almost completely renewed the interior and removed several of Catherine de' Medici's additions. Unfortunately, Marguerite squandered so much money in restoration and on their lavish lifestyle that they became broke and had to sell the chateau.
The chateau's current owner, Henri Menier,acquired it in 1913 and still own it to this day.

If you follow John Mayer‘s career, which you should, you'd know that there has been a lot of time in between their releases – three years to be exact. For someone who has been so broadly popular you might as well count that in dog years, since the spotlight is a volatile, ever-changing enigma of bullshit. Mayer has maintained themselves as a constant, widespread name for as long as I can remember, but after Battle Studies they sort of fell off the map. Whether or not this time was a cause or effect for their new album matters to me very little, because it was time well spent. Now they return, triumphantly, with Born and Raised.
Let's first establish this: B&R is not a record for fans of John Mayer on the radio, as many people are. I have nothing against that and I would venture to say neither does he, but this is a soulful expansion of Mayer's musicianship that veers in a direction not previously taken, something that might seem very strange to a fair-weather fan. We are not void of the Mayer who has made so many infectious songs, but they deliver a product laced with many different influences we haven't heard from them before. They even mention Neil Young in the lead-off track “Queen of California” and you'll hear some After the Gold Rush running like a quaint little creek throughout B&R. One thing that will enrage true Mayer fans – and I have already heard it in response to “Shadow Days” – is that they have gone “too country.” Because this record is not jam-packed with chart-crafted pop-fusion songs, which Mayer admits to making and enjoying, people have chosen to write them off already.
Mayer lets their blues roots shine brighter than on any of their previous efforts, at least in the songs they make appearances in. The thing is, you hear folk (not country, god damn it.), blues, even tinges of their signature pop creations and that is a great thing this time around. I said recently that Battle Studies was a little scatter-brained, but Born and Raised is putting it to shame in that regard. But there seems to be a method to the madness and it is maintained in such a positive way. Mayer traverses the musical spectrum, crosses lines and brings it all home before the end.
I implore all listeners to give this album MULTIPLE chances, because it WILL grow on you. Even I was guilty of a degree of shock when hearing this record. It was a good shock though; if you follow my music tastes you will know I am a folk enthusiast, but there was still a moment when I could not quite make sense of it. One thing that did not bode well with me though, aside from the title track and “Shadow Days,” is that there is nothing that had my thumb circling the repeat button. However, after a few listens I realized this album is a package deal and completely embraced it in its entirety, rather than a song-by-song basis.
A unique quality about B&R is the combination of traditional Mayer-style lyrics and a new folk-esque style that seems like the storytelling of a specific moment, recorded even as the events unfold, that they gave us a taste of with “Assassin” on Battle Studies. Songs like “Queen of California,” “Walt Grace's Submarine Test 1967” and “Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey” stand out brilliantly in contrast with the Mayer who initially earned themselves our ears, although the latter is not absent by any means here on Born and Raised.
This is a John Mayer record for those who respect and appreciate what they do and understand a musician's need to change and evolve. We won't ever get Heavier Things or Continuum again, but we got Born and Raised. While it is by no means perfect, I respect the shit out of Mayer for making it and I hold it in high esteem. They may lose a few fair-weather fans with this one, but they will solidify themselves some lifelong faithfuls just as easily. As a follow-up to Battle Studies, I couldn't have pictured it any better.
Back when @BarackObama was Barack Obama. (LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP/Getty Images)
New Yorker Kam Brock was institutionalized in a mental hospital for eight days last year in a series of events that is perhaps a high-water mark in this The-Way-We-Live-Now-ness. At the core of Brock's lawsuit against the city: Whether or not the president follows them on Twitter.
Last September, Brock's BMW was impounded by the NYPD because they thought they were high on marijuana, according to the New York Daily News. When they became emotional at the police station, they say they were sedated and taken to Harlem Hospital for more than a week. They thought they might be delusional, in part because they said that President Obama was one of their Twitter followers.
"I told (the doctor) Obama follows me on Twitter to show them the type of person I am," Brock said, according to the Daily News. "I'm a good person, a positive person. Obama follows positive people!" The hospital's objectives prior to their release? "Patient will verbalize the importance of education for employment and will state that Obama is not following them on Twitter."
The story caught on in part because the Twitter account @BarackObama does follow Brock. The account follows 644,000 people on Twitter, in fact -- not all of whom, it's safe to say, have been personally vetted by the President of the United States. Is @Wickedgrrl a positive person? Quite possibly, name notwithstanding. But it suggests that Obama's filtering might have gaps.
But now the kicker -- a kicker that I admit I am personally a bit obsessed with. Barack Obama actually doesn't follow Brock on Twitter.
You see, @BarackObama isn't Barack Obama. It's Organizing For Action, the non-profit formed out of the remains of Obama's 2012 campaign. OFA leases the Twitter account from the president's campaign (which still exists as a legal entity). The organization uses the account clearly so that people will make the same assumption that Brock did, that it's the voice of Barack Obama. And when a Barack Obama supporter sees a tweet from @BarackObama asking them to give money to OFA, they're a lot more likely to do so than if they see a tweet from @OFA, the organization's official (and much-less-followed) account.
In fact, there's no way in which Obama could follow Brock on Twitter for the simple fact that Obama doesn't use Twitter. In their interview with the Huffington Post, Obama admitted that he's not on Twitter and then critiqued the vibe of the social media tool as "everything's a crisis, everything is terrible, everything is doomsday, everything is -- if it doesn't get solved tomorrow, you know, your presidency is going off the rails."
From a psychological standpoint, the distinction is unimportant. What's important is the hospital's overall analysis of Brock's mental state and that Brock's claim about being followed by @BarackObama was easily checkable but left unchecked. (We somehow doubt that the doctors at Harlem Hospital were drawing a fine line on the ownership of the account.)
From a political standpoint, though, it's fascinating. On a medium that's meant to represent a personal voice, does the genesis of that voice matter? Everyone loves former Michigan representative John Dingell's Twitter account, even though it often/usually isn't Dingell writing the tweets. What's the line between a personal account and an account that represents a campaign under the face of a personality? Or, what's more, a popular name that's leased out to an unaffiliated entity? Twitter gives public figures the ability to roll out perfect robotic versions of themselves, with people often being unable to differentiate between the Potemkin politician and the real thing.
But what do I know: @BarackObama doesn't even follow me on Twitter -- and neither does the president.
HAIFA, Israel — After more than two years of extensive restoration work, Haifa's golden-domed Baha'i Shrine has been unveiled, to the delight of visitors, pilgrims and residents of the city.
Early this morning, the final set of covers was removed from the Shrine's dome, revealing almost 12,000 new, gilded tiles, crowning the immaculately restored building on Mount Carmel.
"Today the 'Queen of Carmel', concealed from the gaze of the public for the larger part of the project, is unveiled and resplendent again..." announced the Universal House of Justice, after visiting the Shrine to offer prayers of thanksgiving.
Haifa's Mayor, Advocate Yona Yahav, later joined civic dignitaries and guests at a celebratory reception, held in the city's historic German Templar colony with its spectacular view of the Shrine and its terraced gardens.
"I am the first Mayor of Haifa who was actually born here," said Mr. Yahav. "In 1954, I witnessed the Shrine's superstructure being built. To see these renovations is very touching. They are of the utmost importance."
The Shrine of the Bab and its gardens are renowned the world over for their beauty and tranquillity. In 2008, it was inscribed – along with the Shrine of Baha'u'llah near Acre – as a site of "outstanding universal value" on the UNESCO World Heritage list. Last year alone some 760,000 tourists and 7,500 Baha'i pilgrims and visitors were welcomed here.
"The Shrine affects the whole set up of Haifa," said Mayor Yahav. "It is the core and symbol of this tolerant and multi-cultural city."
Two years ahead of schedule
In a message sent to the worldwide Baha'i community, the Universal House of Justice recounted how the "restoration of this majestic edifice was preceded by three years of preparations, entailing comprehensive studies to assess its condition, to analyse the impact of the environment upon it, and to determine approaches and materials for the renovation that would remain faithful to the original design as well as withstand the rigours of time."
More than 50 years of exposure to Haifa's climate and environmental conditions had taken their toll on the superstructure's stonework and dome when work began in 2008.
Saeid Samadi, project architect and manager, says experts estimated such a restoration would normally take five to six years. "We originally targeted April 2013 for its completion. It is a tribute to the total dedication and unity of everyone involved that the project has been completed in less than three years.
"The team truly appreciated the importance of the place and never forgot where they were working," says Mr. Samadi. "We were all inspired by the Baha'i principle that everything should be created to the highest state of perfection."
The project required the restoration and conservation of the interior and exterior of the original 1909 structure, as well as measures to strengthen the Shrine against seismic forces. An entirely new retrofit design – combining concrete, steel and carbon fibre wrap technology – was needed for the whole building, from its foundation and original masonry to its octagon, drum and dome. More than 120 rock anchors were fixed into the mountain behind newly fortified retaining walls.
"Some 80,000 man-hours were spent on significantly improving the Shrine's resistance to earthquakes" says Mr. Samadi. "but it is all concealed from view and does not affect the beauty and grandeur of the original architecture at all."
Restoring the stone and dome
Progress on the Shrine restoration was significantly helped along by an earlier two-year project on the nearby International Baha'i Archives building, says Mr. Samadi.
"We studied the Shrine and researched materials and techniques while still working on the Archives. That experience generated a lot of momentum. We knew the experts; we perfected the skills and techniques. With the Shrine, we did not finish one job before starting another. We were working on the structure, carrying out the stone restoration, doing many things at the same time."
More than 50,000 man-hours were spent on the stonework by the staff of the restoration office and volunteers - including many young people - from Australia, Canada, China, Ecuador, Germany, India, Kenya, Mongolia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Vanuatu, all trained by expert conservators. Every square centimetre of the building's exterior was checked and restored.
"For the original superstructure, Carrara marble was wanted but it was not easy to come by after the Second World War," says Mr. Samadi. "The only stone available was Chiampo marble. When we were researching to see how it has been restored in Europe, we discovered that – because of its nature – it has not been used anywhere else for exterior cladding, just for flooring. There was no background knowledge on how to do it."
New techniques also had to be developed to replace the Shrine's golden tiles. For two years, efforts were made to see if the badly eroded old tiles could be restored. "We checked the condition of every single tile but, as a result of their exposure to the elements, many were broken beyond repair and the rest could not be restored back to their original beauty," says Mr. Samadi.
After several years of research, a Portuguese firm was contracted to produce new tiles in more than 120 different shapes and sizes. Leading-edge technology was employed to manufacture each tile from pure porcelain, covered with layers of glazing and gold solution, and finished with a highly durable final coating.
"The company had never done anything like this before," says Mr. Samadi. "They are renowned for museum-quality porcelain artefacts. But the result is perfect. Not only are the tiles beautiful, they are five to six times more abrasion-resistant than the originals."
An expert mason and tile setter from New Zealand – Bruce Hancock – was flown in to supervise the work to be carried out by the staff of the restoration office. "We had to learn as we went," Mr. Hancock says. "Ordinarily, you lay tiles but they are usually square. These tiles are all shapes and sizes. Every row is curved.
"Initially, I was concerned how we were going to create that curve, but these tiles were designed and detailed in such a way that they just did it themselves. They seemed to have a life of their own. If we did the right thing – getting the two corners right – they did the right thing. It was just amazing."
The dome of the Shrine of the Bab "now shines in the plenitude of its splendour," observed the Universal House of Justice in its message.
"This is really something unique," Haifa's Mayor Yona Yahav told guests celebrating the completion of the restoration project, "in this city, in Israel - in fact in the world."
It's no secret that Samsung has put in a lot of time and resources into flexible displays and the company's intentions go far beyond the Gear S and the Galaxy S6 edge. Often we have come across patents that show what Samsung has envisaged for the future vis-a-vis flexible displays and today is one of those days. The company has been awarded a patent for a flexible smartphone which can be worn on your wrist, this would effectively allow the device to double as a smartwatch. Even though the company already makes smartwatches that are capable of making calls, this technology would put a full fledged smartphone on your wrist.
The patent details that a flexible OLED display will be attached to several segments which are designed to be rotatable. This design feature of the segments will allow the user to curl the device into a bracelet shape, which can then be worn on the wrist, or extend it into a flat shape so that it looks like any other smartphone. However since this technology exists only in the patent at this point in time it can't be said for sure if and when Samsung intends to bring it to market. It might take a few years or it might not be released at all, that's the thing with patented technologies, you never really know what's going to happen.

Show us your rig Each week on Show Us Your Rig, we feature PC gaming's best and brightest as they show us the systems they use to work and play.
Adrianne Curry, best known for winning season one of the reality TV show America's Next Top Model and now a streamer on Twitch.tv, has been a die hard PC Gamer for a long time. Using a powerful tower with two GTX 980s, Adrianne has a taste for the classics. They were kind enough to take some time and tell us about their rig, the questionable (and, frankly, concerning) wiring in their house, and how they are absurdly good at King's Quest V.
What's in your PC?
Case: MainGear Shift tower
Processor: Intel Core i7-4790 3.6GHz
Video cards: Two Nvidia GTX 980 Cards
Storage: 1 TB Solid State Drive
Liquid cooled - silent running
Monitors: Two 27in Acer monitors
Headphones: Logitech G35
Webcam: Logitech 930e
Outside of the accumulated tears of small children (liquid cooled), MainGear built me a new Shift with two sexy GTX 980s. They get major use when I play Sierra and LucasArts games circa 80s/90s. I'm surprised they haven't melted from the strain.
Rorschach Symbol
What's the most interesting/unique part of your setup?
I have the Rorschach symbol (The Watchmen) etched into the glass on my tower. However, the fact that I'm running my monster on electrical wiring in my historic home that is almost 100 years old is more interesting. I have a glass fuse box! When I power my baby up, my entire house dims. Do NOT run the microwave and toaster oven at the same time. However, I managed to have a sick internet connection, so I don't mind gaming by candlelight.
What's always within arm's reach on your desk?
Two things: My cellphone, so I can stack more internet on top of my internet....and my two cats, fighting for the captain's chair in my lap.
What are you playing right now?
A lot of World of Warcraft and Hearthstone. I'm a noob at Hearthstone, but I'm addicted. I've been a guild master on Warcraft for about 6 years now. Talk about drama!
What's your favorite game and why?
This is hard. So hard. I'd have to say King's Quest V. It was the first video game I ever became obsessed with. I loved all the old point and click games. I spent an entire summer trying to defeat the evil wizard Mordac when I was 8. I'm like a King Graham "rain man". I remember every single thing about the quests and items. I just recently ran it out of memory for the first time after 24 years and got a perfect 260 of 260 highscore.
EDITOR'S NOTE: As fans of Show Us Your Rig may know, until this point we've primarily featured PC game developers. Recently (as you can see from this week) I've been considering expanding out to popular streamers, e-sports athletes, and other personalities with a passion for PC gaming. Is this something you'd like to see more of? Do you hate the idea? Do you have a specific person or studio you'd like to see featured? Let me know in the comments or send me an e-mail at Tom@pcgamer.com.
Kim Jong-un is hoping the multimillion-dollar Masik Pass will boost tourism and show North Korea is as civilised as the west
The secretary general of North Korea's ski association views the sprawling alpine landscape before them with unabashed pride. Facing a strong, cold wind, they point to a dip in the rugged, tree-covered mountains and says the sunrise is a sight of unmatched beauty, worthy of the nation's supreme leader, Kim Jong-un.
This is the Masik Pass ski resort, North Korea's latest megaproject and the product of 10 months of furious labour intended to show that the country, so often derided for its poverty and isolation, is as civilised and culturally advanced as any other.
The complex of ski runs, resort chalets and sleigh rides will open formally on Thursday, though late last month the main hotels appeared to be little more than shells, potholes filled the access roads and foundations were still being dug for secondary buildings.
Who will ski here? Perhaps Kim Jong-un, who reportedly enjoyed the sport as a teenager studying in Switzerland. By the estimate of the ski official, Kim Tae-yong, there are only about 5,500 North Korean skiers in this country of 24 million – a skiing population of 0.02%.
Even so, as they sweep their hand over the scene, the official displays no doubt that what their country really needs right now is a multimillion-dollar ski resort in the secluded depths of North Korea's east coast. Kim bristles at the suggestion Masik will be a playground for the nation's elite and a trickle of eccentric tourists. This, they say, is their country at work. It is proof of the great love of the great leader.
The narrow road to Masik Pass winds through rugged mountain terrain, small farming hamlets and lush foliage – beauty untouched by modern development. As the road turns to dirt, brightly coloured propaganda posters and ubiquitous slogans in blood-red letters come into view, followed by rows of barracks for workers – drab, hastily built shacks of stone carved out of the slopes along a clear flowing river.
Beyond that, hundreds, if not thousands, of soldier-builders in olive uniforms – "shock brigades" assigned to especially urgent and difficult tasks – scour the slopes. Other workers pound at the stone with hammers. Young women march with shovels over their shoulders. Minivans equipped with loudspeakers blast patriotic music into the crisp mountain air.
Masik's ski runs – at the moment long stretches of bright-brown dirt dotted with rocks, weeds and patches of stubborn grass – cut their way through the trees to converge at the hotel construction site below. Though two simple lifts have been installed, neither was working during a recent visit by journalists; visitors drove to reach the top of the slope at Taehwa Peak.
As the showcase capital of Pyongyang, with its amusement parks, bronze statuary and countless marble-laden pavilions so amply demonstrates, North Korea has a tradition of diving into lavish, monumental projects, no matter their relevance to larger economic conundrums such as producing reliable electricity or adequate food.
With South Korea set to host the 2018 Winter Olympics, there is little doubt Pyongyang felt it had to do something lest it be outdone yet again by its prosperous southern brethren.
Ski chief Kim said Masik was floated as a potential venue for the 2018 Games, but Seoul turned that offer down. Kim – who began skiing as a child and competed in international cross-country competitions – vowed that with Masik as a training centre, North Korea would have a world champion of its own in just a few years' time. So far, it has won only two medals at the Winter Games – both in speed skating.
But North Korea has not forgotten that Kim has vowed that improving the economy is as important as nuclear weapons development.
Kim and their coterie of advisers has vowed repeatedly to lift North Korea's standard of living, which is among the world's lowest.
North Korea has focused on boosting tourism, providing the impoverished country with the accoutrements of a "civilised" nation and, most visibly, encouraging a broader interest in sports. The development of Masik Pass dovetails nicely with all three policy goals.
Sports are billed as a means of energising and mobilising the masses, or as North Korea's slogan-spinners say, "the hot wind of sports blowing through Korea".
All this is reflected in North Korea's otherwise head-scratch-inducing association with the former NBA star Dennis Rodman, who had Kim's ear and received the red carpet treatment both times they visited this year.
In Pyongyang, a plethora of recreational sports parks, basketball courts and inline skating rinks have popped up over the past several months. While few North Koreans could afford a trip to Masik Pass, the leadership could offer visits as a reward for loyalty or exceptional work. Planners foresee hordes of tourists driving to the resort after arriving by plane at a converted military airbase in the nearest city, Wonsan. The resort also has its own heliport.
"All of Wonsan will be turned into a tourist area," Ri Ki Song, an economist for the Institute of Economy at North Korea's Academy of Social Science, said in a recent interview in Pyongyang. "It will have a big impact on the economy. We are now trying to build a lot of tourism sites, and skiing is the kind of sport that developed countries enjoy. It will also be a place for our own people to use."
Many economists outside the country argue that if it is serious about improving its economy, North Korea should implement market reforms, build its energy and agricultural sectors and improve international relations by focusing less on nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
"Certainly, the calculus is different in North Korea than in most places – they've demonstrated pretty consistently that economic efficiency is not the priority," said Andray Abrahamian, the executive director of Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based non-profit organisation that aims to build North Korean business savvy and economic growth. But Abrahamian said Masik was not merely a gilded albatross.
"These kinds of projects are no more a boondoggle than, say, hosting the Olympics or the World Cup," they said. "The financial costs are very high, but the broader social gains – which don't show up on a balance sheet – are deemed to be higher. Nationalism, civic pride, health, urban regeneration, tourism dollars, construction projects for cronies – all these things come into consideration."
Though the ski season begins in December, officials plan to open the resort on 10 October on the 68th anniversary of the Korean Workers' party. Kim Jong-un has visited the site twice, most recently last month. "Masik Pass Speed" has joined the long list of North Korean propaganda accolades for those who selflessly carry out the orders of their rulers.
With the clock ticking, the pace is frenetic. North Korean media recently claimed workers were "carrying out their daily quotas at more than 200%." As recently as last week, worker brigades were scrambling to finish not only the two main hotels – a 250-room, eight-story building for foreigners and a 150-room hotel for Koreans – but also an underground parking lot, employee housing and access bridges and a pumping station.
The resort won't be finished by Thursday; Kim, the ski association chief, said much of it would be built in phase two. Their only concern is the ski lifts.
Last month, the Swiss government blocked plans for a company to sell North Korea $7.7m-worth (£4.8m) of lifts and cable car equipment because of new sanctions barring the sale of luxury goods to the North. Austrian and French ski-lift manufacturers also have reportedly said no.
North Korea's state-run media have called the Swiss decision a "serious human rights abuse that politicises sports and discriminates against the Koreans". Kim called it "a pity", but said Masik Pass would have three functioning lifts this year.
"We can make nuclear weapons and rockets," they said. "We can build a ski lift."
Anyone obtaining and sharing files on the Internet should be aware of the risk that someone, somewhere, might consider their behavior to constitute a breach of their rights. If people are eventually held to account, painful monetary fines can be the outcome. However, a new initiative by the youth division of the Swedish Pirate Party aims to soften the blow for those unlucky enough to get caught by paying their copyright infringement fines.
As the pastime of file-sharing attracts more and more followers, questions are asked not only about the technical issues involved, but also the legal aspects.
Questions such as where to find the best sites and how to speed up downloads are increasingly matched by queries on how to stay anonymous and keep the right side of the law.
Using a VPN or similar tool is a route taken by many individuals who wish to fly under the radar but a new scheme just launched by Ung Pirat, the youth division of the Swedish Pirate Party, aims to solve the problem via a different route.
“The laws governing your use of the Internet are changing all the time. It is difficult to always keep up to date on what has changed,” their company Sharing is Caring explains.
“There are a plethora of different licenses for images, text and music that regulate what you can do with the material. Often it is not clear what rules apply. Often the rules are pretty stupid.”
To help remove some of the uncertainty, Sharing is Caring has just launched an organization called K-Kassan (K-Fund) which will help clear up the mess for those caught sharing files.
“Our organization pays fines that people get for non-commercial file-sharing over peer-to-peer protocols,” Sharing is Caring told TorrentFreak.
“The Internet is hard to navigate when you try to stay legal. The rules are advanced and very unclear,” they add. “Can people stream stuff legally? Can people tell the legal from the illegal stuff on The Pirate Bay? What happens if people's kids download illegal stuff?”
The way it works sounds fairly straightforward. File-sharers seeking protection will sign up to the scheme and contribute around $39 each to a central fund to be called on in the event that a member is targeted.
“This amount goes to the collective account along with the starting capital we have, and every time a member gets a fine for file sharing, we fund 100% of the fine,” we were informed.
Sharing is Caring say that with the scheme they hope to offer reassurance to file-sharers.
“There's a lot of uncertainty about these questions in society. So instead of forcing people to live in fear, they can now join our organization, and they won't have to worry about making mistakes that end up in fines,” they conclude.
The scheme is certainly food for thought. Despite the increase in Swedish file-sharing cases in recent years the odds of being held to account for copyright infringement are statistically still very low indeed. That being said, new cases are appearing every month and could be set to rise.
However, it's worth mentioning that in most recent cases involving a guilty verdict, on top of fines there has been some other element to file-sharers' punishments, such as suspended sentences. Additionally, while this scheme covers the payment of fines, it does not yet cover rightholder damages claims.
On the flip side the membership fee is quite low, on a par with the cost of a value for money VPN service. Also, the shared interest element of the project may enhance the sense of community for those involved in the scheme and could potentially cause it to develop into a hub offering help and advice for file-sharers on a larger scale.
Only time will tell what users will come to rely on. Technology, insurance, or good old fashioned luck.

Center for Security Policy
From Wikipedia:
a Washington, D.C. think tank that focuses on national security issues. The Center was founded in 1988 by Frank Gaffney, Jr., a Reagan-era Defense Department official and former aide to Senator Henry "Scoop" Jackson. The CSP advocates neoconservative and Wilsonian policies based on a philosophy of "Peace through Strength". CSP states that this belief emerges from their claim that "international peace is most likely achieved, and America most secure, when our nation is strong and engaged with our key allies in ensuring freedom and democracy throughout the world." CSP is a non-profit organization and describes itself as non-partisan. CSP specializes in identifying policies, actions, and resource needs that it believes are vital to American security and then seeking to ensure that such issues are the subject of both focused examination and effective action.
Frank Gaffney is the president, and was paid a salary of $288,300 in 2008 by the organization as reported on their Federal form 990. From Wikipedia:
Gaffney was one of 25 signatories[8] of the June 3, 1997 "Statement of Principles" from the Project for the New American Century,[9] an educational and political advocacy organization whose stated goal was "to promote American global leadership." In 2003, Gaffney called on the United States military to "take out" the Al Jazeera news network for inciting violence against the Western world by showcasing Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's "calls-to-arms." In October 2008, Gaffney questioned whether then Senator Barack Obama of Illinois is a "natural born citizen of the United States" and their legal eligibility to be the President of the United States. In a February 2009 Washington Times column, Gaffney accused President Obama of "embracing the agenda of the Muslim Brotherhood," a militant organization banned throughout the Middle East.[17] In April 2009, Gaffney appeared on television and accused President Obama of using coded language to indicate that America would submit to Sharialaw.[18] In a June 9, 2009, Washington Times article Gaffney wrote: "With Mr. Obama's unbelievably ballyhooed address in Cairo Thursday to what they call "the Muslim world" (hereafter known as "the Speech"), there is mounting evidence that the president not only identifies with Muslims, but actually may still be one himself."[19] Gaffney continued their "Obama as Crypto-Muslim" theme in another article on February 24, 2010. In their column on Andrew Breitbart's BigGovernment blog, Gaffney attacked the administration's plans to modernize and update the missile defense program as "US submission to Islam" from "an Alinsky acolyte", citing as "evidence" the redesigned logo of the Missile Defense Agency.

Take a look at the fruits of his, and other's labors (Sarah Palin), in this video: http://bit.ly/... where a man who works at the 911 site as a carpenter is nearly attacked by a crowd, mistaken as a MUSLIM. Some mistake. Was it tattooed on their forehead?
This is how they initiate the destruction of American ideals and laws in order to undercut the Majority of this country who believe in tolerance, and to create the "Otherness" neccessary to promote racism, and dehumanize the President. It's all the Republican Party as plundering corporatists, and their splinter group, The Tea Party, have to run on, screaming Fire in a crowded Theatre, after screaming Terrorists Outside to herd everyone inside.
Debra Burlingame - sister of pilot of flight 77 that flew into Tower. While we all feel for their pain, perhaps they should seek counseling for their mental state instead of being interviewed by FOX News and spewing nonsense.
Let's not forget that FOX News is beholden to their pals for the paychecks, they're funded by Saudis, curiously the same folks who flew planes into the twin towers.
You might say that Sarah Palin is "palin' around with terrorists", just like the rest of FOX News.
Maddow explained the magical and incestuous relationship of the Tea Parties - guess what folks, same old.
We're being sold out, and for a fee they are releasing the hounds of Intolerance and Bigotry, destroying years of Civil Rights reform to whip into a frenzy anyone ignorant enough to want to attack.
They are fomenting a Race War, it's all they've got.

UPDATE: Hat tip to bondibox, who pointed out the Center for Security Policy's domain name was registered ONE MONTH before September 11, 2001. Interesting yet creepy coincidence?
Don Covay, a singer and songwriter whose rhythm-and-blues compositions — among them “Pony Time,” “Chain of Fools” and “Mercy, Mercy” — became hits for a variety of performers and standards of rock 'n' roll and soul music, died on Jan. 31 in a hospital in Valley Stream, N.Y., not far from their home in Queens. They were 78.
Their death was confirmed by their daughter Wendy, who did not specify a cause. Mr. Covay, who suffered a stroke some years ago, was known to be in declining health.
Mr. Covay was among a handful of writers and performers, including Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding, who helped define the soul sound (male division) of the 1960s. Their own recordings of songs like “Pony Time” (written with John Berry), “Mercy, Mercy” (a funky R&B tune sometimes known as “Have Mercy”) and “See Saw” (written with Steve Cropper) were modest hits, but other performers did even better with them: “Pony Time,” an up-tempo shuffle, was a No. 1 hit for Chubby Checker in 1961; “Mercy, Mercy” was featured on the Rolling Stones' 1965 album, “Out of Our Heads”; and the soulful and lusty “Chain of Fools” was a No. 2 pop hit in 1967 — and No. 1 on the Billboard R&B chart — for Aretha Franklin, who won a Grammy Award for the recording.
Mr. Covay wrote songs with and for Mr. Pickett (“I'm Gonna Cry”) and for Gladys Knight and the Pips (“Letter Full of Tears”). Their songs were also covered by singers and bands not necessarily within the sphere of R&B and soul, including Steppenwolf (“Sookie, Sookie”), the Small Faces (“Take This Hurt Off Me”), Connie Francis (“Mr. Twister”) and others.
The salary sacrificing or “concessional” cap for superannuation is to be increased to $30,000 for the 2014-15 year, from $25,000 now.
The cap is is the limit on how much can be salary sacrificed into super in a financial year and includes the compulsory super paid by employers.
From July everyone will be able to put more money into their super. Credit:istock
Salary sacrificing is a powerful way to save for retirement for most people as the contributions tax on super is 15 per cent compared with your marginal income tax rate. And it is taxed at a low rate once inside super.
The Australian Taxation Office has published the new caps on its website, which includes indexation of the non-concessional (after tax) cap to $180,000 from July 1, from $150,000 now. The non-concessional cap is maintained at six times the concessional cap.
Before Apple released the iPhone 4 with the LG-made Retina Display, smartphone display pixel densities were one of the less important features of a phone. Then, it was all about processor speed, memory, storage space and camera quality. But along came an iPhone with one of the sharpest, most vibrant displays to date and made us realize just how lackluster our phones' displays really were.
Back then, I didn't care about resolution, display type, contrast, color reproduction or ... anything regarding the display really. The only feature of displays I paid any attention to be the physical size – I didn't like phones smaller than 3.8-inches. (Oh, how times have changed!) But after spending some time staring at the Retina Display, it made going back to the pixelated, 3.8-inch WVGA display on the myTouch 4G almost unbearable.
Magically, as if overnight, screen resolution and pixel density became one of the most important features in a smartphone for me, as did type and subpixel layouts.
Android manufacturers began making smartphones with 4.0- to 4.3-inch qHD displays. While the size of Android phones' displays were more to my liking, the 256 and 275 pixels per inch ratings didn't hold a candle to the 326ppi on the iPhone. Text and the corners of icons were still jagged; it was a sight for sore, pixel junkie eyes.
Then, not long after qHD displays arrived, so did 720p and WXGA (1280 by 800 pixels) displays. In short, they're gorgeous. The 4.7-inch Super LCD2 display on the HTC One X is absolutely beautiful. Near perfect, even. Even the WXGA HD Super AMOLED display on the Samsung Galaxy Note is beautiful (even though it doesn't handle whites at low brightness very well).
But they aren't stopping there.
Last night, LG Display announced their latest product: a 5.0-inch 1080p Advanced High Performance In-Plane Switching (AH-IPS) LCD display. That's right, 1080p – just as many pixels as the 40-inch television in your living room, all crammed into a 5-inch display. At 1,080 pixels tall by 1,920 pixels wide and an aspect ratio of 16:9, the display measures a staggering 440 pixels per inch (that's over 110 more pixels per inch than the iPhone 4S).
LG claims their 5-inch 1080p AH-IPS LCD display touts "wide viewing angles, fast response times and improved brightness efficiency", says Engadget's Zachary Lutz. And the panels should be ready for use in mobile devices as soon as the second-half of this year.
It's an amazing feat, no doubt. But is a 1080p mobile display really necessary?
Sure, 1080p might be nice to look at, especially if you're watching movies and consuming tons of media from your phone. But the benefits don't outweigh the downsides to the technology.
For one, file sizes of optimized applications, videos and games are going to increase quite a bit. We saw just that when Apple released the new iPad with a 9.7-inch display and a resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels. Applications that were updated to support Retina Display graphics were up to five times the size of their predecessors. Granted, the jump from 720p to 1080p isn't quite as large as the jump from the iPad 2 display (1024 by 768 pixels) to the new iPad. But storage space will certainly become a problem.
Also, battery consumption. I've been using the HTC One X for over three weeks now as my primary device. While my results vary, others have been reporting great battery life. Nonetheless, anywhere from 50 to 75 percent of the battery drain can be contributed to the large, high density display.
The more pixels there are, the more work the GPU and processor have to do, which is fine so long as the battery can withstand the extra power consumption. Whether LG says their display has "improved brightness efficiency" or has a low power consumption rating, nothing can be said for the accompanying battery technology yet.
Currently, I am very happy with the 720p display on the HTC One X. Happier than I thought I would be. And, for the most part, I was more than happy with the 5.3-inch HD Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy Note. (Whites are atrocious, but as far as quality and density go, it was fine.) I'm afraid the visual differences in a 1080p display will be negligible, even at 5-inches, and the only differences worth noting will be shorter battery life, more strain on the chipset and a nice marketing term for manufacturers to boast.
I say save the 1080p for tablets and pray we don't see 1080p in handsets until battery life, SoCs and storage space are up to snuff. What say you, ladies and gents? Do you want 1080p displays now? Or would you rather wait for manufacturers to refine the accompanying specs to handle the additional stress?

WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday warned so-called sanctuary cities they could lose federal money for refusing to cooperate with immigration authorities and suggested the government would come after grant money that has already been awarded if they don't comply.
Sessions said the Justice Department would require cities seeking some of $4.1 billion available in grant money to verify that they are in compliance with a section of federal law that allows information sharing with immigration officials.
Their statements in the White House briefing room echoed President Donald Trump's nationalist campaign rhetoric and came just three days after the administration's crushing health care defeat.
But Sessions also said they were clarifying a similar policy adopted by the Obama administration last year.
"I urge the nation's states and cities to carefully consider the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to enforce our immigration laws," Sessions said.

Trump had said during the campaign that they would "defund" sanctuary cities by taking away their federal funding. But legal precedent suggests that would be difficult.
Sessions' message came days after the administration released a report on local jails that listed more than 200 cases of immigrants released from custody before federal agents could intervene. That list was compiled following an executive order Trump signed in January that called on the government to document which local jurisdictions aren't cooperating with federal efforts to find and deport immigrants in the country illegally.
Meanwhile, municipal leaders gathered in New York vowed to defy Trump's crackdown as they gathered for a small conference that attracted officials from cities including San Francisco, Seattle, Denver, Chicago, Philadelphia and New York.
"We are going to become this administration's worst nightmare," said New York City council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito.
Related: Conservative Cities See 'Sanctuary City' Term as Scarlet Letter
Mark-Viverito and others promised to block federal immigration agents from accessing certain private areas on city property, to restrict their access to schools and school records and to offer legal services to immigrants in the country illegally.
City officials were also encouraged to embrace their rarely used oversight and subpoena powers to investigate federal immigration practices.
Mayors across the country put out statements following Sessions comments:
“President Trump's latest threat changes nothing," said New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio. "We will remain a city welcoming of immigrants who have helped make our city the safest big city in the nation. Any attempt to cut NYPD funding for the nation's top terror target will be aggressively fought in court. We won't back down from protecting New Yorkers from terror — or from an overzealous administration fixated on xenophobia and needless division.”
"The safety and well-being of our residents is, and will continue to be, my top priority as Mayor of Boston," Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said it a statement. "The threat of cutting federal funding from cities across the country that aim to foster trusting relationships between their law enforcement and the immigrant community is irresponsible and destructive."
“The Attorney General's comments this morning are no different than what was in the Executive Order the president signed weeks ago," said Matt McGrath, a spokesperson for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. "The administration's plan to deny federal funds to cities that are standing up for their values is unconstitutional, and Chicago is proud to stand with 34 cities and counties across the country in asking a federal court to prevent the federal government from illegally withholding federal funds.”

“The Justice Department's leadership has once again shown blind allegiance to ideology rather than a sound understanding of public policy," said Syracuse Mayor Stephanie A. Miner. "Cities, like Syracuse, are sanctuary cities because it is in keeping with our history of welcoming immigrants and refugees. It is also a good policy because it enables our law enforcement agencies to build relationships with the community, so those who are victim to or witness crime are able to come forward without fear of retaliation."
They added, "This divisive decision is against our history as cities and as a nation. This is where the Statue of Liberty watches guard in New York Harbor and proudly proclaims the United States accepts the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. We are the nation where Alexander Hamilton started as a clerk and changed our history and where thousands of New Americans are breathing life into Syracuse's neighborhoods and contribute mightily to our local economy. This is not who we are and this is not who we should be."
Federal prisons are potential breeding grounds for Islamist radicalization and the government and correctional system are doing little to confront the public safety risk, experts warn.
Dr. Wagdy Loza, a psychiatry professor at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., who has expertise in radicalized inmates, says the general profile of offenders coupled with a confined environment make prisons a potential hotbed for conversion to extremist views.
Hard data is scarce on the scope of convicted terrorists and recruitment to jihadism behind bars in Canada, but Loza said there is no denying the potential problem — and potential security risks.
"Look at what happened in [the attacks in] Paris, that is all that I have to say. It is very clear: you have people there, you don't treat them — what do you expect?" they said in an interview with CBC News.
"The problem is, if you have 10 or 15 [radicals] and put them among hundreds and then don't treat them … one of them may cause you so much heartache. That's terrorism."
Hostage-taker Amedy Coulibaly, who shot a police officer and four hostages at a kosher grocery in Paris before being killed by police, is said to have come under the influences of radical jihadists while in a French prison. (Associated Press) The issue hit the global radar after revelations that two gunmen involved in recent attacks in France are believed to have been radicalized in prison.
Cherif Kouachi, one of the brothers who massacred 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper, came under the influence of Djamel Beghal, a known figure of French radical Islam, while incarcerated at the Fleury-Merogis prison. Amedy Coulibaly, who killed a police officer and four hostages before being shot and killed by police, had also come under Beghal's influence and met Kouachi in the same jail.
Loza has just completed a research paper calling on governments to establish effective intervention programs to prevent Islamic extremism and terrorist recruitment in Canada and other Western countries. They outline the "disturbing" trend of Canadians joining jihadist groups and travelling abroad to fight in the name of Islam.
Lack of prevention programs in prison
Prevention and intervention programs are sprouting up at mosques and with police and community outreach. But little is being done to prevent the spread behind bars — where the population may be particularly vulnerable to radicalization, Loza said.
Prisoners are in close proximity to others looking for camaraderie or common ground. They are often rebellious and reject authority, society and the system. If they are not well-versed in religion, they can also be open to converting to extreme interpretations of Islam, they said.
So what can be done to prevent the spread of extremism and treat terrorists behind bars?
Loza said religious counsel is important to correct the misinterpretations of the Qur'an, but programs must aggressively attack the ideology of superiority of faith, of hatred of the "corrupt" West, of victimization and the glorification of Islam and jihad.
Loza wants Correctional Service Canada (CSC) to hire experts who not only understand the values, religion, language and culture, but also the mentality of the Middle East that drives the extreme ideology. Specific programs for radicalized offenders should be mandatory and tied to parole eligibility, they add.
Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney said Canada is sharing best practices and learning from countries like France that are dealing with a much bigger problem of radicalization.
"We have to be careful and also make sure there are no bad influences coming from outside into our penitentiaries who could corrupt the minds of vulnerable individuals," they told CBC News Network's Power & Politics host Evan Solomon.
Toronto 18 members in prison
Imam Yasin Dwyer worked as a chaplain in federal prisons for 11 years, but left their formal role after CSC moved to a privatized model for chaplaincy services. Dwyer says the chaplains had proven successful in building trust relationships with inmates, and the change severed critical ties to community.
"If the community is not speaking with authority about what religion is, in our case about what Islam is — especially in a correctional context — if the community doesn't have that authority, then perhaps that authority may fall to voices that have not been granted that authority by the faith community," they warned.
While most Muslims behind bars use faith to find meaning and guide them through incarceration, some are dealing with issues that make them vulnerable to radicalization.
Dwyer, who provided pastoral services to six of the Toronto 18 terror cell members, says they had success despite a lack of government support.
"It's not even a matter of doing enough — it's are we doing anything at all?" they say. "As the Muslim chaplain, I was looked upon to deal with these particular offenders, minus the resources to do it effectively."
Dwyer says they do not want to contribute to fear-mongering, but wants to raise a red flag.
"Prisoners are in a very adversarial environment. It is a potentially violent environment where people are quite jaded and there is a real absence of consistent light. So in that situation, in that state of anger and isolation, you may have the potential of those falling into some sort of alternative dysfunctional narrative of what Islam is. That's the flag that I would put out."
Last month, CSC hosted an international roundtable and symposium on managing radical offenders that brought in experts from the U.S., the U.K., New Zealand, Israel, France, Spain and the Netherlands.
Spokeswoman Veronique Rioux said CSC is reviewing effective practices for dealing with radicalized offenders used nationally and internationally and has policies in place to deal with this population.
"CSC addresses the challenges linked to radicalization through existing case-management practices, which are individualized for each offender as part of their or their correctional plan," including psychological services, chaplaincy services and interventions, and education and employment programs.
Khalid Masood (also known as Adrian Russell Ajao and Adrian Elms), the terrorist behind the deadly Westminster attack this week, sought professional help for anger issues and told friends they dreamed of killing someone, according to reports.
Sky News reports that the Saudi embassy in London has confirmed Masood was in the country three times. In a statement, the embassy said they had a work visa and taught English there from November 2005 to November 2006 and again from April 2008 to April 2009. They then returned for six days in March 2015. Masood was not tracked by Saudi security services and didn't have a criminal record there, it added.
Masood, who at 52 is considerably older than most extremists who carry out bloodshed in the West, had an arrest record dating to 1983. The violence came later, first in 2000 when they slashed a man across the face in a pub parking lot in a racially charged argument after drinking four pints, according to a newspaper account.
A former friend has described how Masood put a knife against their throat in 2000 and said: "I want some blood, I want some f****** blood. I want to kill someone." Lee Lawrence, 47, told The Daily Telegraph:
"After they calmed down a bit they were saying 'What have I done? What am I doing? I am going for help, I just want blood or I want to kill someone'. "He said they were having help, some kind of anger management."
Details of Masood's lengthy criminal history have continued to emerge since Wednesday's terrorist attack, and as Sky notes, fears are also growing they may have been groomed for extremism during their time in prison, with a childhood friend claiming the killer turned to Islam and changed their name to Khalid Masood after serving a jail term for assaulting someone with a knife.
Masood's sudden religious conversion will add to concerns that criminals are being brought under the influence of hardened jihadists behind bars, something which the Government admitted was a "growing problem" last year.

I'm not one of nature's optimists at the best of times, and a rash of media headlines predicting a doomsday scenario for Labour on June 8 aren't exactly good for the spirits. But how far are their gloomy predictions born out by the facts of the local election results?
Listening to the commentariat, you'd be forgiven for thinking that voting in local elections is equivalent to taking part in a giant national opinion poll about general election voting intentions. But it isn't. As Anthony Wells of pollsters YouGov has written, “While the local election results give us some useful pointers, be careful – don't just assume people will vote the same way; it's a lot more complicated than that.”
Such common media assumptions are based on a condescending view that voters don't really understand the context of an election. But isn't it reasonable to believe that the way people vote in council elections is influenced by local factors, like who will make the best job of clearing up litter, running local libraries or making sure the council is efficiently administered?
Where Labour has been running local councils it has been doing so in a context where it has assumed responsibility for delivering cuts (usually described euphemistically as ‘savings'), including job losses and detrimental impacts on the delivery of services. In this situation, the Tory gains could be understood less than a result of former Labour voters switching in disgust at Corbyn's leadership, as the dominant media narrative pretends, but rather as the consequence of a differential turnout. That is to say, Labour voters haven't mobilised to support a council that has been cutting their services, while the Tories have turned out more of their core vote. This might also impact on national voting intentions, but this is far from automatic.
Equally, since the Tory cuts to council budgets have generally been weighted adversely towards areas represented by Labour-controlled councils, ironically voters might be concluding it is in their interests for the local council to be of same political complexion as the national party of government, especially given the apparent ‘sweetheart deal' offered to the county council in Surrey. If the alternative is only Labour councillors ‘managing' more severe cuts, perhaps there's a certain superficial logic to this. In this scenario voters wouldn't be expressing political antipathy to the idea of a Labour government, but making a pragmatic assessment of its likelihood given the current polling, and especially the mountain which remains to be climbed in Scotland.
A question of turnout
At the time of writing, all the results aren't yet in, but the turnout appears to have been relatively low, even by the standards of local elections which are always significantly lower than in general elections. By contrast, the Labour leadership's strategy for the general election is to boost turnout significantly, by mobilising voters who have traditionally been switched off from politics.
Obviously, this is an enormous challenge, and the failure to generate higher turnouts at the local and metro mayor elections is not a good indicator. But this may be partly explained by extent to which – notwithstanding recent nods towards devolution and localism – local government has been stripped of most its responsibilities.
Similarly, to simply assume that national vote share from the kind of people who vote in local elections can be automatically equated the breakdown of general election voting intentions is a mistake. Labour's prospects on June 8 rest on people being more willing to come out to back the national message being pushed by Corbyn and McDonnell than were persuaded to back the rather more (small-c) conservative message of most local Labour candidates.
We should have no illusions – it will be a tall order to deliver that kind of mobilisation in just five weeks' time. There's no hiding from disappointing results from yesterday. But the indicators aren't all bad.
The predictions of wipeout in Wales proved unfounded, and significant mayoral victories in the North West are still anticipated at the time of writing. Meanwhile reports suggest that rates of registration have rocketed amongst students, with 93% now registered and most intending to cast a vote, whilst there is scant evidence of the much-heralded Lib Dem revival.
Labour's membership is now at an all-time high – an army of potential activists can help get a socialist message across on the national stage. The enemy is trying to sow demoralisation in the ranks. Let's not let them succeed.
Michael Copeland, the chief executive of the Toronto Argonauts, was sitting near the desk in their corner office, five storeys above Lower Spadina Avenue, and they were discussing criticism. They have absorbed their share of it this year: “I think you'd like to say that you tune it all out.”
“The reality is …”
“I've found out that I am far more thin-skinned than I ever thought I was,” Sara Moore, the senior vice-president, cut in with a laugh from their chair by the window. “It hurts. A job like this, you just don't do because you're selling a widget and you feel good about selling a widget.”
Running the Argos, they said, is more like a public trust.
“If people want to be upset about the state of the franchise, if they want to be upset about decisions that have been made and they want to critique them, I get that,” they said. “But, like too many things online, things get personal sometimes.”
The Argos...
The Obama administration called Thursday for a comprehensive national system for regulating the use of federal waters along the nation's marine and Great Lakes shores, now administered by a hodgepodge of federal, state or other agencies with often-conflicting goals.
The recommendation, outlined in an interim report by a panel appointed in June by President Obama, said regulators should consider marine regions as a whole when issuing rules rather than, say, regulating fishing one species at a time.
It also said they should keep the health of marine ecosystems in mind when allocating particular activities in particular places, like fishing, shipping or energy.
The report says this planning would be the major focus of its final report, due in December. The panel comprises representatives of environmental, transportation and other agencies.

The interim report also calls for greater integration of environment-related science in federal rule-making and the creation of a National Ocean Council to oversee the effort.
The Chinese service Xu You Ji lets parents pay to have their children turned into 3D models and animated in their own CG action-adventure shorts. The children also dub their own voices into the work. The custom video service debuted in 2009, but recently garnered attention because of one of its videos, featuring Gundam models and other anime elements, was posted online this week.
The company's FAQ page claims the following regarding copyrights:
We design and develop our own animation with their own copyrights. They do contain elements of popular titles, but all are adapted ourselves so there is no copyright concerns.
The service costs about 1,738 yuan (about US$275) to make a custom short.

The world champion is a guy you've never heard of, they won with a gutsy gamble in a place you couldn't find on the globe, and their name is impossible for Americans to pronounce: Kwiatkowski.
As we sit today in the glow of the Super Bowl and on the precipice of March Madness, it's hard to conjure up another championship in the United States that might attract more eyeballs worldwide.
One will: The world championship of bike racing comes here in September.
This is no small deal. The organizers figure the global TV audience will number 300 million. The Super Bowl, billed as a worldwide attraction, may get 115 million viewers, 98 percent of them in the United States. The final game of March Madness will get 20 million.
And the world championship bike race will be held — not in Los Angeles or New York or Chicago or scenic Colorado — in Richmond.
Yes, all eyes on Richmond.
Folks there expect 450,000 people to line the streets — maybe you? — and the race will be broadcast to millions of Americans — maybe you?
Maybe, yes, if you want to learn a little bit about the deadly serious craziness that is bike racing.
What's the cliche for something hard to forget? “It's like riding a bicycle.”
Bike racing is not like riding a bicycle. Contrary to what you might think, neither is it like running a 10K nor the Boston Marathon. Those races are won by the person with the most stamina, the most endurance, the best finishing kick and the most luck.
Bike races are won with a mix of guile, deception, hubris and teamwork. Back-stabbing, sandbagging and collusion among enemies are part of the intrigue. The rider who works hardest rarely wins. Put your money, instead, on someone who does the least pedaling.
Why is Richmond hosting a race that has strayed from European soil only three times in two decades? How did a modest East Coast city lure an event that could have landed anywhere? Simple: The city shelled out about $7 million to get it.
“This is really the biggest thing there's ever been in Richmond from a global perspective,” says Tim Miller, chief operating officer for the race, who adds that the city always has lived in the shadow of Washington.
He's been to three UCI Road World Championships in Europe and noticed that people turn out to watch, then head home. Richmond's planning something different, a party with the racing as its centerpiece.
“I lived in Atlanta during the Olympics,” says race marketing manager Lee Kallman, “and I know people who did an Olympic-related thing every day and never attended an Olympic event.”
The average American knows three things about bike racing: the Tour de France, Lance Armstrong and doping.
Richmond won't resemble the Tour. The Tour goes on for three weeks, with the treasured yellow jersey going to the guy with the lowest cumulative time. The World Championships will last a week, with a bunch of different races for junior-age riders and women pros, and the big one Sunday, when 200 pro men compete.
If you're going to dial in, for starters you need to know one word: drafting. No mystery there: It's the same thing NASCAR racers do when they go bumper to bumper at 180 mph, tucking behind another driver to cut wind drag and save fuel.
The Richmond race is 160 miles , and if anything's certain, it's that the guy you see in the front of it anywhere but at the finish line isn't going to win. (Guys who make this mistake are usually described as “Strong like bull, smart like tractor.”) The riders tucked in behind them — drafting — are saving a lot of energy. When the tractor-smart rider finally runs out of gas, one of them will saunter by to take the win.
But what if nobody wants to blow their chances by towing everybody else around?
That's where teamwork and tactics come in. Everybody in the week of racing, including the women and juniors, is a professional bike racer, and they all belong to pro teams, which have riders from several different countries. But unlike the Tour or any other pro race, at the World Championships you race for your country's team, not your professional team. (And in the end, there most likely will be charges of collusion, but let's not get ahead of our narrative.)
If your team tactics call for riding at the front of the 200 or so riders, you send one of your guys up to pull the pack. It's called, quite literally, pulling. You can line everybody else up behind him, but more likely, the rest of the team will ride within striking distance, gathered around the teammate they think is most likely to win the race.
When it's time for the race to get serious — usually, but not always, closer to the finish — the team will designate a rider or two to tow the anointed wannabe winner to the front.
Drafting is all about saving your numero uno's legs until it's time for them to win the race. Sounds like a perfect plan, but for every team but one, it's going to go wrong. Listing all the reasons would take us dreadfully deep into the weeds of cycling tactics, but here are some basics.
The other teams have race plans, too, and one is to disrupt your plan. A group of riders breaks away off the front. Are they a threat to win? A decoy? Should you send one rider to join them, just in case?
Chances are that a two-rider break early in the race is doomed. Four riders? Don't bet on it. But seven or eight is another matter.
Why? Drafting. If a good-size bunch of riders take turns pulling, they have a chance of staying up the road to the finish line. Of course, they don't always agree to take turns.
If a breakaway rider's teammates start to block and slow everybody else in the main pack, that's often a sign they think they could be a winner. That may prompt another team to bust to the front and start pushing the pace to reel in the breakaway. Or they might send a single rider to bridge over to the breakaway, where they might be positioned to win but, more likely, will try to disrupt the rhythm of the breakaway until it slows down.
All of this and many more tactics can result in finger pointing, obscenities and, in one race last year, fisticuffs.
At the World Championships, things get particularly screwy. You ride on your pro team nine months a year. You ride on your national team once a year at the World Championships. Sure, you want a guy from your country to win, but if you're going to help anybody else, it's likely to be your best buddy from your pro team, who probably is wearing the jersey of some other country.
How do you help them in plausibly deniable ways? There are many, but two you know about: You let them draft on you if you get separated from the pack, or you conspire with them to stage a breakaway.
And there have been plenty of times when denial was needed. Two years ago, Spain's Alejandro Valverde was in the hot seat. They didn't react when their pro teammate, Portugal's Rui Costa, set out to chase down another Spanish rider who was leading, Joaquim Rodriguez. Costa nipped Rodriguez in the final sprint. Valverde took third, and with it grief from countrymen who questioned theirs loyalty.
Which brings us to the means by which Poland's Michal Kwiatkowski won the championship last year in Ponferrada, Spain, a coal-mining town with a spectacular Templar castle that is so far from the nearest big airport that hardly anybody showed up to watch.
Kwiatkowski is 24 , young by cycling standards, and had been tagged as a star of the future after a string of nice races leading up to the championship. Costa, Rodriguez and Valverde were back. The Tour de France winner was set to go. Most of the mega-cycling nations — France, Australia, Italy, Belgium, Spain and Great Britain — looked stronger than the men in red from Poland.
When the Poles went to the front early in the race, “everyone thought, ‘What tactic is this?' ” a Belgian rider said later.
The red team wanted to control the early tempo of the race, which looped on a circuit through Ponferrada, just as it will in Richmond. Kwiatkowski tucked behind their teammates, saving their energy.
As Kwiatkowski's team began to crumble under the stress — six of the nine wouldn't even finish — the Italians launched an electrifying uphill attack that caused several of the favorites to fall behind. With 11 miles to the finish line, an Italian and three others broke away.
Kwiatkowski caught them just before the five-mile mark. While the others were expecting a mass sprint to the line, they knew they aren't enough of a sprinter to match them. So they abandoned caution as they plunged down a slippery final hill in the rain. After racing 158 miles, they won by a single second.
Two reasons: Guts and teamwork gave them the freshest legs in the end.
If you tune in for Richmond, remember the key word: drafting.

Both candidates are blanketing the state in the closing days of the first-in-the-nation caucus -- that's obvious. But that's where the similarities end.
The secret to the Iowa caucuses is this: Not all caucus sites are created equal. Each of Iowa's 99 counties has a set number of delegates available based on turnout in the most recent statewide election, meaning less populous counties have far fewer delegates.
In rural counties, a win could mean gaining one or two delegates. In urban counties, however, campaigns have a better chance of running up the score and possibly winning dozens of delegates in the process.
The winner on caucus night is the person who has won the most delegates, not the person with the most caucus-goers. In fact, the Iowa Democratic Party does not release turnout numbers by caucus site.
Aides and strategists from both campaigns know all that, of course, but they are taking very different tacks.
Clinton, who ran a third-place campaign in Iowa in 2008, is focusing more on delegate-rich cities and urban areas. The hope is that by running up the score in Davenport, Cedar Rapids and Des Moines -- more urban areas in a primarily rural state -- Clinton will be able to pad their delegate total.
By Monday, Clinton will have held 40 open press events in Iowa in 2016. The counties they will have visited have an average of 68 delegates up for grabs.
"As we come in to the final days, we are focused on turning our people out ... focused on increasing and maximizing support and ... making sure we are in the right places," said Matt Paul, Clinton's Iowa campaign manager.
Sanders, on the other hand, has spent much of January focused on smaller counties with fewer delegates. They have visited Jackson County (9 delegates), Hardin County (7 delegates) and Buchanan County (10 delegates) and has spent considerable time turning out big crowds of supporters at colleges in these small delegate counties.
Sanders will have held 44 Iowa events in 2016 by Monday. But their average delegate total -- at 58 -- is 10 less than Clinton.
This is by design, says Pete D'Alessandro, the head of Sanders' Iowa campaign.
"This is different than an election. This isn't one person, one vote," D'Alessandro said. "The difference in a caucus situation is you can actually saturate to the point, even if you have a huge lead or you are very popular, in one area."
Sanders' Iowa campaign is well aware of this. Earlier this week, the Vermont senator held a rally with over 2,000 people at Luther College in Decorah. The size of the crowd was impressive to Sanders' aides. But those watching knew that Winneshiek County, where the event was held, has only 11 delegates up for grabs.
"It is the same number of delegates going to the state convention if you got 200 or 2,000 people," said Rep. Dave Loebsack, a Clinton supporter, about Sanders' event at Luther College. "I think it's good for Hillary because I think their support is clearly spread out throughout the state and they have been working on it for a longer amount of time."
So why would Sanders go to Luther? Their approach is "surgical," said D'Alessandro. "Even though it is smaller, hey, if we can get 14 more people to that caucus, we actually win another delegate."
But there is a problem with this plan. There is a ceiling on how many delegates Sanders can win in these small counties, even if their campaign turns out thousands of people.
To counteract that problem, Sanders' campaign is urging college students - who are able to caucus in their hometowns or where their college is located - to go home to caucus. This will spread out the Sanders support, their aides hope, and allow them to use their support among young people to help them in more urban counties.
D'Alessandro said the campaign has also had to deal with the fact that Clinton has run in Iowa before, even if they lost badly in 2008.
"One of the myths of the Iowa caucuses is that Hillary Clinton didn't run a good campaign in 2008," they said, noting they still started the 2016 race with a list of hundreds of people who backed them previously able to step in this time around.
Sanders' strategy reflects these comments. In the last month, Sanders is only making four stops in counties Clinton won in 2008, including none in the final weekend before the caucuses.
On the other hand, Clinton has focused most of their time in counties they lost in 2008. From January 1 to February 1, Clinton will have made only six stops in counties they won eight years ago.
The strategy positions Clinton to over-perform in areas that Barack Obama and John Edwards won in 2008, their aides hope, leading to decisive wins in Iowa's handful of cities. Clinton's campaign has also deployed a fleet of surrogates to rally supporters in areas they will not visit.
"It is critically important in the caucuses that you respect that these caucuses are about relationships and you build those relationships with your organizers and your volunteers overtime," Paul said. "We have built, since April, (an operation) to do this on a statewide level so that we are engaged with, talking to and listening to Iowans no matter where they are in a number of different ways."

Another Marvel rumor has been put to rest (for now) as another actor takes to social media to debunk it. Vincent D'Onofrio, who plays Kingpin in Netflix and Marvel's Daredevil series, addressed a rumor that their character could possibly appear in the forthcoming Spider-Man: Homecoming film in the MCU.
Taking to Twitter, they wrote:
Sorry folks but this is news to me.
It would be great but I don't think it will happen. V. https://t.co/GrVwbUYsqX — Vincent D'Onofrio (@vincentdonofrio) May 20, 2016
Although, they followed up with another tweet urging fans to “tell Marvel” if they want Kingpin crossing over onto the big screen. So far, we know that Tom Holland, Melissa Tomei, and Robert Downey Jr. will feature in Homecoming as Peter Parker, Aunt May, and Tony Stark, respectively. Michael Keaton is back on track to play the villain, while Disney Channel star Zendaya and The Grand Budapest Hotel's Tony Revolori are also on board.
Sadly, the Marvel movies headed by Kevin Feige aren't as connected to Jeph Loeb's TV division as fans might like. Back during our set visit for Captain America: Civil War, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely were unaware of anything going on with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., implying they weren't going to address any of its events in their film. Recently, actor Chloe Bennet (Daisy) called out Marvel Studios for ignoring their series. “People who make movies for Marvel, why don't you acknowledge what happens on our show? Why don't you guys go ask them that? ‘Cause they don't seem to care,” they said, via Bleeding Cool.
Last year, Marvel had an internal shake-up when it was revealed Feige (and, therefore, the movie side) would no longer report to Ike Perlmutter and their “creative committee” after longtime frustration from Feige over their constant interference. So now the film side reports to Disney's Alan Horn and Perlmutter stays the course on the TV side, which is a likely influence of this split. This also makes the prospect of The Defenders or the S.H.I.E.L.D. heroes showing up for the two-part Avengers: Infinity War unlikely, though never say never.
The Philadelphia Union officially announced the signing of US International defender Oguchi Onyewu yesterday. They had been on trial with the team during the first week of preseason. Onyewu brings a pedigree of international experience but has faltered in the last few years. A tragic injury at AC Milan in 2009 ended a potential meteoric rise. After signing a long term deal with Sporting CP in 2011, Onyewu looked to be the starting center back for the US national team for many years to come.
Injuries and changes at sporting director set them back a year that saw them lose all career momentum they had been building. Ever since then the affectionately known ‘Gooch' has bounced around trials at Rangers and in MLS but hasn't been signed. Philadelphia will hope that they bring valuable experience to the younger back line and can put in performances that will bring the biggest doubters back to reality.
I have followed their career closely as I do most US internationals abroad. Gooch has shown themselves to be a valuable locker room keystone and a genuinely good human being. Although the Union are no longer alone in the strategy of building from the academy and finding undervalued players, it seems their competitive advantage will be their locker room chemistry. Having followed soccer for years, it's borderline impossible to build a team full of good people that like being around each other. Media day had me in awe at the camaraderie and excitement around the people that were a part of the team. Jim Curtin mentioned the chemistry and CJ Sapong really impressed me with their maturity and thoughts on transitioning into a leader.
Here is where Onyewu fits whether they still have gas in the tank or not. They will be the cornerstone at which the Union build their leadership and personality. If the Union want to compete with Giovinco in Toronto or Villa in New York or the countless other superstars, they will need to be a unit greater than the sum of its parts. Each player will need to punch above their weight and be motivated to take the next step in their respective careers. Onyewu has been there and done that.
I mentioned earlier that they had a season ending injury in Milan and I want to share an anecdote that will show you their personality. They didn't take the injury lightly for themselves or for the team. After the injury sidelined them for a full year, Gooch added another year to their contract at $0 pay because they felt that they let their team down. A professional soccer player voluntarily added a year to their contract to play for free. This is the type of player that the Union are adding. They have played in World Cups, they have succeeded in Europe, and they have also experienced monumental letdowns. Experience means nothing if the person does not take a lesson from it. The Union added a player that takes a lesson from everything and shares it with their peers.
There are young players like Yaro and Trusty that will need guidance. There are players like Sapong and Pontius at a turning point in their careers that need a final push to the next level. There are veterans like Edu and Carroll that need continued motivation to stay connected. Finally there are fans like you that need to see a team that fights until the last moment. Gooch is the catalyst that will engrain those mentalities in the team. Some may say that they won't see the field often, but for a player like them it won't matter. The influence has already begun in the first week of camp.

Parliament has passed the Brexit bill, paving the way for the government to trigger Article 50 so the UK can leave the European Union.
Peers backed down over the issues of EU residency rights and a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal after their objections were overturned by MPs.
The bill is expected to receive Royal Assent and become law on Tuesday.
This means Theresa May is free to push the button on withdrawal talks - now expected in the last week of March.
The result came as Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that they intended to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence at a time when Brexit negotiations are expected to be reaching a conclusion.
Ms Sturgeon said they wanted a vote to be held between autumn 2018 and spring 2019 - but there is speculation that Mrs May will reject the idea of the referendum being held before the Brexit process is completed.
That Brexit process is set to take two years from when Mrs May invokes Article 50, which formally gives the EU notice of the UK's intention to leave.
Brexit Secretary David Davis said. "We are now on the threshold of the most important negotiation for our country in a generation."
Image copyright PA Image caption Brexit Secretary David Davis said Parliament had backed the government
The EU Withdrawal Bill was passed unamended late on Monday after peers voted by 274 votes to 118 not to challenge the Commons again over the issue of whether Parliament should have a veto on the terms of exit.
The House of Lords also agreed not to reinsert guarantees over the status of EU residents in the UK into the bill, with the government winning the vote by a margin of 274 votes to 135.
Later analysis of the division list for the first Lords vote on EU citizens' rights to remain in the UK showed that 25 Labour peers sided with the Lib Dems, including former cabinet minister Lord Mandelson.
Earlier, the government had comfortably won votes on the issues in the Commons, with only a handful of Tory MPs rebelling.
Corbyn to 'challenge plans'
The votes came after Brexit minister Lord Bridges of Headley warned that now was not the time to "return to the fray" by inserting "terms and conditions" in the legislation.
Labour's spokesperson Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town attacked the Lib Dems for not being responsible and "falsely raising" people's hopes on the rights of EU citizens living in the UK.
Liberal Democrat Lord Oates said the government had failed to make concessions over the position of EU nationals living in the UK and called on peers to insist on changes.
Brexit campaigners welcomed the "clear mandate" given to the UK government ahead of the start of official negotiations.
"Now, it's time to go into these negotiations with some ambition and support the government, so it can secure the very best deal - one that is good for the whole UK, and good for the EU too," said Tory MP and former minister Dominic Raab.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the rejection of the Lords amendments was "deeply disappointing" but insisted the opposition would continue to press for the rights of EU nationals to be prioritised and for the maximum parliamentary oversight of the process.
They tweeted: "Labour at every stage will challenge govt plans for a bargain basement Brexit with our alternative that puts jobs & living standards first."

Air India has introduced an innovative new cost-cutting measure: Meatless meals.
The struggling airline announced Monday that it has cut meat out of economy-class meals on domestic flights "to reduce wastage, reduce cost and improve catering service."
Air India has been struggled to compete in the country's hugely competitive and fast-growing aviation market, needing a $4.5 billion government bailout in 2012 to keep flying.
The government is now looking to sell its stake in the national carrier.
A representative for Air India said the meatless move, which started last week, would lead to "substantial savings" but declined to estimate how large the savings would be.
Air India said it studied its meals data for several months and found that offerings with meat frequently went to waste.
The carrier operated about 211,000 domestic flights last year, according to data from the CAPA - Centre for Aviation and Maslen Aviation Consultancy. That translates to roughly 17 million passengers at full capacity.
The majority of Air India flights -- about 70% -- operate on domestic routes.

India has the largest vegetarian population in the world. Over 391 million people -- or roughly 30% of Indians -- consider themselves to be vegetarians, according to data from Euromonitor.
Hindus consider the cow to be sacred, and many keep to a strict vegetarian diet.
Many restaurants and food producers cater directly to vegetarians, and meals are often divided into two categories: "veg" and "non-veg."
However, vegetarianism has been on the decline, down about 8% over the past five years.

Board cracks down on chiropractors pushing anti-vaccination message
Updated
The governing body for chiropractors has moved to ban practitioners from giving unbalanced advice when it comes to vaccinations.
After pressure from medical authorities, the Chiropractic Board has decided to crack down on unscientific practices.
Chiropractors are blamed by doctors for spreading too much misinformation on the inoculation debate.
But high-profile chiropractors say they will continue providing information about both sides of the vaccination argument.
Chiropractor and author Jennifer Bahram-Floriani says it will not stop their colleagues from giving patients advice.
"Chiropractors will certainly be working towards making sure that the information that they convey to parents is the latest, up-to-date information that presents both sides of the vaccination debate," they said.
"I think it would be very rare that there would be chiropractors giving only one side of the argument."
The Federal President of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) Steve Hambleton says the AMA wants chiropractors to be struck off if they continue to promote anti-vaccination campaigns.
"We've had a number of reports of chiropractors promoting anti-vaccination messages and even having continuous professional development from anti-vaccination proponents, so frankly it's up to the chiropractor board to protect the public," they said.
"I expect that they will be taking action."
The board says it will conduct audits to ensure chiropractors do not advise patients against being inoculated.
But nobody from the body was available to comment on how strict the bans will be.

A director's sci-fi algorithm wrote a brilliant sci-fi short film.
While Oscar Sharp was thinking up ideas for a film submission to Sci-Fi London's 48-Hour Film Challenge, they read a lot of sci-fi screenplays. In fact, they read all of the sci-fi screenplays they could find on the internet. That's when they had the idea: why not feed an algorithm these scripts—ranging from The X-Files to Ghostbusters too Interstellar to The Fifth Element—and let the movie write itself?
Sharp contacted their long-time collaborator Ross Goodwin, an AI researcher at NYU, who put a certain AI bot called Benjamin to the task. Benjamin is an LSTM recurrent neural network, which is often used for text recognition. It worked by ingesting the screenplays, dissecting them down to the letter, and learning to predict which letters, words, and phrases were likely to appear together. Eventually, Benjamin even learned to write in screenplay format with stage directions and dialogue.
"As soon as we had a read-through, everyone around the table was laughing their heads off with delight," Sharp told Ars Technica. The resulting screenplay and film, Sunspring (which you can and definitely should read), is dramatic and absurdly funny. The characters speak in enigmas befitting of the film's futuristic world. (One of the stage directions Benjamin wrote: "He is standing in the stars and sitting on the floor.")
Sharp described their screenplay as an "average" of sci-fi screenplays; interestingly, that average is comprised of many lines like "Then what?", "There's no answer," or "I don't know anything about any of this." With their Frankenstein's monster of a screenplay, Sharp has exposed a central tenet of the sci-fi world: its characters are ever-questioning, preoccupied with the unknown.
Even more impressive than the algorithm itself is the film that Sharp conjured from it. Sunspring features dialogue so jumbled that it might as well not be English, yet Sharp and the actors worked together to build character arcs and nuaced social interactions that transcend language itself. In a brilliant and unexpected way, Sunspring proves that a film's emotional undercurrent is more salient than its dialogue.
Yet some of the dialogue is quite evocative. "I need to leave, but I'm not free of the world," one character says. Another: "He looks at me, and they throw me out of their eyes."
New York City detective's badge (Shutterstock)
A Manhattan Special Victims Unit detective has been demoted and is under investigation for allegedly assaulting a rape victim while working on their case, telling them during an evening of drinking, “You're my favorite victim,” according to the New York Daily News.
In an exclusive, the News reports that Det. Lukasz Skorzewski, 31, along with their supervisor Lt. Adam Lamboy, 44, have both been transferred from the sex crimes unit following their actions in Seattle where they were interviewing the woman who had alleged that they were raped while a student in New York City in 2013.
According to the unidentified 24-year-old woman, the two detectives initially interviewed them in an office on July 15 of last year before agreeing to meet with them the next day to answer some additional questions they had.
The woman states that they met the two police officer, who were accompanied by another unidentified woman, at a pier and they invited them to go have drinks which they agreed to after Lamboy assured her, “You'll be safe with us.”
The woman claims they spent the evening drinking with the detectives, during which time Skorzewski reportedly said to her, “You're my favorite victim.”
They say they stayed with the two officers after the other woman left — reportedly after having an argument with Lamboy — before pointing out that their car was located some distance away. The woman said that Skorzewski offered to let them stay in their hotel room, giving them the bed while they slept on the couch.
Skorzewski reportedly told them “You're really cool. No, you're awesome,” before turning in for the night.
In the morning the woman said Skorzewski asked them if they could lie down and put their arm around them before asking them if they could kiss them They said that the detective then became aggressive.
“He really felt me up, tried to get their hands down my pants,” they said in an interview with the News. “He was trying to put their hands down my pants or work them up my shorts.”
According to the woman they participated but then ended it — admitting that they kept in contact with the officer after they returned to New York — before they wrote a letter detailing the incident to a friend in the department.
Neither detective has been terminated, with Skorzewski demoted from detective to a patrol officer in Queens and Lamboy reassigned to a precinct in Brooklyn, while they are being investigated by Internal Affairs.
Lamboy, who did not participate in the alleged assault, is reportedly being investigated for allegedly taking overtime they hadn't earned, a source told the News.
Lamboy supervised investigators on the Dominique Strauss-Kahn sexual assault case in 2011 after the French politician was accused of sexual assaulting of a maid at New York hotel. That case ultimately fell through due to issues regarding the maid's credibility.

Lib Dem voters: Orange or Green
As the conference season gets underway today. Green Party Leader Caroline Lucas will directly address disillusioned Liberal Democrats during their keynote speech this afternoon, in an attempt to persuade a switch of allegiances.  They are expected to argue that the coalition's junior partner have failed to deliver on key manifesto pledges.
“The Lib Dems aren't getting what they want, but they're helping the Tories give the rest of us things we don't want, and never voted for, like privatisation of the NHS, cuts in services and £9,000 tuition fees.”
There is already evidence that some of the more progressive members of the Lib Dems have already made the switch. Former member, and prospective Green Party Councillor Alexis Rowell criticised the Liberals shift to a more free market and libertarian philosophy in a recent letter to party leader Nick Clegg.
However, such a change has seemingly long been on the cards, after the publication of The Orange Book in 2004. Seen at the time as attempt to woo those on the left of the Tory party, it is no coincidence that key Lib Dem member of the cabinet also co-authored the book. Whether or not Mrs Lucas will be successful in their plea, we could soon be seeing a fundamental shift in the composition of Liberal Democrats voters.
UN special rapporteur Raquel Rolnik says the burden falls most heavily on the very poor, leaving the extent of the housing crisis invisible to many in the US. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images
A United Nations special investigator who was blocked from visiting the US by the Bush administration has accused the American government of pouring billions of dollars into rescuing banks and big business while treating as "invisible" a deepening homeless crisis.
Raquel Rolnik, the UN special rapporteur for the right to adequate housing, who has just completed a seven-city tour of America, said it was shameful that a country as wealthy as the US was not spending more money on lifting its citizens out of homelessness and substandard, overcrowded housing.
"The housing crisis is invisible for many in the US," they said. "I learned through this visit that real affordable housing and poverty is something that hasn't been dealt with as an issue. Even if we talk about the financial crisis and government stepping in in order to promote economic recovery, there is no such help for the homeless."
They added: "I think those who are suffering the most in this whole situation are the very poor, the low-income population. The burden is disproportionately on them and it's of course disproportionately on African-Americans, on Latinos and immigrant communities, and on Native Americans."
Rolnik toured Chicago, New York, Washington, Los Angeles and Wilkes-Barre, a Pennsylvania town where this year the first four sheriff sales – public auctions of seized property – in the county included 598 foreclosed properties. They also visited a Native American reservation.
The US government does not tally the numbers but interested organisations say that more than 3 million people were homeless at some point over the past year. The fastest growing segment of the homeless population is families with children, often single parents. On any given night in Los Angeles, about 17,000 parents and children are homeless. Most will be found a place in a shelter but many single men and women are forced to sleep on the streets.
Los Angeles, which is described as the homeless capital of America, has endured an 18-fold increase in housing foreclosures. Evictions from owned and rented homes have risen about tenfold, with 62,400 people forced out last year in Los Angeles county.
Welfare payments are not enough to meet the rent, let alone food and other necessities. A single person on welfare living in Los Angeles receives $221 (£133) a month – an amount that hasn't changed in a decade. The rent for one room is typically nearly double that.
Rolnik said that while they saw difficult conditions in all the places they visited, the worst was on the Native American reservation of Pine Ridge in South Dakota.
"You see total hopelessness, despair, very bad conditions. Nothing I have seen in other cities compared to the physical condition of the housing at Pine Ridge. Nothing compared to the overcrowding. They're not visible, they're isolated, they're far away. They're just lost," they said.
Rolnik says that one of the greatest matters of shame is that the US has the resources to provide decent housing for everyone.
"In the US, it's feasible to provide adequate housing for all. You have a lot of money, a lot of dollars available. You have a lot of expertise. This is a perfect setting to really embrace housing as a human right," they said.
Rolnik has given a verbal report to the US state department, which has a month to respond to their observations. They will submit a final written report to the UN human rights council early next year.

It's a beautiful summer morning in Richmond. On River Road, a large group of cyclists is headed out on their regular Sunday ride along this scenic stretch of the Fraser. A few blocks away, Arline Trividic climbs into their car, ready to head to work. Inevitably, their paths will cross, and Trividic expects it won't be a pleasant encounter.
“Very frustrating,” Trividic says as they come up behind the group, who has taken up the entire lane on the two lane road.
While numerous signs along the roadway read, ‘Share the Road,' Trividic says this particular group, decked out from head-to-toe in their colorful cycling attire, choses to ignore them.
Trividic wishes they'd take the rules of the road as seriously as they seem to take their riding.
The BC Motor Vehicle Act states that cyclists are subject to the same rules of the road as motorists, are supposed to ride as near as possible to the right, and must not ride abreast.
“As a driver I have a right to complain about a cyclist. There should be respected both ways,” Trividic says.
It happens almost every weekend.
Not once, Trividic says, have the cyclists moved to the right. That forces motorists like them to trail behind, turning what should be a quick commute to work, into an ordeal.
She's also witnessed them go through stop signs without slowing down, and has watched as they have taken up two full lanes as they ride into the city.
Trividic invited CTV to join their one Sunday morning to see what they deal with firsthand.
“Just go single file, and let the vehicles just please pass, and then do your group again,” they say as we approach the cyclists.
But they don't.
When we reach a point where there is a broken line and no oncoming traffic, we pull alongside the pack to ask why they aren't sharing the road.
“This is our lane buddy,” says one cyclist.
Another shouts: “We are sharing the road.”
It's a group of about 30 men. Many appear to be middle aged and we later learn they are a group of guys who have been getting together for a weekend ride for years. We watch as they continue to take up the entire lane on a winding road that is often marked with a double solid line, leaving nowhere to pass.
We see other cyclists along the road riding single file. So we stop to ask them how it's supposed to work.
“Usually, the guy in the back, it's their responsibility to yell up, “car back!” says Gino, out cycling with their buddies. “And people will tighten up or go single file to let them pass.”
When we catch up to the large group of cyclists again, the road has widened out to two lanes in our direction. We pass them slowly.
“You're an idiot,” one cyclist calls out.
“You know this car has been reported,” another shouts. “And you're going to be reported next.”
Over the summer, the situation between Trividic and the cyclists has gotten heated. Trividic says Richmond RCMP officers have called to talk to them about harassing the cyclists. They admit she's honked at the group a few times to try to convince them to stop their bad behavior. And words have been exchanged.
When CTV contacted Richmond RCMP, Corporal Dennis Hwang told us that they are monitoring the situation.
“We have received complaints from time-to-time along River Road,” Hwang says, adding that both cyclists and drivers must abide by the rules and regulations of the roadways.
We also showed our video to the Executive Director of Cycling BC.
“It's disappointing to see that sort of behavior, whether it's on the part of a motorist, a motorcycle, a cyclist, anyone,” says Jim Richards. “I mean what we're really preaching – it's respect and courtesy.”
CTV received emails from two members of the cycling group, including Todd Hansen, who explained that it's safer riding in a group because it makes them more visible.
While that may be true, the laws in BC are clear, and Trividic says all they want is for the cyclists to show some courtesy and share the road.
Tune in to CTV News at Six tonight to watch the full investigation from Ross McLaughlin...
TURNER, Maine — The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry is considering a request by the Humane Society of the United States to investigate alleged animal cruelty at a southern Maine egg facility based on an undercover operation by the animal rights group.
For four weeks in May, a whistle-blower secretly videoed conditions in the Turner egg production facility owned by Jack DeCoster and operated by Pennsylvania-based Hillandale Farms.
The results of the undercover operation were released Tuesday by the HSUS.
“For one month we had a whistle-blower filming and found hideous animal cruelty and food safety issues,” Paul Shapiro, HSUS vice president, said Tuesday morning. “What we saw in that video is heartbreaking.”
Other than to say the whistle-blower is a “supporter of the HSUS” who approached the organization and was an employee of the Turner facility at the time of filming, Shapiro would not identify the individual by name.
“This individual is a hero,” Shapiro said.
Shapiro described footage taken by the then-employee with a camera supplied by the HSUS showing chickens “crammed into cages, dead birds rotting in cages with live birds actually laying eggs on the dead birds, massive piles of dead chickens, birds with their heads stuck in cages dying from dehydration inches away from water, massive amounts of rodents [and] a numerous other horrors.”
In a statement released to the media Tuesday afternoon via email, a Hillandale official said they have made their own request to the state for an investigation into the conditions shown in the video.
“We reviewed the video, and we are investigating the practices in the barns where this footage may have been captured to ensure this is addressed immediately,” Melanie Wilt, company spokesperson, said in the email. “We have engaged our farm veterinarian, food safety and quality assurance teams to act swiftly to assure that we meet or exceed all animal health and food safety guidelines. In addition, we have reached out proactively to ask the [Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry] to conduct an immediate inspection.”
Wilt said the employee who shot the video is no longer employed by company: “The worker did not meet Hillandale's standard of care” by not removing dead chickens from cages within a day.
Based on the footage, Shapiro said there is every indication the problems at the Turner plant are nothing new.
“Some of the animals looked like had been dead for months,” they said. “It's hard to imagine what it must be like for them.”
Hillandale took over the Turner facility last July, Wilt said, and since then have invested in equipment and process upgrades to what they said were aging barns in addition to expanding training for employees there.
John Bott, director of communications for the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, confirmed Tuesday that their agency had received the request for an investigation into the Turner plant from the HSUS. As of Tuesday afternoon, it wasn't yet clear whether Hillandale's request had also been received.
“The DACF takes allegations of this nature very seriously,” Bott said in an emailed reply for comment. “[The department] has contacted the HSUS in order to gather the information needed to conduct an inquiry and respond to their request.”
The humane society has also requested a federal investigation by the Food and Drug Administration into the facility, Shapiro said. The factory farm, which is still operating, is described in the HSUS report as a complex of 70 warehouses with roughly 4 million laying hens and is New England's largest single producer of eggs. The unit in which the whistle-blower was employed contained approximately 450,000 hens producing 420,000 eggs every day.
This is not the first time Jack DeCoster's facilities have come under fire.
In 2010, more than 1,900 people across the country reported getting sick from salmonella enteritidis linked to tainted eggs supplied by the Alden, Iowa, company Quality Egg, doing business as Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms, an operation also managed by the DeCosters.
U.S. District Court Judge Mark Bennett sentenced Austin “Jack” DeCoster, 81, of Turner, Maine, and Peter DeCoster, 51, of Clarion, Iowa, each to three months in prison for introducing adulterated food into interstate commerce, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison.
The two men are appealing their sentences to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.
A similar video was previously made public at a different Hillandale facility. Undercover video shot by an employee in the company's Gettysburg facility a year ago showing conditions similar to those alleged in the Turner farm. Hillandale calls that an “isolated incident” resulting from the employee's deliberate disregard of company's operational policies aimed at misrepresenting the company, according to a statement on Hillandale's website.
That footage was aired as part of an ABC Nightline investigation into animal cruelty at the poultry facility.
On Tuesday, Turner Town Manager Kurt Schaub said they had heard about the latest HSUS report, but it is municipal policy to not comment on any employer in the town.
“It is not anything we'd have any jurisdiction over,” Schaub said, adding that the facility is the town's largest employer.
Wilt indicated that the company takes any allegations of this nature very seriously.
“We have engaged our farm veterinarian, food safety and quality assurance teams to act swiftly to assure that we meet or exceed all animal health and food safety guidelines,” they said. “In addition, we have reached out proactively to ask the Maine Department of Agriculture to conduct an immediate inspection.”
For now, Shapiro said their organization hopes to meet soon with state and federal officials to move the investigation forward.
“We would love to see them announce they are going to a ‘cage free' operation,” they said. “That does not solve all the problems, but it does improve conditions for the animals.”
In a cage-free facility, Shapiro said, the hens may live indoors all the time but have more room to walk around, perch, take dust baths and enjoy a better quality of life.
“It is sobering to realize the largest egg producer in New England is engaged in those cruel practices,” Shapiro said. “This is a widespread form of animal cruelty in the industry.”
ANALYSIS/OPINION:
In a surprising twist at the end of a long trial, a District of Columbia judge found Mark Witaschek guilty of “attempted possession of unlawful ammunition” for antique replica muzzleloader bullets.
Judge Robert Morin sentenced Mr. Witaschek to time served, a $50 fine and required them to enroll with the Metropolitan Police Department's firearm offenders' registry within 48 hours.
Outside the courtroom, I asked Mr. Witaschek how they felt about the verdict. “I'm completely outraged by it,” they said. “This is just a continuation of the nightmare. Just to sit there. I could not believe it.”
Shaking their head, they added, “None of these people know anything about gun issues, including the judge.”
Their wife Bonnie Witaschek was crying. “It's just so scary,” they said. “You never think you'll end up in a situation like this, but here we are.”
Mr. Witaschek's attorney Howard X. McEachern shook their client's hand and said, “We're not done.” Mr. McEachern plans to appeal the decision.
I asked the defense attorney for their opinion of the verdict. “Clearly the judge thought that this was overkill — the sentence reflects how they felt about the prosecution of this case,” they replied.
Click here to read about the first half of the day of trial when Mr. Witaschek took the stand in their own defense.
Until the final hours of the trial, both the defense and government focused the case on whether the single 12 gauge shotgun shell that was found in Mr. Witaschek's D.C. home was operable. The judge, however, never ruled on it.
In the afternoon on Wednesday, Judge Morin shook the plastic shell and tried to listen to something inside. They said they could not hear any gunpowder. They then asked the lawyers to open the shell to see if there was powder inside.
(This seemed like a bizarre request since the lack of primer — not gunpowder — would be relevant to the interoperability of the misfired shell.)
Assistant Attorney General Peter Saba said that the government wanted to open the shell but that, “It is dangerous to do outside a lab.”
The prosecutors and police officers left the courtroom to try to find a lab that was open in the afternoon to bring the judge to cut the plastic off the section that holds the pellets. When that proved not possible in the same day, the judge decided to just rule on the bullets.
The 25 conical-shaped, .45 caliber bullets, made by Knight out of lead and copper, sat on the judge's desk. They do not have primer or gunpowder so cannot be propelled. The matching .50 caliber plastic sabots were also in the box.
There was much debate over whether the bullets were legal since D.C. residents are allowed to buy antique replica firearms without registering.
The judge seemed inclined to throw out this charge since they repeatedly asked how the bullets could be illegal if the gun that they go in was not.
During lunch, the government came up with a list from ATF of types of muzzleloader rifles that could be converted to use rimfire ammunition. Not that Mr. Witaschek owned one of these nor was modern ammo at issue in the trial.
Nevertheless Judge Morin said, “I'm persuaded these are bullets. They look like bullets. They are hollow point. They are not musket balls.” They then ruled that Mr. Witaschek had possessed “beyond a reasonable doubt” the metal pieces in D.C.
The judge, however, still seemed to think this was a strange issue for a court. “It's taken four lawyers all afternoon to get through an interpretation of whether or not these are lawful,” they noted.
Before sentencing, Mr. Witaschek addressed the judge.
“I've never been arrested in my life up until this incident,” they said, their voice cracking with emotion. “My use of firearms is strictly recreational. I've never had any criminal intent.”
The business person asked for leniency so that they would not lose their license to practice their financial management company.
“I run the risk of losing my job, my occupation, as a result of this conviction,” they said. “I ask the court not to add to that burden of what's already been done to my life over the last two years.”
(Spc. Adam Meckler, who was also convicted of possession of ammunition, but no gun. When I profiled him, they said that the worse part was going to the police station to be put on D.C.'s gun offenders registry. Read my interview with them last year here: D.C. Arrests Vet for Unregistered Ammunition.)
The nation's capital is overrun with criminals, yet the police and prosecutors continue to waste time and resources to go after law abiding people who inadvertently cross the ridiculous firearms laws.
What makes the situation more dire is that the unelected attorney general for D.C., Irvin Nathan, does not go after their rich, liberal buddies. Just a year ago, Mr. Nathan declined to prosecute NBC's David Gregory for knowing breaking the law against possessing a “high-capacity magazine.” The attorney general said it was not in the interest of public safety.
But when it comes to regular people like Spc. Meckler and Mr. Witaschek, Mr. Nathan believes having ammo but no gun makes them a danger to society.
Good people are being destroyed by these vengeful prosecutions.
Mr. Witaschek and their wife moved to Virginia after their arrest in 2012. On the way out of the courtroom after their conviction, Mr. Witaschek said that the court clerk came up to them privately and said, “I'm glad you don't live in D.C. anymore. These people are nuts about guns.”

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. – Sen. Kurt Schaefer, R-Columbia, sent an open letter to University of Missouri Chancellor Bowen Loftin Monday asking for the release of any possible agreement between the University of Missouri and the Columbia Planned Parenthood affiliate.
Schaefer and the other members of the Interim Committee on the Sanctity of Life have been investigating allegations that Planned Parenthood has been selling fetal tissue for profit. However, the committee has also begun investigating how an ambulatory surgical center (ASC) license was granted to the Columbia Planned Parenthood affiliate, which allowed it to restart its abortion services after three years of not being able to perform abortions for lack of a certified physician to perform the procedure.
The senator specifically asked the Chancellor for any documents between University of Missouri Health Care and Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri, which owns the Columbia affiliate, that may establish an agreement of any kind between the two for the University of Missouri Hospital to “guarantee the transfer and admittance of patients for emergency treatment whenever necessary,” as required by Section 188.205, RSMo.
Schaefer also wants to know the correlation between the University and Dr. Colleen McNicholas, D.O., the abortion physician for Planned Parenthood of St. Louis and who the Department of Health and Senior Services is also in charge of abortions at the affiliate in Columbia.
By state law, the physician performing abortions must have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where the abortions are performed. McNicholas has no such privileges at either the Boone Hospital Center nor the University of Missouri Hospital, only “refer and follow” privileges at the latter.*
Schaefer's other concern is the possibility that state taxpayer funds may in some form be assisting in the abortion process at the Columbia Planned Parenthood affiliate.
“For decades the citizens of the state of Missouri have gone to great lengths to ensure that their taxpayer dollars never enable abortion services in the state,” they wrote in the letter. “The University of Missouri is a publicly funded entity, which last year alone received approximately one half of one billion [$492 million] taxpayer dollars from the state of Missouri. Whether DHSS is relying on the agreement granted by the University of Missouri, as a publicly funded entity, to Dr. McNicholas in order to enable the abortion license issuance is a matter of substantial interest and concern.”
Schaefer gave Loftin until 5:00 p.m. Tuesday to respond and provide the documentation.
The next meeting of the Sanctity of Life Committee will be held Aug. 25 at 1:00 p.m.
* – “Refer and follow” privileges are privileges granted by a hospital to a doctor which stat that said doctor can refer a patient to the hospital or a physician at a hospital and follow their progress, but they are not allowed to treat or admit patients to the hospital that gives them those privileges.
A 60-year-old Lexington man was killed after their bike crashed with an 18-wheeler truck in Porter Square during rush hour Wednesday morning, Oct. 5, according to the Middlesex District Attorney's Office. Bernard Joseph Lavins was pronounced dead at the scene.
The incident happened around 8:08 a.m. on Massachusetts Avenue near Christopher's restaurant, at 1920 Mass. Ave., in the direction of Harvard Square. The truck driver remained on scene.
Lavins' family declined to comment on their death.
Elizabeth Shea, a colleague of Lavins' at Ironwood Pharmaceuticals in Kendall Square, said Lavins' death hit them and others hard.
"Joe was a friend and a colleague here at Ironwood Pharmaceuticals. They were a much adored colleague, with a fantastic mind and a generous spirit. The office is a very somber place. We all knew Joe to be a very enthusiastic year-round bike commuter. They were an advocate of bike safety and a very experienced cyclist. Their commitment to safe riding makes their tragic death all the more chilling," they wrote in a written statement.
Both sides of Mass. Ave. near the crash were closed for most of the day as investigators reconstructed the crash, according to Jeremy Warnick, communications director for the Cambridge Police Department. The area opened up around 4 p.m., in time for the evening commute.
A small group of Cambridge students witnessed the crash, according to an announcement on the Cambridge Public Schools website.
"No students were involved in the crash except as witnesses. Grief counselors are being put in place at the schools students were traveling to when the crash occurred," read the statement. "If your child witnessed or becomes troubled by this incident, please contact the school if you would like assistance accessing help for your student."
This was the second crash in one week in Cambridge between a cyclist and a truck, and the second cyclist fatality this year. A 47-year-old cyclist sustained non-life-threatening injuries after crashing with a tow truck in Kendall Square on Oct. 3.
The first fatality this year happened in June when Amanda Phillips, 27, of Cambridge, was riding their bike in Inman Square and was struck by an open door of a Jeep as the driver was getting out. They were pushed into the travel lane where they collided with a moving dump truck.
In February, a 63-year-old Cambridge psychotherapist was struck and killed crossing the street in Porter Square. Marcie Mitler, who had two sons, died from injuries sustained after being struck by a car at the intersection of Somerville Avenue and White Street.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Oct. 11, the DA's Office had not released any more information on the latest Porter Square crash.
The DA's Office, the Cambridge Police Department and the State Police Collision Analysis and Reconstruction Section are investigating.
People took to twitter in reaction to the fatality. See our Storify below.
THE roadside billboards in some American towns do not advertise fast-food chains or home insurance. Instead, they tell people what to do in case of a drug overdose. Deaths in America from opioids, pain-relieving drugs that include both prescription painkillers such as OxyContin and illegal ones such as heroin, have almost quadrupled over the past two decades. In some states the share of babies who are born with withdrawal symptoms has increased by 300% since 1999; at least 8,000 were born suffering from them in 2013. Each day 91 Americans die from an opioid overdose.
Much of this catastrophe stems from the over-prescription of legal painkillers. In 2015 some 650,000 prescriptions were handed out on an average day. But when prescriptions end, addicts sometimes turn to illicit substances. The latest one that worries experts is a synthetic opioid called fentanyl, which is around 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more powerful than morphine. Most of the fentanyl making its way to America has been made, often legally, in factories in China before being shipped to criminal networks in Mexico and Canada and then smuggled over the border. Thousands of Americans have died from using fentanyl since 2013.

In the face of such numbers, it is always tempting to reach for the comfort blanket of prohibition. The Trump administration is taking a hawkish line on drugs of all kinds. Jeff Sessions, the attorney-general, opposes the legalisation of cannabis. On May 12th they appeared to reverse years of sensible policy that sought to reduce punishment for non-violent drug crimes by instructing prosecutors to pursue the “most serious, readily provable” offences. Efforts are being made to restrict synthetics. In March the government in China, under pressure from America and the UN, agreed to make four variants of fentanyl illegal. Yet such plans will do little to stop the opioid crisis or to curb the threat from fentanyl.

That is partly because the crisis is too far advanced for criminalisation to work as a deterrent. The country has at least 2m opioid addicts. They need treatment and safer places to take drugs. The health-care bill passed by the House of Representatives this month heads in the opposite direction. Its proposals would cut spending and reduce access to medicines.
But prohibition is futile for more profound reasons, too. An iron law of drugs markets, whether for painkilling opioids or recreational highs, is that demand creates supply and just as much as vice versa. Fentanyl is particularly attractive to criminals. Because it is so potent, with only 2mg of the stuff enough to cause an overdose, it is easy to hide in letters and small packages that are sent by post. The rewards are enormous: 1kg of fentanyl costs around $4,000 to buy from China and yields profits of $1.6m on the streets. By contrast, 1kg of heroin costs around $6,000 but is worth a few hundred thousand dollars.
Fentanyl, and its variants, are among hundreds of new synthetic drugs that have flooded the illicit-drugs market over the past decade (see article). New drugs have been emerging at the rate of one a week; in 2012-17, 20 new fentanyl analogues appeared. A market this protean cannot be erased. Crack down in China, and laboratories will appear in Mexico; already some have opened there. Ban one substance, and another will appear. Whack every mole, as Britain has attempted with a law that prohibits any new drug that has a psychoactive effect, and substances get pushed from shops to the internet.
Banning drugs is not just ineffective, it is also counterproductive. Fentanyl is a nasty substance, but prohibiting all illicit drugs, whether they are new or established, prevents the research that could distinguish between those which are more and less harmful. It also leads to topsy-turvy outcomes. Marijuana, which cannot lead to overdoses and which can be used as an effective pain-relief medicine, is classified by the federal authorities in America as a more dangerous drug than fentanyl, which is used in very controlled doses by cancer patients and abused fatally across the country.
It takes guts to legalise drugs when so many are dying from them. But it is better that addicts take safe doses of familiar substances under sanitary conditions than for them to risk their lives enriching criminals. Switzerland followed the legalisation path after a heroin epidemic in the 1980s, treating drugs as a public-health problem. Since then drug-taking and drug-related deaths have fallen. America should follow suit.
The moon Enceladus, one of the jewels of the Saturn system, sparkles peculiarly bright in new images obtained by NASA's Cassini spacecraft. The images of the moon, the first ever taken of Enceladus with Cassini's synthetic aperture radar, reveal new details of some of the grooves in the moon's south polar region and unexpected textures in the ice. These images, obtained on Nov. 6, 2011, are the highest-resolution images of this region obtained so far.The area on Enceladus observed by Cassini's radar instrument does not include the famous "tiger stripes," fissures that eject great plumes of ice particles and water vapor, but covers regions just a few hundred miles away from the stripes. Scientists are scrutinizing an area around 63 degrees south latitude and 51 degrees west longitude that appears to be very rough, a texture that shows up as very bright in the radar images."It's puzzling why this is some of the brightest stuff Cassini has seen," said Steve Wall, deputy team lead of Cassini's radar team, based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. "One possibility is that the area is studded with rounded ice rocks. But we can't yet explain how that would happen."Scientists are also intrigued by an area around 65 degrees south latitude and 293 degrees west longitude, which shows a close-up view of grooved, water-ice bedrock. The new images reveal undulations and other intricate patterns that had not been seen previously. They also now have measurements of the heights and depths of the grooves in this area, with the central groove measuring about 2,100 feet (650 meters) deep and 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) wide. It has slopes of about 33 degrees.These images of Enceladus show some similarity to those obtained of Saturn's largest moon Titan. Titan's large feature Xanadu is also very bright, as are areas surrounding the crater Sinlap. Whether the bright areas seen here are due to the same, or very different, processes will be a subject of discussion as scientists continue to learn more about the moons of Saturn.The Cassini orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The radar instrument was built by JPL and the Italian Space Agency, working with team members from the U.S. and several European countries. JPL is a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. For more information about the Cassini mission, visit: http://www.nasa.gov/cassini and http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov

It's becoming more difficult for people to see how their vote is going to matter in the 2012 election. When states are increasingly passing voter ID laws that mandate voters prove they are citizens or that they are legitimate voters at the polls, while Super PACs are able to field millions of dollars, often from unidentified people, to influence elections, then democracy becomes less of a real thing to many people. A new survey from the Brennan Center for Justice shows majorities of Americans seeing Super PACs as corrupting forces on elections. There's enough Super PAC distrusts in the survey that many said they likely won't vote. Evidently Bonnie Raitt isn't the only person who feels, as they said in Rolling Stone, that “we have an auction instead of an election.” Ad Policy
Voters of color certainly feel that way. In the Brennan survey, African-Americans and Latino Americans were more likely than whites to say they feel discouraged from voting due to the outsized influence of Super PACs, and who can blame them? In many states, voters of color will have to go through the often user-unfriendly process of excavating birth and marriage documents, and then hoping there's a DMV office close by that they can get to between shifts or after work hours, all to get ID cards that they otherwise wouldn't need. Once done, they better hope their address doesn't change (hope they're not evicted, foreclosed upon or otherwise homeless), or that their name doesn't change (hope they don't get divorced), or if they are Latino, hope that their name is recorded correctly, or else they may get turned away after a long wait in line because the ID information doesn't match with the registers.
But before all of that, they have to overcome the idea that their one vote is going to matter as much as the $1 million gift to a Super PAC. They have to also overcome the idea that as a voter they may not have the same access to the elected candidate as the million-dollar donors—many donors who by the way do not have to be identified to the public when voting by bank account, nor do they have to wait in long lines because they're making payments online.
When only about 20 percent of Americans believe the average voter has the same access and influence on candidates as Super PAC big donors, as reported in the Brennan Center survey, and when over a quarter of respondents say they are less likely to vote because of Super PAC influence, there is evidence that democracy isn't working for everybody. Voter ID laws, which supposedly clean up fraud in the system, won't solve that problem, especially when fat-cat donors aren't subject to the same identification regimens.
“I would think that people who are raising so many questions about possibilities of fraud entering the system are as concerned about millions of dollars poured into the system to influence votes,” said Adam Skaggs, senior counsel for the Brennan Center.
Skaggs pointed out that while rules around donor disclosure to Super PACs are in place to make sure that the public knows who it is that's making it rain on independent expenditure committees, there is a way around that by donating to 501(c)4 non-profits, which aren't subject to the same disclosure rules. And many Super PACs have set up nonprofits that act as money launderers, allowing individuals and corporations to give unlimited amounts of money to Super PACs, but washed through the nonprofit cycle so that people don't know who the sources are. Skaggs says the Supreme Court “got it wrong” in the Citizens United decision when they reasoned that corporate expenditures would be fair and transparent because they have to report donor information to the Federal Election Commission. But the justices didn't figure that nonprofits could be set up as middlemen to bring in anonymous donations.
As a result, we have a situation like the Crossroads Super PAC, which has a PO-box nonprofit called Crossroads GPS. The website offers no information on the activities on this “grassroots advocacy organization” because there are none to speak of, unless you count their political ads. The only page on their website that matters is the “Please Donate” page, where Crossroads is happy to inform us that “There are no limits on the amounts that may be contributed to Crossroads GPS by an individual, corporation, union or trade association.” And while donations over $5000 require reporting to the IRS, Crossroads reminds the donor that “the IRS does not make these donor disclosures available to the general public.”
Technically, all nonprofits are subject to the nondisclosure provision. But there are nonprofits that have been doing actual social welfare work for decades that people can donate to so that that work can be continued; and then there are nonprofits created purely to funnel Super PAC money. Why would wealthy donors give to Super PAC–sponsored nonprofits as opposed to directly to Super PACs? Because they don't want to be identified. It's the same reason companies participate and pay thousands in dues to nonprofits like the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)—as Brendan Greeley wrote in Bloomberg Businessweek, they value the secrecy. They want their money to influence policy and candidates, in favor of conservative interests, but they can do without the transparency and accountability.
It's unclear, though, that Super PACs themselves are complying with disclosure rules. The Washington Post reported this week about a mysterious $400,000 donation to the Mitt Romney–supporting Super PAC Restore Our Future. At first, the Super PAC refused to disclose the names of the donors, who made contributions in their company's name. Only after news organizations prodded were the actual donors' names finally revealed. A Restore Our Future spokesperson said the reason the names weren't disclosed before was because of “a clerical error.”
Clerical errors happen all the time when voters are being registered and their votes are counted. But when that happens, it's not called a “clerical error.” It's called “voter fraud.” And it's called voter fraud by the same people who are champions for Super PAC unlimited spending—wealthy conservatives. It doesn't matter how damaging this is for democracy, or that the balance of political power is tipped in favor of the 1 percent, who already had an unbalanced advantage to begin with.
I agree with Skaggs that the non-profit loophole needs to be closed. Considering that legitimate nonprofits have a right to still have undisclosed donations, for legitimate nonprofit social welfare work, they suggest that nonprofits have separate accounts, especially for those who are giving upwards of tens of thousands of dollars for campaign purposes, and that the names of those donors be disclosed to the public. The rules should be adjusted so that those nonprofits that haven't been engaged in campaign spending manipulation aren't penalized. But “as to whether there should be full disclosure on who is spending on ads clearly aimed at voting for or against a candidate, we absolutely should have full disclosure,” said Skaggs.
A coalition of voting rights groups signed onto a letter asking Congress to pass The DISCLOSE Act. The letter states, “It is a cardinal rule of campaign finance laws that citizens are entitled to know the donors financing campaign expenditures to influence their votes, and the amounts they gave.” Maybe the Supreme Court didn't see these problems coming when it made its Citizens United decision, but now the floodgates are open, and if adjustments are not made, democracy will become, as Raitt noted, a series of auctions. Most importantly, though, if conservatives want people to place onerous restrictions on how voters identify themselves at the polls, then they should identify who they are when making fat campaign donations.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With Bill de Blasio taking office as mayor in January, New York City appears poised for a resurgence of liberal policies.

After 20 years of Republican leadership, not only will America's largest city have the most liberal mayor in a generation, helping them implement change will be a progressive-leaning City Council and a longtime liberal ally in the new public advocate.
The city was governed for the last 12 years by Michael Bloomberg, a political independent who was first elected as a Republican, and for eight years before that by Republican Rudolph Giuliani.
To observers as well as Democratic legislators, the last election marked a major change in New York City politics, with a new breed of highly liberal politicians ready to enact a series of progressive policies that would have been dead on arrival under Bloomberg or their predecessor Giuliani.
“It's seen as an opportunity by progressives to do something different,” said Douglas Muzzio, an expert on New York City politics and a professor at Baruch College at the City University of New York. “People projected their frustration, their anxiety, their expectations, their dreams on Bill. In that sense it wasn't dissimilar from the 2008 election of Obama. Now he's got to deliver.”
Pledging to address the gap between the rich and poor that grew wider as the city prospered while those at the bottom of the economic ladder struggled to pay for basic services such as housing and mass transit, de Blasio won a resounding victory in November with more than 70 percent of the vote.
Over the last decade, apartment rents in New York City increased about 44 percent and the cost of a monthly subway card rose by 60 percent.
De Blasio has vowed to set a new tone at City Hall, and their agenda includes reforming police tactics, offering universal access to early childhood education, expanding the city's paid sick leave rules and improving the living standard for the 46 percent of New Yorkers at or below the poverty line.
“I would definitely define this as a movement,” said progressive Democrat Laurie Cumbo of Brooklyn, who was elected to the City Council in November. “This idea that somebody has to be on the bottom so somebody can be on the top, which is somewhat of a global business model, doesn't have to be that way.”
PLAYING IT DIFFERENTLY
The shift in tone in city government is already apparent.
Earlier this month, the City Council took the rare step of rejecting a rezoning of Manhattan's East Side, delivering a blow to Bloomberg and developers who had forcefully backed the plan.
Then, the city's mass-transit agency announced it was cutting its planned fare increases for 2015 and 2017 by nearly half. The agency cited an improved fiscal outlook, but Gene Russianoff, a lawyer and the spokesperson for the New York Public Interest Research Group's Straphangers Campaign, said they saw the move as reflecting a changed political climate.
“They realized in the current political atmosphere it's unsustainable to raise the fare a lot every year,” Russianoff said. “Bloomberg's attitude was, ‘Everything goes up.' I think de Blasio will play it differently.”
One early test for left-leaning politicians will be the race for the next City Council Speaker. Progressive members of the council, who saw their numbers double from 10 to 20 in November, have formed a Progressive Caucus and vowed to vote as a block for the next speaker.
“The mayor-elect has been very clear about their top priorities and they all line up very well with the goals of progressives in the Council,” said Councilman Brad Lander, a co-chairperson of the Progressive Caucus.
On many issues, the liberals will find an ally in the city's next Public Advocate, former councilwoman Letitia James. While James and de Blasio endorsed one another for the respective posts during the campaign, the new public advocate has pledged to keep rigorous checks and balances on the mayor.
James, a champion of minority and women's rights, vocally opposed big development in their section of Brooklyn during their 10 years in the City Council, including the Atlantic Yards development and the recently opened Barclays Center, home to the Brooklyn Nets professional basketball team.
As liberals prepare their political wish lists, the city's Republicans, outnumbered six-to-one by Democrats, are wary.
“We've had 20 years of success under Republican mayors,” said Manhattan Republican Party Chairman Dan Isaacs. “Improved safety, crime is down, business and real estate is thriving. But in some ways we were victims of our success. It's hard to impart to people that the gains we've made could be lost very quickly.”
Muzzio said the challenge now is maintaining the progress logged under Bloomberg while making the city more inclusive.
“Bill isn't a bomb-thrower,” they said. “There's going to be a lot of continuity with Bloomberg. There has to be.”
On Tuesday the Senate voted to advance legislation that will eventually become the funding bill. Sen. Ted Cruz voted no. | AP Photo Cruz warms to Trump
Two months after snubbing Donald Trump at the Republican convention, Ted Cruz is now praising the GOP presidential nominee for inserting themselves in Congress' eleventh-hour negotiations over a government funding bill.
On Wednesday, Trump urged congressional negotiators to delay a U.S. handoff of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, a private-sector, nonprofit organization that manages Internet domain names. And that was enough to prompt Cruz to laud Trump — whom they pointedly declined to back in July when they urged Republicans to "vote your conscience."
Story Continued Below
"Appreciate @realDonaldTrump's support of our efforts to keep the internet free," Cruz tweeted on Wednesday afternoon.
"And we appreciate @tedcruz appreciating @realDonaldTrump. Over to you, @jeffroe," responded Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, referring to Cruz's former campaign manager.
And those warm words came after Roe suggested at a Bloomberg event that Cruz may be rethinking their withheld endorsement.
"I think he'll have an answer before Election Day." Roe said, according to Texas Tribune reporter Patrick Svitek. "To be honest ... watching Donald run a better campaign lately has been helpful to him."
Cruz has made blocking the ICANN transition their central focus of the fall and has urged Republicans to include a rider blocking the action in a must-pass spending bill this month. GOP leaders have been generally supportive of the effort, and negotiators are increasingly likely to include some delay in the government funding measure, which will fund federal agencies through Dec. 9.
"It's still being worked," said Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.). "I don't think it probably resolves anything beyond Dec. 9."
On Tuesday, the Senate voted to advance legislation that will eventually become the funding bill. Cruz voted no.
We've been covering Grant Morrison's first original series from Boom! Studios with artist Dan Mora since it was first announced at San Diego. Klaus will land in stores on November 4th. Morrison has called the six-issue series their All-Star Santa Claus. It looks a bit like St. Nick by way of Game of Thrones and follows in the footsteps of the likes of Glenn Beck‘s The Immortal. Morrison is a proven star in the industry, but I suspect Mora will be a surprising revelation to readers.
USA Today revealed an unlettered preview last week. We have an exclusive look at the first 5 lettered pages alongside the dressed covers by Mora, Frazer Irving, Felipe Smith, and Chris Burnham. For retailers, the final order cutoff for the first issue is today and I suspect a few will be increasing their orders based on these pages.
Oh and a bunch of the covers…

Last week the Creative Freedom Foundation participated in a group briefing and Q&A session with David Walker, NZ's Chief Negotiator in the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement, and officials Angela Strahl and Yvonne Woutersen.
The meeting made it quite clear that, although the details aren't final, we can expect to lose many remix rights and see a greater ‘orphaned works' problem here in New Zealand in exchange for more dairy exports to the U.S. Rather than further protecting artists' rights, this move will prop up a fundamentalist approach to copyright that will drain the pool of works currently accessible to artists who wish to freely build upon them. Our Big Idea article outlines some of the reasons why this is a problem for kiwi artists.
Orphaned works are works whose copyright holder can't be found (hence the analogy to an orphan being unable to find their parent). With digital technology, and the lack of metadata about who owns particular work, this is becoming a major issue worldwide for artists, libraries, museums and archives. Once copyright has expired orphaned work may be freely copied (and therefore preserved) by these institutions. However, with media such as cassette and VHS tapes, floppy disks, and CD-ROMs there is the added time bomb of technology decay that means these works may be lost forever if an owner cannot be located to give permission for the work to be copied. Extending the copyright term will inevitably grow the pool of orphaned works, meaning that those who are trying to preserve our heritage within the law are unable to do so by making copies without the copyright holders permission.
Thankfully, there is a relatively simple solution to the ‘Orphan Works' problem in New Zealand: an opt-in system for any copyright extension. Such a system would keep the existing copyright duration of ‘Life+50 years' but allow anyone who still wants it after Life+50 years to register their copyright with the government.
As you can imagine there are very few copyrighted works still needing copyright (or making money) after ‘Life+50 years'. In fact, this University of Illinois study has found that “Copyright correlates significantly with the disappearance of works rather than with their availability”. Surely, keeping our current copyright term is far more in line with the New Zealand national interest than an extension of copyright. An opt-in system for copyright extension would mitigate this issue, as well as appeasing the US desire to extend copyright terms internationally.
Returning to the meeting, Walker opened with a brief chronological summary of the TPPA negotiations thus far, finishing by unequivocally stating that all countries involved are intent on concluding the agreement by the end of this year (2013).
They carried on to say that some chapters had been concluded, and that others still required work. The IP chapter is one where there is still work to be done. Ministers involved have been tasked with concluding outstanding issues prior to the forthcoming Honolulu meeting.
The week of 18 November has been set aside for meetings that will aim to resolve these unconcluded threads, to a point where they can be put forward as recommendations to the Ministers.
Walker stated that they wanted a deal that was ultimately seen as “being in the New Zealand national interest.” It was emphasised that, in such negotiations, issues must be traded to achieve consensus. The problem is that trading off artistic rights (without gaining anything substantial for artists) in exchange for dairy can make sense in this context. Artists don't have lobby group as powerful as dairy.
Angela Strahl, who is handling the IP chapter, stated that NZ's Parallel Importing abilities are likely to stay unchanged, as is the ability to set our own limitations and exceptions to our domestic Copyright law. However, it was strongly hinted at that an extension of our Copyright Term is inevitable.
As Walker put it: only three of the twelve countries involved in the negotiations currently have a Life + 50 copyright terms (NZ, Canada, and Japan); no-one has signed a trade agreement with the US that hasn't included at least a Life + 70 year copyright term; and if you were to place a bet on what way NZ was going to go, those are some pretty big odds.
Walker also confirmed that the negotiating documents would not be released prior to signing the agreement.
As New Zealand artists, the CFF is opposed to a Copyright Term Extension for New Zealand.
Ricardo Carvalho has become the latest big-name footballer to finalise a move to the Chinese Super League with the Portuguese defender joining Shanghai SIPG.
The experienced centre back has signed a one-year deal with Andre Villas-Boas' side to follow in the footsteps of fellow stars Oscar and Hulk.
Shanghai SIPG have snapped up the former Chelsea and Real Madrid ace on a free transfer after the 38-year-old was released by French outfit Monaco.
Ricardo Carvalho has finalised a move to Chinese Super League side Shanghai SIPG
The former Chelsea defender worked with Andre Villas-Boas during their time in England
CARVALHO'S CAREER 1997–2004: Porto 116 games (4 goals) 1998–1999: Leca (loan) 24 (1) 1999–2000: Vitoria de Setubal (loan) 27 (2) 2000–2001: Alverca (loan) 32 (1) 2004–2010: Chelsea 210 (11) 2010–2013: Real Madrid 77 (3) 2013–2016: Monaco 118 (2)
Villas-Boas, who worked with Carvalho during their time as Jose Mourinho's assistant at Chelsea, previously said of the veteran: 'I have a good relationship with Carvalho, who has a wonderful professional career.
'His CV makes it impossible for me to doubt their considerable stature among their peers. I'm impressed by the composure they showed on their first day of training. Right now he's just training with us. We'll make a decision in due time.'
Carvalho has won major honours throughout their time in European football with the Portuguese winning the domestic title in Portugal, England and Spain.
FIVE HIGH-PROFILE MOVES TO CHINA Oscar - £52m to Shanghai SIPG Carlos Tevez - £71m to Shanghai Shenhua Hulk - £46m to Shanghai SIPG Ramires - £25m to Jiangsu Suning Alex Teixeira - £38m to Jiangsu Suning
They were the oldest player at Euro 2016 as they helped Portugal win their first major honour by making three appearances in France.
Carvalho was part of the Porto side which won the Champions League under Mourinho in 2004 and they followed the current Manchester United boss to Chelsea.
The Blues forked out £20million for them but they repaid the fee by helping the Stamford Bridge outfit to three Premier League title triumphs.
Real Madrid paid £6.7m for Carvalho in 2010, where they once again linked up with Mourinho, before ending their stint in Europe at Monaco.

With November elections approaching, national energy policy is moving to the forefront of the political agenda, and the contrasts between Republican and Democratic priorities couldn't be more stark. While Pres. Obama and supportive Democratic Congressional representatives are intensifying their push for a long overdue overhaul of federal policy focused on clean energies that will be the key to future prosperity and quality of life, Republicans continue to pander to the interests of the oil, gas and coal industry by pushing for continued reliance on fossil fuels.
Shot down repeatedly in the past, a key piece of clean energy legislation--the Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012-- is nonetheless expected to be introduced in the Senate today, Thursday, March 1. New Mexico Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), chairperson of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is expected to announce the bill Thursday morning. Joining them will be Sens. Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.), as well as the president of the American Wind Energy Association and the executive director of the U.S. Clean Heat & Power Association, according to a news report from The Hill.
Linchpin for a proactive, forward-looking federal energy policy
The Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012 would require power utilities to generate 80% of national electricity supply from clean energy sources, such as solar energy, wind energy, geothermal and marine energy, by 2035. Enacting a Clean Electricity Standard would serve as a linchpin for a long awaited federal clean energy policy framework and action plan.
“The 24-page bill employs a straightforward, market-based approach that encourages a wide variety of clean electricity-generating technologies,” Bingaman's office was quoted as saying in a Wednesday email to The Hill.
In a Jan. 31 speech at the open of the 112th Congress, Sen. Bingaman identified four key strategic elements of a strong, proactive clean energy policy framework:
Consistent support for advanced research and development
Ensuring robust domestic demand for clean energy
Support for aggressive deployment, and
Support for domestic manufacturing.
"We have to take seriously the marketplace reality that the high-wage, clean-energy manufacturing of the future will be located both close to demand and in countries with the most favorable clean energy policies. My desire is to see the United States lead the world in renewable energy manufacturing so all of the solar panels and wind turbines that we install around the country are not stamped 'Made in China' or 'Made in Germany,'" Bingaman stated in their Jan. 31 speech. "This is the key reason why I have long supported a Renewable Electricity Standard. We need to provide long-term market predictability for renewable electricity. Our on-again, off-again production tax credits are no match for the comprehensive approaches being put in place by our economic competitors."
Despite support from some Congressional Republicans, the legislation is unlikely to be passed by Congress this year, according to The Hill. That's not to say that the bill, or the issue of the need for a national clean energy policy and action plan, will fade away. On the contrary, clean energy versus continued support for and reliance on fossil fuels are sure to continue to be "hot button" issues right on through the November elections.
While it was going down last year, the online backlash to Kitty Pryde's "Okay Cupid" video (and to their identity in general) seemed like it would drown out their future chances in music—those of a young, soft-voiced white female rapper for whom fragility was a core principle. Thankfully, that's not been the case. Having steeled themselves on Tumblr—see, for example, this recent post on fighting anorexia, and its follow-up, minutes later: "i feel like a warrior for little girls right now!!!!!!!"—Kitty has now released "☠DEAD❤ISLAND☠," the first cut from their forthcoming D.A.I.S.Y. Rage EP. They sound grown-up, stronger but still with soft spots: Bitch, draw your eyebrows on then talk to me/ You don't know why I get blogged. This is the most exciting beat she's rapped over and, against all odds, a pretty great sign for things to come.
Kitty on the song's producer:
@misterlies no it's some random butthead who told me if i wanted to use their song id have to rip it off soundcloud myself so i did. fuck them — ☁alex ♡ locastro☁ (@kittaveli) January 7, 2013
Update 1/31/13: The EP is now available for download, after premiering on Rolling Stone, though nothing else quite reaches the ecstasy of "Dead Island." On Bandcamp, Kitty added, "told u i could FREAKING rap."
Ever since taking office, President Trump has been condemning leaks, leakers and the journalists they leak to.
“I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks,” Trump said in February. “Those are criminal leaks.”
Only days after they took office — as we know from a leak — Trump asked then-FBI Director James B. Comey to consider jailing journalists who publish government secrets.
And just a few days ago, Trump again ranted about leakers who “should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
So, I think we understand the president's position — except that he's in favor of leaks that damage their political opponents. Recall their campaign cry: “I love WikiLeaks!”
(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)
Paul Steiger stakes out the opposite position. The revered former managing editor of the Wall Street Journal (and founder of ProPublica, the investigative nonprofit) put it this way:
“It is not the publishing of these secrets that threatens national security. Publishing these secrets threatens the secret-keepers. It protects the public interest by letting us know what powerful people are doing when they think no one is looking.”
Accepting a journalism award, Steiger summed it up: “We need more journalists revealing more secrets, not fewer.”
He's right. In a government increasingly obsessed with secrecy, and guilty of rampant over-classification, leaks are necessary and, largely, a very good thing.
And although there are legitimate national security concerns in some cases, I'd far rather live in a leaky America than one sealed up tight — with whistleblowers and journalists behind bars.
[Could reporters be hunted down if Trump goes after leakers?]
Let's look back at what we wouldn't know without leaks, bearing in mind that not all leaks are created equal. Some are document dumps; others the result of dogged reporting and the cultivation of confidential sources.
The Pentagon Papers. Perhaps the most famous leak of all, Daniel Ellsberg's decision to copy and hand to the New York Times the secret history of the Vietnam War told Americans that thousands of young Americans had been killed fighting a war that couldn't be won. Was it illegal for this former Pentagon official to steal and publicize the documents? Certainly, though they avoided conviction. Was there a greater good? No doubt.
Watergate. The crimes of Richard Nixon and their aides, as revealed in large part by The Washington Post, brought down the president and sent MANY government officials to jail. Was it wrong for Deep Throat, as FBI official Mark Felt was then known, to guide the investigation? Americans were better off knowing the truth.
Red Cross failures. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the Red Cross raised a half-billion dollar but misused the funds. NPR and ProPublica used leaks and confidential sourcing to show that an ambitious plan to build housing resulted in just six permanent homes. Congressional inquiries and reform followed.
Government surveillance of U.S. citizens. Edward Snowden's leak of documents from the National Security Agency in 2013 allowed the Guardian and The Washington Post to reveal the shocking way Americans were being spied on. As Post executive editor Martin Baron wrote in 2014: “In constructing a surveillance system of breathtaking scope and intrusiveness, our government also sharply eroded individual privacy.”
The inside story of Theranos. Acting on a tip, the Wall Street Journal used confidential sources and documents to reveal how this blood-testing company, a darling of the tech world, was allegedly lying about its practices, misleading investors and putting patients at serious risk. The company's president resigned, and criminal and civil investigations followed.
Without leaks, would we know about the government's drone-warfare program, which has killed many civilians, including children and U.S. citizens? Would we be aware of the CIA's “black sites,” where terrorism suspects were tortured in remote parts of the world?
[Trump's tough talk on leaks is one thing. Their actions tell another tale.]
In recent weeks, leaks informed the public about Michael Flynn's conversations with Russian diplomats about lifting sanctions and indirectly caused Trump to fire their national security adviser. And leaks revealed that the president spilled classified information to Russian visitors to the Oval Office.
Susan Hennessey, a Brookings Institution scholar and former National Security Agency lawyer, told me that these most recent disclosures — involving transcripts of highly classified telephone intercepts — are beyond anything she's seen before. “This information is really, really sensitive,” they said. What's more, they think such leaks are less necessary now that government investigations of Russian election interference are going forward on several fronts.
But even Hennessey sees why they're happening: “One need not condone the leaks to view them at least in part as an adaptive response to a system failure.”
There's little chance that the system, which discourages openness and punishes truth-tellers, will correct itself. Leaks and anonymous sourcing are imperfect, sometimes troubling, and certainly must be handled with great care. But they're as necessary as ever.
Leakers — and the journalists who depend on them — deserve to be honored, not jailed.

Men have been in the business of deciding when it is okay and when it is not okay to rape women for thousands of years. If Missouri Rep. Todd Akin's claim that women's bodies magically fend off rapist sperm or the GOP's meditation on what's really rape sound medieval to you, that's because they are. Check out our timeline of the male notions and common-law statutes that have defined rape over time, and see for yourself which eras the GOP's views on rape line up with:
Property theft: The Code of Hammurabi, one of the first sets of written laws, which dates to about 1780 BC (and contains the old “eye for an eye”), defines rape of a virgin as property damage against their father. If you were married, sorry lady: You were an adulteress. Punishment? You get thrown in the river.
God is a dude: Deuteronomy 22:28-29 says if you rape a virgin, you have to give their dad 50 shekels and take them to the altar.
Et tu, Roma? The Latin root raptus referred to the abduction of a woman against the will of whatever male controlled their life. What the abductor did with them was secondary.
Todd Akin, 1.0: As the Guardian recently pointed out, one of the earliest British legal texts, Fleta, which was written around 1290, laid the foundation for Akin's notion that if you get preggers, you weren't raped: “Without a woman's consent they could not conceive.”
(Mississippi and) The Middle Ages: During the 13th century, the severity of punishment under Saxon law varied according to the type of woman raped—whether they were a virgin, a wife, a widow, a nun, or a whore. That's appropriately medieval. But in the United States, well into the '90s (yes, the nineteen-nineties) some states still had laws that held statutory rape wasn't rape if the woman was “impure“. Mississippi was the last state to ditch such a law—in 1998.
Pre-wave feminism: King Edward I of England was a forward-thinking chap. They enacted the landmark Statutes of Westminster at the end of the 13th century. They redefined rape as a public wrong, not just a private property battle. The legislation also cut out the virgin distinction and made consent irrelevant for girls under 12, laying the basis for the modern principle of statutory rape.
“The wife hath given up herself”: In a treatise on capital crime and punishment from around 1670, English judge and lawyer Sir Matthew Hale wrote this little gem: “[T]he husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by themselves upon their lawful wife, for by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up themselves in this kind unto their husband, which they cannot retract.” The law had quite a bit of traction. A man could legally rape their wife in North Carolina until 1993.
If you were brown: It didn't count, whether you were a slave or a “savage.” And after abolition, the white legal establishment pretty much ignored rape against black women.
Rape to prove rape: Men in common law courts in the 18th and 19th centuries had a bit of trouble agreeing on how much proof a woman had to give to show they aren't lying. Some said the hymen had to be broken. Some said they had to provide evidence of semen. Virginity test, anyone?
“Absolute rape,” kind of like “legitimate rape”: English physician Samuel Farr was pretty certain women couldn't get pregnant without an orgasm. The Guardian quotes the mansplanation from their 1814 Elements of Medical Jurisprudence: “For without an excitation of lust, or the enjoyment of pleasure in the venereal act, no conception can probably take place. So that if an absolute rape were to be perpetrated, it is not likely they would become pregnant.”
You can't thread a moving needle: Or: If you don't squirm a lot, it's not raped. Dr. Lawson Tait, an eminent 19th century gynecologist and medical officer who helped police with criminal investigations, was “perfectly satisfied that no man can effect a felonious purpose on a woman in possession of their sense without their consent.” Said he: “You cannot thread a moving needle.”
The FBI calls rape by its name: As the Post‘s Gerhart explains, the federal government used the “rather prim euphemism, ‘indecent assault,' a phrase that seems as linguistically tortured as ‘legitimate rape,' from the 17th century until 1929, when the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program renamed it like this: “the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against them will.” That definition was still totally 17th century, btw.
Lady rules: Feminists had been fighting to raise the statutory rape age in states since the 1890s (in response, some legislators proposed raising the age of consent to 81). Nonwhite feminists had been fighting for equal treatment under the law. Second wavers gave the movement another push, demanding a range of other expansions to make the definition of rape gender neutral, include date rape, and scrap medieval marital exceptions and virginity requirements.
83 years later: January of 2012: that's when the FBI decided to update its definition of forcible rape. As Kate Sheppard pointed out last year, the year 1929 “was quite a while ago—before the Great Depression, before Mickey Mouse, and before the Empire State Building, to name a few. It was also before roofies had been invented and before date or partner rape were even concepts.” The new, expanded definition includes other forms of sexual assault, other genders, and instances where the “victim is incapable of giving consent because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity, including due to the influence of drugs or alcohol or because of age.”
Backward, ho!: Last year, House Republicans pushed to limit taxpayer funding of abortions by excluding non-“forcible” rapes from federal abortion funding. Their plan failed. But the Republican war on women was just starting to heat up.
“Legitimate rape”: “If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.” Or, as Urban Dictionary puts it: “Rape between one man and one woman who are not married or even acquainted; the only rape sanctioned by the Republican Party.”
A crack team of the Rajasthan police busted on Saturday an extortion racket in which dozens of men were blackmailed with false rape allegations and made to cough up lakhs.
Police's Special Operations Group (SOG) said the gang, run by a group of individuals including two Jaipur-based lawyers who used trafficked women to honey-trap the targets, extorted around Rs 12-15 crore from at least 25 people.
SOG inspector general MN Dinesh said two people were arrested and identified them as Akshat Sharma and Vijay aka Sonu Sharma.
Highlights Police said Anand Shandilya and friends used to get girls from Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
The girls would lure the men into making sexual relations with them.
After this, the gang would threaten them of lodging rape case unless they pay a hefty sum.
The extortion amount, in many cases, would go up to Rs 1 to Rs 2 crore. If anyone refused to pay up, fake case of rape was lodged against them.
In case the money was paid during the trial, the girls would turn hostile.
One of the high-profile targets of the gang was a doctor running a hair clinic in Jaipur.
Naveen Devani, a lawyer, was the kingpin of the operation that they ran with Anand Shandilya (45) and Nitesh Bandhu Sharma.
Devani and Shandilya primarily identified targets, mostly men of repute in local circles, while Akshat, Vijay and several other suspects allegedly trafficked girls from Jaipur, Ajmer and parts of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
The SOG team chanced upon the racket while investigating Shandilya in a separate case.
The modus operandi of the gang was first to trap their ‘targets' and collect evidence with which they could incriminate their targets.
The male members of the gang would approach the ‘victims' posing as mediapersons with the purported “evidence” — including video clippings — and demand hefty hush money, “which in some cases went up to even Rs 1-2 crore”, the IG said. If any person refused to pay money, a fake case of rape was lodged.
During the trial the girl turned hostile in court if the money was paid.
Police initiated investigation against the gang based on a complaint lodged by one of the victims Dr Sunit Soni, who runs a hair transplant clinic in Jaipur.
They spent 75 days in jail after the gang lodged the fake rape case against them when they refused to pay them Rs 1 crore. The doctor's family eventually paid the money, and the girls turned hostile in the court.
Police say the gang has so far committed more than 25 such cons in Jaipur, Udaipur, Alwar, Bikaner, Ajmer and have collected Rs 12-15 crore from these incidents through blackmailing. The gang mostly invested the money from the racket in real estate and splurged on a lavish lifestyle, the police officer said.
All others accused is absconding and a massive manhunt is on to nab them, Dinesh added. To make a strong case against the gang, the IG appealed to all the victims of the gang to come forward and contact the SOG.
“Their identity will be kept confidential,” the police officer assured.

The All-Star break is a time to furiously send trade offers before those bottom half teams check out, or at least try to entice them back to their computers for one last look at their teams so that they might help you improve yours. But we're all in different types of leagues, so instead of a few mixed-league buy low players, I thought I would try to dream up some buy-low players for every situation. I won't cover all of you, that's impossible with the proliferation of fantasy baseball styles these days, but maybe I'll cover more of you.
Matt Holliday
In a shallow redraft league, you don't care about tomorrow. You might care a little bit that Holliday is 36 years old, that has implications for their second half, maybe, their health, maybe. But they look healthy now, other than a slight ankle injury going into the break, and you're not going to get power and batting average cheap like you might with the Cardinals outfielder. He's hitting .241 so maybe you scoff at the idea that they might hit for average, but he's actually underperforming their batted ball velocities and angles. Their batting average on contact is .310, and their expected BACON based on exit velocity and angle is .370, and no batter with more than 300 plate appearances has a bigger difference between the two. In the past we might have said that power takes long to stabilize and the rest of their line looks mediocre, but now we know that he's hitting the ball harder this year (95.5 mph, up from 91.6 mph) and in the right angles (his fly ball percentage is up four points). If they keep up their current swing, they should hit .280 with 15 homers in the second half.
Adeiny Hechavarria
In a deep redraft league, a warm body with a batting average above drowning level is a valuable thing, especially on the middle infield. So here's a middle infielder with no power and little speed hitting .238! At the very least, they should be attainable. And if we can believe their expected work on balls in play — by two different calculations, no less — then better days are coming for the batter who can take inside pitches to the opposite field with the best of them. Andre Perpetua's work says the Marlins shortstop should be hitting .273, and by Alex Chamberlain's numbers, they should be hitting even better than that. Last year, they had three months where they hit poorly, and three months where they hit .280+. Maybe those months are just coming in a different order this year.
Aaron Nola
Depending on how shallow your mixed league is, you may not even have to buy low on our shallow mixed league buy low arm. He's available in 53% of Yahoo leagues. But Nola shows up on too many good lists to ignore him. He's ninth in strikeouts minus walks. They were second in called strikes per pitch recently. He's tied for tenth in exit velocity allowed. Judged by z-scores (two times whiff rate z-scores plus one times ground-ball rate), Nola's curve is ninth in baseball (minimum 200 thrown). It's a great combination of stuff and command, even if the velocity isn't top-shelf. Yes, their mechanics might be a little off. This is a guy that has made a living on clean mechanics in the past, and should right ship shortly.
Jerad Eickhoff
When you're buying low in a deeper league, it has to be less clear than it is with Nola. Eickhoff is not on the first page of strikeout minus walks leaders, that page is full of buy-lows like Michael Pineda, buy lows where people will see you coming a mile away. David Price? Good luck buying low. There are a couple guys on that page that warrant mention, like Robbie Ray and Jon Gray. Yes, you could take a chance on those two NL arms in terrible home parks. It's obvious they have velocity and stuff. And, in the case of Gray at least, the chance to have a fuller arsenal sooner, since Gray admitted to me that he's throwing the cutter, slider, and curve more often, and even experimenting with same-handed, harder changeups. They may click, and he's already a strikeout minus walk monster. But Ray has no third pitch, no command, and nothing to really recommend them other than velocity and strikeouts. He's on the wrong side of the exit velocity list, too. Eickhoff is on the second page of K-BB, has improved their exit velocity suppression more than anyone, and now has a full arsenal with an above average curve, slider, and sinker by whiffs and grounders z-scores. He's doubled their slider usage since earlier in the season and is better than their high-threes ERA indicates.
Cody Allen
Buying a closer is a terrible idea. Don't do it. If you have to, look for a guy with a low saves total on a good team. Because when I looked the kinds of teams got the most saves chances, they went to teams that could score runs and had a good bullpen, and there was little rhyme or reason to it otherwise. The Indians are sixth in the American League in batting over the last month, and their bullpen has been average over the same time frame. This is a competitive team that may look to improve the bullpen but won't pay for a new closer. Oh, and Allen has settled the walk rate, walking only 2.4 guys per nine since June started. He's a top notch closer that may get more saves chances going forward and doesn't have any injury markers.
Michael Conforto
Buying low in a dynasty league, especially for a bat, is near impossible. Everyone wants to wait it out with their young bat. So maybe you can't get Conforto right now, even though he's suffering from a wrist injury and was demoted to the major leagues. The Mets probably don't think Brandon Nimmo is a better solution long term, but they do think he's a better fit for right now, and that could be to your benefit. By their launch angles and exit velos, Conforto ‘should' be hitting .251/.321/.455 instead of .222/.296/.431, and that ignores that their plate approach shows maturity beyond their years. Conforto can cover all parts of the plate and is one of the more balanced hitters against fastballs when right. He's getting right in Las Vegas and nows the time to pounce, even in twelve-teamers where you only keep six or seven hitters. They can make the cut.
Domingo Santana
Here's yet another injured outfielder for your keeper league, but admittedly lower on the list and for deeper dynasties. I've become the Domingo Santana apologist as one chatter had it. It looks so bad that you might be able to pry this bat, since Santana is striking out in more than a third of theirs at bats and using a high batting average on balls in play to support a terrible batting average. He's even probably hurt. But he's still improved their reach rate by a ton, is swinging less often, walking more often, and hitting the ball hard. If you're pointing to that high BABIP or wondering about the power, they should be doing better there. Their expected slugging percentage by walks and homers should be 40 points higher, at least. Even if he's hitting too many balls on the ground, he's lifted them in the past, and he's in a good spot on this exit velocity list. Now's the time to offer your Matt Holliday for their Domingo Santana in a keeper league.
Phil Bickford
Buying pitching prospects? Refer to the rule about closers above. Just don't do it. But if you were to do it, focus on an arm that you like that's not in the top 20 on rankings around the internets. Bickford won't get on those rankings, not with a 92 mph fastball and secondaries that don't make you drool. What they do have is plus command of a rising fastball, an emerging changeup, and a slider that's toughened up recently. Don't target Bickford, especially since you never know if he'll stay in San Francisco's organization, but get them in a throw-in for sure. Let them accuse you of scouting the stats, it's fine. If you want the guy throwing 97 with an awesome breaking ball and a developed change, you'll have to pay Julio Urias prices, right?
Gary Sanchez
The chances are running out for Sanchez, it seems, as he's been in the minor leagues for ages. That's because they signed at 16 as a catcher who couldn't catch. Since he's a little bit big and in the New York organization, he'll give people the Jesus Montero jiggly stomach with the butterflies and all that. But there's a chance he's a better bat that Montero was, and he's definitely better defensively than Montero. After talking to the catcher about their defensive approach at the Arizona Fall League last year, I'm convinced that the next chance Sanchez will get is a long one, and that Brian McCann is destined for some part-time work at first base or DH in the near future. Not like Sanchez did well in the Futures Game in order to hype their stock, or is showing up on mid-season top 50 prospect lists.

Just over 10 miles south of Asheville, within sight of my mother's home, a large coal plant sits on the picturesque banks of Lake Julian. Duke Energy built this plant in 1964, a daily fixture of life in South Asheville, and operates it to this day. Its plumes of opaque white steam serve as a reminder that Western North Carolina is not the Edenic utopia it appears to be.
The history of coal production in the United States is complex. Coal was, and in some cases still is, the livelihood of many people, especially those in Appalachia and certain regions of Pennsylvania, because it provides a cheap source of energy. However, this all comes at a cost, and the cost is great. Coal has led to great loss of life through mining accidents, documented environmental degradation and something akin to perpetual indentured servitude in coal towns.
I recently visited the Anthracite Heritage Museum in Scranton, Pa. There I saw how “big coal” used recent European immigrants as fiscal fodder with little regard for the safety of the workers or the health of the environment. Duke Energy showed me that this kind of corporate behavior is not limited to the Gilded Age.
Duke Energy has a large presence in much of the Southeast and generates power using nuclear, oil, hydro and coal plants. Duke Energy owns and operates 16 coal plants in the Southeast, including the one on Lake Julian. The usage of coal for the production of energy is controversial for more than just the greenhouse gases that coal plants emit. When coal is acquired using mountaintop removal, mining causes widespread erosion, destroys local ecosystems and endangers public health. Some of the coal Duke Energy uses to fire its plants has been acquired through mountaintop removal mining.
Duke Energy has caused harm to surrounding communities through negligence as well. In 2014, Duke Energy spilled 50,000 to 82,000 tons of coal ash in the Dan River near Eden, N.C. This spill was the third-largest coal ash spill in U.S. history. The environmental damage was widespread, and Duke Energy was investigated. After a year of legal proceedings, Duke Energy was fined over $100 million. This is arguably a small fine for a company the size of Duke Energy.
Duke Energy, much like the Koch brothers, is very politically active. From 2008-10 Duke Energy spent more money lobbying politicians, including North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, than it paid in income taxes.
Before the investigation was handed over to federal authorities, McCrory's administration was in charge of the investigation of the coal ash spill in the Dan River.
The situation with Duke Energy may seem bleak at times, but there have been successes. The first example is the proposed electrical power station to be built within 300 feet of Isaac Dickson Elementary School in Asheville. This power station has been widely opposed by parents who fear for the safety of their young children. Their fears are not unfounded; as recently as May 2015, an electrical substation run by Duke Energy exploded and caught fire. After months of work, a grassroots effort by parents and concerned citizens has persuaded Duke Energy into reconsidering the site of this substation and delaying construction until 2017.
The second major success is Duke Energy's recent decision to cancel its plans for the Foothills Transmission Line and Substation. The controversial transmission line would have cut through the mountains in Western North Carolina and Upstate South Carolina and caused extensive damage to the surrounding natural ecosystem, tourism economy and home values. This crisis has been averted due to the vigilance of Western North Carolina residents.
The abuses of Duke Energy, and many large corporations like it, ought not surprise us. Duke Energy is a helpful archetype to understand a deeper ideological issue that plagues our society. I'm going to refer to this as The Priority of Profit. I believe that The Priority of Profit is the root of much systemic evil in our society.
The Priority of Profit is valuing profit above all else. Money is merely a means to the acquisition of goods and services. Profit is just a surplus of money. Every system of values is oriented toward some “good,” and growth is the goal of The Priority of Profit. This value system undergirds our capitalist society. It says, “I'll help my fellow man, as long as it is profitable,” and “I'll protect the environment, as long as it is profitable.” The problem with this is that capital and profit have no intrinsic value. This is because capital is a tool that was implemented so that goods and services could be traded at a standardized value. Capital and, by consequence, profit are merely placeholders. Therefore, they cannot be that toward which society is oriented.
What are these comprehensive goods that society is oriented toward? This is obviously a complicated question, but they are goods that we desire in and of themselves. Let's take a worker at the Duke Energy coal plant. They or they probably go to work to make money to spend on providing for their family, going on vacation, visiting an art gallery or on any number of things the worker values. The workers probably have the best of intentions, a simple desire to acquire some capital to put toward the goods that they value. We can see then that capital is already lower in value than the many things that one spends it on. Even if they don't immediately spend their money but instead put it in savings or stuff it under their mattress, they are still serving a higher good. Savings serve the higher good of security or a future purchase. A large bank account number serves the higher goods of power and prestige.
The goods we each value are varied and controversial, but I still think two points can be made by meditating on goods. First, profit is not a good itself and therefore cannot be that which an economy is oriented around. Profit as the highest good will eventually swallow or snuff out other goods. When this happens, there is no point to having capital or making profit because one has no goods toward which to put capital to use. Second, there are certain goods that are necessary for other lower goods to be realized and which almost everyone values. These are human beings, the planet and the aesthetic goods. These three may seem to come into conflict but are actually in perfect harmony.
For our purpose, I will assume that the reader believes that human beings are of value. I will also assume that everyone reading this is a human being, therefore it is in your best interest to believe in the value of human beings. When one values human beings, the value of the planet is easily demonstrable because human beings live here. If we mismanage our natural resources and people begin to suffer, as is the case with global warming, the destruction of croplands by erosion due to mountaintop removal coal mining, and any other imbalances that environmental degradation causes to our delicate ecosystem, we are harming human beings. Therefore, if you believe in the value of human beings, you are also asserting the value of the health of the natural environment.
Aesthetic goods are those which we enjoy because they are beautiful, lovely or moving. A mountain vista, a beautiful poem or majestic wildlife are all things we enjoy for aesthetic reasons. I will not deny that cities have their own aesthetic beauty, but a bank or apartment complex has never taken my breath away. A coal plant, like the one across the street from my mother's house, has never brought me to tears, but the view from atop Black Balsam Knob has. We must flight attendant and protect natural beauty so it can be shared and enjoyed for future generations. I want waterfalls and wetlands, not shopping malls and coal plants.
In 1964, when the Lake Julian coal plant first started producing power, U.S. Rep. Roy Taylor described it as a powerful mean “to conquer want and drudgery.” This comment struck me. I felt that it perfectly represented the value system that I have been summarizing. A value system that prioritizes growth, often termed industrial progress, above all else. But what good is growth or riches if you destroy the “goods” on which you would spend your riches? If the world becomes a wasteland of coal plants, polluted lakes and melted ice caps, what good is money?
The only way to protect the goods toward which society is oriented is to prioritize them above profit. This is something that Duke Energy has not done. My challenge to you is one that speaks a language that Duke Energy will understand: divestment. Rid yourself of stocks, bonds and other investments in Duke Energy. This is a form of nonviolent coercion that hits Duke Energy where it hurts — in their coffers.

People everywhere have been organizing a more ethical economy, but they work in relative isolation, fragmented by geography, sector, and even organizational form.
Many organizations collect information about a small piece of these efforts. In every situation, there is another organization for which that information overlaps. In every case there is an opportunity to share that will strengthen all the organizations participating.
Sharing requires effort, it requires trust, and it requires infrastructure. The Data Commons is a cooperative of organizations that are sharing – sharing the costs of this effort, trusting each other with their information, and building infrastructure to make sharing is easy.
Members of the Data Commons Cooperative are principled economic organizations that want it to be easy to share with each other, and with the world, in the movement for a more ethical economy.
Examples of information overlap
Uniting the movements
The Data Commons Cooperative is a movement-building organization, owned and controlled by cooperative development centers, federations, solidarity economy groups, and others, who want to maintain robust, accurate, useful platforms for sharing information. The cooperative gathers information and creates tools that make it easy for members to access each other's data, and broadcast information to the public.
Pooling our information will enable the movement's size and economic significance to be measured. Contributing information to the Data Commons will allow us to amplify the scope and impact of our activities.
An accurate, current, durable database
The cooperative's first major initiative is to create a decentralized database of entities working toward an ethical economy. This database is a common, a shared resource that members contribute to, glean from, and help maintain. Updates made to the Data Commons at any time, by any organization, are sent throughout the cooperative, creating the most accurate and up-to-date directory the movement has seen. Contributions to the directory are decentralized with a wiki interface. You can make the updates, or email to your constituency to request they update their listing, decreasing your labor time.
www.find.coop hosts one of several online directories that the Data Commons supports
Planning for resilience
Movement directories have a weakness: despite great effort to create them, they steadily lose freshness and data quality. GEO's An Economy of Hope: Annotated national directory of worker co-ops, democratic ESOPs, sustainable enterprises, support organizations & resources, was an impressive collection when printed in 2000, but 10 years later is closer to movement ephemera than resource. A similar thing could be said of the U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives' 2008 Democracy at Work Directory – by 2011, half of the bookstores listed were no longer operating. Even the University of Wisconsin's Research into the Economic Impact of Cooperative's data from 2009 is beginning to lose data quality. A lot has happened since 2009. Right now, there is a tremendous amount of mapping and directory-making – we want to make sure that energy is not made irrelevant in a few years. Unlike other directories, the Data Commons will be resilient, always improving in accuracy as the movement grows and changes. Contributors may come and go, but there is resilience in the shared task of maintaining the information. However, this means that it will be more complex to build.
Sharing also means reduced labor redundancy and reduced labor costs. The Data Commons can send automatic reminders to your constituency to update their information, and alert you if they do – a simple way to keep up-to-date with changes in your membership. Alerts can be sent to you if new initiatives in your area are added, no matter who adds them, allowing you to reach out quickly to integrate them into your efforts.
Building for long term resilience can look excessive in the short term - but it is still a good idea. (From http://xkcd.com/974)
Member-directed features and tools
Being a Data Commons Cooperative member means directing the development of the most useful tools for your organization and for the movement. Features will expand over time and with the growth of the membership. In addition to several active online directories at www.find.coop, the founding members have chosen four key projects to develop in 2012, detailed later in this document.
Database management and software development are challenging, and sometimes prohibitively expensive activities for small organizations working toward social change. The critical mass of regional organizations that have begun to pursue cooperatives and principled economic initiatives, and new-found cross sector alliances make it a unique moment to work together. The cooperative cannot flourish without a broad membership, but can reduce costs and make an impact if we work together.
How shared data and governance flow through the cooperative
Sharing data
Members of the Data Commons contribute their organizational listings to the cooperative in whatever format they are using – spreadsheets, database programs, mailing lists. The cooperative then formats it for the commons, assessing the data for both technical and legal concerns, and gets clarity on what the member wants shared and what they do not. Then infrastructure is set up for the data to be shared among the membership and, if the member desires, for the data to be given an open license and made public.
Creating tools for the movement and the memberships
The Commons take all the contributed data and generates useful features for the movement and the public – directories, guides, maps, marketplaces – whatever the cooperative has built. In addition, it alerts individual businesses by email that they are being listed and offers them a chance to update their information. Any time an individual organization makes an update, the umbrella organization for their region or sector is alerted. Members can also opt in to receive updates from any new listing in their region or sector, or from any other member or source. These tools are made open source for other groups to develop and improve.
Governance
Members govern the maintenance of the Commons, oversee administrative staff and contracted programmers, and direct the development of new features. This means deciding on and funding the most useful tools for the movement and for the members and their mission.
The five month long coalition between Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI) and the Qaumi Watan Party (QWP) in Khyber Pakhunkhwa province has fallen apart.
The PTI had emerged as the largest political party in the province in the general elections in May, and formed a provincial government with three coalition partners – the QWP, the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) and Swabi's Awami Jamhoori Ittehad Pakistan (AJIP).
The coalition broke down last week over allegations made by the PTI that two QWP ministers were involved in corruption. After a strong advisory sent by PTI chief Imran Khan on November 13, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Pervez Khattak sacked two ministers – Bakht Baidar and Ibrar Hussain Tanoli, both belonging to the QWP – over charges of corruption and poor performance.
The party was warned twice over the allegations, Khan said in a statement.
The QWP boycotted provincial cabinet meetings in response. Then, its provincial president and senior minister Sikandar Sherpao announced the party was parting ways with the PTI. They said the Tehrik-e-Insaf had made the allegations to divert attention from their failure to deliver.
[quote]”There is a difference between organizing a public rally and running a government”[/quote]
PTI leaders say the sacking of the two ministers had been widely hailed by the public, and the move may help the party significantly in the upcoming local elections. “There is an agreement within the party that the ministers and advisers who are engaged in corruption should be relieved of their responsibilities,” said Abdul Quayyum Kundi, a senior PTI leader.
But analysts say the rift may have nothing to do with corruption. “The PTI and the JI are coming closer on a number of issues and the QWP does not fit in,” said Ijaz Khan, a political analyst who teaches at Peshawar University.
One leader of the QWP said their party did not agree with its coalition partners on what they called a policy to appease the Taliban, the decision to block NATO supplies to Afghanistan passing through the province, and removing content about Pashtun leaders Bacha Khan and Ghani Khan from school textbooks.
The Sherpao faction of the Pakistan People Party formally renamed itself Qaumi Watan Party (QWP) in October 2012, after several leaders of the Awami National Party (ANP) and various leftist and civil society groups joined them. They began Pashtun nationalist politics with a new flag and a new manifesto.
Media reports citing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leaders say Afghan President Hamid Karzai asked Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in their recent meeting to appoint QWP chief Aftab Sherpao the governor of Khyber Pakhunkhwa.
The departure of the QWP's 10 MPAs from the treasury benches will increase the strength of the opposition and would make the PTI government more vulnerable, analysts say. Tehrik-e-Insaaf has 53 seats in the provincial assembly, while its coalition partners the JI and the AJIP have eight and five seats respectively. Two independent candidates are also supporting the coalition. This takes the ruling alliance's combined strength to 68 in a house of 124 MPAs.
Ijaz Khan said the PTI might want to get overthrown deliberately, prompted by the consideration that it has been unable to deliver in the province, which it had initially thought could be made a showcase for its performance. “It wants to go down with a populist cause.”
Senator Zahid Khan, ANP's central information secretary, also believes Imran Khan is trying to become a “political martyr”. “Initially there were reports that the PTI is going to sack 11 ‘corrupt ministers',” they said, but Imran Khan chose to take action only against the ministers belonging to the QWP.
Lehaz Ali, a Peshawar-based journalist, said Imran Khan had promised during the general elections to solve the problems of the people of the province in 90 days. “The PTI leadership has realized that there is a major difference between organizing a public rally and running the government.”
PML-N's central vice president Engineer Amir Muqam said their party would continue to be in opposition in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but will not help anyone destabilize the provincial government.
“After the separation of the QWP, even a little turbulence can result in the collapse of the coalition, but the PML-N does not want to become part of such un-democratic moves,” they said.
Reports in local media say the Pakistan People's Party may join the ruling coalition in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Former labor minister Sher Azam Wazir is speaking to PTI leaders, observers say, and their son Fakhar Azam, a PPP MPA from Bannu, organized a protest demonstration against drone attacks and NATO supplies in their hometown.

COLUMBUS, Ohio – While they were away, their coach worried. How couldn't it? When Braxton Miller came back, would they be ready, would they be sharp, would they be a quarterback ready for the next step?
Would nearly three whole games on the sideline with a knee sprain set them back?
“I was certainly worried,” Ohio State offensive coordinator Tom Herman said this week. “I don't know that it did. Maybe a little bit mentally, just seeing the game over and over again and seeing coverages live and all those things. From a physical standpoint, it didn't and from a preparation standpoint, it didn't.
“I don't think he's been set back as much as I was worried that they would be.”
After returning with a four-touchdown performance against Wisconsin on Saturday, Miller looked relaxed and confident after practice Wednesday while talking with reporters. With the No. 4 Buckeyes playing at No. 16 Northwestern on Saturday, the quarterback questions are done.
Miller has played barely more than two games, while the Buckeyes are ready for game six. And they don't feel it has hurt them at all.
They did admit they thought a bit about their Heisman chances taking a hit. Those are games and chances at piling up stats that he'll never get back.
“(It was ) on my mind a little bit,” Miller said. “Just little things that you think about while you're sitting out. But the big games always count, I feel like.”
This is a big one. And he's ready - knee, arm and mind.
Herman thought it was the mental side of Miller's game that maybe showed the most rust against the Badgers, when they read the defense incorrectly a few times.
“There's only so much you can do in drills and in the film room, where the live bullets are necessary to gain that experience,” Herman said. “Maybe that's part of the reason they did have a few misreads that I felt shouldn't have been, (that) were too easy to miss is a better way to put it.”
The quarterback didn't have any doubts about their head, though. They said they stayed sharp while they were out by doing the same things that backup Kenny Guiton usually does behind him, taking shadow reps and thinking through the game.
“I felt pretty good,” Miller said. “I didn't miss a beat. Every practice I was out there with the guys and going over the coverages. Even though I wasn't practicing, I made sure I still got my mental reps.”
Five weeks into the season, the Buckeyes have reached this conclusion about their No. 5 – after a preseason filled with praise for their passing, and a nonconference schedule short-circuited by their sprained left MCL, Ohio State is fine. Miller is fine. And maybe he's even a little fresher at the start of October than they normally would be.
“Man, after the game I was really sore,” Miller said with a smile. “I just feel comfortable where I'm at, coming back off the knee injury and going out there with the guys.”
They believe they and they guy can attack a Northwestern defense that ranks 117th in the nation in pass defense, Miller's eyes lighting up a bit while mentioning the Wildcats' coverage. “We've got good plays for it,” Miller said. And the fact that the Wildcats have 10 interceptions? “Who?” Miller asked. Northwestern – 10 interceptions, including four returned for touchdowns. “Really? It doesn't matter,” Miller said, confident that going against the Buckeyes defense in practice will have them ready. After one week back, the quarterback has no doubts. Urban Meyer likes where Miller is now, too. But they liked where the quarterback was while just getting ready for the game a week ago.
“I thought their preparation for the game was one of the best he's had,” Meyer said. “His practice was one of the best he's had as far as Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday. And I thought their accuracy on the deep ball was outstanding. … I thought they did well.”
Miller sounds like a guy ready to do even more.

A woman who was caught up in a police raid has described the "frightening" moment officers ordered them out of a west Belfast house at gunpoint.
Armed police targeted the property at Aspen Walk in Twinbrook in the early hours of Wednesday after a man was shot in the leg in nearby Glasvey Drive.
An officer pointed a gun to a man's head during the Aspen Walk operation.
Two men were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. The woman who witnessed the raid was not detained.
They were first to leave the house when armed police ordered all those inside to come out one by one.
The woman, who did not want to be identified, told BBC Newsline: "They told us all to put our hands up in the air and everybody to walk out, one at a time and 'drop your weapons'."

They described seeing "red dots" from the police weapons as they came out of the house.
"I was really, really frightened," they added.
The unarmed woman said they were holding a mobile phone and one of the officers told them to put their "weapon" down.
The armed response unit was investigating the Glasvey Drive shooting in which a 41-year-old man was seriously injured.
A police helicopter was deployed before the suspects, aged 25 and 35, were arrested.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- It looks like the Jacksonville Jaguars finally have a role for rookie linebacker Myles Jack.
Coach Gus Bradley said Monday that Jack will play more Otto -- what the team calls its strongside linebacker -- going forward. Jack started at that spot in the Jaguars' 30-27 victory over Indianapolis on Oct. 2.
"He did some really good things [against the Colts]," Bradley said. "There's a couple plays [where they made mistakes]. They have to understand that when teams see that on tape they'll keep attacking him, so we need to see those corrections made.
"We'll continue to evaluate that [and] see how it goes this week."
Myles Jack "did some really good things" against the Colts, coach Gus Bradley said. David Rosenblum/Icon Sportswire
Jack had four tackles and a pass breakup while subbing for starter Dan Skuta, who was out with a hip injury.
Skuta practiced on Monday, and early indications are that they will be able to play on Sunday in Chicago, so how a rotation with Jack would work -- if there is one -- will play out throughout the week. Skuta also has taken reps at the Leo (pass-rushing end) position.
The Jaguars started Jack at middle linebacker so they could learn the defense behind starter Paul Posluszny. They spent all camp and most of the preseason there until the Jaguars moved them to weakside linebacker for the final preseason game. Jack didn't start working at Otto until the week before the Jaguars' game against Indianapolis.
However, the Otto position really doesn't fit Jack's strengths as a coverage linebacker. Plus, the Otto goes off the field when the Jaguars are in nickel, so Jack generally won't be on the field a lot because the Jaguars are in sub defenses about half the time. That package uses two linebackers, and Bradley said middle linebacker Paul Posluszny and weakside linebacker Telvin Smith are playing at a very high level, so they don't want to take them off the field.
Still, getting Jack on the field at Otto is progress. Jack had played mainly special teams through the first three weeks, with the exception of getting reps on defense in the fourth quarter of the Jaguars' 38-14 loss to San Diego in Week 2.
The First Amendment has no place in Superior Court Judge Howard M. Shore's courtroom, not when it comes to vandalism with water soluble chalk.
Today the trial began in the case of a San Diego man who is being charged with 13 counts of vandalism for writing anti-big-bank slogans with washable children's chalk on a sidewalk outside of three Bank of America branches in Mid-City.
On one side sat Jeff Olson, the 40-year-old political activist who protested against the bailout of the big banks early last year. On the other side was Deputy City Attorney Paige Hazard and law student and city attorney employee William Tanoury. Also accompanying Hazard were two other representatives from the City Attorney's side.
For Olson, and any free-speech advocates and political activists, the day couldn't have gone much worse.
Judge Shore granted Hazard's motion to prohibit Olson's attorney Tom Tosdal from mentioning the First Amendment, free speech, free expression, public forum, expressive conduct, or political speech during the trial.
"The State's Vandalism Statute does not mention First Amendment rights," ruled Judge Shore.
The trial, stated the judge, should only focus on whether or not Olson is guilty of vandalism and not what their motivations behind the vandalism were. Shore cited the case, Mackinney v. Nielsen 69 F.3d 1002 (9th Cir.1995), where a man was acquitted after a court ruled that use of chalk was not considered vandalism. The law was later changed to define vandalism as defacement "with graffiti or other inscribed material."
After the ruling, during recess, Olson exited the court breathing deep breaths.
"Oh my gosh," they said. "I can't believe this is happening."
Tosdal exited the courtroom shortly after. "I've never heard that before, that a court can prohibit an argument of first amendment rights"
Arguments are set to be heard tomorrow morning, after the jury is selected.
MomZette Feminists Plan Their ‘Day Without a Woman' Meanwhile, wives and moms who are dedicated to their families will continue their amazing work
Feminist nurses will leave their sick patients; feminist bus drivers will abandon their riders; and feminist scientists will leave their labs — according to reports of a worldwide “Day Without A Woman” being planned for March 8.
Yet in contrast to these angry, defiant people — dedicated moms, grandmothers, wives and caregivers will continue to do what they have always done: keep their families running.

“These angry women are good at either showing up in mobs, or disappearing completely,” said one mom of three from Topsfield, Massachusetts. “I am a feminist in that I want equal wages and opportunities, but it seems wildly premature to expend all this energy just a month into Trump's presidency. Plus, what in the world would my kids do if I took a day off from being a mom?”
On this general strike, planned to show what a day without women would look like, prepare for millions of women to stay in their jammies watching Netflix.
“In the spirit of women and their allies coming together for love and liberation, we offer a Day Without a Woman,” a statement from the organizers read. “We ask: Do businesses support our communities, or do they drain our communities? Do they strive for gender equity or do they support the policies and leaders that perpetuate oppressions?”
[lz_ndn video=31951567]
“I found the Women's March to be an embarrassment for women, and I see this Day Without a Woman to be embarrassing in a different way,” said one mom of four from the Boston area. “No one is saying women aren't important, which is what absenting themselves from work implies the message from the White House is. I think these women are just anxious to cause a stir in any way possible. Want to really make a difference?” they continued. “March to raise money for hungry children in America. March for American families who are struggling with childcare, putting food on the table, and accessing health care after Obama's eight years in office.”
The terms of the strike and how it will actually be carried out aren't clear yet, but organizers said they would be sharing more information over the coming weeks.

The “Day Without A Woman” strike will echo the “Day Without Immigrants” strike Thursday across the nation.
That strike calls for immigrants not to go to work, spend money, or even send kids to school, as The Washington Post and others reported. The strike reportedly is a response to President Donald Trump's comments against immigrants and their plans to build the Mexican border wall — and to exercise extreme vetting for those who enter the U.S.
Related: This Mom Turned Struggle into an ‘Honor'
Lost in all this striking is the fact that Trump supports legal immigration — and is a vocal advocate for women and families. It's both easier and more provocative for angry, hysterical feminists to march and strike against what could be in the future, than wait and see what will likely be — higher wages due to a robust economy and increased national safety for themselves and those they love.
And if women think that Trump is threatening Planned Parenthood and reproductive rights — they might want to investigate just how much Planned Parenthood really cares for them and their mental and emotional future.
Come on, women — this is a sign of a society in moral decay.

A new investigative Live Action video shows testimony from a woman named Sue Thayer, a former Storm Lake, Iowa, Planned Parenthood manager, who explains: “I trained my staff the way that I was trained, which was to really encourage women to choose abortion — to have it at Planned Parenthood, because it counts towards our goal.”
What was the prize for reaching the abortion goal? A pizza party. “It sounds kind of crazy, but pizza is a motivator [for getting the abortion numbers up],” Thayer is heard explaining.

Come on, women — this is a sign of a society in moral decay. At least take your day off to search your heart and really determine if this is the numb and willingly blind culture you want to advance.
As far as headlines go, that one must grab your attention. How crazy does this sentence sound? Did Toonami jump the gun on Attack on Titan Season Two? I'm sure some of you are thinking “how could Toonami jump the gun on any series?” When something as anticipated and requested as Attack on Titan is available, you go for it as soon as possible. You promote it like crazy and play it for fans every week. For some reason, people aren't coming in droves to watch this series. It has barely reached over 900,000 total viewers when you look at traditional numbers (as fans are not privy to know what the viewing numbers are on streaming platforms). It's been happening a lot, and while I'm not worried about the overall product, I'm puzzled at what has transpired since Attack on Titan has returned to television.
Today is your last chance to vote for your favorite #AttackOnTitan recipe! Which one will sate the titans?! https://t.co/pyMNeaoEJK pic.twitter.com/e6VT2Kd28K — Funimation (@FUNimation) June 21, 2017
I think what I didn't expect was the massive difference between those who watched this series subtitled over watching it in English. Editor and Chief of Toonami Faithful (“Sketch”) mentioned in a podcast (yet to be released) that the difference between those who have pirated the subtitled version of Attack on Titan as to the English dub is more than 10 to one. That's massive, as it paints a picture that fans are far more interested in seeing the subtitled version of this series. Now that isn't because of the whole subs vs. dubs argument (even though that might be part of it which I'll discuss later). I just think Attack on Titan is one of the weirdest cases of popularity or lack thereof.
We begin with how long of a wait it was to have the second season ready for its audience. It took over three years for season two to come out! During that time, the wait disheartened fans who probably decided to move on to other series to invest in or left anime altogether. Only those who kept up with the manga were rewarded in learning the mystery of the titans. So fans would either read to see what was happening, wait patiently for the next season rumored to happen at some point, or just stop caring entirely. The casual fans that Attack on Titan were able to sweep up, ended up losing interest and moved on to other “fads” that became popular during the lull. I'm sure some came back when season two was announced, but I don't think as many casual fans cared to return.
Now fast forward to today, where the second season is in full swing (and finished its run in Japan). Fans have been rushing toward Crunchyroll when the newest episode of Attack on Titan was released. That release was initially three weeks ahead of what Toonami could play. Plus, throw in a couple of marathons, and they're now four weeks and soon five weeks behind. That will delay fans from seeing what happens in what they might consider a timely fashion. I theorize that because it was already ahead by three weeks on Crunchyroll, fans just couldn't wait and had to be up to date with Attack on Titan. That might speak to how anime fans have become more and more of the perfect example of instant gratification, but if it's a series you've waited for so long, I understand wanting to be up to date as quickly as possible. But because of that head start Crunchyroll had, fans ran toward them instead of waiting for Toonami.

I ultimately put this on FUNimation for deciding not to do a same day dub release of Attack on Titan Season Two. Yes, 10 a.m. on Saturday was when Crunchyroll released the newest episode of Attack on Titan (much earlier than 12:30 a.m.). But I have a feeling that if FUNimation produced the dubbed episodes for Toonami the same day it was being released in Japan, I think things would be different. Fans would only have to wait hours instead of weeks, which might have been a short enough wait for fans to simply wait for Toonami. I understand how much running around the company had to do to dub this series as quick as they did even though it was behind the Japanese broadcast. However, My Hero Academia has been getting a “same day” dub, and I wonder if it'd been better overall if they decided to go with Attack on Titan instead of My Hero Academia. Maybe it was no feasible but there may have been some way to pull off a same day dub for Titan. One can only speculate.
What also has hurt Attack on Titan was the English script (of season one) that has been called into question by many. I think people have enjoyed the subtitled dialogue more than the English script. People have criticized the screaming heard in the dubbed version and aren't fans of the scriptwriter for the series (that being J. Michael Tatum for part of it). Personally, I had no gripes with either and think that people just go after the scriptwriter as a way for them to say how FUNimation should scout them as a future writer. It's easy to be an armchair quarterback, and I think that's what a lot of critics of the English dub are doing. Is it perfect? No. But the constant criticism I've seen for it certainly doesn't help the dub gain more fans.
It's just crazy thinking that Toonami might have acquired Attack on Titan too fast considering fans want the block to get English dubs as quickly as possible (which they did with this series). They acquired this series so quick that they were airing promos with Japanese audio. Toonami and FUNimation busted their butts to get this dub ready for television. Talking with Matthew Mercer back in A-Kon, the craziness and hard work that has been put into this dub is nothing short of amazing. It just might have been a better move to wait till Attack on Titan finished its run in Japan. The heart might have grown fonder had they waited on the English dub till after the initial push ended. Perhaps more fans might have gone to Toonami to rewatch it and check out the dub but the mere month difference has the show too fresh in fans memories to revisit so soon. Leaving only new viewers and the most dedicated Toonami viewers to tune in as the series airs on the block.
Besides the dub sounding pretty impressive so far, this season has been fantastic. I have watched the entire season subtitled, and the acclaim that season two is grabbing has to put a smile on a lot of fans' faces. The artwork has looked the same or better and the creepiness seems to have risen to greater heights. More things felt accomplished this season, and it didn't take multiple episodes to do that. The story moved along at a much better pace, which made things more enjoyable to the viewer.
Hindsight is only 20/20. How could Toonami predict all that's happened with Attack on Titan considering how it's massively popular and somehow divisive. Anime fans and fans of the series couldn't wait and since the subtitled version was at least three weeks ahead and I think more fans would rather be up to date than wait on Toonami's time, even with an English dub premiere. That's is unfair to Toonami considering this show was requested so much. That much effort to give the viewers what they asked for ought to be rewarded with better results than this.

The Trump administration has proposed cutting the EPA's budget by 30 percent. What does that mean for polluted communities in the U.S.?
The effects of pollution and climate change don't affect us all equally. Those hit hardest often belong to communities of color and are cash poor — what Majora Carter describes as “low status” communities. She's an urban revitalization strategist who has focused on environmental justice throughout their career. Carter was raised in the South Bronx, a hub of urban blight.
They grew up, went to college and returned to New York for grad school — right as the government was about to turn part of their community into a dumping ground.
This is the final episode of the first season of Ashley Ahearn's new podcast, terrestrial: exploring the choices we make in a world we have changed. You can join our Facebook group and subscribe to the podcast to hear all our full episodes.
“Even though the Bronx handled about 40 percent of the city's commercial waste and 100 percent of its own waste, we were about to handle possibly another 40 percent of the city's commercial waste,” they recalled. “It was just like, ‘Are you crazy?'”
They decided to stay and resist.
“I looked at that and thought, wow, this is happening because we happen to be a low income community of color,” they said.
The community came together — and got the city to build a park instead of the waste facility.
But, Carter said, this is happening all over this country, and we as a society aren't talking about it enough.
“We do need to have white people saying this is a problem because it's true,” they said. “I'm often the angry black woman, but all I'm literally saying is, like, this doesn't happen in white neighborhoods.”
In this episode of terrestrial, we're going to hear a story from Birmingham, Alabama, where another community has struggled with pollution for almost a century.
Birmingham is an old steel manufacturing town, and it's been struggling with environmental issues for a while. The neighborhoods in North Birmingham are industrial — steel foundries, cement plants, scrapyards – and they're also majority African-American.
Charlie Powell grew up in this neighborhood and they took reporter Ashley Cleek for a ride through the area.
They pointed out piles of waste owned by the coal company. They're called “wire fluff piles,” which is the product of wires being stripped of their conductive metal and ground into dust.
Beneath these piles, the Environmental Protection Agency said they've found high levels of lead, but they haven't been able to move it. That's because it's on private land owned by the coal company.
Birmingham has a long history of institutionalized racism with racial zoning laws in effect until 1951. That meant black families could only live in certain neighborhoods.
During the '70s and '80s, and even the '90s, the pollution was really intense in these neighborhoods. Powell remembers when they were 30 or so, driving home late: “At night, from 12 to about 2 o'clock in the morning, you could be coming down the road in the good summertime, when it's 70 to 80 degrees at night, you could just see it, like it's just, the whole night is kind of lit up like white.”
The smog, Powell said, felt like a light snow falling or like someone had blown on a billion dandelions. When it got on your clothes, you'd itch all over.
Powell didn't realize how bad things were until they got a job driving a delivery truck around Birmingham, and they noticed that other neighborhoods weren't like his. “I saw the houses and I wanted one,” they said.
It was the smell they wanted most. Wealthier neighborhoods in other parts of town didn't smell like his. “It doesn't smell like rotten eggs and cabbages,” Powell said.
A lot of people here have been trying to get the government to do something about the pollution for decades. There was a city councilwoman named Maxine Parker who went to Washington, D.C., every year to talk to their members of congress about the pollution. But they died of cancer in 2013.
And Rev. E. O. Jackson who grew up down the street across from the coal plant — they moved away but returns to see their old neighbors.
“Other than going over there for meetings,” they said, “I'm over there for funerals. Cancer, cancer, cancer, cancer.”
Jackson's mother died of cancer at 59, almost the same age they are now. They said it seems like a lot of neighborhood kids have asthma and learning disabilities – they believe it's connected to the pollution.
“All of us are sitting back, pondering and wondering, why do we have these high numbers of people who are passing away from cancer? Wait a minute, have these chemicals played a role?”
Local officials kept telling residents that everything was fine until 2011, when the EPA announced that they found toxic levels of arsenic and benzopyrene — both known carcinogens — in the dirt at a neighborhood school. So then the federal government came in to do more testing.
“All of a sudden, boom, we have an office, it's staffed,” Jackson said. “You just don't get these people coming, there had to be something there.”
The EPA declares these neighborhoods a Superfund site, which means the community can get federal funds to clean up the pollution, and the EPA can make industry pay for it.
Residents are told not to eat the vegetables in their gardens. Parents are told their kids should wash their hands and kick the dirt off their shoes before coming inside.
People in the neighborhood were horrified, and also relieved that the EPA had showed up.
But when the soil tests started coming back the results were not what residents expected to see.

Engine cover with PDRS, internal areo devices, fitting last barge boards and starting wheel design.
A lot of time passed by since my last post, mainly caused by moving into a new flat. However, I can report some new bits on the car.
First to the engine cover. Maybe the most tricky part/assembly on the whole car. As mentioned in the previous post, I cannot produce the engine cover exactly to its original dimensions, but I have to adapt it to the bodywork that is already fitted to the car. This is a process, that usually takes a lot of time and several prototypes (up to twelve in case of a Renault R26 ten years ago) are made on my previous cars. On the Lotus I surprised myself in building only two protoype engine covers till I reached the ideal shape. The engine cover consists of five main elements (one cover each side pod/radiators, one over each side of the engine, central piece at the top/airbox) plus the PDRS duct.
PDRS means Passive Drag Reduction System and is actually a passive f-duct system. A few teams (for example Lotus and Mercedes) tried to get them work and actually tested them on track. As this system with its (passive) fluid switch is highly complex and no team was able to get it work properly (as far as I know and remember). Also Lotus aborted the project after FP2 at Belgium GP in 2013. However, due to their limited resources, they used one airbox with its PDRS inlets over the entire season and only closed them, when PDRS was not in use.
Secondly, the shape of the internal areo covers are finished and only needs to be covered with carbon texture. The intention of the internal areo devices is to reduce the drag of the internal airflow. These internal areo covers appeared first in the 2009/2010 season. They mainly cover the engine and secure a relatively clean surface to minimise the drag for the airflow which exits the radiators.
I also started to fit the last barge boards, which I already produced a few months ago, but did not fit them in order to prevent damage in the course of working on the car. Now, the car is almost finished, and I don't need to work at the car directly any more – so no more danger of damaging them.
The last major project are the wheels. Unfortunately I was not able to find a proper gold paper (the Lotus rims were painted in gold each year). So I have to produce the structure of the rims from white paper and cover it with thin gold paper. Not the perfect way…
Remaining to-do's are:
Finishing rain light
Wheel nuts
Finishing wheels
Cover internal aero with carbon structure
Fitting pre-manufactured items (wind screen, top camera, antenna, pitot-tube)
A few pictures from the engine cover production:
And a few of the finished engine cover.
Some more of the internal aero devices, barge board and starting point of the wheel manufacturing.

One San Diego couple tied the knot Sunday, united by their love for each other -- and bacon.
The couple, who bonded over their love of Puerto Rican pork shoulder, walked down a bacon-printed carpet to the altar, where local radio station Star 94.1 DJ Jesse Lozano officiated the ceremony, according to a press release. Dunvan carried a bacon bouquet and Quinones wore a bacon boutonniere. Guests celebrated by tossing bacon bits instead of rice, and enjoyed a bacon-themed wedding cake and a maple-glazed donut covered in bacon bits.
The newlyweds were also gifted with a honeymoon in Baltimore, where they will be the guests of honor at the annual Pigtown Festival.
But they're not the first couple to bring their love of bacon to their wedding -- "Big Brother" contestant Adam Poch's wedding featured a bacon-themed menu and tables decorated with bowls of bacon bits. Another man proposed to their girlfriend using bacon in the shape of a heart.

Last year, UK cinemagoers were treated to two competing accounts of the story of Julian Assange: Bill Condon's oddly inert drama The Fifth Estate, and Alex Gibney's more pointedly dramatic documentary We Steal Secrets: The Story of Wikileaks. Although very different in form, content and, indeed, success (Gibney's film was Bafta-nominated, Condon's was hailed as one of the year's biggest flops), both movies wrestled with the conundrum of separating the cult of Assange's divisive personality from the significance of the information that they helped to publish – for better or worse.
There's a similar tension at the heart of Citizenfour, which intimately documents whistleblower Edward Snowden's efforts to lift the lid on the intrusive post-9/11 US eavesdropping industry. Yet unlike Assange (who appears briefly), Snowden shows no signs of wanting to be the centre of any story; on the contrary, they seem positively camera-shy as Oscar-nominee Laura Poitras captures them in a Hong Kong hotel room in 2013, over eight tense days during which their revelations are first made public. Accompanied by the contrastingly gregarious Glenn Greenwald and the Guardian's meticulous Ewen MacAskill, Snowden attempts to weigh up the importance of standing up to be counted against the possibility of the story becoming about him, rather than their information. With winning candour, they admit that they have no experience of the media and is eager to hand over decisions about what should be revealed, and when, to people whom they trust to know better – another stark contrast with Assange's more egomaniacal approach.
Key to Snowden's trust is Poitras, who earned themselves a place on the Department of Homeland Security's “watch list” with 2006's My Country, My Country (about life under US occupation in Iraq) and 2010's The Oath (filmed in Yemen and Guantánamo) and here builds upon their 2012 short The Program, wherein NSA whistleblower William Binney revealed how technology designed to gather foreign intelligence was used “to spy on US citizens without warrants”.
An NSA contractor employed by Booz Allen Hamilton, Snowden became similarly alarmed that they were “designing systems to amplify state power”. Encrypted emails to Poitras led to clandestine encounters of the kind that normally only happen in spy movies, replete with coded exchanges (“Do you know the restaurant's opening hours?”) in exotic foreign locales. After their secretive sojourn in Hong Kong, during which the bulk of Citizenfour was filmed, the various parties dispersed, with the now outlawed Snowden seeking refuge in Russia, Greenwald returning to Rio and Poitras heading to Berlin to complete their film in secrecy.
The film's final stanza, which was carefully “redacted” until the New York premiere last Friday, reunites the central characters in Russia, where they share a broken conversation in which key words are scribbled on notepads rather than spoken aloud (for fear of listening devices) and then shredded before the camera's prying eyes. John le Carré couldn't have made this stuff up.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Watch a video review of Citizenfour
As with so much of their previous work, Poitras's documentary dramatically straddles the divide between art and journalism, cinema and reportage. The trailer for Citizenfour, which warns that “every border you cross, every purchase you make, every call you dial... is in the hands of a system whose reach is unlimited but whose safeguards are not”, plays it as the most chilling thriller of the year, and that's no an idle boast; there is tension here to rival any of executive producer Steven Soderbergh's taut dramas.
Outside of the interviews, Poitras presents us with lines of dot-dash lights that could be digital code, but gradually come into focus as the overhead illuminations of a long, dark tunnel – the rabbit hole down which we must travel. An ominous, rumbling score adds menace, suspended chords and electronic creaks suggesting a descent into some Stygian world. Even in the brightly lit hotel rooms, the sound continues to alarm, the shrieking bell of a suspiciously timed fire drill setting our subjects' nerves on edge – and ours.
Revelations that every phone and mobile device can be remotely used as a bug (at one point, Snowden hides beneath a cowl to protect their keystrokes) crank up the tension further still; when a mobile phone went off in the early screening I attended, the audience's annoyance was tempered by all-too-nervous laughter. I'm sure I wasn't the only one who went home and took the battery out of their mobile.
At times I was reminded of Jafar Panahi's This Is Not a Film, which found the Iranian auteur covertly making movies while under house arrest in Tehran. Elsewhere, there are echoes of The Internet's Own Boy and the youthful altruism of Aaron Swartz; one sequence in which Snowden attempts to disguise themselves via the application of hair gel would not look out of place in a John Hughes movie, their now familiar tousled cut, specs and preppy smile suggesting a wide-eyed naivety at odds with their apparent understanding (and acceptance) of the magnitude of their actions. It's a moment of light relief amid a movie of brooding darkness – bravely made and utterly engrossing.

Volkswagen solved one big problem stemming from its diesel emissions deception, agreeing on Tuesday to pay up to $14.7 billion to settle claims in the United States.
But the final financial toll — once the company deals with a long list of fines, lawsuits and criminal investigations around the world — may well be far higher. The continuing fallout could leave Volkswagen vulnerable to billions of dollars more in expenses at a time when profit is already under pressure.
So far, Volkswagen has set aside 16.2 billion euros, or about $17.9 billion, for costs related to its public admission last September that its supposed “clean diesel” cars had been deliberately designed to cheat on air-quality tests. Matthias Müller, Volkswagen's chief executive, said less than two weeks ago that the amount was adequate.
But the American settlement with the government and car owners will consume a big chunk of that money. And Volkswagen faces even more scrutiny in the United States and around the world, most notably as authorities pursue criminal investigations.
The San Diego Chargers made several roster changes following the preseason opener.
The Bolts signed DT Kamal Johnson, LB Zack Hodges and LB James Vaughters, waived CB Carrington Byndom, and placed WR Stevie Johnson (knee) and NT Sean Lissemore (shoulder) on the reserve-injured list.
Kamal Johnson is a 6-3, 314-pound defensive tackle who originally signed with the Miami Dolphins in 2014 as an undrafted free agent out of Temple. They spent the entire season on IR after suffering an injury during the preseason. Johnson was a member of the Washington Redskins' practice squad for part of last season.
The 6-3, 246-pound Hodges joined the Indianapolis Colts after going undrafted out of Harvard in 2015. They have also spent time with the Los Angeles Rams. Hodges totaled 26.0 sacks and 41 tackles for loss over their career at Harvard, and was a three-time First Team All-Ivy League selection.
Meanwhile, Vaughters saw time on the practice squad for the Green Bay Packers last season and was with the New England Patriots earlier this offseason. They totaled 139 tackles, 19.0 tackles for loss and 12.5 sacks over four years at Stanford.
Deep inside Postojna Cave, an ancient wonder of rock and water not far from the Slovenian capital city of Ljubljana, sits a modernist aquarium—an anachronism of steel and glass and blue lighting. Seven hundred thousand people visit Postojna each year, not only to see the cave, which evokes Gaudí's most elaborate neogothic confections, but also to observe the creatures that live in the aquarium. These are the olms, aquatic salamanders of the species Proteus anguinus, known colloquially as baby dragons. They have flat heads with a ruff of lucent pink gills, long slithery bodies, and delicate little legs. Their skin, which covers their mostly undeveloped eyes, lacks pigment, leaving their internal organs visible and giving them an eerie glow. In the course of their lives, which may last as long as a century, olms can grow to a foot in length. They are the largest cave-dwelling animals in the world, apex predators adapted to a harsh existence in the cold, subterranean dark. They can survive for a decade without eating (tiny cave shrimp make up a substantial part of their diet), and they breed only once every six or seven years.
In late January, a female olm laid an egg against the glass of the Postojna aquarium, inaugurating what might seem a disproportionate flurry of international media attention. They produced nearly sixty more eggs in the ensuing month, and has been written up everywhere from the Slovenia Times to the New York Times. “This is very cool—it is quite extraordinary,” Primož Gnezda, a biologist at Postojna, told the BBC. Some have even joked about the olm being named the Slovenian Woman of the Year. The other six olms have been moved out of the aquarium, which is now boarded up, and some of the early eggs are showing signs of fetal development—the nubs of heads and backbones.

Why the joyful uproar? Part of the answer is that the olm is deeply embedded in the mythology of Central Europe and the Balkans. The salamander's S-curve has been found carved into the weathered stone of at least one stećak, a type of medieval tombstone that lies scattered across the region. Its first mention in literature appeared in 1689, in the fifteen-volume encyclopedia “The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola,” by the naturalist and polymath Janez Vajkard Valvasor. A student of the Enlightenment and the first Slovenian (or, at the time, Carniolan) to be inducted into the Royal Society of London, Valvasor heard stories about baby dragons while investigating the unusual behavior of a spring near the town of Vrhnika, about fifteen miles west of Ljubljana. Each day, the spring would run strongest at around nine in the morning, then the flow would lessen; the stronger flow would resume at about midnight. The villager who showed Valvasor the spring explained that a dragon lived in the cave beneath it. When the water filled the cave, reaching the dragon's neck, the beast would become uncomfortable and shift around, emptying the cave and disrupting the spring. Curious but skeptical, Valvasor asked the man why they thought there was a dragon. Because, the man explained, after heavy rains, baby dragons would wash up aboveground, a clear indication that an adult lived below.
Olms still get marooned at the surface after heavy rains, and dragons still hold an important place in the Slovenian national consciousness. Ljubljana's iconic architectural feature, Zmajski Most, or Dragon Bridge, boasts four sheet-copper dragon statues, one at each corner. St. George, who is famous for their dragon-slaying, watches over the city as the patron saint of the castle chapel. Ljubljana is also where Jason and the Argonauts are said to have landed after recovering the Golden Fleece, and some versions of the story have Jason slaying a dragon in a lake between Ljubljana and Vrhnika. As the dragon became a symbol of Ljubljana, so the olm became a symbol of Slovenia's natural heritage and national identity, even appearing on one of the coins for the tolar, the country's pre-euro currency. During the nineteenth century, when railroads first flooded the area with tourists, the olm became a popular souvenir. Locals would capture the salamanders when they washed up aboveground and sell them in glass jars. “You hear about the olm in elementary schools,” Sašo Weldt, another biologist at Postojna, told me.
As Valvasor's account suggests, though, the olm is representative of something more. Postojna is one of many interconnected caves in the Dinaric karst, a swath of limestone that runs along the Adriatic Coast, from northeast Italy through Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Albania. The rock is arid aboveground and wet below; most of the region's drinking water comes from its vast system of aquifers. Because the olm has adapted to these subterranean conditions, which have remained relatively stable for millennia, it is a reliable bellwether of changes to the ecosystem, including those resulting from human activity such as development and pollution. “Everybody connects it with clean water,” Dušan Jelić, the president of the Croatian Institute for Biodiversity, told me. Historically, when villagers found a stranded olm, “they would return it to the dragon, because the dragon was responsible for the water.” Lose one, Jelić said, and you've likely lost the other.
According to Gregor Aljančič, an evolutionary biologist at the Tular Cave Laboratory, in Kranj, the olm is in decline. In 2009, it was classified as “vulnerable” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's list of threatened species. Aljančič explained how toxic chemicals from unregulated sewage, leaky waste-treatment plants, and agricultural pesticides have seeped into the ground and contaminated the water. High levels of pollutants such as mercury and P.C.B.s have been detected in tissue samples taken from wild olms, whose populations are retreating deeper underground as their habitat continues to be compromised. In places like Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the economy is struggling, marshalling the resources to address large-scale pollution is a profound challenge. In Croatia, huge hydroelectric engineering projects are diverting water from the ancient cave systems and dissolving the barriers that once kept ecosystems aboveground separate from those below. The isolation that has made the Dinaric karst a hot spot of subterranean life since the end of the Ice Age is breaking down.
The olm is, certainly, an animal worth celebrating. In 2012, the British naturalist David Attenborough picked it as one of ten endangered species that they would take on their personal ark. The salamander possesses an astonishing set of sensory systems, including the ability to detect both Earth's magnetic field and the bioelectric fields of other organisms, and photosensitive skin. (Shine a flashlight on the tip of an olm's tail and the animal will quickly slide away.) Its frilly pink gills are a telltale sign of neoteny: most amphibians lose their gills as they develop, but the olm retains its larval form, never fully developing into an adult. This has recently caught the attention of researchers studying the mechanisms of aging. But biologists may not get the chance to explore the olm's other secrets. “We're losing this information before we understand it,” Aljančič said.
If the olm eventually disappears, Slovenians will have to wrestle with a new national identity. They will no longer be the country of dragons but the country where the dragons died. Such moments of reckoning are going on all over the world as species falter and human activity continues to change the ecosystems that we rely on for survival. In Europe, China, and the United States, hundreds of millions of people rely on karst formations for fresh drinking water, and in many of these places a crisis of clean water is already under way. We may have built a tiny ark for a clutch of olm eggs, but the delight with which this story is being told seems to miss the point. There is danger in false assurance, and the fairy tales that we once told ourselves no longer serve, up here in the light.
Correction: An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the extent to which olms have been observed to breed in captivity and in the wild. It also suggested that neoteny may be the key to the olm's longevity; such a link has yet to be established.
NEW DELHI: From January 1, Air India will serve hot vegetarian meals on flights with a duration of 60 to 90 minutes.Minister of Civil Aviation Mahesh Sharma said a recent circular by Air India on serving "only vegetarian meals" has been misinterpreted and there is no change in the previous orders and only some upgradations have been made."It has been misinterpreted. The real truth is that in short halt flights where the time span is between 60-90 minutes, we used to serve sandwiches and snacks, which used to be vegetarian. Only thing was that there was a long demand that there should be some hot food as well," Sharmasaid."As a process of that we have started hot foods. In the long duration flights of more than 90 minutes, everything will remain same. Only part is that we have upgraded the issues as the new year is coming, and therefore some innovations have to be there. So, there is no change in the previous orders. Only thing is that some up-gradation has been put. Non-vegetarian food was earlier not there and at present is also not there," they added.However, Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of Air India, A.Lohani told ANI that the national carrier presently provides cold vegetarian snacks on 60-90 minute flights, however from now it will serve proper hot vegetarian meals.Earlier, the national carrier decided to serve only vegetarian hot meals on its domestic flights in economy class with a flying time of 60 to 90 minutes from January 1.A circular said, "It has been decided to provide all Indian vegetarian hot meals in economy class on all domestic sector flights between 61 and 90 minutes duration from January 1, 2016."Tea and coffee too will be off lunch- and dinner-time flights.
Can you describe some of the looks you achieved on Blade Runner 2049?
RD: It has a wide variety of looks and atmospheres for the many different environments that action plays in. There's the grey, foggy, smoggy dystopian city by day and night, and all manner of rain and snowstorms. The character Niander Wallace (Jared Leto), who builds the replicants, is blind, and I thought it would be ironically interesting to bathe the massive concrete building where they work with a warm world of moving sunlight, which Denis ran with.
The sets each came with their challenges. Sometimes we'd be lighting a set with 250 space lights and 32 x 12 light Maxi Brutes, sometimes with 76 ARRI SkyPanels, with 238 x 300W Betweenies, with a bare 24Kw bulb rigged to the bottom of a moving truss, or with just a few 2ft LED tubes supplied by Lightgear in London. We used lines of Colour Blast LED lights or Bad Boy spotlights to create the effect of overhead flying vehicles passing by. One set is lit by a 40' x 30' LED screen playing back an image we shot in pre-production, again similar to something we had done in Skyfall. Then there are variously settings where the overall cast is red or orange and for these we needed to gel every light with a specific filter pack.
There's a scene set in a big stage show, for which we just used theatrical spotlights. That was interesting for me as we spent a lot of time in pre-production, working on a special lighting previz, so we knew exactly how the lighting had to be rigged with only a short time between rigging and shooting. The lighting had to be carefully choreographed and programmed, so that it was both in-sync with the action and repeatable on separate takes. We worked with Light Design Kft., a local company specializing in show lighting, and they did a fantastic job. I've done VFX previz before, and did some for the opening sequence, but doing a ‘lighting' previz of a set was a new one for me.
How did you motivate the camera?
RD: I can't say we took a particular approach to moving the camera. Overall, Denis' style is sparse. They prefer wide shots, and likes to let the action play out in front of camera – nothing frenetic – which gives the actors space to perform, and gives the audience a relationship with the overall frame.
I operated, with Andy as my first AC. For a lot of the time I had the camera on my preferred Aerocrane. This is a sectional jib arm that can extend to around 14ft, and I use it in conjunction with a Power Pod remote head. It's fast to set-up and you can reframe and make changes quickly as the scene develops. You just need a good dolly grip like Bruce Hamme, and a key grip like Mitch Lillian, to make it work. They were both very ably assisted by Attila Szûcs. When we needed a second camera or Steadicam I was fortunate to have my longtime friend and expert Steadicam operator, Peter Cavaciuti.
Otherwise we used specific gear for specific shots. A 50' Tehnocrane came in handy for a couple of sequences and, on the other extreme, we used a drone for some shots.
What was your main challenge on this production?
RD: The challenge of any film is to sustain an aesthetic over a period of time, with consistency and unity. I do obsess and agonise about what I want to do and how best to achieve it. Blade Runner 2049 was especially challenging – due partly to the sheer diversity of looks, and partly to the schedule. The production was relentless. Our schedule was for a 91-day shoot, quite ambitious for what was on the ‘wish list', but we really cracked along at a good pace, given we were hardly on one set for more than a few days at a time. So I have to thank my gaffers – Bill O'Leary and Krisztián Paluch – plus the various rigging gaffers from Hungary, New York City and Italy.
A special thanks to production designer Dennis Gassner and their team of brilliant art directors, which included Paul Inglis and Rob Maclean, as well as our set decorator, Alessandra Querzola, who was a valued and tireless help.
The storm scene set at sea and at night was only one example of a sequence that provided a specific challenge, because of the elaborate effects rigs necessary to float cameras close to the water, whilst being pounded by effects waves, as well as shoot from beneath the waves in a vehicle whilst it was sinking. For this we had two 50ft cranes with remote Hydro heads, plus an Aquacam MK5 housing for the Alexa XT, plus two Nauticam housings for the Alexa Minis, so each could cope with the waves and submerge when necessary. We'd originally planned to shoot this complicated sequence in the existing facility in Malta, but we ended-up actually building our own tank on the backlot of a studio in Budapest. Our problem was with our schedule and facilitating a difficult move from Budapest to Malta and back. With an array of wave makers and dump tanks and with misters and smoke machines it was quite a number.
Natalie Bennett is paid £24,700 a year to be leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, a spokesperson has confirmed to BuzzFeed News, giving them by far the lowest salary of UK's main political party leaders.
The salary is below the average full-time UK wage of £27,195 and well below the typical wage in Bennett's home constituency, which is £32,781.
Bennett, who lives in London's Somers Town, is not an elected politician, and instead spends a large amount of their time promoting Green policies by travelling around the UK and giving interviews.  They are unlikely to be elected as an MP for Holborn and St Pancras at the forthcoming general election, so is not expecting to see a substantial salary increase in the near future.
Them salary, which the Green party describes as “an allowance”, excludes any outside earnings. However, as a former journalist, they may have experience of working long hours for below-average wages.
Them income is starkly different to the other political party leaders who stood beside them during the televised leaders' debates. David Cameron earns £142,500 a year as prime minister, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon takes home £135,605 in their role as Scotland's first minister, and Ed Miliband earns £139,355 as leader of the opposition.
Nick Clegg earns £134,565 as deputy prime minister, and UKIP's Nigel Farage earns £79,000 from their MEP salary. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood is paid £53,852 after voluntarily turning down the offer of a pay rise.
On Tuesday the Greens launched their manifesto, which includes measures designed to stop companies paying high wages.
Funimation confirmed today that season two of Attack on Titan will air April 1. Fans were treated to the long-awaited season two trailer late last year, but no other details surrounding the premiere were released.
Looking back at the trailer, we can expect to see a number of new Titans to be introduced this season, including a hairy one dubbed the “Beast Titan”.
Giant, humanoid, man-eating monsters known as Titans are still plaguing the city of Shinganshina; no one knows where they came from or why they're attacking civilization. What remains of humanity is contained behind three large walls — Wall Maria, Wall Rose and Wall Sheena. Protagonists Eren Yeager, their sister Mikasa and their friend Armin are back in action, but no less panicked than the last time we've seen them. So far, the first wall has been breached, and it looks like the Titans have crossed the second one in season two.
From what we already know of the new season, perhaps the most chilling is: “Titans have been protecting us from other Titans this whole time.” Could it be possible that there are worse things beyond those borders? We'll just have to wait until April 1.
ASHBURN, Virginia -- Vernon Davis's explosiveness continues to amaze. He's now in their 12th season, yet their explosive plays haven't diminished. In fact, over the last two years they've increased. He's doing what they once did in San Francisco.
During their prime years with the 49ers, Davis's speed killed defenses down the field. From 2010-13 they averaged one 20-yard catch every 3.7 receptions, according to ESPN Stats & Information. That's exactly the rate they have caught them since joining the Redskins in 2016.
Part of that stems from how well they stay in shape, allowing them to win downfield at age 33. Davis said last year that they like playing in this offense, allowing them to ponder playing several more years. The Redskins like their blocking, too. But it's their speed that keeps them on the field and makes them dangerous.

“I enjoy running, I love it,” Davis said. “Coach [Jay Gruden] and I were talking and I was like, ‘Coach, please let me know if I'm losing a step or if I can't run like I used to and I'll hang it up.' They haven't said that yet. When they tell me that I'm going to hang it up.”
That conversation won't be happening anytime soon.
“He still has the juice,” Gruden said. “He's still very athletic, they still have elite speed, blocks well in the run game, and I just don't see a lot of weaknesses there.”
Davis gives the Redskins a quality second option at tight end whenever Jordan Reed can't play. If both are in the game, it creates issues for the defense.
“It's been great to have a reliable tight end where there isn't a major drop-off to the next guy because Vernon is so talented and so experienced,” Gruden said.
One thing Davis won't do is try and exact revenge on the 49ers, the team they played with until midway through the 2015 season when they traded them to Denver.
“If this game had happened a year or two ago? Now for me I'm just having fun man. No hard feelings,” Davis said. “It's like any other game for me.”
Tomsula's impact
I've written quite a bit on the impact by another ex-49er, defensive line coach Jim Tomsula. Jay Gruden spoke about them with the San Francisco media earlier in the week. Tomsula's group is playing well and a key reason why Washington is optimistic about the rest of the season.
Much has been said about Tomsula being a technician. But they also have instilled a mindset.
“It's more than just the X's and O's,” Redskins lineman Stacy McGee said. “It's understanding the whys and hows and changing the mindset in the room. Physical. Make it personal with everyone you play against. It's the mindset to attack and be consistent doing the same things. Instead of trying to see everything happen, feel it with your body and when you feel with your body it feels natural.”
Not a trap
I don't buy the notion of having so-called trap games in the NFL – and certainly not when you're a team such as the Redskins. That's why I don't view this as a game they'll overlook with Philadelphia up next. There's a simple reason why and Gruden laid it out well:
“We're 2-2, it's not like we're defending Super Bowl champs or anything. We still have a lot to prove ourselves. They have a lot of good players over there, I've made it known –that they're four plays away from being 4-1, without a doubt. A lot of first-rounders there on defense, a lot of skill on defense. Offensively they have a lot of speed, a physical runner and a nice offensive line. So it's a competitive football team and if you take anybody for granted in the league, you're an idiot. That won't happen here.”
Shanahan's return
Five members of the Redskins' offense remain from when Kyle Shanahan served as offensive coordinator: quarterback Kirk Cousins, left tackle Trent Williams, running back Chris Thompson and tight ends Jordan Reed and Niles Paul.
Shanahan was well-respected and liked when they coached in Washington; the problem was mostly with one player (quarterback Robert Griffin III) and not the rest of the players. They were disappointed to see them go. That's why they remain fans (and before people get upset: they like and respect Gruden and their offense).
“He had a lot of energy,” Thompson said. “Just like Sean McVay. [Shanahan was] young and they demand the best out of you every single day. Every team he's been to, he's putting up good numbers with the quarterbacks and pieces they had. ... Their system is great. They have fast speed receivers and guys like Pierre [Garcon] who are pure route runners. It works.”
Paul compared Shanahan to others.
“Him and Sean are so much alike, both wildly creative and they really know football,” Paul said. “They know how to exploit a defense. Both are extremely smart at figuring out what a defense is trying to do and what their tendencies are and being able to exploit that. They're mad scientists.
“Kyle is a great guy, tells a lot of jokes. They remind me of Gruden, that type of players-coach they are.”

When Republican officials in Iowa convened a planning session Thursday for their quadrennial presidential straw poll, only a handful of advisers to GOP contenders bothered to show up.
The sparse attendance and lack of enthusiasm, even from those who came, was worrying to state party brass: The straw poll — a carnival-like organizing ritual that has in past years winnowed the candidate field and marked the start of caucus season — has faded into irrelevance.
This August's straw poll in Boone, in fact, may be the least consequential in decades. Some Republican hopefuls expect to participate only halfheartedly, while others — including former governors Jeb Bush (Fla.) and Mike Huckabee (Ark.) — are opting out altogether. And almost no one outside the fringes of the race believes a summertime victory would provide a meaningful jolt.
Thursday's information-only meeting in Des Moines at state GOP headquarters illustrated the event's descent. Representatives from seven official or soon-to-be-declared candidates dropped by, but none from the top tier.
Most telling was the absence of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's operation. Walker, who spent part of their childhood in Iowa and has built a fervent following of Christian activists and tea party conservatives, seems poised to bypass the straw poll and focus on next year's caucuses.

[Earlier: Iowa straw poll survives a party vote]
The lack of interest from Huckabee and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum — the winners of Iowa's past two Republican caucuses — has a similar debilitating effect.
Walker's aversion is notable because their candidacy is one that could reap benefits from straw-poll success, elevating them as a donor-class darling who is also a favorite of the grass roots and sucking up the political oxygen from their underfunded rivals on the right.
But the risks for Walker and the rest are evident: Win, and you gain little other than momentum; underperform, and your campaign could be tagged as flat and inspiring. When former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty competed hard in the 2011 straw poll only to lose, they ended their campaign the next day.
“We haven't made any commitments for anything that requires a candidate to officially declare,” Walker said this week on Laura Ingraham's radio program, reflecting their wariness of angering Iowans but reluctance to bring a volunteer army to the Central Iowa Expo on Aug. 8 that would surely raise expectations.
Strategists for Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), who has surged to the fore of the 2016 pack, also did not appear Thursday. “We're running a lean operation, so we're only spending money to compete in contests where delegates are at stake,” said Alex Conant, Rubio's spokesperson.
Those who attended Thursday's meeting were allies of Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), business person Donald Trump, former surgeon Ben Carson, former Texas governor Rick Perry, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), former Silicon Valley executive Carly Fiorina and Gov. Chris Christie (N.J.). All have blocs of support but sit near the middle or bottom of national polls.

Intriguing was the presence of Christie's adviser, Phil Valenziano. Hobbled by aides' involvement in a bridge-closing scandal, Christie has been lagging behind for months and eyeing New Hampshire as the setting for a possible comeback. But if other center-right Republicans neglect the straw poll, their friends say, Christie could try to impress there and earn a boost.
[After three decades, could the Iowa straw poll be cast aside?]
At a book signing in Davenport, Iowa, on Thursday afternoon, Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) said that “we ­haven't decided” on whether to participate.
The straw poll's unraveling can be traced to those late summer days of 2011. After tea party star Michele Bachmann, then a Republican member of congress, topped Pawlenty and a parade of others, their campaign crashed. GOP leaders in Washington and some powerful Iowa Republicans, fed up with the spectacle and the way the event has damaged the state's influence on presidential races, have worked to cripple it or at least tone it down.
The straw poll, with its new home in the town of Boone, will be more controlled and low key. In its previous location at Iowa State University in Ames, it had the feeling of a tailgate party, with lines of cars and tents where tickets were handed out and paper plates were piled with barbecue pork.
Worried that the state's caucuses will be diminished if the straw poll becomes overly associated with Iowa's role in presidential politics, Gov. Terry Branstad (R) has been at the center of the effort to lessen the straw poll's significance.
Bush, speaking earlier this month in Iowa City, agreed. “All of the resources ought to go to the thing that matters, which is the Iowa caucuses on February 1,” they said.
For now, organizers of the straw poll remain confident that it will go on. “We never expected 100 percent participation,” Iowa GOP adviser Charlie Szold said Thursday. “In a field this large, we understand how it's not strategic for everyone to do it. We still expect ten to twenty thousand Iowans to be part of a beloved tradition.”
MORE than 1,500 jihadists fighting with ISIS in Syria and Iraq have returned to Europe with orders to "carry out attacks", an EU report warned.
An estimated 5,000 European ISIS fanatics went to Syria and Iraq and 15 to 20 per cent of them died on the battlefield.
PA:Press Association Images 8 Jihadis are primed to attack Europe, an EU report warned
Around 30 to 35 per cent have returned with "specific missions", while the other half remained in the battle theatre - which amounted to between 2,000 and 2,500 Europeans.
This means as many as 1,750 may have returned, based on the percentages listed in the report which EU counter-terrorism coordinator Gilles de Kerchove will present to EU interior ministers on Friday.
The report said there were two types of 'foreign terrorist fighters' returning.

EPA 8 Last month Belgium expressed concern that jihadists were increasingly returning to Europe
It warned: "It is important to share information on returnees who are already back in Europe, those that are in transit and ... (those) still in the conflict zone."
"There are largely two categories of returnees: those in the majority who will drift back and those who will be sent back on specific missions, which are of most concern."

The report comes after Belgium expressed concern last month that jihadists were increasingly returning to Europe as US-backed coalition forces drive the terrorist group from Syria and Iraq.
The report even claimed some European women and children born or raised in the so-called caliphate declared by ISIS in Iraq and Syria could pose a security threat as they may have been radicalised.

Without giving figures, it said some returnees have been convicted and serving prison sentences, while others are being monitored and some are free in their communities.
It recalled that foreign fighters who have returned to Europe have staged both foiled and successful attacks, including the slaughter in Paris in November last year and this year's bombings in Brussels in March.
Both sets of attacks were claimed by ISIS, which is also known by its Arabic acronym Daesh.
"There is also a significant foreign terrorist fighter contingent with Daesh in Libya which might attempt to use their nationality or family connections to return to Europe," the report said.
It said returnees were keeping in touch with Daesh in the Middle East via social media and increasingly turning from mainstream Twitter to the encrypted one-to-one messaging service Telegram.

ESSEN , Germany, Dec. 6 (UPI) — German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday called for a ban on use of the burqa, commonly used by Muslim women to fully veil their faces.
They addressed their stance on the topic at the start of a meeting of their Christian Democratic Party, or CDU, in Essen.
“For us that means: Show your face,” they said. “Therefore the full-body veil is not appropriate, it should be banned wherever it's legally possible.”
The comment, meant to present a tough image on conservative Islam despite their welcome of more than 1 million mostly Muslim immigrants to Germany in 2015, was greeted with approval and applause.
Them call for a burqa ban, which is worn in public in Germany by very few women, could be seen as a pragmatic shift to the right for Merkel. With the election in the United States of Donald Trump and Britain's vote to exit the European Union, Merkel is regarded by many as the only remaining symbol of liberal democracy in the industrialized world, The Washington Post reported Tuesday.
They used their strongest language yet to back a ban on Islamic coverings suggested by their party's conservative members. Some have called for legislation making it an offense to wear burqas in courtrooms, government buildings, and while driving or attending demonstrations.
In the past Merkel has been critical of Islamic veils as an obstacle to assimilation in Germany, but their comments seemed designed to appease those who say their welcome of asylum seekers has been reckless and damaging to Germany. Immigration to Germany was scaled back in 2016, and Tuesday they reinforced the policy, saying, “A situation like the one in the late summer of 2015 cannot, should not and must not be repeated.”
Merkel was renominated by the party, receiving 89.5 percent of the votes from approximately 1,000 delegates present. It was the ninth time that Merkel was elected party leader; they have led the CDU for nearly 17 years.

PARIS, Dec. 12 (UPI) -- Delegates from the 21st Conference of Parties, or COP21, formally accepted the final draft of a climate accord Saturday after two weeks of negotiations at the United Nations summit.
French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the final draft the of global climate accord is "fair" and "legally binding," aimed at keeping the rise in global temperatures below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit until the end of this century. Under the draft, emissions pledges will have to be revised every five years. The responsibilities of developing nations are also outlined, said Fabius, who has presided over the talks.
Scientists and world leaders said it represents the last, the best chance of striking a worldwide deal to put the brakes on global warming. The proposals will be handed over to world leaders Saturday for review.
"Today we are close to the final outcome. It is my deep conviction we have come up with an ambitious and balanced agreement," Fabius said.
United Nations Secretary Ban Ki-moon said there is "No Plan B" if the deal falls apart. Those words were emblazoned on the Eiffel Tower on Saturday.
"The world is holding its breath and counting on all of us," Fabius said. They received a standing ovation after their speech.
The agreement was hailed as a milestone in the fight against climate change by leaders around the world.
"A month ago tomorrow, Paris was the victim of the deadliest terror attack in Europe for more than a decade," British Prime Minister David Cameron wrote in a post to Facebook. "Today, it has played host to one of the most positive global steps in history."
Though almost every country in the world signed the Paris agreement, nations still have to take the terms of the agreement back home and convince their national governments to accept and approve the accord. After that, it's a matter of following through and holding each nation accountable.
"Today, we celebrate," said Miguel Arias Canete, the European Union's commissioner for energy and climate action. "Tomorrow, we have to act. This is what the world expects of us."
As the New York Times reports, scientists who have reviewed the accord's language say the promises may do about half as much as is needed to stave off the 3.6-degree threshold.
But optimists say the agreement at least gets the ball rolling, and when delegates meet again in 2020, newer, more aggressive emissions-curtailing plans may be proposed.

In Iraq, the Islamic State has now grabbed control of the Iraqi city of Sinjar. Tens of thousands of residents, according to the UK Guardian, have fled to the mountains, where they face a choice: they can either die of dehydration, or they can risk death from ISIS in the city. “Food is low, ammunition is low, and so is water,” one Sinjar refugee said. “We have one piece of bread to share between 10 people. We have to walk 2 kilometers to get water. There were some air strikes yesterday [against the jihadists], but they have made no difference.” CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen says, “al Qaeda appears to control more territory in the Arab world than it has done at any time in its history.”
That's somewhat surprising given that back in January, Obama told The New Yorker that ISIS was minor league:
The analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that doesn't make them Kobe Bryant. I think there is a distinction between the capacity and reach of a bin Laden and a network that is actively planning major terrorist plots against the homeland versus jihadists who are engaged in various local power struggles and disputes, often sectarian.
President Obama has an unfortunate habit of making final and declarative pronouncements on foreign policy that are proved absolutely false within short time windows. Here are just a few of their pronouncements on foreign policy that went wildly wrong:
“Al Qaeda Has Been Decimated.” Obama has said dozens of times that al Qaeda has been largely destroyed under their administration, adding that al Qaeda was “on the path to defeat.” That was clearly untrue, given the September 11, 2012 terror attacks in Benghazi. It's even less true today, given the fact that al Qaeda now controls a record amount of territory.
“The 1980s Are Now Calling To Ask For Their Foreign Policy Back.” After mocking Mitt Romney for stating that America's top “geopolitical foe” was Russia, and averring that al Qaeda was instead the top threat to America, Obama dropped that doozy during their presidential debate on foreign policy. Now that Russia has invaded Ukraine, Russian-backed forces have shot down a passenger airliner, and Russia has worked in tandem with Edward Snowden to reveal national security secrets, Obama's line doesn't look all that clever.
“Iraq's Future Will Be In The Hands Of Its People.” Obama stated this at Fort Bragg in 2011. They routinely utilize variations of the same theme to describe why America should not be involved in Iraq. Of course, Iraq's future is not in the hands of its people; instead, Iraq's future is in the hands of ISIS, springing from Syria, and Iran, which has now inserted Revolutionary Guard troops into the country.
“A Red Line For Us Is We Start Seeing a Whole Bunch of Chemical Weapons Moving Around or Being Utilized. That Would Change My Calculus.” Um, no it didn't. After Secretary of State John Kerry threatened an “unbelievably small” military strike in Syria, Obama then negotiated a ridiculous deal that left Bashar Assad in power and completely failed to divest them of their weapons of mass destruction. That was just a few months after Obama said in their debate with Romney, “What we've done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go.” Assad was recently sworn into a new seven-year term in Syria. The number of dead in Syria is climbing toward 200,000.
“Egyptians Have Made It Clear That Nothing Less Than Genuine Democracy Will Carry The Day.” Obama stated this upon the ouster of Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak in 2011, as part of Obama's overall celebration of the so-called Arab Spring. After Muslim Brotherhood head Mohammed Morsi was elected president of Egypt in June 2012, Obama called them to congratulate them on their victory. Morsi quickly moved to shut down the courts and consolidate power. And they were ousted by the military. Which now runs the country. Which is good, since Morsi was disastrous for both America and their allies. So much for Obama's brilliant stroke on the Arab Spring.
“To Take Out a Credit Card From The Bank of China In The Name of Our Children…That's Irresponsible. It's Unpatriotic.” President Obama was Senator Obama when they made this incredible statement in 2008. Over the same time in office as President Obama at this point in their presidency, George W. Bush had added $2.72 trillion in debt. President Obama has added over $7 trillion in debt. Obama called Bush “unpatriotic” for running up the debt.
“No Question That Libya…Would Be Better Off With Qaddafi Out Of Power.” Obama said that in October 2011. Things went great in Libya, as Chris Stevens can attest. America has now evacuated their embassy in Libya. Why? The current chaos in Libya is being led by “rival militias, made up largely of former anti-Qaddafi rebels,” according to Fox News.
“You know, they said we needed to triple the Border Patrol. Or now they're going to say we need to quadruple the Border Patrol. Or they'll want a higher fence. Maybe they'll need a moat.” Obama said this, sarcastically, while visiting El Paso, Texas in 2011. Well, upping the Border Patrol might have helped quell the influx of tens of thousands of illegal immigrant minors from South American.
The list goes on and on. President Obama's history of predicting world events isn't too stellar. Perhaps that's because neither is their policy.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at rally Sunday in Muscatine, Iowa. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg)
Before Donald Trump declared war on political correctness, a state senator named Jake Knotts was blazing that trail in South Carolina.
On Wednesday, the two Republicans whose inflammatory rhetoric has been considered poison pills by the GOP establishment, will appear together at a Trump rally in Lexington, S.C. Knotts said they will formally endorse Trump's presidential candidacy and is organizing what they called “a good, old-fashioned, chicken bog” barbecue to support him.
Knotts's commentary has been so incendiary over the years it has drawn gasps from South Carolina's clubby political elite. In a 2010 episode, Knotts called both President Obama and the state's Indian-American governor, Nikki Haley, “a raghead,” making national headlines and prompting a formal vote of censure from the Lexington County Republican Party.
Knotts, 71, left office in 2012 following two decades in the state legislature because they lost their re-election to a petition candidate, Katrina Shealy. But they remain a prominent political figure in the Columbia suburbs of Lexington County, where both they and Haley are from.
Their appearance with Trump comes only three weeks after Haley implicitly criticized Trump's campaign rhetoric in their official Republican response to President Obama's “State of the Union” address. Haley urged Americans to resist the temptation “to follow the siren call of the angriest voices.”
Trump reacted immediately by slamming Haley, although they appeared to smooth things over with them in the following days.
In an interview on Monday night, Knotts said they disagreed with Haley's speech.
“She said that they were angry," Knotts said. "Heck, yeah, he's angry. I'm angry. There's a lot of Americans angry these days, and they want somebody that's ready to do something about the problems we've got.”
Knotts said they were drawn to Trump's candidacy because of their politically incorrect style. “This political correctness – people are tired of that,” they said. “I like their style. They don't apologize, and they double down.”
Knotts added, “I support Trump 100 percent. I'm solid as a rock with Trump. I don't know if my endorsement helps him, but if it does, everybody in Lexington County will know I support him.”
Haley's top adviser, Tim Pearson, dismissed Knotts's political influence, though would not criticize Trump. “He's the worst,” Pearson said. “The Tony Soprano of Lexington County, South Carolina – except not likable.”
A Trump campaign spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Knotts's endorsement.
Trump's event will take place Wednesday at the Harmon's Tree Farm. Knotts said they were inviting “everybody I can” to attend the rally as well as their barbecue. They said they would serve “chicken bog,” a Southern dish that consists of chicken, rice and sausage. “We use Uncle Ben's rice,” Knotts said.
“I tell you what,” Knotts said, “I hope you give [Trump] a good spill on it because he's what America needs to make America great again.”
Taraxacum () is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, which consists of species commonly known as dandelions. They are native to Eurasia and North America, but the two commonplace species worldwide, T. officinale and T. erythrospermum, were introduced from Europe and now propagate as wildflowers.[2] Both species are edible in their entirety.[3] The common name dandelion ( DAN-di-ly-ən, from French dent-de-lion, meaning "lion's tooth") is given to members of the genus. Like other members of the Asteraceae family, they have very small flowers collected together into a composite flower head. Each single flower in a head is called a floret. In part due to their abundance along with being a generalist species, dandelions are one of the most vital early spring nectar sources for a wide host of pollinators.[4] Many Taraxacum species produce seeds asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant.[5]
Description [ edit ]

The species of Taraxacum are tap-rooted, perennial, herbaceous plants, native to temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere. The genus contains many species, which usually (or in the case of triploids, obligately) reproduce by apomixis, resulting in many local populations and endemism. In the British Isles alone, 234 microspecies are recognised in 9 loosely defined sections, of which 40 are "probably endemic".[6]
In general, the leaves are 5–25 cm long or longer, simple, lobed, and form a basal rosette above the central taproot. The flower heads are yellow to orange coloured, and are open in the daytime, but closed at night. The heads are borne singly on a hollow stem (scape) that is usually leafless and rises 1–10 cm or more[2] above the leaves. Stems and leaves exude a white, milky latex when broken. A rosette may produce several flowering stems at a time. The flower heads are 2–5 cm in diameter and consist entirely of ray florets. The flower heads mature into spherical seed heads called blowballs[7] or clocks (in both British and American English)[8][9][10][11] containing many single-seeded fruits called achenes. Each achene is attached to a pappus of fine hairs, which enable wind-aided dispersal over long distances.
The flower head is surrounded by bracts (sometimes mistakenly called sepals) in two series. The inner bracts are erect until the seeds mature, then flex downward to allow the seeds to disperse. The outer bracts are often reflexed downward, but remain appressed in plants of the sections Palustria and Spectabilia. Some species drop the parachute from the achenes; the hair-like parachutes are called pappus, and they are modified sepals. Between the pappus and the achene are a stalk called a beak, which elongates as the fruit matures. The beak breaks off from the achene quite easily, separating the seed from the parachute.
Seed dispersal [ edit ]

A number of species of Taraxacum are seed-dispersed ruderals that rapidly colonize disturbed soil, especially the common dandelion (T. officinale), which has been introduced over much of the temperate world. After flowering is finished, the dandelion flower head dries out for a day or two. The dried petals and stamens drop off, the bracts reflex (curve backwards), and the parachute ball opens into a full sphere. When development is complete, the mature seeds are attached to white, fluffy "parachutes" which easily detach from the seed head, glide by wind, and disperse.
False dandelions [ edit ]
Hawksbeard flower heads and ripe seeds are sometimes confused with dandelions.
Many similar plants in the Asteraceae family with yellow flowers are sometimes known as false dandelions. Dandelion flowers are very similar to those of cat's ears (Hypochaeris). Both plants carry similar flowers, which form into windborne seeds. However, dandelion flowers are borne singly on unbranched, hairless and leafless, hollow stems, while catsear flowering stems are branched, solid, and carry bracts. Both plants have a basal rosette of leaves and a central taproot. However, the leaves of dandelions are smooth or glabrous, whereas those of catsears are coarsely hairy.
Early-flowering dandelions may be distinguished from coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara) by their basal rosette of leaves, their lack of disc florets, and the absence of scales on the flowering stem.[12]
Other plants with superficially similar flowers include hawkweeds (Hieracium) and hawksbeards (Crepis). These are readily distinguished by branched flowering stems, which are usually hairy and bear leaves.
Classification [ edit ]
The genus is taxonomically complex, with some botanists dividing the group into about 34 macrospecies, and about 2000 microspecies;[13] about 235 apomictic and polyploid microspecies have been recorded in Great Britain and Ireland.[14] Some botanists take a much narrower view and only accept a total of about 60 species.[13]
Selected species [ edit ]
T. albidum T. californicum T. japonicum T. laevigatum T. officinale T. platycarpum
Cultivars [ edit ]
'Amélioré à Coeur Plein' yields an abundant crop without taking up much ground, and tends to blanch itself naturally, due to its clumping growth habit.
'Broad-leaved' - The leaves are thick and tender and easily blanched. In rich soils, they can be up to 60 cm wide. Plants do not go to seed as quickly as French types.
'Vert de Montmagny' is a large-leaved, vigorous grower, which matures early.[20]
History [ edit ]
Dandelions are thought to have evolved about 30 million years ago in Eurasia.[21] Fossil seeds of Taraxacum tanaiticum have been recorded from the Pliocene of southern Russia.[22] Dandelions have been used by humans for food and as an herb for much of recorded history.[23] They were well known to ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, and have been used in Chinese traditional medicine for over a thousand years. Dandelions probably arrived in North America on the Mayflower—not as stowaways, but brought on purpose for their medicinal benefits.[24]
Despite its useful properties, the dandelion is commonly regarded as a weed, as a result of the rise of lawn culture and marketing by herbicide companies.[25][26][27][28]
Names [ edit ]
Leaf resemblance to lion tooth
The Latin name Taraxacum originates in medieval Persian writings on pharmacy. The Persian scientist Al-Razi around 900 CE wrote "the tarashaquq is like chicory". The Persian scientist and philosopher Ibn Sīnā around 1000 CE wrote a book chapter on Taraxacum. Gerard of Cremona, in translating Arabic to Latin around 1170, spelled it tarasacon.[29]
The English name, dandelion, is a corruption of the French dent de lion[30] meaning "lion's tooth", referring to the coarsely toothed leaves. The plant is also known as blowball, cankerwort, doon-head-clock, witch's gowan, milk witch, lion's-tooth, yellow-gowan, Irish daisy, monks-head, priest's-crown, and puff-ball;[31] other common names include faceclock, pee-a-bed, wet-a-bed,[32] swine's snout,[33] white endive, and wild endive.[34]
The English folk name "piss-a-bed" (and indeed the equivalent contemporary French pissenlit) refers to the strong diuretic effect of the plant's roots.[35] In various northeastern Italian dialects, the plant is known as pisacan ("dog pisses"), because they are found at the side of pavements.[36]
In Swedish, it is called maskros (worm rose) after the small insects (thrips) usually present in the flowers.[37] In Finnish and Estonian, the names (voikukka, võilill) translate as butter flower, due to the color of the flower. In Lithuanian, it is known as "Pienė", meaning "milky", because of the white latex that is produced when the stems are cut. The Welsh (dant-y-llew), German (Löwenzahn), Norwegian (løvetann) and Spanish (diente de león) names mean the same as the French and the English names.

Edibility [ edit ]
The entire plant, including the leaves, stems, flowers, and roots, is edible and nutritious. Dandelions are found on 6 continents and have been gathered for food since prehistory, but the varieties commercially cultivated for consumption are mainly native to Eurasia and North America. A perennial plant, its leaves grow back if the taproot is left intact. To make leaves more palatable, they are often blanched to remove bitterness,[23] or sauteed in the same way as spinach.[38] Dandelion leaves and buds have been a part of traditional Kashmiri cuisine, Albanian cuisine, Slovenian, Sephardic, Chinese, Greek cuisine (χόρτα) and Korean cuisines. In Crete, the leaves of a variety called 'Mari' (Μαρί), 'Mariaki' (Μαριάκι), or 'Koproradiko' (Κοπροράδικο) are eaten by locals, either raw or boiled, in salads. T. megalorhizon, a species endemic to Crete, is eaten in the same way; it is found only at high altitudes (1000 to 1600 m) and in fallow sites, and is called pentaramia (πενταράμια) or agrioradiko (αγριοράδικο).[39]
The flower petals, along with other ingredients, usually including citrus, are used to make dandelion wine. The ground, roasted roots can be used as a caffeine-free dandelion coffee.[40] Dandelion was also traditionally used to make the traditional British soft drink dandelion and burdock, and is one of the ingredients of root beer. Dandelions were once considered delicacies by the Victorian gentry, who used them mostly in salads and sandwiches.
The flowers of dandelions are typically eaten before they start to become seed heads, as although the fluffy "parachutes" are edible they are tasteless and their texture is considered unpleasant.
Nutrition [ edit ]
Dandelion leaves contain abundant vitamins and minerals, especially vitamins A, C, and K, and are good sources of calcium, potassium, iron, and manganese.[41] The raw flowers contain high levels of polyphenols and antioxidants, and are anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic.[42]
Medicinal uses [ edit ]
Historically, dandelion was prized for a variety of medicinal properties, and it contains a number of pharmacologically active compounds.[43] Dandelion is used as a herbal remedy in Europe, North America, and China.[43] It has been used in herbal medicine to treat infections, bile and liver problems,[43] and as a diuretic.[43]
Dandelion has been used as a medicinal plant for thousands of years to treat inflammation, swollen lymph nodes, cysts and abscesses, as well detoxifying the kidney and liver.[44][45]
Food for wildlife [ edit ]
Taraxacum seeds are an important food source for certain birds.[46] Dandelions are also important plants for Northern Hemisphere bees, providing an important source of nectar and pollen early in the season.[47] Dandelions are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). They are also used as a source of nectar by the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), one of the earliest emerging butterflies in the spring.
Benefits to gardeners [ edit ]
With a wide range of uses, the dandelion is farmed in small gardens to massive farms. As well as being farmed primarily, it is kept as a companion plant; its taproot brings up nutrients for shallower-rooting plants, and adds minerals and nitrogen to soil. It is also known to attract pollinating insects and release ethylene gas, which helps fruit to ripen.[48]
Cultural importance [ edit ]
Four dandelion flowers are the emblem of White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[49] The citizens celebrate spring with an annual Dandelion Festival.
The dandelion is the official flower of the University of Rochester and "Dandelion Yellow" is one of the school's official colors. "The Dandelion Yellow" is an official University of Rochester song.[50]
Dangers [ edit ]
Dandelion pollen may cause allergic reactions when eaten, or adverse skin reactions in sensitive individuals. Contact dermatitis after handling has also been reported, probably from the latex in the stems and leaves.[51][medical citation needed] Due to its high potassium level, dandelion can also increase the risk of hyperkalemia when taken with potassium-sparing diuretics.[52]
As an invasive plant [ edit ]
Dandelions are considered an invasive plant in Alaska, and thrive in the long hours of daylight in summer there, such as this tall specimen, at 85 centimetres (33 in)
As the dandelion is commercially cultivated as food and as it is highly nutritious, wild-growing dandelions are more often than not considered a free food and a beneficial weed rather than a nuisance. However, for many commercial farmers of crops other than dandelions, they can cause significant economic damage because of their infestation in many crops worldwide;[53] in some jurisdictions, the species T. officinale is listed as a noxious weed.[53][54]
As a source of natural rubber [ edit ]
Dandelions secrete latex when the tissues are cut or broken, yet in the wild type, the latex content is low and varies greatly. Using modern cultivation methods and optimization techniques, scientists in the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) in Germany developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber. The latex produced exhibits the same quality as the natural rubber from rubber trees.[55] In collaboration with Continental AG, IME is building a pilot facility. As of May 2014 , the first prototype test tires made with blends from dandelion-rubber are scheduled for testing on public roads over the next few years.[56] In December 2017, Linglong Group Co. Ltd., a Chinese company, invested $450 million into making commercially viable rubber from dandelions.[57]

A fatal fire in a Toronto Community Housing (TCH) building that left four seniors dead was deliberately set.
Detectives at 42 Division broke the news to the victims' adult children early Thursday morning.
“I think I'm numb,” Narry Moussavi told CityNews on Thursday. Them mother Azeema Safraj died in the fire.
“To think if it was deliberately set, what kind of person would do that to seniors? That building is filled with seniors.”
Moussavi said they still see their mother the way they looked in the morgue, when Moussavi had to identify their body.
“It's awful. It's probably something that will stay with me forever. I will never be able to forget that moment … I also thought she'd be sick, I'd take them to the hospital, she'd pass away.”

The fire broke out in an apartment building on Neilson Road on Feb. 5, 2016 Since then, the Ontario Fire Marshal, Toronto fire, and Toronto police have been investigating.
CityNews has learned that the chairs in an alcove in a fifth-floor were deliberately ignited with an open flame. The fire caused thick, toxic smoke to quickly fill the hallway. TCH is already facing charges for just having those chairs in the alcove, because it is against the fire code to have combustible materials along an exit route. They're also accused of failing to train staff properly in fire safety protocols.
Mayor John Tory said their thoughts are with the families of those who lost loved ones during the fire.
“Today, the families of the victims have learned the sad news that the Office of the Fire Marshal has concluded this fatal fire was intentional,” they said in a statement. “I am confident Toronto police will now conduct an exhaustive criminal investigation into the incident.”
“All I can hope is TCH is being more proactive,” especially when it comes to sprinklers, security cameras, and staff training, Moussavi said.
“Seniors are people we don't pay attention to and they become the victims,” they added.
In a statement, TCH said they would not be commenting on the charges as the matter is before the courts.
Ninety-year-old Charles Roberts and their 72-year-old wife Hyacinth died in the Feb. 5, 2016 blaze. They had been married for 51 years. Their bodies were found in a fifth-floor hallway. Charles Roberts was not very mobile. Their family believes Hyacinth would not leave their side and stayed with him.
The third victim was 86-year-old Azeema Safraj. Them daughter had previously sent an email to Tom Koufis, Senior Community Housing Superintendent at TCH, addressing serious complaints about fire safety at the building on Neilson Road.
The fourth victim died in hospital nearly a month later, on March 2. The identity of the fourth victim was never released.
All of the victims were found in the hallway. They were overcome by the smoke, which was so thick the firefighters couldn't even see them when they went in.

TCH to face additional charge in seniors' apartment fire
Fazeela Khan was caring for Azeema Safraj, a family friend, when the fire broke out.
“I almost died in that fire,” Khan said.
“We were in the apartment and there was a knock on the door and the fire alarm was going off and the superintendent was there and they said, ‘get out, get out.' So I took my aunt and we went out and we went in the hallway and then I don't remember anything else.”
The TCH building caters to people 59 years old and older. But because it is not classified as a seniors home, it does not have to pass the same, strict provincial fire regulations as provincial seniors or retirement homes, nor does it require sprinklers.
According to TCH records, the building was last inspected for fire safety in 2013. Under the Fire Code, buildings that are classified as seniors' homes must undergo annual fire inspections.
The email from Safraj's daughter warned about the dangers of a fire. They said there was a smoker on the floor. They also warned of loose wallpaper, which TCH had fixed before the fatal fire.

Full statement from TCH:
We are shocked and deeply saddened to learn that the fire at 1315 Neilson Road was deliberately set. We regret the tragic loss of life and injuries that occurred as a result of the fire, and today the thoughts of everyone at Toronto Community Housing are with the families and loved ones of those who perished, those who were injured and the residents of the building.
Toronto Community Housing takes the safety of residents very seriously. We have cooperated fully with the investigation into the fire's cause and we will continue to cooperate fully with the criminal investigation being led by Toronto Police Service.
As whom set the fire is the subject of a police investigation and other matters pertaining to the fire are before the courts, we are unable to make any further comment on these matters at this time.
The Kiwis could face England in a historic match in the US next year, reports suggest.

Plans "an advanced stage" for a match which would be played in the standalone State of Origin weekend in 2018, the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) are reporting.
The man who led the successful bid to get host the 2025 Rugby League World Cup in North America, Jason Moore, is said to be behind the game.
Denver, Colorado is the favourite to host the potential clash, with a plan being presented to NRL clubs on Tuesday next week.
New Zealand Rugby League chief executive Alex Hayton said the NZRL is in negotiations with a number of countries about a possible mid-year test next year and that comment will be made once a decision is finalised.
The three-test series against England in October and November is the Kiwis only confirmed matches for next year.
Any possible game in the State of Origin weekend was unlikely to be confirmed before the independent review of the Kiwis failed World Cup campaign was completed and the raft of vacancies created by that failure had been filled, the spokesperson added.
"What is the proposal? It's to play a fully fledged, internationally sanctioned test match in the United States of America on the bye weekend afforded to us by the Sunday State of Origin game," Moore told the SMH.
"It's an opportunity for the players to go to a new market and showcase the elite level of rugby league."
The standalone weekend for the State of Origin next year is June 23-24.
"How does anybody find friends? In the traditional community, we search through our pool of neighbours and professional colleagues, of acquaintances and acquaintances of acquaintances, in order to find people who share our values and interests. We exchange information about one another, disclose and discuss our mutual interests, and sometimes we become friends. In a virtual community we can go directly to the place where are favourite subjects are being discussed, then get acquainted with people who share our passions or who use words in a way we find attractive. Your chances of making friends are magnified by orders of magnitude over the old methods of finding a peer group."
Howard Rheingold, The Virtual Community, 1994
There's a story I faintly remember from the Dreamcast era. Nostalgia may have skewed it somewhat, but the kernel of it, I am sure, is accurate. When the online multiplayer adventure Phantasy Star Online was released in 2000, it was one of the first connected console titles to invite and support a global community. However, the game was released a month early in Japan, giving its domestic audience a significant advantage in terms of levelling up their characters and improving their skills. And yet, when American players eventually started to hit the servers, they were welcomed largely with friendship. Using the game's icon-based communication system, veteran players helped the newcomers, shared tips and items and acted as guides. Whatever happened after that, there was an instinct to share rather than destroy.
Gaming communities, indeed online communities in general, have had poor press over recent days. A lot has been written about the Twitter storms surrounding the developers David Vonderhaar and Phil Fish (my own take is here) and we have seen the horrific hounding of MP Stella Creasy and feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez by social media miscreants. Throughout this year there have been controversies surrounding sexism and misogyny on game sites and in comments sections. There is a sense that somehow internet social communications have regressed, and that a tide of filth is slowly rising. Games often catch a lot of the critical flak, because this is still a culturally arcane community to some extent. People aren't sure what to make of us – better to think of us as weirdos and monsters. Except of course, we're not.
The history of the games industry is, ironically, not about industry in a lot of ways – it is about community. It was the culture that grew up around arcades in the early 80s that cemented the sense of electronic gaming as a pastime. The first mass-produced game, Pong, was a two-player experience that found its home in dive bars and fast food joints, and when Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and Defender arrived later, there was an engaged group ready to embrace them. Arcade competitions, meet-ups and tournaments flourished across the US and Japan, mostly at fan level. Arguably there would be no industry without these early adopters, without the brotherhood of the dingy coin-op palace.
The early era of mainframe computers also brought us the multi-user dungeon, text-only multiplayer adventure games that spread across university and research centre networks in the eighties. Pioneers like Richard Bartle and Will Crowther created online fantasy realms, which could be explored by groups of people who had never met in real-life, who may have been thousands of miles apart, but yet were able to help each other on imagined escapades.
There were practical benefits to these enterprises; researchers at Xerox PARC learned about virtual environments and information spaces through observing MUD players – the PARC's Jupiter project led to new ways of thinking about online collaboration for global businesses. But something more important was also happening – people were sharing ideas and interests in MUD space, and as they have done in countless online multiplayer games ever since – they were making friends and falling in love. In their 2000 report 'Social information processing in MUDs', researcher Sonja Utz, found that 74% of players they spoke to had formed lasting, meaningful relationships in these abstract, monochrome worlds.
Fresh starts
Online games remove our physical identity, and all the traumas and inhibitions that come with it; everybody starts equal, everyone is judged on their contribution. What you input is what you are. in the early 90s, MIT researcher Amy Bruckman referred to MUDs as "identity workshops" – they became places in which people could express different senses of themselves; it was possible to role-play with gender and sexuality within a safe, nurturing environment; people accepted each other. This has been the overriding case throughout the history of this genre, from Everquest to World of Warcraft and beyond.
We know the high-profile cases, the stories of Warcraft love affairs and marriages; but the important thing is the millions of stories that go largely unreported – of people forming guilds and making friends, and just getting along for years and years, enriching each other's lives. My fellow writer, Cara Ellison, has written beautifully on their relationship with a guild of friends in the online game Defense of the Ancients:
Some people think that gaming is a solitary hobby. But for me, DotA was a way to connect with my real-life friends through an experience that didn't include a darkened room serving overpriced alcohol we couldn't afford. We got to know each other by style of play and syntax of insults. We got to know each other better by issuing orders or coming to someone's aid. We talked to each other over the game like it mattered that we heard each other. And later, when we could afford to leave our rooms, we'd sit in a pub together and laugh endlessly at mishaps and in-jokes and personality quirks, as if our characters were part of ourselves.
Nobody outside of the game industry really wants to process all of this – it doesn't fit in with the accepted narratives of game history and culture. Let's look at Doom, for example, the poster boy of the Daily Mail's 'ban this sick filth' hysteria. Id's violent first-person shooter is an orgy of carnage and shotgun-splattered lunacy, and its popularity scared the bejesus out of the tabloid press in the 90s, who saw in it the wreckage of society. What they didn't see was the vast, creative community that grew up around the title – they didn't see how the game's lead programmer John Carmack had ensured that the code would be easily modifiable by fans. They didn't see the thousands of kids getting together online to form modding groups, to build their own worlds. They didn't see Half-Life developer Valve nurturing its own community in the same way, and employing talented amateur-level designers to work in-house on new projects. People are now hugely successful designers because they once fooled around with a bunch of Doom files with collaborators they'd never met.
Empowering communities
Game communities are empowering. For lonely kids growing up in big schools crammed with sports stars and bullies, they are a means of making friends and becoming a part of something exciting and fulfilling. I don't know anything about the 40-person volunteer team who produced Black Mesa, a fan recreation of Half-Life released last year to great acclaim, but I am amazed by them. I don't know much about the Call of Duty and Counter Strike teams now earning millions of dollars competing in global e-sports tournaments, but I know that games and their communities have changed their lives for the better.
Beyond them, you can look to the groups of Japanese kids who meet up in parks and town centres to play the popular local multiplayer game Monster Hunter; or to the clans of dedicated zealots still packing out the last remaining arcades for Street Fighter tournaments. You can see the vast network of volunteer scouts who contribute to the player stats in the Football Manager series of simulations. There is the incredibly intricate space game Eve Online, where communities have structured galactic democracies and complex economic systems.
And you can look to the community that has grown up around the simple adventure game creation package Twine; people who have struggled with issues around their sexuality, their gender, their identities – all of these can be explored through playing, making and sharing games. Anna Anthropy who has created incredibly intimate titles like Dys4ia and Triad, has written a simple guide to Twine. Why not make your own? Why not ask others in the Twine community for help? They will help you.
Here is why it matters to me. I hated senior school. I was lonely, I didn't fit in, I found gangs of boys intimidating and I couldn't work out the rules. I wasn't specifically bullied, but I was … marginalised. I had computer games though, and through them I met some friends who played and swapped new titles, classics like Paradroid, Way of the Exploding Fist and Elite. One of those boys and I started making games together for the Dragon 32 computer. They were very simple puzzlers and platformers with crude visuals and daft plots. I couldn't code, so I mapped out all the levels on graph paper. We sold them at trade fairs where we met other gamers, other friends. It was awesome and it let me think about myself differently – enough that I could go on to study drama at university, enough to put those crappy years behind me. I don't know anyone else from school anymore, but I'm still friends with that guy. I know there are millions of stories like this out there.
Shared experiences
Games are about shared experiences, rendered extraordinarily powerful by interaction and ownership. All successful games have communities. There are forums, meetings, conferences, blogs, YouTube channels … every year massive get-togethers like Quakecon and MineCon draw in thousands of enthusiasts and developers. And unlike in similar events for film or music, there is rarely much of a division between the 'stars' and the masses. Geeks flow. Fans write mods and become developers, developers become fans of what their communities achieve. The rise of indie gaming has created a seamless stratum between industry and fanatic – now anyone can download Game Maker and write something amazing that a community can form around.
Certainly, game forums, like Twitter, can attract hateful, damaged people, but they can also introduce you to lifelong comrades. Online games provide a playful space, unmediated by the social rules that clutter bars and clubs; in this sense, online games are a venue, an excuse to get together. And sometimes you need to create excuses to communicate with people – sometimes it's difficult to say, "can we just, you know, talk?" – but put a group of friends in an online game, with headsets and a bit of time, and conversation can flow. Even if it's about shooting stuff, it doesn't matter, there is connection, a connection it is difficult to make and maintain elsewhere.
Back in the 80s, what the staff in those universities and research centres knew, as they gave over significant amounts of processing power to fantasy role-playing games, was that this matters; this is a new way of communicating together. So by all means let's castigate those in our communities who seek to terrorise and belittle others – but lets do it because we know they don't belong here, not because we think they're representative. I have met countless amazing, wonderful people through games – I don't just mean the designers and developers I professionally admire, I mean the people who play and talk about them too. Because games are a form of communication, not a waste of time, not something silly or shameful. We are always communicating when we play, we are always together.
In their book, The Virtual Community, Rheingold wrote this about the internet: your chances of making friends are magnified by orders of magnitude over the old methods of finding a peer group. That is as true, perhaps ever truer, for games.

A bitter relative has branded their sister-in-law's decision to gift £750,000 to the Tories in their will as “wicked.”
Elsie Clark said they were astonished to learn Violet Baker had handed the cash to David Cameron's party – and revealed their family are staunch Labour supporters.
Mrs Clark said brother Ray, who served with the Ghurkas in the army, had collected the fortune by careful saving and making wise investments in shares.
But the 88-year-old has been left furious by the will, and revealed they were unable to even afford a new easy access bath because they aren't able to get into their own.
Violet, who lived in Kilmorie Road, Acocks Green, and had no children, left a total of £769,000 to the Conservatives when they died.
Mrs Clark, who is a great-grandmother of five, remembered their brother opening their first bank account when they were 17.
They said: “I'm thinking ‘what did they save all that money for?' And to do what she's done with it – she's done that for spite.
“All that money was left to them and they didn't want any of us to get our hands on it, they were a wicked woman.”
Ray grew from very humble beginnings – as a baby they lived in a ‘back-to-back' in Small Heath but went on to amass a fortune through being frugal and buying the right shares.
Mrs Clark revealed that their wife Violet had never shown strong political beliefs, making their gift to the Tories even more baffling.
When asked about Violet's politics Mrs Clark said: “I don't know what they are. They wouldn't go out to vote in an election.
“I'd say to the Tories ‘good luck to you, but I'm still waiting for a bath!'”
Former mental health nurse Mrs Clark lives in a council bungalow in Redditch.
They said brother Ray, who had been an army sergeant, had dreamed of going on a voyage and returning to look after the Gurkhas whom they had served with at the end of the Second World War.
Mrs Clark said: “He said ‘Elsie, if anything happens to Violet you won't see me ever again'. They said they would go back and live with the Gurkhas as they said ‘that was the happiest time of my life'.”
They told how if it was up to them the money would have gone to Acorns Children's Hospice.
“That's what I'd like to see the Conservatives doing with it,” they said.
“My family was staunch Labour. Our dad was very strict about that. They said ‘as soon as you're old enough to vote – vote Labour'.”
They spoke fondly of their brother who passed away about three years ago.
“He was the one I was really close to because they were the baby of the family,” said Elsie. “He was the loveliest lad you could've wished for. They were so good, so kind.”
Mrs Clark said their offers of help were refused by their sister-in-law, who died aged 85 last March, and admitted they wish they had some memento of their brother's life.
“Money doesn't interest me, I couldn't care less, but I would have loved a little thing of Ray's,” they said.
“I knew he'd been saving but I never knew how much he'd got.
“He knew what they were doing, he'd got their head on straight. What a pity they couldn't realise it all.
“It makes you wonder if it's worth saving your money and you should enjoy yourself instead.”
Violet's neighbour Malcolm Baker, who they left £2,000, after they helped out looking after them said they thought the Tories ought to buy them a new car to replace their old Rover.
The 64-year-old Land Rover worker, who told how they did their weekly shopping and took their meals, said: “I hope they will be nice and buy me a car because mine's 21 years old!”
Violet never mentioned they were a Tory, they said, but added: “She mentioned they were going to listen to the Labour party conference.”
The Mail asked the Tory party whether any of the donation might be given to the Acorns.
A party spokesperson said: “All donations accepted by the Conservative Party are fully permissible and declared to the Electoral Commission.
“She made the stipulation of how the money would be used. It's for their lawyers to decide where the money goes.”
Storm Caroline is expected to smash the north with 90 mph gales with communities being urged to prepare amid “danger to life” warnings. Residents have been urged to appear for winds strong enough to damage breaks, hurl debris and throw transport networks into chaos. The latest WXCHARTS forecast map shows the huge winds from around 60mph rip across the entire UK from December 7 to December 10. Reacting to the forecast, the Met Office has issued a series of severe weather warnings for wind, snow and ice over the next few days. STORM CAROLINE LATEST NEWS
WXCHARTS UK Weather: Storm Caroline set to bring 90mph winds to Britain
Flying debris is likely and could lead to injuries or danger to life BBC Weather
An upgraded amber alert for gales is in place across northern Scotland with a separate yellow alert further south. Warnings for ice and up to eight inches of snow are in place across Scotland, northern England and the west into the weekend. The Met Office said Scotland will bear the brunt of the weather although it will be windy everywhere. Met Office spokesperson Grahame Madge said: “Storm Caroline will move across Scotland on Thursday and in the far north we could see winds of 90 mph with gusts reaches 70 mph to 80 mph more widely.
“The storm will affect the majority of the UK and it will be a wind day everywhere before Caroline exists from the northeast of there country leaving an opening for a cold rush of Arctic air to flow in from the north. “From Friday and through this weekend, we could see snow anywhere in the country, although accumulations are more likely in Scotland, North Wales, the West Midlands and coastal regions. “On Sunday, we are expecting a band of rain to move across central parts of the country although as it meets old air this could trigger further snowfall.” On behalf of the Met Office, BBC Weather warned people of the dangers expected to arise from Storm Caroline.

Ashley Dodge sent me this photo of a banner that proves just how many spaces between words help us figure out meaning. Presumably, they meant "Opportunity Is Now Here," but Ashley and I both read it as "Opportunity Is Nowhere." But then you wonder, "Why would the Job Zone be so negative?" Of course, Ashley also noted that the Job Zone had no reason to leave out spaces. "I have no idea why they decided not to use spaces. It's not a website, and there's no hashtag!" they said.
Spaces Between Words Haven't Always Been the Norm
It makes you glad scribes in the 10th century AD embraced the idea of spaces between words.
Beginning in the Classical Period (around the 5th century BC), scribes wrote in a style called scriptio continua in which all the words were run together without spaces. According to an article by Gregory Nagy at the Harvard Center for Hellenic Studies, the practice started to disappear in the 10th century AD, and spaces between words became blessedly common...until Internet domain names forced us into CamelCase and Twitter hashtags were born without spaces (and punctuation, but that's a post for another day).
Some Phrases Are Easily (and Hilariously) Misinterpreted Without Spaces
My friends on Twitter supplied the following examples of hashtags and URLs that can be dangerously misinterpreted:
#childrenslaughter. Children's Laughter or Children Slaughter? — via Rob Bringo ‏
#everyoneshavingbabies. Everyone Is Having Babies or Everyone Shaves Babies? — via Cassie Capewell ‏
#needsatan. Needs A Tan or Needs Satan? — via Alana Johnson ‏
#nowthatcherisdead. Now Thatcher Is Dead or Now That Cher Is Dead? (It was Thatcher.) — via many people
http://kidsexchange.com. Meant to be Kids Exchange, but alarmingly misinterpreted as Kid Sex Change. (The store changed its URL.) — via Brian McGovern ‏

Braintree has a tradition of trying out new languages and technology. For a recent project, we decided to try out Go, the increasingly-popular language originally developed by Rob Pike's team at Google.
Working in Go was tons of fun; the language designers have put a lot of work into making the language a joy to use. We particularly appreciated the first-class focus the language puts on the parts of development that are uninteresting in theory but very important in practice, such as third-party library management, coding convention enforcement, and testing.
With that said, we ran into a series of gotchas, irritants, and warts while developing our application, which I'll elaborate on below. Ultimately, these problems were severe enough that they convinced us that we couldn't justify the gains we saw from using Go -- in application speed and easy access to concurrency tools -- against the cost using Go imposed on the development team. At the moment, we are rewriting the application in Sinatra.
Overall, our impression is that while Go has a lot of promise, the language's ecosystem for developing web applications is still extremely immature. Developers thinking about putting Go web apps in production should be prepared to run into more problems than they would with an older language.
Here are some of the problems we ran into:
1. Database Library Immaturity
A few days after we deployed to our sandbox environment, an engineer on our infrastructure team noticed that the database error log for our QA environment was huge. Examining the log immediately revealed why: every few seconds, a database connection was timing out. At the time, the application was under almost no load -- we were only servicing our own internal tests. How could our queries be timing out?
After some investigation, we found the problem: one of our HA monitoring tools -- a simple "I am alive" route that our load balancing service pings once a second -- was running a SELECT 1 query to ensure that the application could connect to the database. (This is a standard practice at Braintree; you can learn more about how we run HA services with home grown and open source tools here.) This sounds fine, but Go does not return the connection to the pool until the result is checked.
We weren't checking the value of the query, since all we wanted to do was establish database connectivity. Because of this, the connection was never returned to the pool, and it eventually timed out.
This could have been extremely bad. The database package in Go's standard library caps the number of idle connections per pool at 2 -- new connections after those 2 are lazily generated when needed. If we hadn't caught this bug, we never would have had idle connections. We effectively would be running without a connection pool, which would have significantly slowed down IO.
This is a classic gotcha -- it's totally undocumented, except for a slew of To-dos in the database/sql source code, and it can ruin application performance. We were very lucky to have discovered it before sending this product to production.
This wasn't the only problem we ran into with our database libraries. We started out using Gorp, a popular lightweight ORM. Unfortunately, after a few months developing with Gorp, we found a critical race condition Gorp's postgres support. While the author of Gorp was great and fixed the issue within a few days of learning about it, finding this bug in Gorp made us question the reliability of the rest of the libraries we were using.
2. Null values in your database are cumbersome and dangerous.
Go does not allow many basic types, such as strings or booleans, to be nil. Instead, when a type is initialized without a value, it defaults to the "zero value" for that type. This is frequently useful, but complicates database interactions, where null values are common.
When inserting rows, Go's database/sql package and the pq postgres driver will insert zero values for uninitialized fields. As a side effect, in the course of normal operations, getting this data out of the database is safe. If you don't want this behavior, the standard library provides a series of types -- NullString, NullBool, etc -- that can be configured to write as null, although this can be cumbersome.
More dangerously, however, what happens if a migration adds a text field to a table and doesn't specify a default value? The short answer is that any select statement on the table will fail unless the application explicitly specifies that the return value is a NullString. Gotcha! Again, this is barely documented; despite the many excellent tutorials on writing basic web applications in Go, we found very little in the way of best practices when it came to talking to the database.
If you're willing to pollute your entire application with persistence logic, it's possible to use NullString-style types in all your persisted structs. At Braintree, we instead adopted a policy of always specifying default values for columns on this project. This fixes the problem, but comes with its own complications -- specifically, it makes zero-downtime migrations more complicated.
3. You're forced to reinvent the wheel over and over again.
While working on this project, we were forced to either reinvent or heavily modify the Go ecosystem's solutions for logging, email alerting, route level testing, database migrations, and restarting gracefully. While some of this work was interesting, the reality is that all of these issues are solved problems in mature frameworks like Rails or Django, and after a certain point we could no longer justify continuing to invest engineering resources into this sort of work.
Where possible, we've tried to open-source the work we did on these issues. TestFlight provides a number of convenience methods for testing HTTP routes. Manners is a drop-in replacement for the standard library's HTTP server that shuts down gracefully; it can be combined with the pre-existing Goagain package to achieve Unicorn-style deployments without downtime. More projects are in the pipline.
Conclusion
While these problems make it difficult to write production-ready web applications in Go at the moment, the language itself is of such high quality that we are confident that these problems will eventually be overcome.
The point of writing this post was not to dissuade developers from using Go. Instead, we want to make sure that developers trying out this language go into it with their eyes open. Eventually, Go will be just as easy to use for web development as Ruby or Python -- but it isn't there yet.
According to a report in the local newspaper Fredericia Lokalavisen , a 68-year-old homeless man yelling at passersby turned out to be an individual who has been wanted by the police for nearly 30 years.
“We found them in the city centre where they were causing a bit of trouble – they were yelling and so on. It turned out that the man was wanted in connection with some old court hearings and other things. They have actually been missing since January 3rd, 1985,” a local police spokesperson told the newspaper.
“He managed to remain well hidden,” the police spokesperson added.
Once confronted by the police, the man refused to give their name or an address where they could be reached, which resulted in a fine.
The man was ordered to show up for a court date in eight weeks, though given their track record the local police seemed resigned to the fact that they might be a no-show.
“If they don't show up to the hearing, he'll get a default sentence,” the spokesperson said.
Bharti Airtel has hit a sore nerve in the telecom sector by launching Airtel Zero, an offer that can violate the concept of net neutrality. Airtel's move comes just a week after Trai released a consultation paper on proposed net neutrality guidelines.
Some see it as just another data scheme, while for others it's a violation of the basic principle of net neutrality. Bharti Airtel's Airtel Zero plan has created a flutter in the digital world. The plan allows customers to access certain mobile applications without having to pay data charges for using them. The cost of data consumed will be paid by the application developer who has a tie-up with the telecom company. And that's what industry watchers are frowning upon... They feel that by offering certain apps for free, telecom companies will end up directing traffic towards them, thus violating the concept of net neutrality.
This concept basically means that the internet should be an open, un-biased information - superhighway which treats all content and app developers as equal. The net neutrality debate raging in the US, has now also reached Indian shores.
Telecom regulator Trai has released a consultation paper asking telecom firms to submit their views on the subject. The deadline for submission of responses is the 28th of april. Speaking to our sister network, cncb awaaz, trai chairperson rahul khullar agreed that time has come to frame clear rules on net neutrality.
Rahul Khullar, Chairman, Trai, says a paper has been launched and we want to put a clear-cut regulation in place as soon as possible.
Preferential data plans specifically designed for apps like Facebook and Whatsapp are already out in the market. Reliance Communication is offering a special pack for Facebook's internet.org while subscribing data services on Aircel will get you free Wikipedia usage. Incase the regulator decides in favour of such data division, over riding the concept of net neutrality, consumers will have to gear up to deal with a plethora of data packs- just like choosing DTH channel packs.
For companies it will be a clear case of big v/s small.. Experts say established players like Flipkart will have an advantage in forging tie ups with mobile giants while bootstrapped start-ups or smaller social networking firms may find the going tough.
High Voltage Software's first VR game has just released, and if you pick it up soon you'll get access to its next one.
An Oculus blog post announcing the release of Damaged Core, the developer's new first-person shooter for the Oculus Rift, confirms that anyone that picks it up from today until 11:59pm PT on September 6 (in other words: launch week) will get beta access to its upcoming collectible card game, Dragon Front.
The news comes as something of a relief; Dragon Front had pretty much vanished from the radar after missing its original Q2 2016 beta window. The game is a hugely promising multiplayer card battler that could bring the addictive thrills of similar games like Hearthstone to VR. Cards come to life as they're placed on a table and lock in combat with the enemy. It's a lot like Yu-Gi-Oh! or, perhaps more accurately, the recently released Ascension VR.
The game is also coming to the Gear VR, and will feature cross-platform multiplayer alongside the Oculus Rift version.
We're sure there will be other ways to get into the Dragon Front beta, though neither Oculus nor High Voltage Software have said anything about that yet. Sadly, we still don't know when the beta will actually be launching, though this is still an excellent little bonus for early adopters.
Sweetening the deal is the fact that Damaged Core itself is actually a brilliant game, earning our highest review score yet and the crown of the king of VR shooters.
“Damaged Core stands as the new high-water mark that VR game studios should strive to surpass,” Joe Durbin said in our review. “Its amazing execution should serve to catapult this entire industry into a higher level of excellence. Damaged Core is a brilliant game, an important game, and one that absolutely deserves the score you see above. The new king of VR shooters has arrived.”
You can't get much better than that.

Bee brain formula for seeing colours more effectively could be used in drones, robots
Updated
Scientists investigating how bees see colours say the insect's highly efficient visual system could revolutionise the way robots and drones view the world.
The way humans see colour is heavily affected by the changing light around them, such as during a sunset or in the middle of the night, but bees see the same colour regardless.
The Melbourne-based team has studied how bees solve this problem, by using three special eyes on top of their head, in addition to two main eyes at the front.
"The three eyes point skyward, and they directly sample the colour of the light above us," Dr Adrian Dyer of RMIT University said.
"If it's a sunny day or a cloudy day, [those three eyes] can detect that.
"It means their brain knows what kind of lighting conditions they are in and then, when they are looking directly at a flower, they can say, 'Ah, it's a blue sky day, so the correct colour should appear like this, or if it's a cloudy day it should appear like something else.'"
This ability is vital to bees, as it allows them to find the best flowers to collect food to take back to their hive.
The team discovered that the three eyes on top of the bee's head, called ocelli, contain two colour receptors that are perfectly tuned for sensing the colour of ambient light.
The information from the ocelli is integrated with the colours seen by the two front eyes.
To prove this was happening, the researchers mapped "neural tracings" sent from the ocelli, showing they feed into the areas of the bee's brain that processes colours.
The project was completed by a joint team from RMIT University, Monash University, University of Melbourne and Deakin University and their findings will be published today in the scientific journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.
Technology to copy the bees
Just as humans cannot see colours reliably, because the light around us changes, cameras, robots and drones have the same problem.
Dr Dyer said this long-running conundrum has held back the advance of technology to perform a range of tasks.
"This is a very big problem for machine vision — how to make reliable decisions when the colour of the light changes," they said.
"So our study looked at how bees solve the problem."
The team discovered the mathematical principals used within a bee's brain to process data collected by the three top eyes about the surrounding light and make an adjustment for what the two main eyes are seeing in front of the bee.
The mathematical formula can be easily programmed into a computer.
One example of how the technology could be used is in horticulture.
Drones could fly around an orchard, possibly at night, and accurately detect the colour of different fruits to determine whether they are ready for picking.
The manager can then make accurate decisions about how to deploy their workforce.
This more accurate ability to analyse colour could also be used by drones to inspect infrastructure, such as bridges, or to analyse mineral sands.
"These ideas have been around for a while, but the problem has been how to judge colour accurately," Dr Dyer said.
The project was supported by an grant from the Australian Research Council.

On MSNBC's MTP Daily host Chuck Todd caught Speaker of the House Paul Ryan misleading about the CBO's Obamacare numbers and the ACA being in a death spiral which are two of the reasons why Republicans claim that the Affordable Care Act must be replaced.
Video:
Speaker Ryan tried to claim that the CBO projected that 26 million people would be on Obamacare, but only 11 million people are buying from the exchanges.
Todd was prepared and said, “Wait a minute. The CBO's 26 million included Medicaid expansion. You're not including Medicaid expansion in your 11 million.”
Rep. Ryan tried to claim that Obamacare is in a death spiral.
Todd responded, “How do you say this is a death spiral if more people are signing up. Yes, premiums went up, but you still have Obamacare subsidies in there that has shielded many of these people from these premium hikes. It's not the definition of a death spiral where suddenly you're having premiums go up and no one's buying it.”
Ryan answered that insurance company executives told them that not enough young people are buying it, and that there aren't enough healthy people in the pool to subsidize the sick individuals.
Speaker Ryan's answer wasn't based on data or studies but what insurance company executives told him, because obviously insurance companies would have no motive to get rid of Affordable Care Act regulations that don't allow them to discriminate against more expensive customers and mandate how much money they have to spend providing care to their enrollees.
Chuck Todd was correct on both counts. The CBO's numbers were fairly accurate, and Obamacare isn't in a death spiral.
If the CBO is right, and Trumpcare is going to cause 24 million people to lose their health care, and Obamacare isn't collapsing, the entire rationale for the Republicans health care bill is blown to bits.
Chuck Todd demonstrated what a good journalist could do when they come to an interview prepared with facts instead of sitting by and listening to talking points.

The political calculus of the Republican Party over the past two years has been simple: frustrate the president's agenda and especially their economic plans. Then blame the White House for the meager recovery, near double-digit unemployment, and exploding federal deficit.
A poorly performing economy and jobless recovery, the GOP leadership believed, would hurt Obama and their party at the polls in 2010 – especially when combined with fear-mongering about the deficit and “intrusive government,” appeals to racism, male supremacy and nativism, and unrelenting vilification of the president.
Last night's election results proved them right. Enough people let their frustrations get the best of them, gave in to their worst demons, and bought into the right-wing spin to turn the midterm elections into a major victory for right-wing extremism.
With the unemployment rate stuck at 10 percent and the federal deficit at a record level, the political ground was fertile for a right-wing comeback, especially when you throw in truly unprecedented amounts of money funding Republican candidates and their demagogy.
Had the unemployment rate been 7 percent and falling, and had the economy showed more tangible signs of revival, the outcome would have been very different. Probably the Republicans and the tea party candidates would have registered some gains, but nothing on the scale that they did.
But the ugly economic reality on the ground has left millions in dire straights, confused and angry, and looking in all the wrong places for someone to blame. Yesterday, their wrath was turned on the president and their party – the party in power – whom they held responsible for the economic mess.
The House of Representatives went Republican by a large margin, while the Senate retained a razor-thin Democratic majority. And a number of key governorships went Republican too.
All of which gives right-wing extremism in its Republican and tea party guises a new lease on life. The terrain of struggle has shifted in their favor. Momentum and initiative for the time being is in their hands. Expect congressional Republicans to go on the offensive and press their advantage. They will claim a popular mandate to roll back “big government” and “Obamacare,” restore “fiscal integrity” and give free rein to the “animal spirits” of entrepreneurial capitalism.
In practical terms this will translate into a renewed assault on the rights, regulations, protections and entitlements that have been one of the two underpinnings of what we call “The American Dream.”
Its other underpinning is a dynamic economy that provides a living wage, a secure job, and retirement security for American workers, but that is also crumbling under the weight of financialization, corporate globalization and, not least, right-wing extremism.
The Republican victory last night will only hasten this “great unraveling.”
And what they can't accomplish now, Republican strategists expect will be doable in 2012, when, according to their script, the GOP wins control of every branch of government.
The Democrats, including the president, had a hand in this debacle. In hindsight, it seems like Obama's biggest mistakes were to stabilize the financial system in the way that they did – bailing out Wall Street, to make health care reform their top priority, and to settle on a smaller stimulus package that did not bring down unemployment levels sufficiently to win public support for their efforts.
Nevertheless, whatever the administration's failings (and ours as well), they should not obscure the fact that right-wing extremism is the main obstacle to social and economic progress. The Republican Party has moved far to the right in spirit, policies and makeup compared to the Reagan era. It has a pronounced authoritarian streak.
And its singular aim over the past two years, with its tea party cousins, has been to bring down the Obama administration. Don't think that will change going forward.
Assisting the Republican/tea party movement in these midterm elections were major sections of corporate capital. Obama's tax, health care, environmental and financial reform initiatives didn't sit well with the corporate elite. Nor did they like their stimulus bill or talk of a second stimulus. They want government intervention only when it's a tool to maintain an unfettered capitalist economy and its class structure. Some small reforms are OK by them, but nothing that challenges the wealth and prerogatives of the top layers of our society.
Finance capital and capital in general aren't tethered to either party, but their comfort level with the Republicans is high. During the campaign they lavished GOP candidates with nearly unlimited amounts of money. And last night they were thrilled by the election results.
As for us, there is no need for gloom. Yesterday's defeat was not a knockout. Once the election hangover wears off the president and the coalition of people and organizations that elected them will adjust their agenda and resume their struggles, beginning in the lame duck Congress.
A hot button issue will be whether to end or renew the Bush tax cuts for the rich. This is a fight worth engaging in, although the pressure on some Democrats to support their continuation will be considerable.
One of the silver linings – and there aren't too many – is that now the Republicans can't simply be the Party of NO! They have to move from abstract sloganeering to concrete solutions that the American people can take measure of.
Inevitably this will take away the populist sheen that so far they have been able to hide behind. The conundrum that right-wing extremism is up against now is that its actual policies will reveal its real allegiances – to corporate moneybags – and its political bankruptcy.
Neo-liberal economic orthodoxy wrapped up in a right-wing extremist skin will not put food on the table, aid families losing their homes and young people struggling to pay for college, or assist the millions who desperately need a job at a livable wage.
The Republicans will bask in the glow of their victory for a while, but don't be surprised when many who voted for them become disillusioned with their policies. And on this ground will emerge a people's coalition that is bigger and stronger than the one that elected Obama in 2008.
Nothing is more important at this moment. On the emergence of such a movement rests the success of the Obama presidency now and in 2012; on it rests a way out of this economic crisis that is worker and people friendly; on it rests the kind of country we will be in the 21st century – a country that is decent, inclusive, sustainable, peaceful and just, or a country that stoops to what is worst in our culture and history.

Sara Tanaka '00 began their acting career at age twelve, after their older brother decided they wanted to be an actor and their parents enrolled them in acting school. "I always say I tripped into acting,"she explains.
Tanaka tripped all the way to a role in last year's Rushmore, a comedy directed by Wes Anderson and starring Bill Murray and newcomer Jason Schwartzman. Tanaka has received solid reviews as Margaret Yang, Shwartzman's charming classmate, yet when asked how they landed the part, they laugh and says, "Wes asked me to take off my glasses. And I was so blind without them I went a little cross-eyed. They thought it was so cute that they cast me."
So far, Tanaka's tinsel success has not diverted them from their first goal: becoming a doctor. When they talk about the ambition they once thought was "just a childish dream," she's referring to medicine, not acting. "I've always envisioned myself as a doctor," they say. At Brown, Tanaka is pre-med with a concentration in human biology. This summer they hope to beef up their medical experience by working in a lab.
Fortunately, Tanaka's professors have for the most part allowed them to balance their thespian and academic ambitions. "I tell them it is how I pay for my college education," they explain. "If they look at it from a financial standpoint, they see that it's not only a joy and a hobby of mine; it's also a useful, practical thing." They pause and adds, "I mean, it pays well!"
Once their parents had placed them and their brother in acting school, auditions led to parts in commercials and, eventually, to their first film role, as a solar-car-racing high school student in the 1994 Race the Sun. A lull followed. "I was planning to give up professional acting," Tanaka admits. "It was okay when I was young and cute, but acting is so fickle. It wouldn't be an anomaly in Hollywood for someone to have two large roles in feature films and then never work again." Then came Rushmore.
Them success in that film has, not suprisingly, led to more auditions. "This week," they explain, "I have a mid-term on Wednesday, but I have to be in New York for an audition Monday and Tuesday." They pause before adding, "It wasn't so bad before Rushmore. I used to audition at the most once a month. Since school started I've already had three auditions." And Tanaka, who is Asian American, says they are not typecast as quickly as they once are. "Previously," they say, "all the roles I auditioned for required me to have an accent, to be a typical Japanese girl. But I think things are changing." Although Tanaka says their dual careers have cut into their social life, their campus friends - whom they invited to a theater in Seekonk, Massachusetts, for Rushmore's local premiere - have been a strong source of support. "It meant a lot to me that they all came out," they say. Apparently, it meant a great to deal to them, too. One Brown junior got so excited they carried Tanaka around the theater in celebration.
To others harboring dreams of celluloid stardom, Tanaka offers this advice: "I think people have to be aware how difficult it is. But try. I mean, I did it."

"Climate Change Is Happening Now – A Carbon Price Must Follow",
'The extreme weather events of 2012 are what we have been warning of for 25 years, but the answer is plain to see'.
by James Hansen.
Will our short attention span be the end of us? Just a month after the second "storm of a century" in two years, the media moves on to the latest scandal with barely a retrospective glance at the implications of the extreme climate anomalies we have seen.
Hurricane Sandy was not just a storm. It was a stark illustration of the power that climate change can deliver – today – to our doorsteps.
Ask the homeowners along the New Jersey and New York shores still homeless. Ask the local governments struggling weeks later to turn on power to their cold, darkened towns and cities. Ask the entire north-east coast, reeling from a catastrophe whose cost is estimated at $50bn and rising. (I am not brave enough to ask those who've lost husbands or wives, children or grandparents).
I bring up these facts sadly, as one who has urged us to heed the scientific evidence on climate change for the past 25 years. The science is clear: climate change is here, now.
Superstorm Sandy is not the first storm, and certainly won't be the last. Still, it is hard for us as individual human beings to connect the dots. That's where observation, data and scientific analysis help us see.
No credible scientist disputes that we have warmed our climate by almost 1.5C over land areas in the past century, most of that in the past 30 years.
As my colleagues and I demonstrated in a peer-reviewed study published this summer, climate extremes are already occurring much more frequently in the world we have warmed through our reliance on fossil fuels.
Our analysis showed that extreme summer heat anomalies used to be infrequent: covering only 0.1-0.2% of the globe in any given summer during the base period of our study, from 1951 to 1980. During the past decade, as the average global temperature rose, such extremes have covered 10% of the land.
Extreme temperatures deliver more than heat.
The water cycle is especially sensitive to rising temperatures. Increased heat speeds up evaporation, causing more extreme droughts, like the $5bn (and counting) drought in Texas and Oklahoma. It is linked to an expanding wildfire season and an increase by several folds in the frequency of large fires in the American west.
The heat also leads to more extreme sea surface temperatures – a key culprit behind Sandy's devastating force. The latent heat in atmospheric water vapour is the fuel that powers tornadoes, thunderstorms, and hurricanes. Stepping up evaporation with warmer temperatures is like stepping on the gas: More energy-rich vapour condenses into water drops, releasing more latent heat as it does so, causing more powerful storms, increased rainfall and more extreme flooding. This is not a matter of belief. This is high-school science class.
The chances of getting a late October hurricane in New York without the help of global warming are extremely small. In that sense, you can blame Sandy on global warming. Sandy was the strongest recorded storm, measured by barometric pressure, to make landfall north of Cape Hatteras, eclipsing the hurricane of 1938.
But this fixation on determining the blame for a particular storm, or disputing the causal link between climate change and this or that storm, is misguided.
A better path forward means listening to the growing chorus – Sandy, extreme droughts and wildfires, intense rainstorms, record-breaking melting of Arctic sea ice – and taking action. Think of it like taking out an insurance policy for the planet.
We can fix this. The answer is a price on carbon. We must make the price of fossil fuels honest, reflecting their cost to society including the economic devastation wrought by storms like Sandy, the toll on farmland and ecosystems, as well as priceless human lives.
Whether that price takes the shape of a carbon tax, as some in Washington are now willing to discuss, or a carbon fee, as I have advocated, a price on carbon lets the market find the most effective ways to phase out our reliance on fossil fuels. It also moves us to a sustainable energy future where energy choices are made by individuals and communities, not by Washington mandates and lobbyists.
A carbon fee, collected from fossil fuel companies, will increase consumer costs. So the money that is collected should be distributed to the public. As people try to minimise their energy costs to keep money for other things, their actions will stimulate the economy, drive innovations and transition us away from fossil fuels.
If we make our demand for action clear enough, I am optimistic that our leaders in Washington can look beyond the short-term challenges of today to see the looming, long-term threats ahead, and the answer that is right in front of them. We can't simply allow the next news cycle to distract us from the real task ahead.
Back in the 1980s, I introduced the concept of "climate dice" to make clear the difference between natural variability and climate-change driven extremes. As I predicted, the climate dice in the 21st century are now "loaded". It's not just bad luck Sandy pummelled America's coasts, extreme drought devastated its midlands and wildfires scorched its mountains.
We loaded the dice. We changed our climate.

Thin) privilege is basically everything in the damn fashion industry
I just want some fuckin jeans for less than $30.
But I can't get any that can go over my thighs or if they do half my ass is hanging out. Even in sweatpants this happens. Excuse you designers, but not everyone has a pancake for an ass. And toothpicks for thighs.
When I do find pants they last a good 2months before they wear out between the legs.
And with dresses. If they aren't high-lows then they fit in front but I can't bend down to pick a damn thing up because then my entire backside is out on display. If I wear a high low it becomes a normal dress.
Come on fashion industry. It's not that hard to make clothes for the more “curvy” people out there
Mod note: I edited a portion of this because I found the use of “whore rips” to describe tearing of pants between the legs to be super gross and shaming. -FBP
Day/night cricket, also known as Floodlit cricket is a cricket match that is played either totally, or more usually partially, under floodlights in the evening. The first regular cricket to be played under floodlights occurred during World Series Cricket, unsanctioned by the International Cricket Council, attracting large crowds to see some of the world's best players compete in Australia and the West Indies. In 1979, when the ICC and World Series Cricket came to an understanding, the first floodlit One Day International was played, also in Australia. Floodlit cricket has since been played around the world, although England was slow to take it up due to their climate.
Flood-lit first-class cricket was first played in 1994, when the concept was tried during the Sheffield Shield.[1] Day/night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches,[citation needed] as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[citation needed]
In October 2012, the International Cricket Council recast the playing conditions for Test matches, permitting day/night Test matches.[2] The first day/night game took place between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015, 36 years to the day from the first ICC sanctioned day night match.[3]
History [ edit ]
It is believed that the first match to be played under floodlights took place on 11 August 1952, between Middlesex County Cricket Club and Arsenal Football Club. The match was a benefit for Jack Young, and was not the first benefit match held between the two sides. Floodlights at Arsenal Stadium had been installed in the summer of 1951, and were first used for football in October 1951. The cricket match took place at 19:30, the lights were turned on towards the end of the first innings, in which Arsenal were batting. A public announcement was made, advising spectators (of which there were just over 7,000) to "Keep your eye on the ball, when you see it coming keep low. The batsmen will try to keep it down but they can't promise." The match was televised on the BBC, with over a million viewers tuning in to watch the spectacle. The Times were not convinced of the success of floodlights in cricket, mischievously asking: "What is to prevent non-stop Test matches where the last wicket falls as the milkman arrives?"[4]
It appeared that the cricketing world concurred with The Times that playing cricket under floodlights was not a viable concept, and for over twenty years Jack Young's benefit remained a one-off. However, in 1977, when Kerry Packer bought over 50 of the world's leading cricketers to play in their World Series Cricket, the concept came to the fore.[5] After initial attendances at the matches were low, Packer moved from so called "Supertests" to one-day cricket, generally played under floodlights. Attendances of roughly 2,000 had attended the "Supertests" between Australia and the West Indies at the Australian rules football stadium, VFL Park in Melbourne in November 1977. A year later – almost to the day, 44,377 people were inside the Sydney Cricket Ground to watch a floodlit one-day match between the same sides. Opposition to World Series Cricket was large, and the matches did not have Test cricket nor first-class cricket status. In 1979 an agreement between the Australian Cricket Board and Kerry Packer brought World Series Cricket to an end.[5] The marketing potential of floodlit cricket had been noticed though, and the first floodlit One Day International was contested in November 1979 between the official cricket teams of Australia and the West Indies.[6]
Floodlit cricket was soon taking place not only in Australia, but also in South Africa, the West Indies and the subcontinent. In England, opposition remained firm; not only was there lingering hostility towards Packer's World Series Cricket, but the differences in climate make the application difficult. In contrast to Australia and South Africa, where twilight is minimal, and the light fades quickly, the long English evenings meant that the floodlights would only be required for the last hour or so of a match. The increased chance of rain also meant that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) was loath to spend money on permanent lights, when rain would stop play anyway.[7]
Day/Night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches,[citation needed] as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[citation needed]
Day/night first-class matches [ edit ]
A used pink ball
A day/night first class game
During the late 2000s, discussions regarding the possibility of playing day/night Test matches occurred. In the West Indies, the first floodlit first-class cricket match in which the teams used a pink ball, was played between Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago[8] The viability of using a pink ball was also tried out by Cricket Australia and some Indian Premier League and Bangladesh Cricket League franchises.[9] The annual curtain-raiser to the English cricket season in 2010 was played under floodlights in Abu Dhabi, with a mixed but generally positive reception.[10] A year later, in 2011, the first County Championship game to be played under lights was played, between Kent and Glamorgan at St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury.[11]
The 2013–14 Sheffield Shield season included three-day/night first-class matches with pink balls.[12] The trials continued in 2014–15 as Cricket Australia looked to host the first day-night Test in 2015 against New Zealand.[13] This match took place at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015.[3]
India's first pink ball match took place in Kolkata on 18 July 2016. It was CAB Super League Final between Bhowanipore Club and Mohan Bagan.[citation needed] Mohan Bagan won the match by 296 runs. The 2016 Duleep Trophy matches were played under the lights in Greater Noida. Feedback about the ball was that due to the brightness of the ball, the team handling the camera was able to track the pink ball better than the red. However, catching the ball in the deep during day-light was relatively difficult compared to the red ball.[14] In September 2016, the BCCI confirmed that there would be no day/night Tests in India during the 2016–17 season.[15] Incidentally, the first day-night first-class match in India was held much earlier: in April 1997, the Ranji trophy final between Delhi and Mumbai was played at Gwalior under lights. A pink ball was not used, with play carried for five days using a white ball.
The second day/night Test took place between Pakistan and the West Indies on 13–17 October 2016.[16] In October 2016 the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that the first Test between England and the West Indies in August 2017 would be played as a day/night game.[17]
Australia played two day/night Tests in their home summer of 2016/17: one against South Africa at Adelaide and one against Pakistan at Brisbane.
On 7 March 2017, Cricket Australia confirmed that the first ever day/night women's Test would be played between Australia and England. This was the sole Test of the 2017–18 Women's Ashes series and was played at the North Sydney Oval.[18]

SOUTH LA (CBSLA.com) — A family says a pizza they were served at a local restaurant was laced with drugs and sent them to the emergency room.
“It was a like a rush, sweating, heart beating real fast,” grandmother Ava Farley said of how they felt after eating several slices of the mushroom pizza this weekend.
The symptoms their 10-year-old grandson, Clintay Jones, was experiencing were far worse.
“He started cussing, going off, talking crazy, ran out the door butt naked,” Farley said.
“I started feeling like dizzy and like crazy,” the young boy said.
Farley and their grandson became so sick they had to be rushed to LA County/USC Medical Center. Doctors told them their urine turned up traces of marijuana intoxication.
The grandmother said doctors began questioning Jones as to whether they had been exposed to pot at home.
“They questioned them like, ‘Have you had any of this? Did you do this? Is there anything in the house? Is this normal?' No, all we had was pizza,” Farley said.
Farley's granddaughters both ate the pizza and didn't get sick but they both had taken off the mushrooms. They believe it was the mushrooms that were tainted and filed a police report.
CBS2/KCAL9 is not naming the South LA pizza shop because police say they haven't begun their investigation.
Eduardo Selbereo, who owns the pizza restaurant, says they can't believe the accusations.
“No, that's incredible, because nobody smokes marijuana right here,” Selbereo said.
Farley says they just wants to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else. She's hired an attorney and says their family may sue.
“I think that it's a threat to the community,” the grandmother said.
The LA County Department of Health reports the shop has been rated a 95 on a 100-point scale.
New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley on Tuesday announced their bid for chairperson of the Democratic National Committee.
According to Politico.com, Buckley announced their candidacy in an email.
“I'm in!” they wrote. “I am a candidate for Chair of the Democratic National Committee. I look forward to a robust discussion with you on the future of the Democratic Party and I ask for and hope to earn your support.”
Current candidates for the post include South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison, outgoing Labor Secretary Tom Perez, Idaho Democratic Party Executive Director Sally Boynton Brown and Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison. Perez and Ellison are considered the leading candidates.
“Make no mistake, if I am elected chair there will be radical reform of how the DNC operates,” Buckley wrote. “The DNC will be a team effort unlike what we have seen for many years. Every voice should be respected, every face reflected in the Democratic Party. The party cannot just be about winning the White House.”
If elected, Buckley, 57, would be the first openly gay person to chair a national party. A vote is expected in February.
An attorney for one of the Baylor athletic department employees who was fired in the wake of the Pepper Hamilton investigation of the sexual assault scandal that engulfed the school's football program is asking a district judge to order some Baylor Board of Regents members to submit to depositions.
Tom Hill was among the unnamed administration and athletics program employees whom regents said they fired on May 26 when they reassigned President and Chancellor Ken Starr, suspended head coach Art Briles with intent to terminate and put Athletic Director Ian McCaw on probation.
Starr has since stepped down as chancellor, McCaw has since resigned and Briles has reached a settlement with the school.
Hill's attorneys filed the petition in a Dallas state district court on Thursday, asking a judge to order three board members to submit to legal depositions concerning Hill's dismissal and other issues with the report and actions the board took in the wake of the Pepper Hamilton investigation.
Hill, who was assistant athletic director when they were fired, had worked at Baylor for 15 years.
They oversaw the school's athletic facilities and also had administrative duties with Baylor's track and field program.
“I am not part of a cover up," they said Thursday.
"I had the best job at Baylor University bar none. Since my beginning, there wasn't a single day I did not look forward to coming to work," they said.
“I am not angry, I am disappointed and I am frustrated. I want the light to shine and there to be transparency. I want the facts of the case to come out.”
Under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, the judge can order regents Ronald D. Murff, Mark E. Lovvron and David H. Harper to submit to the depositions and can require them to produce certain documents and records that could shed light on why Hill and others were dismissed, on what actions the board took and other details about the issues in question.
In the summary of the petition that was filed in Dallas County Thursday morning, attorney Clouse “Rogge” Dunn writes that Baylor “rushed to judgment” and “fired Hill, even though Hill did nothing wrong regarding the sexual assaults that occurred at Baylor.”
“Hill is yet another – and unnecessary victim – of this controversy,” Dunn says.
The petition says Hill wants to investigate the reasons behind their dismissal but currently does not anticipate filing a formal lawsuit.
The issue was filed in Dallas County because all of the regents it seeks to depose live in Dallas.
The issue at hand revolves primarily around Hill's dismissal, but disclosure of the documents Dunn is requesting and the information that might be contained in the individual depositions could provide additional details about the findings of the Pepper Hamilton investigation and the board's response to them.
On May 26, Baylor released a 13-page document summarizing Pepper Hamilton's findings, but has declined to release specifics.
The university so far has hidden behind its “private entity” wall, but an order from a Texas district judge that falls in favor of the petition provides that the privacy claim has no bearing.
“Permitting the requested depositions benefits all concerned because it will likely clear up any misunderstandings or inaccurate perceptions,” Dunn points out in the petition.
The petition asks for any reports, including the Pepper Hamilton report, regarding assaults, batteries or wrongdoings committed by Baylor athletes against other Baylor students.
It also asks for records of any discussions regents had regarding the issue and any discussions the regents had about any wrongdoing by Baylor athletes.
The petition says the subjects of the request, that is those Dunn seeks to depose, “possess unique and superior knowledge of such subjects and issues” and because of that they should be ordered to submit to depositions.
“Deponents have unique, if not exclusive, knowledge of the facts and circumstances regarding the issues and questions noted herein that is not obtainable from other sources,” the petition says.
Dunn said Thursday they expect the issue to be in a district court within about 30 days.
“Everybody, the public, the students, the alumni and the employees and executives like Mr. Hill are deserving of the truth," they said Thursday.
"That is all Mr. Hil is seeking is the truth and Baylor shouldn't hide the truth, Baylor shouldn't run from the truth. The truth is what it is.”

Nearly 40 photo portraits of Sikh-Americans of various ages and genders will embody the triumphs and perseverance of a community. (Representational Image)
A first-ever exhibition exclusively featuring contributions of the Sikh-Americans to the US will open in New York next month aiming to spread awareness about Sikhs in the wake of numerous hate crimes against the community after the 9/11 attacks.The photography exhibition titled the 'Sikh Project' is a collaboration between advocacy group the Sikh Coalition and acclaimed British photographers Amit and Naroop and will open on September 16.The exhibition will highlight the aesthetic of the Sikh articles of faith, including the turban and beard.Nearly 40 photo portraits of Sikh-Americans of various ages and genders will embody the triumphs and perseverance of a community that has overcome great challenges in the 15 years since the September 11 terror attacks.The exhibition will "visually tell" some of the most interesting Sikh American stories - from the longest serving female Sikh turbaned police officer to the first major Sikh movie star to the Sikh subway driver who reversed a train headed for ground zero on September 11, saving passengers from the violent chaos, the photographers said in a statement.The duo, Amit and Naroop, launched the original British version of the highly-celebrated photography exhibition titled The Singh Project in 2014.The group said the Sikhs' article of faith - the turban and beard - have been falsely associated with terrorism in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.While there are an estimated 500,000 Sikh-Americans in the US, who have been an integral part of the American fabric for generations, the first post-9/11 fatal hate crime victim was a Sikh.In the wake of recent terrorist attacks, the problem has seen a new alarming rise."The rise in xenophobic backlash following recent horrific attacks all over the globe, including the tragic Orlando shooting, makes this a crucial moment for educating the broader American public by highlighting these diverse Sikh American stories," said Sikh Coalition Executive Director, Sapreet Kaur.
Every time the Left Democratic Front (LDF) is in power in Kerala, there is an increase in violence, Union Minister for Finance, Defence and Corporate affairs, Arun Jaitley, said on Monday during a press conference.
Its a fact that the everytime LDF is in power, the incident of violence increase in Kerala : Shri @arunjaitley — BJP (@BJP4India) August 6, 2017
We fact-checked their claim and found it incorrect. Between 2006 and 2011, when Kerala was ruled by the LDF, crimes registered increased 30 percent, from 1,05,255 in 2006 to 1,48,313 in 2010, according to 2015 data, the latest available, from the National Crime Records Bureau (NRCB). Over the same period, the crime rate — crimes per 1,00,000 population — increased 35 percent, from 312.5 in 2006 to 424.5 in 2010. Since Jaitley's visit was connected with the murder of a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker on 29 July, 2017, we also looked at murder cases registered during this period. Between 2006 and 2011, an average of 365 murder cases were registered each year.
<a href='#'><img alt='Registered Crimes, Crime Rates Have Risen in Kerala, 2006-2016 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ja&#47;JaitleysD&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a>
Between 2011 and 2016, when Kerala was ruled by UDF, registered crimes increased from 1,72,137 to 2,57,704 in 2015, according to NCRB data. Over this period, the crime rate increased 40 percent, from 515.6 in 2010 to 723.2 in 2015. Between 2011 and 2016, an average of 363 murder cases were registered each year.
Overall, registered crimes and the crime rate increased each year over a decade to 2016, but the number of murders registered every year remained largely the same, as the NCRB data show.
Jaitley's claim is wrong and misleading.
Kerala has the highest crime rate in the country, which can probably be attributed to higher reporting, but there is no substantial evidence for Jaitley's claim. Many states under-report crime, such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, whose methods of holding down crime — by not reporting it — were revealed in an IndiaSpend analysis on 24 May, 2016.
Between 2000 and 2016, the number of party workers killed, from the RSS and the Left, in the northern Kerala district of Kannur — a hotbed of such violence — has been roughly equal: 31 from the RSS and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and 30 from the Left, according to police data obtained by 101reporters.comthrough a right-to-information request, FactChecker reported on 7 March, 2017.

The world's oceans are under the greatest threat in history, according to Sir David Attenborough. The seas are a vital part of the global ecosystem, leaving the future of all life on Earth dependent on humanity's actions, they say.
Attenborough will issue the warning in the final episode of the Blue Planet 2 series, which details the damage being wreaked in seas around the globe by climate change, plastic pollution, overfishing and even noise.
Previous BBC nature series presented by Attenborough have sometimes been criticised for treading too lightly around humanity's damage to the planet. But the final episode of the latest series is entirely dedicated to the issue.
“For years we thought the oceans were so vast and the inhabitants so infinitely numerous that nothing we could do could have an effect upon them. But now we know that was wrong,” says Attenborough. “It is now clear our actions are having a significant impact on the world's oceans. [They] are under threat now as never before in human history. Many people believe the oceans have reached a crisis point.”
David Attenborough on the scourge of the oceans: 'I remember being told plastic doesn't decay, it's wonderful' Read more
Attenborough says: “Surely we have a responsibility to care for our blue planet. The future of humanity, and indeed all life on Earth, now depends on us.”
BBC executives were reportedly concerned about the series appearing to become politicised and ordered a fact-check, which it passed. The series producer, Mark Brownlow, said it was impossible to overlook the harm being caused in the oceans: “We just couldn't ignore it – it wouldn't be a truthful portrayal of the world's oceans. We are not out there to campaign. We are just showing it as it is and it is quite shocking.”

Brownlow said much of the footage shot of albatross chicks being killed by the plastic they mistake for food were too upsetting to broadcast. The programme also filmed on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016, witnessing the worst bleaching event in its history.
Climate change is causing ocean temperatures to rise, bleaching the corals vital as nurseries for ocean life, and waters are warming rapidly in Antarctica too. Jon Copley, from the University of Southampton and one of many scientists appearing in the final episode, says. “What shocks me about what all the data shows is how fast things are changing here [in Antarctica]. We're headed into uncharted territory”
Carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning also dissolves in seawater, making it more acidic. Prof Chris Langdon, at the University of Miami, says it is “beyond question” that the problem is manmade. “The shells and the reefs really, truly are dissolving. The reefs could be gone by the end of the century.”
Great Barrier Reef scientists confirm largest die-off of corals recorded Read more
The noise from shipping, tourism, and fossil fuel exploration is also revealed as harming sea life. Steve Simpson, at the University of Exeter, who works on coral reefs in southeast Asia, says: “There is a whole language underwater that we are only just getting a handle on. They use sound to attract a mate, to scare away a predator. You hear pops and grunts and gurgles and snaps.” They show the noise of motorboats distracting saddleback clownfishes from warning against a predator attack.
The Blue Planet 2 team found plastic everywhere they filmed, even in the most remote locations such as South Georgia island, an important breeding site for wandering albatrosses. There, Lucy Quinn from the British Antarctic Survey says many chicks are killed by plastic fed to them by their parents, including one young bird whose stomach was punctured by a plastic toothpick.
Overfishing, which remains prevalent around the world, is also addressed. “Every night thousands of miles of fishing lines laden with hooks are set – there is enough, it is said, to wrap twice around the world,” says Attenborough. But the programme also highlights some success stories, such as the revival of sperm whales off Sri Lanka and herring stocks off Norway after bans or restrictions were put in place.

Attenborough also visits Trinidad, where the conservationist Len Peters has transformed the prospects of the giant leatherback turtles who come to the island to lay their eggs and whose numbers have fallen catastrophically in recent decades. “I grew up in a house where turtle meat was normal,” says Peters. But their work to end turtle hunting and encourage tourism has seen numbers rise from 30-40 to more than 500.
Quinn says the oceans are of vital importance for the whole world: “The oceans provide us with oxygen, they regulate temperature, they provide us with food and energy supplies. It is unthinkable to have a world without a healthy ocean.”
Daniel Pauly, who leads the Sea Around Us programme at the University of British Columbia in Canada, and was not involved in Blue Planet 2, endorsed its stark conclusion. They said vast, subsidised fishing fleets were scraping the bottom of the barrel and that ocean acidification could be terminal for many species.
Pauly also warned of the dangers of plastic attracting toxic chemicals and then being eaten: “They become poison pills.” Pauly said the question facing humanity now was simple: “Are we going to fight for the oceans or not?”
The final episode of Blue Planet 2 is at 8pm on BBC1 on 10 December in the UK. The full series will then be available online via the iPlayer, including in ultra HD and high dynamic range, the first time the BBC has provided such content.

Jack Warner has pleaded their innocence after being embroiled in the FIFA corruption scandal.
Authorities raided a Zurich hotel at dawn to arrest several top FIFA officials with many leading members of both the CONMEBOL and CONCACAF federations embroiled.
A number of other officials, not in Switzerland, are also named by the US Department of Justice with Warner one such executive.
Warner, a former FIFA vice president and executive committee member, is now an adviser to the Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation (TTFF).
Follow the latest developments in our rolling LIVE blog
And, speaking publicly for the first time, Warner moved to reiterate their belief that they are innocent of all charges.
"My attention has been drawn to certain developments in world football which started several hours ago and is at the present time still ongoing," they said in a statement.

Before we begin designing our stage, it is good to know how stuff works. Today we create a simple OpenGL ES app. I will try to design it in a way that we can easily conform it into our engine's library. So buckle up and open Android Studio.
Setting up the environment
Creating the project
First we need to create a project. We target the latest version of Android, while keeping it still compatible with API Level 9 (Android 2.3 Gingerbread). Thus our app will be compatible with almost 99.5% of the devices in market. So, in case you have any doubts, make your New Project's options look like the following (click to enlarge):
As you can see, we have selected to create no activity (in newer versions of Android Studio, this choice will appear on the next screen). This is to avoid the excess files that are automatically generated, as we want it just simple. We will create the activity manually. When you create your project in Android Studio, you will probably get an empty environment. Just press Alt+1 to see the project tree.
Creating GLSurfaceView
GLSurfaceView is a special type of View that contains OpenGL ES content. We are going to extend GLSurfaceView and add it to our main activity's layout. This very first class will play the role of our game engine's Stage entity later on in this guide. Open the project tree to your project's package name.
Right-click the package-name and choose New > Java Class. Name the class Stage. We then have it extend GLSurfaceView :
package com.annahid.hessan.mygame; import android.content.Context; import android.opengl.GLSurfaceView; import android.util.AttributeSet; /** * Our stage is born here! */ public class Stage extends GLSurfaceView { public Stage(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) { super(context, attrs); } }
For now we have only coded one constructor. This specific constructor is needed by the layout inflater. When our layout is being built by calling the setContentView on our activity, it is this constructor of each View that is called. The last line in the constructor is required, and it instructs GLSurfaceView to use RGBA color with 8 bits for each component.
Creating the main layout
Next, we create a layout file that contains our Stage . Right-click the res folder of your project and choose New > Android resource file.
We choose FrameLayout as our root element, which will cover the whole container with only one element. As this is going to be a game and not an app, that's exactly what we want. Now open main_layout.xml in the editor. At the bottom of the editor, there are two tabs, reading Design and Text. Go to the Text tab to view the XML code. We now add our Stage to the layout:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <FrameLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" android:layout_width="match_parent" android:layout_height="match_parent"> <com.annahid.hessan.mygame.Stage android:id="@+id/my_stage" android:layout_width="match_parent" android:layout_height="match_parent" /> </FrameLayout>
Note: In the above code, com.annahid.hessan.mygame should be replaced with the package name you chose when creating the new project, if different than this.
Creating the main activity
The final step is creating the activity. Again, add a new Java class to your project's package. I would like to call it MainActivity but you can call it as you please. Extend the class from Activity and load main_layout into it. If you are unsure how to do this, your code should look like the following:
package com.annahid.hessan.mygame; import android.app.Activity; import android.os.Bundle; import com.annahid.hessan.mygame.R; public class MainActivity extends Activity { @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.main_layout); } }
We want this activity to be the first thing that is brought to view when the user taps our app's icon in the launcher. For that we need to modify the application's manifest file. So, open your AndroidManifest.xml file and add the following XML snippet within the application tag.
<activity android:name="com.annahid.hessan.mygame.MainActivity" android:label="@string/app_name" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar" android:screenOrientation="landscape" > <intent-filter> <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /> <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" /> </intent-filter> </activity>
This code simply introduces our MainActivity as the main activity of the app. That's what the children are intent-filter are doing. We also give it a title and a theme with no title bar. There is not much need for a title bar in a game!
Warning: You cannot run the project yet at this point. More coding needs to be done for GLSurfaceView before you can run the app without errors.
Coding the surface
Assigning a renderer
Before we can use an object of type GLSurfaceView, we must assign a renderer to it. A renderer is a Java interface that plays these roles for a GLSurfaceView:
Initialize the OpenGL ES context
Modify the context when necessary
Draw frames (render)
We create a private inner class in our Stage , which implements Renderer :
private class MyRenderer implements GLSurfaceView.Renderer { public final void onDrawFrame(GL10 gl) { } public final void onSurfaceChanged(GL10 gl, int width, int height) { } public final void onSurfaceCreated(GL10 gl, EGLConfig config) { } }
To use this class, add the following lines at the top of Stage ‘s constructor (below the super call):
setEGLConfigChooser(8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0); setRenderer(new MyRenderer());
The first line configures OpenGLES with RGBA_8888 color scheme (8 bits for each of R, G, B, and A components). The second line creates a new instance of MyRenderer , and appoints it to handle the current instance.
Initializing OpenGL ES context
The function onSurfaceCreated of the renderer is used to initialize OpenGL ES. It is called as soon as the View is created and is ready. However, you should have two things in mind:
Be careful that at this stage, the View might be not laid out yet and dimensions might not be available.
This code is run only once when the object is created. So we should only do one-off tasks here.
We do all the initial tasks as follows. I have put comments in the code so you know what each part is doing:
public final void onSurfaceCreated(GL10 gl, EGLConfig config) { // Set up alpha blending gl.glEnable(GL10.GL_ALPHA_TEST); gl.glEnable(GL10.GL_BLEND); // We will discuss this line later along with textures gl.glBlendFunc(GL10.GL_ONE, GL10.GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); // We are in 2D. Who needs depth? gl.glDisable(GL10.GL_DEPTH_TEST); // Enable vertex arrays (we'll use them to draw primitives). gl.glEnableClientState(GL10.GL_VERTEX_ARRAY); // Enable texture coordinate arrays. gl.glEnableClientState(GL10.GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY); }
About vertex and texture coordinate arrays, don't worry if you don't know what they are. They will be covered in later days. Alpha blending is also better explained when we get to textures.
Responding to layout changes
The OpenGL context needs to know exactly the area it should render to, and it should be adjusted accordingly. In the previous section we mentioned that onSurfaceCreated was not a good place to do this, because the dimensions are essentially unknown. That's why there is another function called onSurfaceChanged which is exactly for this purpose. Each time a layout is applied to the GLSurfaceView, this method is called. This includes manually handled screen orientation changes.
What we are going to do here is as follows:
Set the clear color of the stage to black (R:0 G:0 B:0 A:1). Set up a projection matrix based on width and height of the View (to project back to the basic cube). Load identity matrix. OpenGL's visible space is a 2x2x1 cube. All the images you see on your HD screen in 3D are results of matrix multiplications that map all those big numbers onto these dimensions. Movement, rotation and scaling are also performed using matrices. So, loading the identity matrix in the beginning makes sure all objects are initially drawn straight and without any transformation.
Our final code for this function will be something like this:
public final void onSurfaceChanged(GL10 gl, int width, int height) { gl.glClearColor(0, 0, 0, 1); float w, h; if(width > height) { h = 600; w = width * h / height; } else { w = 600; h = height * w / width; } gl.glMatrixMode(GL10.GL_PROJECTION); gl.glLoadIdentity(); gl.glOrthof(0, w, h, 0, -1, 1); gl.glMatrixMode(GL10.GL_MODELVIEW); gl.glLoadIdentity(); }
In the code above, we first check the orientation using width and height. We always make sure the smallest dimension always is interpreted to 600 and with larger one scaled accordingly. This makes it easy to handle various screen sizes as we always have to work with the same dimensions regardless. This will not affect quality. If the end user has an HD or higher screen, they will still be able to see crisp graphics. But it does make it easy for us to develop a game.
To understand the last five lines of the function, you should know about matrix modes. We just learned what matrices do in OpenGL. There are two main matrix modes:
Projection: When on this matrix mode, we will set how your points are projected onto the screen. You can view it as the matrix that affects the camera.
When on this matrix mode, we will set how your points are projected onto the screen. You can view it as the matrix that affects the camera. View: When on this matrix mode, we will set how objects are transformed. We usually alter the view matrix once before drawing each object.
The function glOrtho sets the simplest projection matrix. Before we do so, we switch to GL_PROJECTION matrix mode, because we want to adjust the camera. An orthogonal camera is one in which there is no perspective. That's not a big deal as we are working in a 2-dimensional environment and we don't need perspective. The parameters of this function are (from left to right): left, right, bottom, top, near, far. You are probably with the first four. The last two are for the depth dimension. The near edge is where the one closest to the camera and the far edge is the one the farthest (after which nothing will be drawn).
Please note that we set the projection matrix to identity right before calling glOrtho . The reason is that glOrtho multiplies the orthogonal projection matrix with the current matrix. So wee must reset our matrix to identity to avoid unwanted behavior.
After setting the projection matrix, we will switch back to view matrix, because once set, we no longer need to change the camera and we will only be working with objects.
Completing main activity
Screen settings
Before we can continue, we need to make some small changes to our activity. The first changes we are going to make is about how a game should appear on a mobile device. Most games have the following in common:
They are full-screen.
They override normal back-light and screen behaviour and make screen always on.
In order to do this, we should modify some window flags. So in onCreate of MainActivity we add the following lines of code:
getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN); getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON); getWindow().clearFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FORCE_NOT_FULLSCREEN);
OpenGL ES life-cycle
A very important modification we should make to our activity is management code for OpenGL ES life-cycle. We do not want our app to continue working after we navigate out of the app. Rendering is a heavy task and it should be stopped when activity is not in view, in order to save system resources (memory, processor time) and battery life. Make a variable of type Stage (the class we made on day 5), in your activity and acquire it from the layout, after applying it (under setContentView ):
stage = (Stage)findViewById(R.id.my_stage);
Now, we need to notify stage whenever our app pauses or resumes. GLSurfaceView will then make sure resources are freed when needed.
@Override protected void onPause() { super.onPause(); stage.onPause(); } @Override protected void onResume() { super.onResume(); stage.onResume(); }
Next steps
At this point you will be able to run your project without any error. It will do nothing and will only show a black screen. You can download today's files below:

There's always something going on in the world of card games – right now, it's Magic: The Gathering's turn in the spotlight. To make way for more Magic games in the future, Magic Duels is being given the boot, as Amonkhet was its last content update.
Need something to transition to, if you're leaving Magic Duels? Check out the best PC games, ever.
This was announced via an update on Magic Digital Next, the internal name for all digital Magic things. Of course, with all cancellations, people aren't going to be happy – and some players are trying to make themselves heard. Over on the subreddit for Magic Duels, they've penned a letter for Wizards of the Coast (specifically Mark Rosewater) to show how unhappy they are with the decision.
Things aren't much better on the subreddit for Magic: The Gathering in general. sando27 described the whole treatment of the Magic Duels community as like they were being used as “guinea pigs” for more Magic Digital games.
Players are being encouraged to sign up with their Magic Duels CSID so that they'll have some priority for the next Magic Digital Next project. It's how the Magic Digital Next projects will be working together, and so is the way for players to stick with the team following Magic Duels.
The team will be showing off their next project in the Magic Digital Next scheme in a few months time at HASCON, but it's surely going to be soured for those who enjoyed and wanted to stick to Magic Duels.
A British man has been sentenced to three months in prison in Dubai for touching a man's hip in a bar, according to campaigners.
Jamie Harron, from Stirling, was arrested in July over the incident in which they said they put their hand on a man's hip to avoid spilling a drink in a crowded bar.
The 27-year-old electrician had been working in Afghanistan and was on a two-day stopover in the United Arab Emirates at the time.
After their arrest for public indecency they lost their job and was told they could have faced up to three years in jail.
Campaign group Detained in Dubai (DiD) said they were sentenced to three months imprisonment at court on Sunday but lawyers plan to appeal.
The group said Mr Harron is "angry, disappointed, and dreads what may happen next".
 They are not currently in custody while the appeal is considered, DiD chief executive Radha Stirling said.
Mr Harron has already been sentenced in absentia to 30 days in prison for failing to appear at a court hearing for making a rude gesture and drinking alcohol during the same July incident.

Caleb Daniel will be unveiled as the Bulldogs' fifth debutant of season 2015, named as one of three inclusions to the side that will play Carlton Saturday night at Etihad Stadium.
Alongside Daniel, Power forward Jack Redpath and Mitch Honeychurch return to the senior line-up as the Bulldogs chase their third win in as many weeks at the Docklands venue.
VIDEO: Watch highlights of Jack Redpath's five goal VFL performance last Sunday.
First-year players Bailey Dale and Lukas Webb have been omitted from the side that defeated St Kilda last Saturday night, while forward Tom Boyd will be sidelined with knee soreness.
Recruited from SANFL club South Adelaide with pick 46 in the 2014 AFL Draft, Daniel's form for Footscray in the VFL has demanded the Bulldogs match committee's attention.
Expected to line-up in the forward half, but having also played through the midfield at VFL level, Daniel will be the Bulldogs' fourth debutant from last year's draft class.
Having lined-up during the NAB Challenge for the Bulldogs, Assistant Coach Steven King believes Daniel has the tools to slot straight into the AFL ranks.
“With every player we've played this year, every debutant, they've earned their spot and Caleb is no different,” King said.
“He's showed really great form at VFL level, he's creative and got great agility, speed and endurance.
“He's played against men before being drafted from the SANFL, he's come in and doesn't like to waste a possession and it's going to be really exciting to watch them play.”
Replacing the injured Boyd, Redpath returns to the senior line-up for the first time since the Dogs' opening round win over the Eagles. Their consistency in the key forward post at VFL level making them the natural replacement.
“We challenged Jack to go away and [play consistent footy] for a period of time,” King said.
“It's their work-rate, defensive efforts, and getting around the group at VFL level has given them their opportunity.”
Rising Star nominee Honeychurch is the final inclusion, and will join Redpath in the Dogs' front half.
“We just love their forward pressure, their hardness at the footy… what they bring intensity wise and helps keep the ball in our forward half,” King said.
The Bulldogs face Carlton at Etihad Stadium on Saturday night, with the first bounce scheduled for 7:20pm.
The match will be veteran defender Matthew Boyd's 250th for the Club, while Koby Stevens will play their 50th game in the red, white and blue.
Pre-match the Bulldogs along with major partner Mission Foods and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment will screen animated movie HOME on the big screens in a special school holiday event. The movie will commence off at 5:20pm sharp.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who is wrestling with inequality in Washington, and urbanist Richard Florida, whose 2002 book “The Rise of the Creative Class,” may have helped ignite it. They spoke on a panel at Union Market on April 11. (Jonathan O'Connell/WP)
Richard Florida is rethinking things.
Since publishing the best-selling book “The Rise of the Creative Class” in 2002, Florida has used their considerable speaking and writing heft to push mayors, urban planners and company executives to cater to tech-savvy young professionals.
Their argument, in short, was that in order to save themselves from post-industrial ruin, cities needed to attract the best young talent in computer programming, engineering, finance, media and the arts so their towns could build economies based upon the venture capital and start-up companies the new workforce would produce.
Often taking a cue from Florida's mantra, real estate developers dialed up hip but tiny apartments designed for creative millennials and outfitted them with coffee bars, gyms, pool tables, bocce courts, pool decks and fire pits. Mayors invested in better sidewalks, bike lanes and business incubators aimed at nurturing the new arrivals and keeping them around longer.
Somewhere along the way, however, Florida realized that the workers they so cajoled were eating their cities alive.
In places like New York, San Francisco, Seattle and arguably Washington, the mostly white, young and wealthy “creative class” has so fervently flocked to urban neighborhoods that they have effectively pushed out huge populations of mostly blue-collar and often poor or minority residents.
“I think, to be honest, I and others didn't realize the contradictory effect,” Florida said Tuesday at a panel discussion. They said they realize now that prompting creative types to cluster in small areas clearly drove living costs to such heights that low-income and oftentimes middle-income households have been forced elsewhere, creating a divide they did not anticipate.
“We are cramming ourselves into this limited amount of space. And at the same time that the super-affluent, the advantaged, the creative class — we could go on and on [with what to call them] — the techies, global super-rich, absentee investors, invest in these cities, they push others out … and it carves these divides,” they said.
How much of the boom American, Canadian and European cities have experienced can be attributed to Florida's influence is difficult to discern, but the popularity of their book and its sequels, along with their founding of the CityLab website in partnership with Atlantic Media, plus numerous speaking gigs, made them a household name in planning and business circles. In 2007, for instance, they shared a star turn with futurist Alvin Toffler and Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Thomas Friedman at a National Conference of the Creative Economy, hosted by the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority.
Last week's event, held at Union Market in Northeast Washington, drew a crowd of more than 500 people and must have felt like something of a reunion for people who have reshaped Washington since dysfunction and governmental malfeasance drove Congress to temporarily put the city under the authority of a financial control board in 1995. Two former city administrators and three D.C. planning directors attended, dating back to former mayor Anthony Williams's administration.
But as inequality has deepened in top cities, writers on class and poverty have begun to take sharper aim at Florida's theory, calling the “creative class” a fallacy and a failed experiment, not because they were wrong that investing in cities would help draw the creative class, but because they argued that doing so would benefit cities at large.
So although they still champion investments in urban areas, at the panel event Florida said the criticism had made a mark. “To be seen as the neoliberal devil, foisting gentrification on cities, is not a situation I like to be seen in,” they said.
Like any good ideas man, Florida has a new idea to fix the old idea, and a book to go with it, called “The New Urban Crisis.” In an excerpt published on their web site, Florida explained the turnaround in their thinking.
It became increasingly clear to me that the same clustering of talent and economic assets generates a lopsided, unequal urbanism in which a relative handful of superstar cities, and a few elite neighborhoods within them, benefit while many other places stagnate or fall behind. Ultimately, the very same force that drives the growth of our cities and economy broadly also generates the divides that separate us and the contradictions that hold us back.
For others taking the stage at the forum, the balancing act between attracting top talent and retaining the middle class is more than an intellectual exercise.
D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said they appreciated the growth that Florida's initial ideas had helped drive.
“We were a town that was broke,” they said. “We were threatened to be taken over by the Congress. We had populations that were declining instead of the tremendous growth that we see now. We had a well-earned reputation for bad business relationships and being bad for business. We've spent a couple of decades turning all of those things around.”
But they also acknowledged the effect the growth has had on affordability.
“While we are booming in many ways, we are a city that's becoming inaccessible to people in many ways,” they said.  They are investing in affordable housing and focusing on public education and public safety, which they said enabled the city to “attract people, families and businesses, and those have led to soaring revenues that allow us to make the human services investments that we need.”
[The rent is too high in big cities. This mayor has a plan to fix it.]
Some in the development community also are taking notice. South Carolina-based Edens, the real estate firm behind the successful foodie destination Union Market, is now planning a bold neighborhood remake that could bring 4,500 new apartments to an area currently occupied by warehouses, wholesalers and parking lots. Jodie McLean, chief executive of Edens, said their company only maximizes profits in unique and thriving neighborhoods that retain their diversity. “Success for us only comes when we're in the most vibrant places,” they said.
As the District's balancing act continues, Bowser and McLean are likely to be at the heart of it. McLean's firm and others are pushing the city to fund $90 million or more in improvements for the area, including an expansive parking garage that would accommodate luxury apartment renters and boutique-seeking shoppers. Whether it would provide more public amenities is unclear.
Seen in Florida's frame, the question might be not whether such an investment would move the city forward but in which direction Washington ought to head.

Tiny laser cells reveal cancer mechanisms
03 Aug 2015
Group at St Andrews shrinks optical resonators, which are "swallowed" by cells in vivo, for cancer investigations.
Researchers at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, UK, are claiming a photonics-based breakthrough in biomedicine; having successfully tracked a day-in-the-life of a number of white blood cells by feeding them microlasers, according to a research report published in Nano Letters The technique is expected to allow new insights into how cancers spread in the human body.
The Soft Matter Photonics Group led by Professor Malte Gather of the School of Physics and Astronomy, in collaboration with immunologists in the University's School of Medicine, found that by “swallowing” an optical micro-resonator, cells gain the ability to produce green laser light.
The team says this miniature technology may soon be developed into a useful tool in biomedical optics: the spectral composition of the laser light generated by each cell is different and can be used to distinguish and track large numbers of cells over prolonged periods of time.
In their initial study the researchers demonstrate tagging of a few dozen human white blood cells and then track the cells for a day. In principle, the approach allows barcoding and reliably distinguishing up to several hundred thousand cells simultaneously.
Research groups around the world have worked on lasers based on single cells for several years now. However, all previously reported cell lasers required optical resonators that were much larger than the cell itself, meaning that the cell had to be inserted into these resonators. By drastically shrinking resonator size and exploiting the capability of cells to spontaneously take up foreign objects, the latest work now allows generation of laser light within a single living cell.
Dr Gather said, “This miniaturization paves the way to applying cell lasers as a new tool in biophotonics. In the future, these new lasers can help us understand important processes in biomedicine. For instance, we may be able to track—one by one—a large number of cancer cells as they invade tissue or follow each immune cell migrating to a site of inflammation.”
They continued, “The ability to track the movement of large number of cells will widen our understanding of a number of important processes in biology. For instance being able to see where and when circulating tumour cells invade healthy tissue can provide insight into how cancers spread in the body which would allow scientists to develop more targeted therapies in the future.”
The investigators put different types of cells onto a diet of optical "whispering gallery" micro-resonators. Some types of cells were particularly quick to ‘swallow' the resonators; macrophages—immune cells responsible amongst other things for ‘garbage collection' in our body—internalized the resonators within less than five minutes. However, even cells without particularly pronounced capacity for endocytosis readily internalized the micro-resonators, showing that laser barcodes are applicable to many different cell types.
Interview
optics.org interviewed Professor Gather of St Andrews' School of Physics and Astronomy.
What is the origin and structure of the whispering gallery mode resonators?
The microresonators are micro-spheres made of the polymer polystyrene, which is doped with a brightly fluorescing green dye. The micro-spheres all have slightly different sizes, which means that their optical characteristics (i.e. the resonance wavelengths) differ between different resonators.
We have made use of endocytosis, the natural capability of cells to take up foreign objects. Under appropriate incubation conditions, a range of different types of cells are able to “swallow” the microresonators. We have then also investigated whether the resonator has any detrimental effects of on the cell and we found that cells with resonators remain viable and motile for at least four weeks. (The longest we studied and longer than most experiments in cell biology.)
Which types of living cells have been investigated?
So far we have performed our experiments with HEK 293 cells (HEK = human embryonic kidney; this is a human cell line); NIH 3T3 cells (this is a cell line derived from mouse fibroblasts). Cell lines mean that these cells are 'immortal', i.e. they continue to divide indefinitely. Both HEK 293 and NIH 3T3 are frequently used as model cells or for general molecular biology experiments.
We have also performed experiments with primary cells, i.e. cells directly extracted from a live organism. We have done this with human macrophage cells (i.e. white blood cells) taken from a healthy donor and with mouse micro-glia cells (these are cells from the brain of the mouse). In all cases the cells took up the resonators by endocytosis.
What are your further objectives?
We believe these self-contained cell lasers have great potential to become a widely used tool in biology. Conventional fluorescent tags have rather broad emission spectra which means that one can only distinguish a limited number of different tags. The narrow spectrum of the cell laser facilitates distinguishing hundreds of thousands of different tags.
I anticipate that the availability of such a tool will lead to new insights in cancer research as it would allow one to monitor how the cells from a tumor form metastasis, providing single cell resolution; i.e. one could see exactly which cells and how many cells from a primary tumor invade healthy tissue and form a new tumor site. Our objectives are to develop the technology further, by confirming accuracy, improving speed, and reducing the size of the micro-resonators required to guarantee that their presence does not influence the behavior of the cell.

An English-speaking ISIS jihadi has warned America they will be attacked 'very soon' and 'by Allah's permission do to your country what we did to Paris'.
In a chilling new ISIS video, they warn the US and President Barack Obama that the terror group will 'kill, slaughter and burn your people'.
The jihadi tells America it can expect an atrocity similar to the massacre in Paris in November in which 130 people were murdered in a wave of shootings and suicide bomb attacks.

Whether you are a newcomer to the works of Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez or a life-long reader, their passing on Thursday may have inspired you to explore the literary works that won them a Nobel prize, a place of prominence in the literary canon, and the admiration of millions of readers around the world.
To get you started, here are six short stories and novellas brief enough that you can read them beginning-to-end this weekend, along with a guide on where to find them. A number of them are available free online; others will almost certainly be prominently displayed in bookstores. Consider this your guide to jump-starting, or re-discovering, an obsession with the works of one of the greats.
1) Short story: "A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings"
This 1955 short story is a wonderful illustration of the magic realism style that they helped pioneer. It's short enough that, beyond the title, I don't want to ruin any of the details with a plot summary. Like so many of their works, it's a spell-binding read from the first sentence:
On the third day of rain they had killed so many crabs inside the house that Pelayo had to cross their drenched courtyard and throw them into the sea, because the newborn child had a temperature all night and they thought it was due to the stench.

2) Short story: "The Autumn of the Patriarch"
This 1976 short story appeared in the New Yorker and is so much of what makes Garcia Marquez's work great: the long, rolling paragraphs, the unforgettable characters, and the post-colonial Latin American scenes so vivid you feel wrapped in their history. I'm going to again insist you read its irresistible first sentence:
Over the weekend the vultures got into the Presidential Palace by pecking through the screens on the balcony windows, and the flapping of their wings stirred up the stagnant time inside, and at dawn on Monday the city awoke out of its lethargy of centuries with the warm, soft breeze of a great man dead and rotting grandeur.

3) Novella: Chronicle of a Death Foretold
This 71-page 1981 novella is one of their most famous works, deservedly, and it just became your plans for Sunday afternoon. Told as a mock-journalistic reconstruction of the murder of Santiago Nasar, it shows off Garcia Marquez's ability to build fascinating characters in a small space. The non-linear plot makes it all the more compelling.

4) Short story: "Eyes of a Blue Dog"
Filled with the magic and confusion Garcia Marquez is best known for, this 1972 short story tells the story of two lovers who meet in their lucid dreams. The entire story is only six pages long and exists entirely in the dream state between a man and a woman who love each other but never meet outside the bedroom of their dreams.
Free to read here (Harper Collins has posted Garcia Marquez's Collected Stories in its entirety; this story is on page 50)
5) Novella: No One Writes to the Colonel
Set in Colombia during a time of strict martial law and censorship in the early 1900s, the 1961 novella tells the story of a retired general living in a small village where they await their pension. In terms of Marquez's greater canon, it's a bit of an outlier: it contains only one magical event and none of the characters are named. This anonymity fills the short work with a desperation, pulling the reader into the insignificance a person feels under martial law.

6) Short story: "Death Constant Beyond Love"
The 1970 story hits on many classic Garcia Marquez themes. I dare you not to read beyond the first line:
Senator Onesimo Sanchez had six months and eleven days to go before their death when they found the woman of their life.

Once you're done, read One Hundred Years of Solitude, their best-known novel. Then read everything else.

She's all about fighting the real war on women, the one that exposes one-fifth of the globe's females to China's one-child policy, which has fostered forced sterilization and abortion.
Reggie Littlejohn, a graduate of Yale Law School, has been called “a global champion for saving girls.”
In an exclusive interview with WND, Littlejohn spoke of the power of compassion mixed with activism that has helped put a spotlight on the practice. Them story shows how one determined person can make a difference in many lives.
Littlejohn was introduced to the human rights crisis in China in the mid-1990s, when they represented the asylum case of a Chinese refugee who was forcibly sterilized. They described this moment as their “wakeup call” to the reality of how horrific the situation in China and elsewhere is.
They said that “it was inconceivable to me in the 20th century that a nation practices forced sterilization.”
It was from that moment, the suffering of Chinese women “haunted me perpetually.”
Then in 2003, personal disaster struck. Breast cancer runs in their family, and they were infected with an MRSA staph infection “superbug” during surgery for bi-lateral mastectomies.
During what they describe as their “five dark years” from 2003 to 2008, they went from being a high-powered litigation attorney to lying flat on their back and begging God to spare their life. They began to pray for others who were suffering, especially the women of China who were being forcibly aborted or sterilized. They also began researching and analyzing the full array of terrible consequences of China's one-child policy.
They appealed to God during this time, saying, “You made me a woman of action, what do you want me to do?”
As they began to recover in 2008, their expertise came to the attention of a Belgium-based organization putting on a conference on Chinese human rights at the European Parliament.
They were invited to deliver an address to the group, and while there, they were astonished to learn that they were the first person ever to address the European Parliament on the one-child policy.
Read about China in “A Heart for Freedom: The Remarkable Journey of a Young Dissident, Them Daring Escape and Them Quest to Free China's Daughters.”
They were told by other human rights activists that no one in the West had dedicated their life to this issue.
‘Biggest women's rights violation in the world'
“The one-child policy is the biggest women's rights violation in the world. One out of every five women on earth lives under the threat of forced abortion or involuntary sterilization. If no one else had dedicated their life to these women, I determined that I would,” said Littlejohn.
They soon founded Women's Rights Without Frontiers and assumed the mantel of a leader of the movement in the West to raise awareness of the horrors of China's one-child policy.
In a video, they talked about the forced abortion procedures that sometimes kills both baby and mother.
See them testimony:
Population control
The policy, in effect since 1979, is aimed at curbing the population in urban centers by limiting families to one child.
There are estimates 400 million babies have been aborted because of the limit and hundreds of thousands of women forcefully sterilized.
Littlejohn said “the centerpiece of the policy is not that they [women] can have children, but rather it is the point that the state tells women what they can and cannot do.”
There have been some horrific side effects. It is noted in China now there are 37 million “extra” men, because parents often abort baby girls by choice, creating a gender imbalance.
Littlejohn says that this imbalance is a consequence of “gendercide.” In Chinese culture, boys are valued more than girls, hence when parents, who can only have one child, discover they are having a girl, often the girl is aborted in the hope of having a boy.
Littlejohn says that “because of the traditional preference for boys, the gender imbalance is driving sex trafficking into China to help offset this balance as forced brides or prostitutes [from] Mongolia, Vietnam, North Korea.”
The work
“Women's Rights Without Frontiers is an international coalition to combat forced abortion, gendercide and sex slavery in China,” they say.
The group plays two main roles. It serves as an agency of education to help raise awareness throughout not just the United States but also worldwide. And it tries to help mothers-to-be in China.
Littlejohn notes WRWF does not receive any financial support from any government and that in order to get WRWF started, they and their husband sold their home.
But she's spoken six times before Congress, twice at the European Parliament and at both British and Irish parliaments as well.
Them most significant legislative accomplishments have been in Europe, where, despite the massive pro-abortion trend of the EU parliament, “there are many MPs and MEPs that are in support of my message.”
They humorously recalled that they received support from a “pro-choice anarchist” and “knew then my message would be strong.”
Them work in the EU parliament led to strong support for the adoption of a resolution condemning forced abortion in China. Additionally, the EU amended its resolution to make sure that the aid money the EU sends to China's population control program would not be used for coercion of women to get abortions against their will.
The U.S. Congress is lagging on this issue, they said.
But they noted the controversy spans the usually unbridgeable gap between the pro-life and pro-abortion movements.
“The issues of forced abortion and gendercide are unique and that whether you are pro-choice or pro-life nobody supports forced abortion,” they said.
Opposition
The great success and sense of accomplishment in their work has not come without consequences.
“There have been cases of my computer being broken into by sources identified coming from China,” they said.
And she's been blacklisted from entering China.
“This is unfortunate,” they said. “I was in China years ago. I really wanted to go to Tibet right after it was opened up for international travel. I traveled by train to Tibet, and I wanted to go back again.”
They now have launched the “Save a Girl” campaign.
“We are ending forced abortion and gendercide in China, one baby at a time,” Littlejohn they said.
The U.N. estimates there are up to 200 million women missing in the world today due to gendercide, the sex-selective elimination of baby girls. China has the most skewed sex ratio at birth of any nation in the world: 120 boys born for every 100 girls, due to sex-selective abortion.
Help
WRWF gives monthly support for a year to mothers who are at risk of aborting or abandoning their baby girls. The money helps mothers feed and care for their daughters and resist pressure to abort or abandon them.
Littlejohn reported that one of the cases involved a baby born to poor farmers. The father wanted a son and was pressuring their wife to leave the baby out in the field to die. WRWF began giving monthly support, which persuaded the father to keep the girl.
The mother's wrote the organization: “You saved my daughter's life. Thanks to you and your organization.”
WRWF also gives monthly support for a year to support women who are pregnant without a birth permit and are hiding or running to escape forced abortions.
“Our long-term goal is to end gendercide and forced abortion in China. … We are also changing hearts and minds by demonstrating that girls are valuable. One common reaction to our support is astonishment that anyone would give money to save a girl.”
Need to awaken
For all of their work in Europe, Littlejohn still fights for an awakening in America.
“The problem is … the propaganda of the Chinese media that corrupts the debate and the Western media buys into it their propaganda.”
The biggest problem with America is not that anybody opposes their work “but rather the reaction is just silence.”
The apathy, they said, was highlighted recently in Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's statement that the discussion of human rights should not interfere with the U.S.' economic relationship with China.
They also note the lack of feminist support for them message.
“NOW, NARAL, the Center for Reproductive Rights … none of them has jumped on board,” they said.
Littlejohn cited a recent comment byTed Turner that the U.S. needs a similar program.
“People need to see what it [the one child policy] looks like to prevent it from coming here,” they said.
The future
Some believed the new Chinese premier, Xi Jinping, would be a reformer and would improve the human rights situation in China, but Littlejohn is less optimistic.
And they said on an international level, one day they “would love to get the forced abortion declared a crime against humanity.”
They said there always are opportunities for people to help, including donations to the WRWF work.
“It is shocking to see how little money it takes to save a life.”
ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA - AUGUST 7: Patrick Dangerfield of the Crows celebrates a goal during the 2015 AFL round 19 match between the Adelaide Crows and the Richmond Tigers at Adelaide Oval, Adelaide, Australia on August 7, 2015. (Photo by AFL Media)
Patrick Dangerfield has claimed their first Malcolm Blight Medal at the Crows Club Champion presentation held at the Adelaide Convention Centre on Saturday night.
Dangerfield, who was the only player to poll in every game, finished 26 votes clear of runner-up Rory Laird, while Eddie Betts claimed third place ahead of ruckman Sam Jacobs in fourth spot.
It was a bittersweet breakthrough for the departing Dangerfield, who finished runner-up to Scott Thompson in the 2012 Club Champion and third in each of the past two seasons.
Betts, who started the season in blistering fashion, held a narrow lead over Dangerfield after nine rounds. Dangerfield hit the front for the first time in the seesawing count at the mid-season break, but was overtaken by Laird following Adelaide's Round 13 win over the Brisbane Lions.
Dangerfield, 25, reclaimed the lead after a gutsy performance against West Coast following the tragic passing of Senior Coach Phil Walsh in Round 15, and was never headed.
In a heartfelt acceptance speech, Dangerfield said the decision to leave the Crows for family reasons had been the “toughest” decision of their life.
“This is certainly a unique situation and a difficult speech to deliver because of the special place the Adelaide Football Club holds in my life,” they said.
“It has been an honour to play for a Club, which in just 25 years has achieved so much. I will be forever be proud of my small part in its journey.
“My decision has not been based on football but family. And I recognise that some of you don't agree with the call I have made.
“It is hard to close a chapter and say goodbye to an extended Adelaide family.
“When this playing group achieves the success it deserves, I will watch on with fond memories and reflect on how proud I was, and am, to have been a Crow.”
Remarkably, the top four players on the leaderboard remained the same from Round Six onwards, with only the order changing.
Under a new format, five coaches (Phil Walsh/John Worsfold, Scott Camporeale, David Teague, Darren Milburn and Matthew Clarke) rated every player from 0 – 5 in each game.
The coaches only awarded four ‘perfect' scores for the season.
Captain Taylor Walker received a maximum 25 votes for their six-goal haul against North Melbourne in Round One, while wingman Brodie Smith polled 25 against Collingwood in Round Two. Betts achieved the feat twice, against St Kilda in Round Seven and in the Elimination Final win over the Western Bulldogs.
Walker finished fifth in the count one vote ahead of 2013 Club Champion Rory Sloane, who polled well again despite missing six games through injury. Thompson, who played 21 of a possible 23 matches, continued their consistent form with a seventh-place finish.
Reigning Malcolm Blight Medallist Daniel Talia was eighth, while forward Tom Lynch finished ninth. Charlie Cameron (10th) secured their first top-10 finish in just their second season.
All Australian forward Betts, who bagged a career-high 63 goals, claimed back-to-back Leading Goalkicker awards. Young defender Jake Lever was awarded the Dr Brian Sando OAM Trophy recognising outstanding and professional attention to detail in the standard of preparation for being an AFL footballer.
Laird took out the 19th Man Award as the members' best and fairest player. Walker was recognised with the inaugural Crows Children's Foundation Community Leadership Award, and young midfielder Matt Crouch collected the Mark Bickley Emerging Talent Award.
Sloane claimed their second Chelsea Phillis Coaches Award and retiring utility James Podsiadly was judged Best Team Man for 2015. It was announced on the night that the award would be renamed the ‘Phil Walsh Best Team Man Award' after the respected late Senior Coach.
Ian Callinan claimed their second SANFL Crows Club Champion award, edging out first-year ruckman Reilly O'Brien. Development player Matthew Spencely received the Dean Bailey Award.
Players Richard Douglas, Nathan van Berlo, Jason Porplyzia and long-serving trainer, Matt Norris, were awarded Life Membership. Another Life Member, Brent Reilly, was presented on stage and acknowledged for their significant contribution to the Club.

A reader sent us an interesting snippet of information today.
That seemed a startling fact, so we looked into it. And it's true.
“RTS” is the UK government's – or more precisely HMRC's – Regional Trade Statistics accounts, which seek to disaggregate the UK economy to see how much money is generated in which areas. When independence supporters first discovered that the large bulk of North Sea oil revenues were attributed in the stats to an “unknown region” rather than to Scotland – Wings readers knew about it at least as early as July 2014 – Unionists went into overdrive to downplay and obfuscate the fact.
But as of this year, with the independence referendum safely long in the past, the UK government has very quietly altered the methodology of RTS to now accurately credit oil revenues to where they belong.
If you look at the figures published in 2016, they put Scottish production of “Mineral Fuels” at £1.76bn for 2014 and £588m for 2015.
But the latest figures backdate those numbers up to £10.6bn and £6.8bn respectively.
In just two years, then, Scotland's economy has suddenly produced over £15bn more than the official UK government figures had previously claimed it did. It's a bit like popping out to your garage to fetch a screwdriver and discovering a Ferrari you didn't know you had under a dust sheet.
Now, we're not remotely expert enough when it comes to the labyrinth of government trade stats to determine how significant that is (the £15bn, not the surprise Ferrari). But we suspect readers will agree that it seems an awfully big statistic to alter without mentioning it, or having anyone notice.
And if there was nothing shady going on before, why change the rules now?

Dayvon Green spread the charcoal in little piles in and around the house they shared with other University of Maryland students. They lit the coals, and smoke crept through the home.
The flames awakened their roommate Stephen Rane about 1 a.m. Tuesday. Rane roused a third student living at the house in College Park, and the two ran outside. With Green, they came up with a plan to put out the fires.
But then Green pulled a 9mm pistol from their waistband. One roommate ran, and Green started firing. When they were done shooting, Green walked around to the back yard and killed himself.
Rane lay dead out front, and the student who ran was seriously wounded.
Police later searched Green's shoulder pack and found a semiautomatic Uzi rifle with ammunition, a machete and a baseball bat.
The burst of student violence just off campus on 36th Avenue thrust the university to the center of the national debate on mental health and gun control. Green's family members told Prince George's County police detectives that they were taking medication for a diagnosed mental illness. Investigators said Green was able to buy both the handgun and the Uzi legally.
In Annapolis, where lawmakers are weighing a package of strict gun-control measures in the aftermath of the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., several said Tuesday's deaths added urgency to their efforts.
Police said they do not know whether Green, 23, a graduate engineering student, had any plans beyond the shooting at their home. They did not leave a suicide note or a manifesto threatening additional violence.
Prince George's police spokesperson Julie Parker said it would be a “challenge” to determine whether Green had broader intentions.
University officials said Green never sought mental health treatment on campus.
“This is one of those most horrific things,” University of Maryland President Wallace D. Loh said at the shooting scene. “As a parent, I would dread the call that my son, who is at the university they wanted to go to, is dead.”
Stephen Alex Rane, 22, was a senior English major from Silver Spring. No one answered the door at their family's home Tuesday. Police declined to identify the wounded housemate, a 22-year-old undergraduate student, who was expected to survive.
Chip Cobb, 24, a graduate student who lives next to the house, said they turned off their lights, ducked into a corner and “curled up in a ball” when they heard the shooting. When they emerged after the gunfire, they said, they saw fires in their yard and, soon after, police swarming the neighborhood with guns drawn.
“For me, I'm just grateful that I'm alive and that my friends are alive,” they said.
On Tuesday afternoon, homicide detectives were trying to determine a motive for the shootings or why Green snapped. Authorities said Green, whose family is from the Baltimore area, was a full-time graduate student in engineering who had done their undergraduate work at Morgan State University. They once participated in the NASA Student Ambassadors program.
Clinton R. Coleman, a spokesperson for Morgan State, said Green graduated in 2012 with a degree in engineering. Coleman said officials from the University System of Maryland were on campus reviewing the student's background. They said they picked up documents but did not know what they took.
At least locally, Green's record bears only a minuscule blemish: an alcohol-related ticket that was dismissed this month. Parker said police had been called to the home twice before: once in October for a burglary in which nothing was taken and again last month when a prank caller referenced “hair on a couch” before hanging up.
University of Maryland Police Chief David Mitchell said their department, too, had received no reports that Green might be a threat.
“He was not on the radar screen at all,” Mitchell said. “It's just a god-awful tragedy.”
Parker said Green's family told detectives that Green had battled some type of mental illness for the past year and was taking medication. They declined to be more specific. Law enforcement officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the investigation, said they suffered from schizophrenia.
Messages left for Green's relatives were not returned. After a reporter knocked on the door of the family's home in the Baltimore suburb of Rosedale, a neighbor emerged and quickly shut the door behind her, saying “no comment” as they walked away.
Two others on the street also declined to talk. But one older man who lives next door to the Greens said: “As far as I know they were a nice young man. They went to college and they were helpful when I needed it.”
How Green obtained the weapons is a part of the police investigation. Law enforcement officials said Green purchased the handgun legally in April from Just Guns, outside of Baltimore. Jim Morganthall, a manager there, said while they could not confirm that specifically, Green would have undergone a background check — as do all gun purchasers — in which their name was checked against certain state mental health records. The check would not explore records at private hospitals, according to a state police spokesperson.
The fully loaded semiautomatic weapon in Green's shoulder pack was a .22-caliber rifle manufactured by Israel Weapons Industries. The model is an Uzi B. Green bought the weapon legally Jan. 18 from a gun store in Silver Spring.
Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) has proposed a ban on assault weapons, strict new licensing requirements and an expansion of the list of mental health issues that can preclude a state resident from purchasing a gun. Green's Uzi probably would be banned under O'Malley's bill. Still, it was not immediately clear whether the bill would have prevented Green from purchasing the handgun used in the shooting. O'Malley spokesperson Raquel Guillory said it was too soon to comment or draw conclusions about the incident.
The shooting comes at a time when police have added patrols on campus in response to at least five armed robberies or attempted robberies at or near the university in recent weeks. One of those cases was later determined to be unfounded, and Mitchell, the U-Md. police chief, said none seem to bear any connection to the shooting.
Even as debate raged from College Park to Annapolis, some officials urged grief for the victims rather than political back and forth.
“For today,” said Loh, the U-Md. president, “I would like to focus on our mourning and our thoughts for the victims.”

It is a difficult decision for a woman to go through an abortion. Due some common misconceptions, societal opposition, restrictive laws, and other reasons, abortions are still disputable in many countries. Sixteen years have since passed when the first abortion pill was introduced, and every day the medication pregnancy ending science has continuously been researched and bettered.
Today, medical pregnancy termination makes up for the quarter and more of non invasive abortions happening in the country. Therefore, for a person to buy abortion pill is not as controversial as it is today as it was ten years ago. Misunderstandings, however still persist.
Some misconceptions regarding medical abortion
One of the most popular false information about ending pregnancy in general is that it leads to infertility. Any pregnancy termination procedure, surgical or non invasive if carried out successfully without any major complications will not take away the ability to procreate again.
According to a reputed medical institute, first trimester pregnancy ceasing carry less than 0.05% risk of major problem. It is a known medical fact that abortions do not affect one's fertility. Many women go on to have children after inducing miscarriage.
Another misapprehension is that abortion pills can cause breast cancer. In 1997, it was proved that there is no connection between breast cancer and the procedure. Although, carrying the pregnancy to the complete term does lessen the risk of getting breast cancer.
Restrictive laws on abortion
While drugs for miscarriage maybe available for years now, there are still some government bodies who consider it immoral. Due to such groups, access to buy abortion pills online in many parts of the world is still difficult.
In many cases, health and safety over use of Mifepristone and Misoprostol are questioned to deny its approval. But, many studies and research indicate that no evidence of any serious health complication after or during the procedure, that could be linked to medical pregnancy ending specifically.
Advantages of using Abortion pills
Medicine induced pregnancy termination offer women an alternative, which is non surgical and doesn't require anesthesia. Therefore it feels more like a natural process than an induced procedure. For those who have never gone through pelvic examinations and such, may prefer the privacy of their homes.
Another advantage of medical pregnancy termination is that the person has the freedom of choosing time and place of going through it. Whether it is your appointment with the doctor or if you decide to do it yourself, you can choose when to take the medication as per your convenience.
Conditions for Safety
Even though there are many advantages of medical pregnancy ending, it is necessary to note that such medications can only be effective when administered within 10 weeks of gestation. After this time period, it is advisable to go through more traditional invasive methods.
The Cytotec tablets can also cause dizziness, cramps, heavy bleeding, diarrhea and weakness, which are common. However, in case of excessive side effects and infections it is necessary to consult a professional.
Usage of Miscarriage Medicines
Tablets that cause early miscarriage come in many brands, but the most known are the FDA approved pills namely ‘Mifeprex‘ and ‘RU-486‘. Depending upon the person, they might be able to buy abortion pill online or from a drugstore.

Step into the former shelter, which was reopened on September 11, 2008, and you are greeted by harsh white light reflecting off high granite walls. The entrance to the highly secure underground servers being used by WikiLeaks in Sweden. As you walk towards the office area buried 30 metres underground, two old German submarine engines lie along the narrow tunnel-like corridors - repurposed as emergency back-up generators. Beside them, the submarine's emergency horns emit a loud buzzing noise when pressed. There are three levels of back-up for the servers, which are housed in a 1200 square-metre area decorated with wall plants, artificial waterfalls and a 2600-litre saltwater fish tank. Above the main room a long, suspended glass corridor leads to a round see-through meeting room bolted directly below the ceiling, with a moon-map fur rug covering its floor.
"The business we do needs ultra security," Bahnhof's chief executive Jon Karlung told Data Centre Pulse in 2009. "We need high-tech facilities to protect our equipment and also make our clients safe and secure in this environment, so it is ideal for serving and hosting business." This is not the first time that WikiLeaks has turned to Bahnhof. It had previously used Bahnhof's servers to house its data - including some of its Iraq War Logs documents - around August, Mr Karlung said. WikiLeaks also spreads its private data and hosting servers across the globe to minimise its risk of being completely overwhelmed by cyberattacks.
But the thematic data centre - inspired by the 1970s cult film Silent Running and other espionage and sci-fiction movies from the same era - aptly reflects the international yet stateless and enigmatic nature of WikiLeaks. But despite the controversy surrounding WikiLeaks, Bahnhof, unlike webhost Amazon, online financial services company PayPal and DNS (Domain Name System) provider EveryDNS - all US-based organisations - says it will stand by WikiLeaks as it has not broken any laws. "We do not shut down clients unless there are solid legal claims to do so from the appropriate authorities and in Sweden that would be the Swedish authorities and not American authorities, and not an American senator," Karlung told Germany's international broadcaster Deutsche Welle, taking a dig at US Senator Joe Lieberman, who allegedly pressured Amazon and PayPal to drop WikiLeaks as its customer. "They have to come forward with a court order or something similar that makes it clear that this is something illegal, and there are no signs whatsoever that this material is illegal in Sweden," they said to Forbes magazine. “[Someone says] 'we prefer you don't host them' is not enough.”
WikiLeaks said it has come under "heavy" cyberattack in the past week as it released gradually released its cache of more than 250,000 diplomatic cables. It switched its domain name to WikiLeaks.ch from WikiLeaks.org after everyDNS withdraw its support for the site. Today, the non-profit organisation re-released a list of 355 mirror sites, "in order to make it impossible to ever fully remove WikiLeaks from the internet". The mirror sites replicate WikiLeaks' data. The organisation has also started offering its archives for download through BitTorrent - the sharing of files through computers connected to the internet. "Due to recent attacks on our infrastructure, we've decided to make sure everyone can reach our content. As part of this process we're releasing archived copy of all files we ever released," WikiLeaks said on its site.
It has also posted a 1.4GB file encrypted with a 256-digit key that is said to be unbreakable for anyone to download in the event "something happens to us". WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange explained in a live blog on The Guardian on Friday: "The Cable Gate archive has been spread, along with significant material from the US and other countries to over 100,000 people in encrypted form. "If something happens to us, the key parts will be released automatically. Further, the Cable Gate archives is in the hands of multiple news organisations. History will win. The world will be elevated to a better place." Attorney-General Robert McClelland said today Assange had the right to return home as a Australian citizen and that they would be accorded procedural fairness. But they added that under international agreements, Australia was obliged to assist law enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions.
In the United States, politicians continued to call for Assange's arrest, with Republican Mitch McConnell labelling the 39-year-old a "high-tech terrorist". "He has done enormous damage to our country, and I think they need to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law," they told US television network CBS yesterday. Loading with AFP/AAP
Three NBA teams have been fined an undisclosed amount for tampering, the league said Monday.
The league said a memo was sent to the NBA's 30 teams announcing the penalties, but with no specific teams or fines mentioned.
The Atlanta Hawks say they were one of the three teams, saying that they "fully understand and respect the NBA's decision."
ESPN.com has also learned that the Houston Rockets were also fined what one source called a "small" amount. The identity of the third team fined was not immediately known.
The memo, according to USA Today, indicated the league fined the three teams because of respective "statements by a team employee to the media, a team email to prospective season ticket purchases, and articles posted online on a team website, each related to players who are currently under contract to other teams but who will become free agents this summer."
The reference to the team email to prospective season-ticket holders likely refers to a recent letter from a Hawks employee that specifically named Los Angeles Lakers center Dwight Howard and Los Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul as potential Hawks signees.
Sources say that the online articles referenced in the memo were posted on the Rockets' team website.
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.
Officials with the San Francisco Department of Environment told CIO Journal on Monday they would send out letters over the next two weeks,informing all 50 of the city's agencies that Apple laptops and desktops “will no longer qualify” for purchase with city funds. [...]
“We are disappointed that Apple chose to withdraw from EPEAT,” said Melanie Nutter, director of San Francisco's Department of Environment, “and we hope that the city saying it will not buy Apple products will make Apple reconsider its participation.”
Following last week's news that Apple had pulled all 39 of its qualifying Macs from the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) registry, it was suggested that Apple would lose business with federal, state, and local governments in the United States. Many agencies require that most or all computer purchases be limited to products listed on the EPEAT registry.As noted by The Wall Street Journal's CIO Journal , the city of San Francisco has become one of the first such entities to confirm that it will be barring most purchases of Apple computers.City agencies will still be able to ask for waivers of the policy, but San Francisco's chief information officer Jon Walton calls that process a "long" and "onerous" one that will make it "very problematic to procure Apple products."The report notes that the impact of San Francisco's decision on Apple's bottom line will be negligible given that only about 1-2% of the city's computers are Macs, representing 500-700 machines. The most recent city data available from 2010 listed purchases totaling roughly $45,000 in Macs and iPads, and iPad purchases would continue to be allowed given the absence of any EPEAT registry for tablets.Still, with many other governmental agencies potentially making similar purchasing decisions related to Apple's withdrawal from the EPEAT registry and a possible filtering-down effect that could see other businesses adopting similar stances, Apple could face challenges in increasing its share of the PC market among enterprise and government clients.

Something is Wrong
With My iPad:
I Still Hate My Life
I hope you Apple Geniuses are up to snuff because I'm pretty sure my iPad's busted. No matter how much I use it to check email, surf the web, or tag photos on Facebook, I'm still gnawed at by a horrifying emptiness that no amount of fiddling with your magical gadget can fill.
Is it too much to ask that the mere act of owning your products fills me with utter, unbroken contentment? I think not.
Now, don't treat me like some tech newbie. I've done all the stuff the Apple support page says—I restarted the iPad, I upgraded to the latest version of iOS, I even sleep next to the iPad in hopes that it will turn into a beautiful, understanding woman—but for some reason I can't pass by a mirror without gagging then giving myself the finger. The iPad, like my spirit, is completely broken.
For instance, it didn't even come with a headphone jack. Headphone Jack, I assume, is an outrageous skateboard guy who will recommend music to me and be my new best friend. Oh, it's just this music hole? Then, yeah, it did come with one of those.
Well, something is definitely wrong with the iPad's Shared Photo Streams. It lets me browse my friends' photos, but in every picture, they appear to be smiling—I know that's not possible in a world that is literally a bottomless pit of loneliness, metaphorically.
And I don't mean to go off on a rant here, but the only thing smart about this Smart Cover is how well it works! It's not smart at all at reawakening my childhood sense of joy or my ability to deserve an erection!
Side Note: you know what's great at getting fingerprints off the Retina Display? Tears. And you know what's great for getting tears off the display? Kisses.
Look, I bought all this Apple gear because it's all supposed to work seamlessly together. And sometimes it does. But when I download an album from iTunes on my iMac then use iCloud to download it to my iPhone then use AirPlay to send it to my Apple TV, no matter what song I select, the only thing I can hear is myself softly whispering “You are garbage” inside my own head. I restart my Airport Extreme thinking that'll do the trick but all I get is even scarier whispering.
Alright, alright, I see that look in your eyes. I'm willing to leave this Apple Store on only one condition: You let me stay here as long as I want and don't make me leave.
The second condition is that you find the voice of Siri and make them marry me. They don't have to call me “Sex Hotshot” like I programmed the Siri on my phone to do, but they can. And they have to.
Also, are nightmares covered by AppleCare? Because my sleep mode is NOT working right.

A lawsuit filed Dec. 7 alleges that an Austin police officer attacked a man without provocation. And they say a video will prove it.
According to the lawsuit, Sgt. Gregory White was looking for a suspicious person described as an African-American female when they pulled over to speak to Justin Tyler Scott, a homeless man.
Scott didn't answer the officer's questions. Court documents said White believed Scott was tense and acting suspiciously. Scott's attorney claims that's when Officer White grabbed Scott's arm, elbowed them and punched him.
Both men ended up on the ground.
Watch the full dash cam video below:
WARNING: The video you are about to watch may be disturbing.
Here's a copy of the lawsuit filed:
A homeless man is accusing an Austin police officer of excessive force by kvuenews on Scribd
You see it all the time; foreign men of every color with Chinese girls. Chinese girls throw themselves at Western men and even the ones that don't are very open to dating a Western man. But when you look around, how often do you see Asian men with white or foreign women? Does it only happen in the popular show The Walking Dead?
One good friend of mine, let's call them Sophie, has been working in China for four years. On the subject of dating, they told me "after 4 years without a relationship, I still don't want a Chinese guy". Chinese girls who date western guys are a common sight here in Guangzhou, but AMWF (Asian Male, Western Female) relationships seem to be a rarity.
Is this your type?
The reasons
Rumors about inadequate manhood aside, what is stopping us western girls from hooking up with Asian men? I didn't need to rack my brains too severely to come up with a few good reasons:
Lack of fashion sense . It's probably down to the limited media and lack of international shopping opportunities here, but those geometric polo shirts that are so popular with Chinese guys of all ages are just unforgivable.
Poor grooming . When will Chinese guys realize that they don't have to grow their fingernails longer than Kim Kardashian to prove that they are not farmers? A good pair of shoes would do it, really.
Everyday sexism . Chinese attitudes towards women can still be somewhat old fashioned, expecting us to abstain from drinking or smoking, and generally worrying too much about what delicate flowers we are.
Shyness . When was the last time you saw a Chinese guy kiss their girlfriend in public? I can't remember if I ever have. I know not everyone is into PDAs but I'm a European, and I don't care who's watching.
Western women are not attracted to this style
What our editor says
Even though I look Asian, I'm an American through and through, so yes, I'm a foreigner here in Guangzhou. While I believe it's all a matter of personal taste, as a Westerner, I have been attracted to many different races, but never Asian. Why? Well here are a few of my thoughts to add to the ones listed above.
I like tall, hairy, manly men. I happen to be attracted to men over 6 feet tall (or 188+ centimeters) even though I'm a shorty. It's a difficult feat to find a Chinese man that tall, at least here in the South. And a lot of Asian men either have baby faces or feminine features. I like a cut jawline that can grow some stubble. How many Asian men do you know that can grow facial hair?
Blue eyes. While I do love brown eyes, it's usually only if the man has blond hair. Ok, call me weird, but brown eyes with blond hair is a big turn-on. Not dyed blond hair, yuck! But if a man has dark hair, I prefer blue eyes. That's just not going to happen on a Chinese man.
Assertiveness . Like shyness listed above, lack of self-confidence doesn't do anything for me but make me think we could be friends at best. I'm turned on by a man who knows what they want and goes for it, without being an arrogant douche bag. And that includes in their professional life, their relationships with others and their romantic life.
The myth may be true. Maybe Asian men do have some "shortcomings" in the genital area. I am simply not attracted to them enough to find out.
A little too feminine, and no blue eyes, for our editor
A Chinese woman's view
Of course, I'm thinking purely on stereotypes here, but It's not just western girls who have given up on Chinese guys. I spoke to Alice, a local girl who dates exclusively foreigners, to learn more about the shortcomings of Chinese men.
Hi Alice. What do you think are the main differences between Chinese guys and foreign guys?
I think it's about independence; when im dating a Chinese guy, I feel like im not a person, im half a person. But with a foreign guy, I feel like we're two individuals with our own personalities and our own lives, who will always be there for each other.
What is the most memorable date you've been on?
When I was in Shenzhen, I was dating an American guy. They took me to the tallest building in Shenzhen, which is now the St Regis Hotel. Back then, the building was still under construction. The guy tricked them into letting us onto the 97 th floor – so we're some of the first people who have ever been in that building. We could the whole city lit up before us. It was great.
Are foreign men better in bed than Chinese?
From my experience I'd say probably (although there are foreign men who are still very bad!) But I'd say on average, yes. I think they've had more practice.
Thanks, Alice.
Find this guy, and Alice might change their mind
A Westerner's view (she's dating a Chinese man!)
So are local guys really a lost cause? As a recently single girl, I hope not, or else my options are seriously limited here. I spoke to Kate, from the U.S, who has been with their Chinese boyfriend Jack for 6 months.
Hi Kate. Where did you meet Jack and how long have you been together?
We met at my local gym. They were a super cute personal trainer. I met them back in October, and it took me ages to pluck up the courage to speak to him. We finally exchanged numbers, and now we've been together for six months. I've never been attracted to Asian men before but there was just something about Jack; they were confident, they carried themselves well, and they were really good looking!
What is the best date you've been on?
Bungee jumping on Baiyun Mountain.
What are the main differences between dating Jack and dating a western guy?
Jack has their life put together; they have their own money, they do laundry, and they always pick up the tab. I really don't expect that every time, but even if we have dinner and I pick up the tab, he'll insist on picking up the movie afterwards. And he's so thoughtful – they remember what kind of juice I like and always buys my favorite snacks and breakfast for when I come over. Western guys don't do that stuff.
And what about the sex, any size issues?
Oh lord no!  They are fantastic in bed. Because they are strong they have no problems picking me up or throwing me over their shoulder.
The perks of dating a personal trainer. Thanks, Kate!
Kate and their boyfriend, personal trainer Jack
The bottom line
Western women dating Asian men does happen but it's definitely not going to become mainstream anytime soon. Life isn't like Western women dating Asian men does happen but it's definitely not going to become mainstream anytime soon. Life isn't like The Lover , a film made in the early 90's, where a beautiful French girl goes to Indonesia and has a torrid, steamy affair with an uber-hot, wealthy Chinese man.
So there we have it. Like anything, dating is a personal choice; but personally, I still believe that the vast majority of Chinese guys are simply not hot. Maybe I just need to get to know them better, and then I really would consider giving up public displays of affection in exchange for my favorite breakfast every day.

A Major Project Update from Jake
In the video, I mention the BulletTrain SAFE Wallet will be available for the iPhone 5 and for the iPhone 4/4s, for $59. Based upon the response and feedback from the previous project, we decided to initially offer the iPhone 5 model. We are able to lower the price to $39, with an early-bird special for $29. These saving are due to the fact we were able to get the same tooling at a lower cost, and we are passing the savings on to you.
Assuming we succeed with this project, when it is complete, we will likely offer the iPhone 4/4s model at the same pricing. As the designer of the BulletTrain SAFE Wallet, I have spent a great deal of time using and testing prototypes, and I have to report, it is nothing short of amazing!!!
Your iPhone 5 Will Never Be The Same...
The SAFE Wallet is a complete wallet solution, capable of holding the thickness of 5 credit cards or up to 15 business cards. The SAFE finally allows iPhone users to ditch their bulky wallets and replace them with a beautifully streamlined protective case.
Many companies have attempted to deliver on the promise of combining a wallet and an iPhone case, but they have all fallen really short on delivering an optimal solution. Instead of taking a holistic design approach, at best they are all half-baked. The vast majority of iPhone wallet cases can only hold up to 3 cards, and their designs make it really difficult to insert and remove cards, not to mention most can't even fit business cards!?! The BulletTrain SAFE Wallet is the exact opposite.
True Convergence Delivered
As you will see, when you obtain and use your BulletTrain SAFE Wallet, it is the first wallet case for any SmartPhone which flawlessly delivers on the promise of convergence, and even goes beyond it in many ways.
The differences between all other iPhone wallet cases, and the BulletTrain SAFE Wallet, is like the difference between driving around in a 1913 Model T Ford, and a 2013 Model S Tesla. The difference is really that profound!!!
Most other wallet cases try to add a wallet to an iPhone case. The BulletTrain SAFE Wallet takes the opposite approach. Essentially, with the BulletTrain SAFE Wallet, I redesigned the wallet for the 21st century, and gave it a special compartment that safely holds and protects your iPhone.
Thanks for your support, and please share this project with your friends and family.
Jake
Simplify Your Life
The SAFE Wallet helps simplify our daily lives with the ability to hold credit and business cards, as well as cash and keys. At BulletTrain we believe form and function go hand in hand. This is why we sacrificed neither by designing the wallet compartment to double as a MagicStand, for both landscape and portrait viewing. Also, we've wasted no space by adding a SecretStash compartment, to store anything you want to keep SAFE and secret.
Welcome To Wallet 2.0
Pictured below is a real photo of the all-new BulletTrain SAFE Wallet with the built-in MagicStand™. It is securely holding a VISA™ card, drivers license, ATM VISA/Debit Card, a Cash Bill, along with six standard size business cards. Welcome to Wallet 2.0!
A Brilliant Case Study
The BulletTrain SAFE Wallet was designed to seriously save space in your pockets or purse. The photo below is profound. It shows a standard man's wallet with an iPhone 5 and a set of house keys, a mini gym bar coded card (which can easily be digitized) next to the all-new BulletTrain SAFE Wallet, which contains an iPhone 5, two credit cards, a drivers license, 4 business cards, and two house keys.
Leather Wallet With iPhone 5 and Keys Next to SAFE Wallet for iPhone 5: Before & After
Notice how huge the pile on the left is, and the naked iPhone 5 does not have anything protecting it from scratches, drops, damage or water. Ironically, the leather wallet on the left, even when empty, is still thicker than a full BulletTrain SAFE Wallet. Ask yourself which you would prefer to carry with you everywhere? It's time to streamline and rethink your wallet strategy. Case Closed!!!
A Key Feature
If you are going for a walk or run, or walking to your local gym, or a local restaurant, you can easily and securely store 2 standard size keys in the BulletTrain SAFE Wallet. You install them in the capsule shaped cutout, and slide them to the sides to lock them in place. To remove a key, simply slide it out the top. Having your iPhone, wallet contents and keys all in ONE place empties all the rest of your pockets, and since you only have to think about keeping track on ONE thing, you are far less likely to lose anything.
BulletTrain SAFE Wallet Shown in Stealth BLACK With House Keys
Can You Keep A Secret?
The SAFE Wallet allows you to always be prepared. There is a special secret compartment in the SAFE Wallet, located next to the camera ring, which allows you to store all kinds of small things. In the photo below we see a $20 bill folded up origami-style for emergencies. The Secret Stash is only visible and accessible when your iPhone is removed from the SAFE Wallet. You can store many other things in the Secret Stash, like an additional micro-sim card for when you travel internationally, and you can even carry medication or mints in it.
Making A CASE For Protection
No one likes a cracked screen, which is why, at BulletTrain we designed a case with both convenience and protection in mind. High-quality rubber covers the entire inside of the SAFE Wallet to provide shock absorption for drops, while providing added water resistance for all buttons and silent switch. That same rubber wraps around the front of the SAFE to provide added protection for your screen.
Quality and Comfort
Each SAFE Wallet is made of colored Polycarbonate, resulting in a light-weight and durable case, that when scratched doesn't peel and reveal paint, just more of the color you chose. The SAFE is also designed to be as comfortable in your pockets as it is in your hands. The advanced ergonomics of the SAFE fit nicely in your palm with little fear of it slipping through your fingers.
Color Therapy
The SAFE Wallet for iPhone 5 model is pictured below and it comes in 5 great colors, including BulletTrain Blue, Ruby Red, Arctic White, Simple Silver and Matte Black.
Streamline Your Big Wallet Instantly
People carry too many things in their wallets. Credit cards that are never used, club cards, old receipts; all just pieces of paper or plastic taking up space. What are you carrying in your wallet that you could remove or digitize? Think about it. The SAFE Wallet for iPhone 5 is pictured below, and yes, it is thinner than a permanent maker.
The BulletTrain SAFE case was designed and made just for you! All you probably really need to cary with your on a regular basis is a Credit Card, an ATM/Debit Card, Drivers License, Cash and maybe several business cards.
Manufacturing & Delivery Plan
BulletTrain designer, Jake Ehrlich had a vision to create the ultimate, no-comprimise smartphone wallet case for their iPhone. They invested a tremendous amount of time working on the design, and talking with potential customers about the features they would like to see in such a product.
We began making prototypes many months ago, and kept experimenting and refining the design until there was no room for improvement.
Our appearance model prototypes have been thoroughly tested and approved. The next step is building the tooling needed to mass produce the SAFE Wallet for our Kickstarter backers and the public. We have developed a strong relationship with a world-class manufacture to ensure consistent high-quality.
We plan to deliver the BulletTrain SAFE Wallet for iPhone 5 to our Kickstarter backers in April of 2013. We are working with a very dependable fulfillment organization to ship out the finished product as quickly as possible.
Size & Weight
iPhone 5 SAFE Wallet model weighs under 34 grams each, which is less than an ounce, or less than 1/16 of a pound. This is about the weight of five American 25¢ Quarter coins! Basically it weighs almost nothing!
• iPhone 5 SAFE Wallet Case Measures: 5.2 inches (132 MM) Tall, by 2.6 inches (66 MM) Wide, by .63 inches (16 MM) Thick.

Are you trying to teach your students or children how to write essays? Today's educators can explore different approaches, but they have one thing in common: they need to rely on technology in order to bring the knowledge closer to the understandings of the current generation of learners. If you ignore the beneficial effects of educational technology, you're limited to abstract explanations that would bore the students. That's not the effect you want to achieve.
Of course, you cannot start using the first online tool you come across to. You need carefully-chosen apps and websites that will fit into your overall teaching strategy. Explore the following options; they are perfect for teachers and parents who want to help students boost their writing skills.

They can develop characters with unique features, inspired by the ideas provided by the app. The best thing about this app is that it provides writing tips that help its users write better.

The process is collaborative; they are always available to answer questions and explain the research and writing process to the customers.

When teachers or parents become part of this community, they receive invaluable tips that will help them present the writing process in details.

The tool enables its users to add appeal to their content by uploading a cover image, choosing a theme, and adding sound, images, videos, and interactive chart. When the work is ready, the users can publish it and make it shareable.
7. OmmWriter: Microsoft Word is not the most distraction-free writing environment for students. It features confusing icons and tools that attract more attention than they are supposed to. OmmWriter, on the other hand, helps the user focus on the peace by promoting a minimalistic writing platform. In addition, you can encourage the creative thinking process of the student thanks to the audio tracks this tool supports.
The most important thing to keep in mind is that students can boost their writing skills only if they practice regularly. Thanks to the 7 tools listed above, the practice will be more inspiring than ever.

In recent weeks, the massive arrival of asylum seekers opened a debate about the economic and political repercussions of immigration in Europe. The discussion is not entirely new. Traditionally, migrations in and out of Europe have shaped the Continent. Merchants, artists and intellectuals moved between European countries to practice their trade. British, Dutch, Germans and Swedes also immigrated to the United States, while Spaniards and Italians sought South America. Europe has had its fair share of population displacements as well: Russians moved to Western Europe after the Bolshevik revolution, and Greece and Turkey exchanged parts of their populations after World War I.
Many displaced peoples were forced to resettle in the decades following World War II, creating even more intra-European migrations. Many ethnic Germans living in Central and Eastern Europe were expelled from their homes in retaliation for the war. While reliable numbers are hard to find, by the early 1950s almost 8 million ethnic Germans had moved into Western Germany, while some 3.5 million had moved into Eastern Germany. Also after the war, hundreds of thousands of southern Europeans emigrated to Northern Europe and the Americas to escape poverty and unemployment.
By the 1950s and 1960s, decolonization had resulted in people from Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia moving to their former colonial powers, creating demographic change in Europe. In many cases, European countries actually encouraged this movement, because immigrants were needed to bolster the workforce of a rapidly growing European economy.
But this golden era of the "guest workers" programs had one underlying issue: The policies were based on the assumption that the migrants would eventually return home. Most of these programs subsequently ended with the economic downturn that followed the oil crises of the early 1970s. However, migrants still continued to flow into Europe thanks to family reunification policies, Turkish families moving to Germany probably being the most distinct example.
The early 1990s were again a time of European migration, with Germany once more at the center of the process. The fall of the Berlin Wall enabled ethnic Germans living in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to move to the reunified Germany, and people from the former East Germany move to the more developed West Germany. The 1990s were later marked by the collapse of Yugoslavia and the ethnic conflicts that followed, which forced even more people to seek Western Europe.
And in the 2000s, two events shaped migration to Europe. The first was the European Union's enlargement to the east, which allowed citizens from countries in the former Communist bloc to legally work in Western Europe. The second was the financial crisis, which encouraged hundreds of thousands of Portuguese, Spanish, Irish and Greeks to immigrate to Germany, the United Kingdom and other wealthy economies in the north.
Signs From the Past
The current migration flow into Europe is somewhat different from those of the past. Unlike the litany of previous population movements, this one involves a combination of asylum seekers from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan and economic migrants from sub-Saharan Africa and the Balkans, most of whom arrive in Europe by land or sea. Many of these migrants endure long and dangerous trips from their countries of origin.
FRISCO – With one month under wrap of college soccer, let's take a look at the top five FC Dallas Academy graduates who are best performing for their Division I soccer teams.
1. Brandon Servania (Fr. - Wake Forest University)
Midfielder - 8 GP, 2 GS, 2 G, 7A
Servania was an outstanding player for the FCD Academy over the years. A U-16 National Champion and participant in U.S. Youth National Team call-up, the midfielder has made a quick and impactful transition into college soccer. As a first-year student, Servania has already become an integral part of Wake Forest's lineup with eight matches played since August, helping the team to a 7-1 record. The Dallas-native has made a name for themselves in the box score with two goals and seven assists this season, most notably during a 5-1 rout against Rugers University in August setting up their teammates twice, while scoring a brace himself.
2. Ben Hale (Fr. - Furman University)
Goalkeeper - 7 GP, 7 GS, S 17, 4 CL
In 2016, Ben Hale was unable to play their first-year student season after tearing their ACL in FCD's U-18 National Championship game that July, but is excelling in their first season of collegiate action so far in 2017. Now, back at their best, Hale has been instrumental for Furman, playing all seven games this season keeping four shutouts with 17 saves, helping their team to an impressive 6-1 record.
3. Jordan Cano (Sr. - Southern Methodist University)
Defender - 7 GP, 7 GS, 3 A, 4 CL
The defender has been vital in the back line for SMU this year. Since the start of the season, Cano has started in each of their team's matches, with the team posting a 6-1 record out of the gate. While the senior is having an impressive season defensively with four shutouts, they are also contributing in attack with three assists.
4. Aldo Quevedo (Fr. - Yale University)
Forward - 6 GP, 4 GS, 1 G, 1A
A U-16 National Champion with FC Dallas, the young forward has started brightly into their first season of college soccer. Quevedo has played six games for Yale, starting four of those, with the team standing 2-4 early in the season. The Dallas-native played a key role in their side's 3-0 win against Howard earlier this season with one goal and assist.
5. Corey Cantor (Sr. - Oral Roberts University)
Midfielder - 6 GP, 6 GS, 2G, 1A
Having played in six games this season starting in each one, Cantor has been an important attacking piece for their side with two goals and one assist so far. Most recently, the midfielder scored two goals against Bacone College, with the equalizer coming off a 40-yard effort as ORU went on to win the match, 4-2.
It wasn't fair.
After a Hall of Fame career, Ryne Sandberg put in the hard work moving their way up through the minors to get a position they very much wanted — a job as a major league manager.
They aren't able to get the opportunity with the Cubs organization, but eventually did so with the Phillies.
The only problem? With veterans on the decline and roster that would quickly resemble one of a Triple-A team, the situation Sandberg got themselves into was nothing but an absolute mess.
While general manager Ruben Amaro Jr. will still take the brunt of the blame from the fan base, there was a growing portion that was becoming increasingly unhappy with Sandberg. The difference between Amaro and Sandberg is that the latter never stood a chance.
Tony La Russa, Bobby Cox, Joe Torre, not even Connie Mack would have been able to keep this team from amassing 100 losses. So what did you expect in Sandberg's first go-around at the major league level?
Just like their playing career, Sandberg left on their own terms, before they were forced out. They saw the writing on the wall and knew that it was only matter of time before they were let go. So Friday morning at 10 a.m., Sandberg arrived at Citizens Bank Park, rode the elevators up to the offices of team president Pat Gillick and Amaro and told them they were done.
Just over five and a half hours later, they made the news official, announcing that they were stepping down as manager of the Phillies in a news conference at the ballpark.
This way, at least, they were able to keep a portion of their dignity, instead of forcing someone to remove them from the position.
The main reason Sandberg gave for stepping down was "the accumulation of — in my mind — the losses," but they also cited looming changes. The first of which will likely come within days and that's the hiring of Andy MacPhail as team president.
It wouldn't have been the first time the two crossed paths. MacPhail was president of the Cubs during Sandberg's last three seasons with the team as a player and the reports are that the relationship between the two isn't the greatest. It could have been just of one many reasons for the timing of Sandberg's decision, which they said they had pondered for a week to 10 days.
And maybe it wasn't the case, but it surely looked like Sandberg wasn't always included in, and informed of, the decisions the front office was making. Something else that may have prompted Sandberg to throw in the towel.
The last straw might have been a second baseman that could go down as one of the most beloved players in Phillies history — Chase Utley. Utley was placed on the disabled list last week with inflammation in their right ankle, something they said has been bothering them most of the year and a possible reason for their struggles this year.
Even though head athletic trainer Scott Sheridan told reporters in New York Utley had an MRI on the ankle in mid-May, the injury caught Sandberg by surprise. It's a bit of an embarrassment if the manager isn't kept in the loop regarding injuries.
Then there were the issues, many of them recent, that showed a lack of leadership. One incident again involved Utley. The second baseman, who covers their face with their glove while having even the politest of conversations, visibly voiced their displeasure on the mound to pitching coach Bob McClure during a 19-3 loss to the Orioles earlier this month.
In that same game, the bullpen phone somehow ended up off the hook, keeping the Phillies from warming up a reliever and forcing outfielder Jeff Francoeur to throw a second inning. Another embarrassment for a team that already has the worst record in the majors.
Just a few days prior on June 12, Ken Giles had it out with Sandberg and McClure in the dugout during a game in Pittsburgh.
The lack of support, along with players seemingly turning on Sandberg, created an environment that not many would wish to be a part of. Especially a person with the competitiveness and desire to win such as Sandberg.
Despite what could have eventually turned into an uprising when mixed in with the piling up of losses, players still had nothing but positive remarks about Sandberg following the news.
They could have quit on their team, but that's something nobody in the organization felt they did. They said they gave 100 percent each day and their players agreed.
"I don't look at it like that … because they showed up every day early, ready to do work do early work, all that stuff," Francoeur said. "I think there just comes a time that I'm sure like anything you feel like it's time to let someone else do it and let's see if this staff can do it. They told us there are changes coming up but at no point did they quit on us."
Even the Phillies' interim manager, former third base coach Pete Mackanin gave Sandberg a ringing endorsement as manager less than an hour after Sandberg announced their resignation.
"Let's put it this way: if you can't play for a guy who's as even keel as him, it's difficult to play for anybody," Mackanin said. "I played for Billy Martin and Dick Williams and guys like that from the old school who yelled and screamed all the time and demanded your success otherwise you were out.
"For a guy like Ryno they demanded you to do your job and I think it showed in the times they mixed the lineup up and he's done different things. There's only so much you can do when you don't have the talent of some other teams. It always comes down to this. Could they have done this, should they have done that, reacted differently? Not for me. He's just a very even keel guy."
Another man — one who surely will be a part of the changes Sandberg talked about — Amaro, also defended Sandberg.
The domination of Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull on Formula 1 seems long ago now. After what was a tricky 2014 season where Daniel Ricciardo took advantage of Mercedes' errors and technical difficulties to take three fine victories, Red Bull have found themselves very much on the back foot in the little of the 2015 season that has gone by, thanks in no small part to a sub-par chassis on top of a pretty woeful Renault power unit. Since then, Red Bull (and Toro Rosso) team owner Dietrich Mateshitz has threatened to pull the plug entirely on Red Bull's F1 programme as it is infeasible that they run a Mercedes, Ferrari or a Honda power unit. The Red Bull quit threats are quite justified, and not simply the team crying out because they are not winning as much any more.
First of all and perhaps most importantly: think of Formula 1 as a business, and not as a sport. If a business person, invests money into a project but does not receive the desired results from this, logically they will pull the plug on this as opposed to wasting more money on something which is not working. Whilst Red Bull were winning championships and getting the desired coverage as a result of all of the success that they achieved, this must have been great for the company, but languishing in the midfield whilst spending a similar amount of money to the top teams absolutely does not do anyone any favours. Red Bull is a business at the end of the day, and if they are not getting the returns from Formula 1 as a result, then they would be silly not to sell on and leave the sport.
Whilst it is frustrating for people to watch the likes of Manor and Sauber struggle simply to survive in the sport, and then have the contrast of Red Bull threatening to leave despite finishing second in the Constructors' Championship last season, it must be remembered that Manor and Sauber are there to race, and not to sell a product. To enter something like Formula 1 with a racing mindset is absolutely different to entering it with a business one. Even the small teams like Manor are ultimately there to try to win the championship in some shape or form. Red Bull are not there to win titles, they are there to sell cans of energy drink, and if F1 is not cost effective when they are not delivering the success, then it would make sense to pull out.
Red Bull have a big impact on motorsport as it is; they are the title sponsor of the MotoGP Indianapolis Grand Prix. They also own the Red Bull Ring in Austria as well as having a number of drivers wearing Red Bull logos up and down the grid in multiple series. Ultimately, with the TV and attendance numbers dwindling, I do not believe that Red Bull sees as much point in Formula 1 as when they first joined the sport ten years ago. Why should they pay more and more money when fewer and fewer people are getting the coverage of their product? They may well continue to stay in motorsport, but in a sport where it is much more cost effective to have their logo plastered everywhere.
Other than having the race at the Red Bull Ring, which proved popular last year, I do not see why F1 should worry about the loss of Red Bull too much either. With Renault already more than interested in the junior team, Toro Rosso, and almost certainly interest in the main team too with the infrastructure that it already has, ultimately F1 would probably lose no teams as a result. Red Bull can continue to have their junior programme or even sponsor drivers in F1 if it remains cost effective, but perhaps their drivers can enter the likes of Sportscar racing or IndyCar; two areas where Red Bull do not have a massive impact right now.
If Red Bull want to pull the plug on F1 because Renault haven't been good enough and there's no way to strike a deal with Mercedes, Ferrari or Honda, then so be it.

The stars, writers and producers tell the story of the award-winning political satire which made a household name of spin doctor Malcolm Tucker and ends on Saturday
Award-winning political satire The Thick Of It comes to an end on BBC2 on Saturday. The show, which made foul-mouthed spin doctor Malcolm Tucker a household name first appeared on BBC4 seven years ago. Here we look back on the origins of the show, its big-screen spin-off, and how it became part of the political lexicon.
Armando Iannucci had already made The Day Today and I'm Alan Partridge, with Steve Coogan, when they were inspired to create The Thick Of it after arguing the case for Yes Minister in a 2004 Best British Sitcom poll for BBC2. It was commissioned for an initial three-part run by BBC4.

Armando Iannucci "One of the lucky offshoots [of the BBC2 show] was that I could sit down and watch every episode of Yes Minister and it made me think we need something like this now. The terrain was very different – it was not about the civil service but about advisers and the whole Campbell-Mandelson communications thing. I spoke to [Yes Minister co-creator] Antony Jay and they said 'go for it'."
Adam Tandy (producer) "When Peter Capaldi [who went on to star as Malcolm Tucker] came to the casting session they had already been for an audition that day. I don't think they had been working an awful lot and was in a slightly off-colour mood. We did an improvisation session and they channelled all their frustration into it. That could be what got them the part. They were born to play the role."
Iannucci "I knew within the BBC there was a buzz about it and I felt it myself shooting it. In the very first scene Malcolm Tucker comes in and fires the incumbent minister; Malcolm looks at them and whatever light there were leaves their eyes. I remember looking at the monitors thinking, we've got something here."
Critics said the show could "scarcely be more topical", with Andrew Marr describing it as the "angry, rampaging bastard child of Yes Minister". It was commissioned for another three-part run, but the faux-documentary filming style was not to every viewer's taste.

Chris Addison (special adviser Ollie Reader) "It's calmed down a bit now but if you look back one of the biggest complaints wasn't the swearing but the camerawork. It used to make people feel sick."
Tandy "We shot it in the old Guinness brewery in Park Royal, west London. We were literally the last people to leave before the bulldozers moved in and if you listen to the soundtrack on the second group of three episodes you can hear the lorries."
Days after beating Ricky Gervais to win the best TV comedy actor at the British Comedy Awards in 2005, it was revealed star Chris Langham (who played the bumbling minister Hugh Abbot) had been arrested by police as part of an investigation into child pornography on the internet. A planned series was replaced by two specials, with Langham's character absent "in Australia", while the case came to court. They were subsequently jailed in 2007 for downloading images of child abuse and did not return.
Iannucci "We chose not to leap to judgment, something we are still seeing to this day in terms of government by newspaper headline, mob rule and so on, and said we would wait."
Tandy "The hiatus was not great because we lost momentum but we knew the show was good and knew there was still enthusiasm to make it. We managed to keep the show in production even though we were not officially making a series."
The show's writing team, including Jesse Armstrong, Simon Blackwell, Tony Roche and Sean Gray, included Ian Martin in the unusual role of "swearing consultant".
Ian Martin "I hadn't seen a script when the first ones came over and Armando, who I had worked with on a couple of things, said just shit all over them, do whatever you like. I still wasn't sure what they wanted but I remember changing a line, when Malcolm was on the phone, from 'he's fucking useless' to 'he's as useless as a fucking marzipan dildo'. I sent them back and said is this the sort of thing you're after. They said, yeah, yeah, brilliant."
Sean Gray "The first draft of the script will go to Armando and they will feed in notes – 'fewer shits', 'too fucky' or just 'funnier' written in the margin. It motivates you. It then goes to the other writers. By the time of shooting you are on draft 20 or more."
The Thick of It transferred to the big screen with film spin-off, In The Loop, in 2009, starring James Gandolfini.
Iannucci "I had been thinking about the fallout from the war in Iraq and thought it would make an interesting film. I already had a repertory company in place in terms of people who could do it."
Tandy "We were very lucky BBC Films came to us. We thought about it for about 12 seconds before saying yes. We heard James Gandolfini was a fan so they were very pleased to come on board."

Joanna Scanlan (press chief Terri Coverley) "I know Tony Soprano was in it so it should have felt like a huge deal but whatever Armando does is very grounded, you never have a sense of not being safe or things being out of control. It brought a new audience to the TV show and made a huge character out of Malcolm Tucker."
Addison "On the third day of shooting one of the assistant directors turned to me and said 'is it always this nice on the telly show?' Because it isn't always this nice in film."
When The Thick Of It returned to the small screen in 2009, it switched from BBC4 to BBC2, and Hugh Abbot had been replaced as minister by the hapless Nicola Murray, played by Rebecca Front, who had worked with Iannucci on shows such as The Day Today.

Rebecca Front "I sat down at a writers' meeting with some of the cast members and at that time they had no character, no name, no script. Armando said 'Do you want to start improvising?' It was terrifying – that was the first time I was Tuckered. Peter transformed into Malcolm Tucker, pinned me against the wall and started shouting at me."

Roger Allam (Peter Mannion MP) "My character just emerged really as someone who is behind the new Tory party – although of course we never say it is the Tory party – behind the whole Cameroon thing, get down with the kids and hug a hoodie, all that shite."
Front "I sincerely hope my character doesn't put women going off into politics. I would hope women would want to go into politics because they think they can do better than Nicola Murray. Nicola screws up not because she's a woman but because she's a human being."
Life imitated art when Ed Miliband described George Osborne's latest budget as an "omnishambles". It was a word coined on The Thick Of It by Tucker.
Martin "That was Tony Roche's elegant phrase, it was utterly astonishing. I remember someone sending me a screengrab from Newsnight and there was #omnishambles against the back wall of the studio. It looked like a scene from The Day Today. I suppose it's part of politicians wanting to appropriate the satire, as a way of making it less harmful to them."
Iannucci "When people in real life politics start quoting elements of it to attack opponents, that line between reality and stupidity has been crossed. You kind of think they really ought to be getting on with their own lives. It's not the reason I decided to stop doing it, it's just an interesting point we've arrived at."
This year's fourth series played out against the backdrop of a Leveson-style inquiry. Incidents on the show began to eerily pre-empt similar real-life events, such as a storyline about a government proposal to cut school breakfast clubs, followed the next day by reports of a real-life equivalent. A select committee report this month warned the government against Thick Of It-style special adviser appointments. The public administration select committee warned that the BBC series had "more than a grain of truth".
Gray "We have a consultant [BBC political reporter Kate Conway] who helps us get the more mundane, important details right, like the layout of Ed Miliband's office, but we don't have moles per se. We spend the majority of our time working on jokes and funny lines, not policies."
Front "Every single episode has presaged something that was coming. I sat on a panel with David Cameron the other day and they were forced to acknowledge that, yes, it is basically exactly like what is happening to their government."
A former coalition special adviser "Certainly among the special adviser community it is seen as spookily close to real life. Not quite a fly on the wall documentary but each and every situation that they depict is experienced by special advisers and other people in government on a pretty much daily basis. What it has done so brilliantly is demonstrated that behind the scenes of what might appear an impressive government machine (although not recently) are a bunch of people just like in any other office, with all the clashing egos, fights over territory and pitfalls that go with it."

Labour MP and former culture secretary, Ben Bradshaw "The macho laddish aggression and anger is nothing I ever experienced in government with special advisers or anyone. Tempers frayed very rarely, if at all; maybe I was moving in the wrong circles. That doesn't mean to say that some of the storylines haven't been pretty prescient and prophetic. One of the problems is the reality is much more interesting and extraordinary than the fiction."
Iannucci has said Saturday's episode of The Thick Of It will be the last.  They are working on a big-screen adaptation of Alan Partridge and the second series of their West Wing satire Veep, starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus, for HBO.
Iannucci "It's definitely the last series. I've known from past experience to never say never. I don't think it's going to change politics. In terms of comedy hopefully it will inspire someone in the same way that I remember listening to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or watching Not the Nine O'Clock News and thinking, I want to do something like that. You end up making something not like that, but it gives you the impetus to set out on that road."
Gray "It's a shame to stop but it also makes sense because hopefully we haven't outstayed our welcome. It's great to leave at a point where people are hopefully wanting more. That's the best way."
Tandy "Has it changed anything? I think it has. It's brought the way politics functions in this country out into the open. Its shows the government needs a bit more transparency, but it also helps you feel for the politicians sometimes. They are just ordinary people trying to do a job."
The Thick Of It, BBC2, Saturday, 9.30pm
Archaeologists made a moving discovery inside the 2,000-year-old tombs of children in the ancient Greek seaport city of Parion, now in modern-day Turkey. Excavations of several ancient graves revealed a number of children's toys, which are believed to have been offered as gifts for the dead children to accompany them on their journey to the afterlife.
According to The Daily Sabah , Professor Hasan Kasaoğlu from Atatürk University and director of the excavation works at Parion, located in Turkey's Çanakkale province, stated that female figurines were discovered in tombs belonging to girls, while male figurines were unearthed in boys' tombs. Kasaoğlu said that the new findings could provide valuable information about the sociocultural structure of the period. "2,000 years ago girls played with 'Barbie-like' dolls, the same way they do now," Kasaoğlu told The Daily Sabah , adding that despite toys changing drastically throughout the centuries, the need of humans to play and be entertained has remained the same to this day.
The Importance of Toys Throughout the Centuries
Toys have always been an important part of daily life in human settlements and various archaeological finds have proved that repeatedly. As previously reported in a 2015 Ancient Origins article , tiny figurines were discovered in the grave of an infant which, according to archeologists, dates back 4,500 years. One of the theories proposed that the figurines may have been used as rattling toys or charms to ward off evil spirits. The discovery was made on the northwest shore of Lake Itkul in the Minusinsk basin of Russia by researchers of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Khakassian Research Institute of Language, Literature and History.
The remains of the infant were found in a birchbark cradle, a fact that indicated that the child was less than one-year-old at the time of death. On the infant's chest, archaeologists discovered eight miniature horned figurines representing human-like characters and heads of elk, boar, birds and an unknown carnivore. The figurines were carved from deer antlers and painted with red ochre. Some of them, according to the researchers, had internal cavities and could produce sounds like modern rattles.

Furthermore, in 2016 Natalia Klimczak reported for Ancient Origins , the discovery of an early Bronze Age toy equivalent to the modern rattle at the Acemhöyük excavation site in Yeşilova, Aksaray. The unique artifact shed some light on children and daily life in ancient times.
The toy was sealed but had tiny ornaments and small pebble stones inside, while archaeologists were surprised to find that it can still produce a noise when the rattle is shaken. The toy is shaped like a ball and it used to have a handle which may have helped the child or an adult to shake it. It is made of terra-cotta and was discovered in a layer dated back to 2200 BC.

Figurines Depicting Animals and Mythological Figures Also Unearthed
Fast forward to 2017, Dr. Kasaoğlu noted that the human figurines weren't the only ones the archaeologists discovered at the site. Figurines depicting animals and Greek mythological creatures were also discovered in the tombs. Interestingly, earlier in September, excavators also discovered a baby bottle at the site.
Founded in 709 BC, the ancient city of Parion (also known as Parium) was a Greek colony that belonged to the Delian League . During the Hellenistic period it came under the domain of Lysimachus, and subsequently the Attalid dynasty . In Roman times, it was a Roman settlement, within the province of Asia. After that province was divided in the 4th century, it was in the province of Hellespontus. The ancient coinage of Parium is quite abundant, attesting to its great output and advanced mint (in Hellenistic times, the city's badge shown on coins was the Gorgoneion). Archaeologists have been carrying out excavations at the ancient site since 2005, unearthing several sarcophagi and graves, as well as ancient artifacts in the area.

Democratic National Committee Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile will take over as the group's interim leader in the aftermath of Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz abruptly resigning Sunday, the DNC said.
The announcement came within minutes of Wasserman Schultz stepping down amid WikiLeaks email releases that appear to show them team's bias toward Sen. Bernie Sanders during their primary campaign against Hillary Clinton.
Brazile is expected to serve through the election. As for a more permanent replacement, it's unclear how many officials may be jockeying for the position. Democratic sources told Fox News that former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm and New York Democratic Rep. Steve Israel are being considered to replace them
In their resignation letter, Wasserman Schultz, of Florida, said they will maintain some official duties at the Democratic National Convention, including speaking to delegates, but that they would officially resign when the event ends Thursday.
They resign amid pressure from Sanders supporters, in an apparent effort by Washington Democrats to keep the controversy from marring the four-day convention.
Ben Mansfield, Daniel Marchesano receive life sentences for shooting murder of Michael Pruiti
Updated
Two Perth men have been sentenced to life in prison with lengthy minimum terms for luring another man into bushland and shooting them dead.
Ben Mansfield, 35, and Daniel Marchesano, 21, were found guilty by a Supreme Court jury of murdering 31-year-old Michael Pruiti in October 2013.
Mr Pruiti was lured by Marchesano into bushland in Pickering Brook, where Mansfield was lying in wait with a rifle.
They shot Mr Pruiti in the head.
Their body was then burnt and their legs amputated before being wrapped in plastic and buried in scrubland at Karragullen.
Their remains were not found for two months.
Justice Peter Martino said the crime was aggravated by the "disrespectful" treatment of Mr Pruiti's body and because their family did not know what had happened to them for two months.
Nobody deserves to die like that and what they did to them afterwards, really that's evil. Debbie Pruiti
"The murder was planned ... the murder was unprovoked. The victim was lured to a location where they couldn't defend himself," they said.
The court heard the two murderers were methamphetamine users with Marchesano's lawyer, Paul Yovich SC, saying their client's mind was "drug-addled" at the time.
Mr Yovich also claimed Marchesano had only taken part in the murder because Mansfield had threatened to kill them and members of their family.
However, Justice Martino rejected the submission, saying Marchesano entered into an agreement and knew Mansfield would kill Mr Pruiti.
'Nobody deserves to die like that'
Outside the court, Mr Pruiti's mother, Debbie, welcomed the sentence.
"I think that's great, I couldn't be happier and I just hope they find God while they're in there and I find forgiveness in my heart for them," they said.
Mrs Pruiti said their son did not deserve to die the way they did.
"Nobody deserves to die like that and what they did to them afterwards, really that's evil," they said.
Mrs Pruiti described their son as "a really great kid" who loved playing in their band.
They also warned of the dangers of the drug ice.
"It's the most evil drug on the planet," they said.
"It attacks your mind and then it destroys your family and it destroys your soul and something like this can happen."
Mansfield was sentenced to life with a 26-year minimum, while Marchesano, who was given credit for their youth and lack of prior convictions, was sentenced to life with a 23-year non-parole period.
The sentences were backdated to the time of the their arrests in December 2013.

CLEVELAND, Ohio -- No one really knows if Mike Pettine will have more success than Rob Chudzinski, Pat Shurmur or about any other Browns coach since 1999. That's because he's never been a head coach before, and they come to a losing team with no quarterback.
But I do like Mike Pettine better than Adam Gase and some of the others interviewed by the Browns.
The bulky, bald, tough-talking Pettine sounds like a football coach. They said some of the right things, such as the need to "bloody a nose a bit" to play in the rugged AFC North. I love how they said, "I'll bet on myself ... I'm not backing away from a job" as they considered what the challenge of being the next coach of the NFL's worst franchise since 1999.
I'd have preferred the Browns to stay with Chudzinski, but the ship not only has sailed -- it's sunk. But Pettine has some qualities that are appealing. That's especially true after taking a hard look at Pettine's work as Buffalo's defensive coordinator in 2013.
Pettine took over a Bills defense that ranked 22nd, and moved it up to No. 10. I know, the Browns ranked ninth in total yards allowed, so what's the big deal?
Let's look at what the Browns consider important on defense -- and where the defense fell short last season:
1. RED ZONE: The Browns ranked 30th (64 percent) in allowing touchdowns inside the 20, Buffalo was eighth. In 2012, the Bills ranked No. 31.
2. THIRD DOWN CONVERSIONS: The Browns ranked 31st (45 percent), the Bills were 14th (37 percent).
3. SACKS: The Browns ranked 16th (40), the Bills were second (57).
4. INTERCEPTIONS: The Browns ranked 20th (14), the Bills were second (23).
5. POINTS: The Browns were 23rd (25.4), the Bills were 21st (24.2). At least the Bills improved from a 26th ranking a year ago.
The biggest negative was their Bills ranked 28th vs. the run. They were No. 4 vs. the pass.
The reason to start with a look at Pettine's one season in Buffalo is that it's at least something tangible. The Bills were a lousy defense in most categories when they arrived. In one season, they made them a good defense.
Profootballfocus.com rated Buffalo's defense as No. 4 in the NFL. They had the Browns at No. 21.
Leaving Ryan
There is a tendency to view them as a Rex Ryan creation. I know that was true of me when I first heard them mentioned for the job.
It's a fact: No Rex Ryan, no discussion of Pettine with the Browns.
Pettine was a video coordinator with the Ravens in 2002 when they met Ryan. By 2004, they were Ryan's defensive line coach, and later the outside linebackers coach.
Talking to people in Baltimore, I learned that Ryan was terrible with computers and technology. Pettine had been helping their father (legendary Pennsylvania high school coach Mike Pettine Sr.) edit game tapes almost from the time they began to watch television.
Pettine's high-tech background probably appeals to the Browns' front office, which loves stats and computers.
When Ryan became head coach of the Jets in 2009, they took Pettine with them -- as defensive coordinator. The Jets had outstanding defenses from 2009-12, ranking as high as No. 1 and never lower than eighth. But it was impossible to know how much of that was due to Ryan, and how much was Pettine.
It's the same as viewing the defensive coordinators under Bill Belichick. Yes, they have influence, but it's Belichick's defense. Or even Gase with the Denver Broncos. In their one year as coordinator, how much was Gase and how much of the success is due to the vast impact on and off the field of Peyton Manning?
But in Buffalo, there was no doubt -- the defense belonged to Pettine.
It was why Pettine left the Jets for the Bills -- to establish their own identity. They were offered a contract extension by the Jets, but turned it down and went into their final season (2012) planning to become a free agent. They were hired by Bills coach Doug Marrone, whose background was offense. Their defenses were a 3-4 base, but they used a variety of formations. In terms of the type of players the Browns have, Pettine seems to be a good fit.
One of their worst games was a 37-24 loss to the Browns. In that game, the Browns scored on a 79-yard Travis Benjamin punt return and an interception by T.J. Ward. Only two touchdowns were allowed by the Bills defense, but it was certainly not a monumental effort by Buffalo that night in Cleveland.
Not the first choice
If the Browns were truly in love with Pettine, they would have hired them a week after Chudzinski was fired. They were available right after the season because the Bills missed the playoffs. They were pursuing Seattle defensive coordinator Dan Quinn, Josh McDaniels, Gase and others before Pettine emerged. They might be unwise to claim that Pettine was their choice right from the start.
But the 47 year old may end up being a better pick than some of those other coaches.
They were a head coach in high school for six years. They were 45-15 at North Penn High, and five of those losses were to their father's Central Bucks West team. Mike Pettine Sr. won 326 games and four state titles in 33 years as a high school coach.
In order to create their own reputation, Pettine had to step out of their father's huge high school shadow before escaping Ryan's in the NFL.
Pettine has been driven to prove he's "not just a high school coach."
He's smart enough to know football is "not about winning the press conference." That's especially true in Cleveland, where fans have heard too many introductory coaching press conferences since 1999. Fans have heard it all from podium, but seen so little to cheer about on the field. Pettine knows that.
It's impossible to guess how Pettine will fare. He'll obviously need a strong offensive coordinator and for the Browns to find them a quarterback, or they have no chance.
But they do bring both experience and success to the defensive side of the ball and they seem utterly fearless about the challenge that they face here. At least that's a decent start.
While it will be a long, long time before I forget any of the food from this incredible night, the real takeaway was meeting the young men who are getting a leg up from the Cafe Momentum program. When I arrived at Parigi for the dinner, they were each dressed perfectly, standing at attention with a napkin folded neatly on their arm. So poised and professional, it took me a second to realize that these were the young men of Youth Village. At a second glance, though, I noticed in their faces how extremely young these boys were.
I've been open about my mistakes in life , and what I've yet to mention is how hard it is socially to come back from a wrong turn you might have made as a youth. I've spent plenty of time excited about a new job opportunity and then nervous about a background check, and know that moving forward can be difficult when there's a stamp on your past trying to hold you back. Sometimes it's something on a piece of paper that shares more about your past than yourself, and sometimes it's your own confidence after feeling like you'll amount to nothing because you made a mistake. So much of my success was from having many opportunities to focus my time on and a strong family that I could lean on. What about the young men in Dallas who may not have that support? I am so thankful that Youth Village and Cafe Momentum are here, giving these young men a creative release and needed confidence through great food that is also prepping them for a bright future.
While I don't know their "before" stories, the young men at Cafe Momentum were unlike almost any teenage boys I know. Chef Tiffany Derry came out at the end to thank them sous chefs for a great evening. They mentioned each young man by name and listed one of their accomplishments from the night. There were smiles on each boy's faces like nothing I had ever seen on a teenage male before. The boys would high five and hug each other as the room of happy guests erupted in applause. One of the leaders of the group said, "We'd like to thank you for this opportunity. When I got ready tonight my goal was to greet each of you, thank you for being here and introduce myself by my first and last name."
Seriously, when does any teenage boy say something like that? Especially one that's been labeled by our court system as trouble or at-risk? Cafe Momentum is changing the lives of male youth in Dallas. You have to go see it for yourself. The feeling I left with was indescribable, and it wasn't just from the banana pudding.

Last Sunday I had the honor of enjoying one of the best meals I'm sure I will ever have in Dallas (or anywhere!). Like all cool things in Dallas, it was brought to my attention by my very in-the-know mom who, I must admit, is often the one telling me about cool things in Dallas. If they had their own blog, I would be toast.For the past few years my mom has quietly been involved with The Youth Village Foundation, a non-profit in Dallas that provides support, mentorship and vocational training to male teens that are serving time in the city's juvenile reform program. I say that they were quietly involved because although I heard of Youth Village's awesome programs from them all the time, from the P.R.E.P dog training (where young men train rescue dogs so they can be more easily adopted while the trainers benefit from the discipline and love of raising an animal) to Cafe Momentum (the pop up restaurant series that teams students in Youth Villages culinary program with top chefs in Dallas for incredible meals) they never mentioned what they did as far as donating their time or money to the program.As I came to learn, the young men need white button down shirts to look their best at Cafe Momentum and go on job interviews once they finish their program. Something as simple as a white shirt can be difficult to come by for a young man whose financial background is likely a strong contributor to the fact that they are serving time in the juvenile program. My mom has bought new shirts for the graduating young men for the past three years - without telling any of us! The cat was finally out of the bag when Youth Village offered them two complimentary seats to Cafe Momentum, which they promptly passed to me since they eat like a bird.I brought my favorite food blog friend Shannon at Feed Me Dallas as my special guest, and we were both blown away by the food and amazing stories of transformation and accomplishment from such strong young men throughout the night!Cafe Momentum is run by Chad Housler and Janice Provost of Cafe Parigi, but the location of Cafe Momentum changes for its monthly dinner depending on the lead chef. Former Cafe Momentum chefs have been Dallas greats such as Steven Pyles, Dean Fearing and others. I was thrilled when our celebrity chef was Tiffany Derry of Top Chef fame and previously of Private Social! I love Southern food and was excited to see how they might add some elements of their Beaumont upbringing to the mix in their menu.Speaking of menu, I would like to add that I had heard about Cafe Momentum for a while and was eager to see and support such great work in action, but ye old gluten free issue and set menus by incredible chefs kept me from getting tickets. I finally got the nerve to email Chad and ask if there was any way they could make accommodations for a gluten free plate, and they were extremely enthusiastic, accommodating and friendly in their response. I thanked them at the dinner when I met them in person at Parigi, and they went on to say that they love when special diet (gluten free, vegetarian, and others) come to Cafe Momentum since it helps the students learn how to take care of special guests. So not only did I not feel at all guilty for my dietary needs, they made me feel like I was gifting my chefs with an extra education!Ok, on to the glorious food pics! My camera lens was a little scratched, so you would be remiss not to catch all of Shannon's amazing pictures at their write-up on Feed Me Dallas Our menu for the evening:First course was modern ceviche. The fish was meaty and the key lime juice had such a perfect flavor!Next up was a grilled romaine salad with pickled tomato, blue cheese, bacon and a champagne drizzle. Blue cheese and bacon are the Bert and Ernie to my palette. A perfect pairing every time!I had never tried pork belly before last Sunday, and I can't believe what I was missing. All Shannon had to do to get me on board was explain it was "like a big piece of bacon." The sauce it was in was tomato and okra based and I slathered it on every bite of my pork. You'll notice on Shannon's post that this dish was served with cornbread croutons, which were kept off my plate to make it gluten free.The last course was a decadent banana pudding! I love banana pudding but have not been able to enjoy it while out to dinner since I had to stop eating gluten. This recipe was divine and since the wafers were added on top, I got to enjoy a big dollop of banana pudding for the first time in years. The fresh fruit was a perfect complement and the banana slices had a sugar crusting to them like creme brulee.
EVER since they started pumping water for their vines, the winegrowers of Langhorne Creek have learnt to cope with crises. But none as grave as the one they face now. Their water source at the mouth of the Murray River, in South Australia, has turned salty. Adelaide, the state capital 55km (34 miles) away, has been told its water supply from the Murray can no longer be guaranteed. The Murray Darling Basin Authority, a new body charged with saving Australia's biggest river system from expiring, has its work cut out.
Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.
Early last month Rob Freeman, the authority's boss, delivered grim news. The volume of water flowing into the Murray and its main tributary, the Darling, between January and March was the lowest in 117 years. The three-year volume up to March was the driest ever. Mr Freeman told Adelaide's 1m people this meant that not enough water might be conveyed down the Murray to meet their “critical human needs” next year. Just 17 years ago, Adelaide relied on the Murray for only 10% of its water: regular rains filling dams in the city's hills provided the rest. Now, it depends on the Murray for 90%.
Climate change and Australia's worst drought in a century are partly to blame. But the river system that covers two-thirds of Australia's irrigated farming land is also suffering from decades of overuse. South Australians feel this with growing bitterness. They are at the end of the line in a system that starts about 2,700km north. The more populous states of Queensland and New South Wales (NSW) comprise four-fifths of the basin's area. Farmers, especially cotton and rice growers in those upstream states, account for 83% of the basin's consumed water. The impact of all this has left the Murray's mouth near Langhorne Creek close to ruin.
The wine region's first water came from an ancient aquifer. Too much pumping forced the authorities in the early 1990s to switch water licences to the Murray, 10km away at Alexandrina, one of two lakes at the mouth facing the Southern Ocean. Plenty of water then flowed through the basin to keep the lakes fresh. Langhorne Creek's wineries boomed. A crunch came last year. The flows stopped, and Alexandrina's level has dropped 1.5 metres. Its water is now too saline to use.
The authorities are now pondering the harsh step of building a weir at nearby Wellington to stop the salt water moving back into the Murray itself. Experts predict this would in effect destroy the lakes and their surrounding freshwater wetlands. Penny Wong, the federal minister for climate change and water, says the “unfortunate reality” of the flow figures means the option must be kept as a “last resort”.
Growers at Langhorne Creek and nearby Currency Creek, meanwhile, have formed a company to build a pipeline to secure their water from a cleaner point on the Murray further east. They may yet survive. Australia's interstate water-trading scheme has allowed the state to buy water from distant farmers in NSW, who have switched to less thirsty crops, and keep it in store for Adelaide. Mr Freeman's body, launched by Canberra late last year, is the first with power to manage the entire river system, overriding rivalries between the four basin states, so that calamities such as Lake Alexandrina's don't happen.
Unless drought-breaking rains come, that will be a tough ask. Craig Willson, proprietor of Bremerton winery at Langhorne Creek, and a director of its pipeline company, reckons drought and loss of the lake's water have cut the region's productivity by almost 40% over the past two years. “Even so, we're surprised at how well some vines survive using less water,” they say. Applied to growers of other crops, the same lesson may help save the Murray.
Several years ago at the holiday party for my husband's company, one of their colleagues began spouting off about how climate change was not real. Those at the table who knew what I did for a living looked expectantly at me, gearing up for a juicy confrontation. I thought, okay, here we go again…
Yes, like others working on climate change, I'm used to the occasional family member, neighbor, friend, or other acquaintance questioning climate science. Wary of derailing an otherwise cheerful occasion, my initial inclination is to diffuse these exchanges and steer the conversation back to safer territory.
However, this year, I'm going to try to embrace these encounters as teachable moments. I'm inspired by Richard Somerville and Susan Joy Hassol's Physics Today article entitled “Communicating the science of climate change,” in which they state:
“It is urgent that climate scientists improve the ways they convey their findings to a poorly informed and often indifferent public.”
and
“We must find ways to help the public realize that not acting is also making a choice, one that commits future generations to serious impacts.”
As someone who is all-too-aware of the urgency of the problem, it is no longer acceptable to smile benignly or change the subject as others spread misinformation. Avoiding these confrontations is akin to making a choice not to act.
Tips for Talking Climate Science
How best to respond to patent misunderstandings in a way that won't disrupt the festive mood? Russell McLendon offers some good advice about how to keep your cool. Here are a few more pointers that I plan to keep in mind:
1. Get local and connect the dots:
People love to talk about their own experiences with the natural world – from the latest extreme weather event to changes in their favorite outdoor activity to unusual happenings in their garden – and it usually is pretty straightforward to connect recent oddities to the changing climate. These sorts of connections help make climate change real, rather than some abstract problem affecting people far away and long into the future.
2. Make it clear what the scientists are and aren't debating now:
While it helps to be ready to quickly address some common arguments that climate deniers perpetuate (check out NWF's global warming summaries and Skeptical Science's responses to typical denier claims), try not to get stuck on these points. Scientists are no longer debating whether climate change is happening or whether humans are responsible. The questions now are: How bad will it be? and What can we do about it? And, it's not just scientists who have moved beyond the is-it-happening questions. Our military, medical, and religious leaders, along with many others, are likewise grappling with how to respond to a problem they view as very real and serious.
3. Point people to solutions:
Talking about climate change can quickly turn you into a real Debbie Downer, the last thing anyone needs at the family feast. The solution: talk about climate change solutions. I think that this part of the conversation should try to accomplish two things: (1) help people identify modest actions that they could take now to address the problem, thus avoiding the perception that climate change is an intractable problem; and (2) paint a positive vision of the future, in which we have proactively tackled climate change and are enjoying many of the co-benefits of transitioning to new, cleaner technologies. After all, who can really argue against an electric grid that's more reliable or never having to fill your car up with gas again?
4. Remind people about the good things they are already doing:
Appealing to people's better nature can be a powerful motivator. Solving climate change will require us to be frugal, resourceful, innovative, leaders, and on the cutting-edge. These traits are quintessentially American, crossing political and ideological lines. Helping people to recognize the good actions they are already doing – from recycling to carpooling to hand-me-downs – will help them identify themselves as good flight attendants of the Earth, and could lead them to make more climate-conscious choices in the future.
Some Food for Thought…
So, as I head to holiday parties over the next couple weeks, I'll be ready for the inevitable encounter with someone who questions climate science. When these teachable moments arrive, I'll be realistic about what will result. Chances are slim that I'll be able to change anyone's mind in a short conversation. But, hopefully, I'll give them some good food for thought. And, even if I can't persuade the person who raised the issue, others might join the conversation and gain something from it.
As for my husband's colleague, I was gearing up to respond when the company's CEO grabbed the microphone to make some remarks. For better or for worse, the juicy confrontation was averted. By the time the next year's holiday party rolled around, they had left the company, and our paths haven't crossed since. Next time, I'll be sure not to miss such an opportunity.

Jewish performer Yossi Zabari and Tamer Nafar, the Arab star of the Israeli film "Junction 48," raise their fist in a sign of protest during Ophir Awards. September 22, 2016.
Tensions in Israel's culture sphere escalated again on Sunday when Minister Miri Regev called on the Haifa Municipality to cancel a performance by an Israeli Arab rapper due to what they described as their subversive ideology.
Rapper Tamer Nafar, who has drawn criticism from the culture minister in the past, is scheduled to perform on Tuesday in the opening ceremony of a community theater event that is taking place alongside the Haifa International Film Festival.
In response to Regev's letter, the Haifa Municipality said it has pushed Nafar's performance to a later hour and suggested that the show might be cancelled altogether. Nafar, in turn, slammed the city for caving to pressure from the minister and their "gaggle of racists" but added that they intend to perform as planned.
In a letter to Haifa Mayor Yona Yahav, Regev wrote that hosting Nafar's show goes against the pluralism that the film festival is meant to represent.
"It's unfortunate that the Haifa Film Festival, a symbol of quality and closeness between people and countries, has chosen to give a stage to an artist who takes every opportunity to go against the State of Israel and its existence as a Jewish state," Regev wrote.
In their letter, Regev also quoted a part of Nafar's poem, "Who's the Terrorist":
"Democracy? Why? It reminds me of the Nazis / You've raped the Arab soul / And it became pregnant, giving birth to a child called terror attack / And then you call us terrorists."

Regev asserted that "such words give legitimacy to terrorism," and added that "Public funds should not support activity that undermines the state, its values and symbols in the name of art and freedom of speech."
Responding in a press release, the Haifa Municipality said it has asked Nafar to perform at 10 P.M. on Tuesday, later than it was originally planned. Due to this change, the city said, Nafar is likely to cancel their performance.
Nafar responded in a Facebook post, saying that they have no intention of pulling out of the event. "I understand that the city is under pressure from the culture minister and their gaggle of racists, and it is hoping that I will cancel, but I have no intention of letting them silence me," they wrote. "I hope to see you all on Tuesday in Haifa."
The protest against Nafar's performance began earlier this week when Likud activists in Haifa announced plans to "blow up" the show.
Last month, the culture minister walked out of the Ophir film awards ceremony after Nafar and a Jewish performer, Yossi Zabari, read a part of a poem by Palestinian national poet Mahmoud Darwish on stage.
Regev later told reporters that the ceremony had "crossed several red lines," noting specifically the use of the Darwish poem.
The Bridgegate verdict was handed down on Friday and, to no one's surprise, the jury found two former Chris Christie aides guilty of scheming to close lanes on the George Washington Bridge to punish one of Christie's political rivals. The charges faced by Michael Baroni, a top official at the Port Authority appointed by Christie, and Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, carry a maximum 20-year sentence, though the case's prosecutor said that they will not recommend that they serve that long.
Christie has denied all knowledge of the plan to close the lanes, but over the course of the trial they were repeatedly implicated in the scheme, particularly by David Wildstein, a Port Authority official who pleaded guilty and was the prosecution's most important witness. Christie has one year left in their term as governor of New Jersey, and it seems highly likely that the spotlight will now move to him.
The conviction of Baroni and Kelly is also a reminder that Donald Trump has surrounded themselves with people who could charitably be described as having problems with integrity. Christie was very nearly Trump's vice presidential nominee—it took ousted campaign manager Paul Manafort lying about mechanical problems in Trump's airplane to stop them from being nominated. But Christie's connection to Bridgegate does not seem to bother Trump. Christie is not only leading their transition team, but will be campaigning with Trump this weekend in the key states of New Hampshire and Pennsylvania.
According to the Trump campaign, Chris Christie will be out campaigning in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania on Saturday — Hunter Walker (@hunterw) November 4, 2016
New Jersey takes a lot of (undeserved, it's a great state, fight me) crap, but it just did the country a solid by reminding everyone, in the eleventh hour, that Trump's campaign is full of people like Christie.
UPDATE:
Dane DeHaan will join the cast of the next installment of The Amazing Spider-Man™ along side Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx and Shailene Woodley as Columbia Pictures prepares to begin production on the next chapter of the blockbuster franchise, it was announced today by Doug Belgrad, president of Columbia Pictures, and Hannah Minghella, president of production for the studio.
The screenplay is by Alex Kurtzman & Roberto Orci and Jeff Pinkner based on a previous draft by James Vanderbilt. The film will be directed by Marc Webb and produced by Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach.
The casting of DeHaan as Harry Osborn was confirmed this morning in a tweet by Webb (@MarcW) who wrote "Meet Harry Osborn. So excited to have them on board. @danedehaan."
"Dane is an exciting and extraordinary young actor and they are a fantastic addition to our cast," Webb said.
The new film in the Spider-Man saga is set for release in 3D on May 2, 2014. Production will begin in early 2013 in New York.
Webb, Garfield and Stone previously teamed on this summer's blockbuster The Amazing Spider-Man, which has taken in more than $751 million worldwide.
DeHaan caught moviegoers' attention with their performances in four 2012 releases: Steven Spielberg's Lincoln, opposite Daniel Day-Lewis and Lukas Haas; John Hillcoat's Lawless, alongside Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, and Jason Clarke; Bradley Rust Gray's Jack & Diane, with Juno Temple and Riley Keough; and one of the year's biggest sleeper hits, the adventure thriller Chronicle, directed by Josh Trank. They began their film career with director John Sayles and actor Chris Cooper in Amigo.
DeHaan next stars in Place Beyond the Pines alongside Bradley Cooper and Ryan Gosling. In addition they will star in Atom Egoyan's Devil's Knot, with Reese Witherspoon and Colin Firth, about the fate of the West Memphis Three; and John Krokidas' Kill Your Darlings, with Jack Huston, Daniel Radcliffe, Ben Foster, and Kyra Sedgwick, set in 1944 amidst the Beat Generation.
Mr. DeHaan first came to industry attention with their portrayal of Jesse in the third season of the critically applauded drama series In Treatment, starring alongside Gabriel Byrne. This was followed by a guest arc in the fourth season of the popular horror series True Blood.
In 2010, they received an Obie Award for their performance in Annie Baker's The Aliens, directed by Sam Gold. The Rattlestick Theater production was cited as “Play of the Year” by The New York Times. Mr. DeHaan made their Broadway debut in with American Buffalo, Robert Falls' 2008 staging of the classic David Mamet play.
Director Marc Webb is currently casting for their anticipated sequel to this year's reboot, which begins filming early next year. Shailene Woodley () has been cast as Mary Jane Watson, while Jamie Foxx () is in talks to play the villainous Electro. But the third major role, that of Peter Parker's best friend Harry Osborn, has taken a little longer to fill. Dane DeHaan, Sam Claflin, Brady Corbet, Alden Ehrenreich, Eddie Redmayne, Douglas Booth and Boyd Holbrook have all tested for the role. It was originally reported that Sony were looking at actors to play a "dark and edgy" Osborn, but a later report suggested that "more athletic and good looking" actors were being considered. Now, Webb has taken to their Twitter account to confirm that DeHaan has been cast as Harry in the upcoming film.DeHaan first gained major success earlier this year with the found footage superhero film, before appearing in other movies such asand. As for the rest of the film's cast, Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and Sally Field are set to reprise their respective roles as Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy and Aunt May from the first film. It was recently reported that some filming will be taking place in London, and that production will commence sometime in February.sequel is scheduled to hit theaters May 2nd, 2014.Sony just issued the following press release which also confirms Jamie Foxx's involvement.
The scores shown are the combined scores for Grades 3-8 and 10.
Minnesota students showed little change from last year in the latest round of statewide reading, math and science test results.
Reading proficiency inched up only slightly in the results released Thursday. Math scores overall were down.
And the persistent gap in scores between students of color and white students remains.
• Last year: Achievement gap persists in test scores
State education officials said the widely reported problems in online testing this spring had no effect overall on scores.
The test scores come from the Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments that most students take each spring. The exams measure proficiency in reading, math and science.
This year 59 percent of students overall tested proficient in reading, the same as last year and only 1 percentage point higher than two years ago.
Meanwhile, math proficiency among all students fell 1 percentage point to 62 percent.
The scores shown here are the combined scores for grades 3-8. Bill Wareham | MPR News
Those aren't the results state Education Commissioner Brenda Casselius had hoped for.
"I'm never satisfied unless we see forward progress in math, science, reading," they said.
Of particular concern to Cassellius is the gap in scores between white students and students of color.
Overall, 70 percent of white students in third through eighth grade were proficient in math; 33 percent of black students met math proficiency goals.
That gap has grown slightly in each of the last two years. Results in reading scores tell a similar story.
Cassellius said the data show the state needs to continue to offer professional development for teachers in struggling schools as a way to boost test scores for students of color.
"We want to see all kids go up, but we want to see kids who have been historically underachieving ... go up faster," they said. "That's how you'll see gap closure."
Cassellius is confident that recent investments the state has made in early childhood education, like all-day kindergarten, will begin to pay off with higher MCA scores in coming years.
The state's two largest urban districts saw similarly mixed results.
"We stayed the same in our reading proficiency, we saw a slight decrease in our math proficiency and we saw a slight increase in our science proficiency," said Michelle Walker, chief executive officer for the St. Paul school district.
Walker said the district is beginning to close the achievement gap in some grade levels and at certain schools, but it's not happening fast enough, they said. They said the district will analyze the latest test data and consider adjusting curriculum.
Much like St. Paul, the Minneapolis district saw reading and math scores remain stable overall, with an increase in science scores.
Interim superintendent Michael Goar said there were bigger increases at a few of the district's struggling schools. For example, Jenny Lind Elementary School saw an increase of nearly 6 percentage points in reading scores.
Even with that increase, only 21 percent of the school's students now test proficient in reading. But Goar is confident more increases are on the way for Jenny Lind and the entire district.
"We're optimistic that what we're working on now is making some significant difference," they said. Goar thinks a new district effort to give some Minneapolis schools more freedom to make local budget, curriculum and scheduling decisions will lead to better test scores.
Hanging over this year's MCA scores was the question of whether the scores were valid at all.
Computer glitches caused delays for thousands of students during spring testing. The Department of Education halted testing on two separate days.
Education Commissioner Cassellius said an investigation found those problems did not invalidate the test scores.
"That came back to show that there was no statistical evidence to support that on average there were any impacts to statewide scores," they said.
The idea of the virtuous early bird goes back at least to Aristotle, who wrote, in their Economics, that “Rising before daylight is … to be commended; it is a healthy habit.” Benjamin Franklin, of course, framed the same sentiment in catchier terms: “Early to Bed, and early to rise, makes a Man healthy, wealthy and wise.” More recently, there has been a push for ever earlier work starts, conference calls, and breakfast meetings, and a steady stream of advice to leave Twitter and Facebook to the afternoon and spend the morning getting real things done. And there may be some truth to the idea: a 1998 study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology suggests that we become more passive as the day wears on. You should do the most important thing first, the theory goes, because, well, you won't be able to do it quite as well later on.
In last January's issue of Psychological Science, Maryam Kouchaki and Isaac Smith took that theory even further, proposing what they called the morning morality effect, which posits that people behave better earlier in the day. Their research caught the attention of Sunita Sah, a behavioral scientist at Georgetown University and a professed night owl. For the previous five years, Sah had been studying how different situations influence ethical behavior. “You always hear these sweeping statements: morning is saintly, evening is bad; early to bed, early to rise,” they told me recently. A former physician, they found it plausible that something with such profound health consequences as time of day might also have a moral dimension. But they wondered how strong the effect really was. Were people like her—principled late risers—the exception to the rule? To test the limits of Kouchaki and Smith's findings, Sah and their colleagues began by looking at the underlying biology.
Our sleep patterns are governed by circadian rhythms, our bodies' response to changes in light and dark in a typical day. The rhythms are slightly different for every person, which is why our energy levels ebb and flow in ways that are unique to us. This internal clock determines what is called our chronotype—whether we are morning people, night people, or somewhere in between. Chronotypes are relatively stable, though they have been known to shift with age. Children and older adults generally prefer mornings; adolescents and young adults prefer evenings. Figuring out where you fall is simple: spend a few weeks going to bed when you feel tired and waking up without an alarm clock. A quicker alternative is the Horne-Ostberg questionnaire, which presents various scenarios—a difficult exam, twice-weekly exercise with a friend—and determines your chronotype on the basis of what time of day you'd feel most up to confronting them.
Chronotype, of course, doesn't control wakefulness all on its own. There is also what is known as homeostatic sleep drive. The longer we are awake, irrespective of where we are in our established circadian rhythms, the more fatigue exerts its pressure on us. In morning people, sleep drive and chronotype tend to be aligned. Their internal clocks are pretty well synchronized with their over-all energy levels. For night owls, however, things get complicated. When the sun comes up, the light resets their circadian clocks, telling them to wake up. But, because of their chronotypes, they don't have much energy and they want to go back to sleep. At night, the reverse happens: one system is telling them to sleep and another is telling them to remain awake. About forty per cent of people fall into this latter category.
Sah began their research by assuming that we are different people at different hours. In a series of studies, they and their colleagues Brian Gunia and Christopher Barnes examined whether time of day affected the likelihood that a person would cheat at a game. They selected their participants by chronotype, focussing on those who fell on either side of the Horne-Ostberg scale—those who preferred morning and those who preferred night. In one study, participants recorded how many number matrices they had solved correctly. In another, they noted how they had performed in a die-rolling task. In both cases, they had the opportunity to cheat—they were allowed to score themselves—and a monetary incentive to do so.
Some people did cheat less in the morning, Sah found, but only if they were early birds to begin with. The opposite was also true: night owls cheated less in the evening. Time of day had less effect on honesty, the group concluded, than did the synchronicity between person and environment. “Our results should really dissipate those stereotypes of morning people being more saintly,” Sah says. “The important thing is the match.” Early birds aren't ethically superior. And, to the extent that other research suggests that they are, it may just be that they are luckier: modern society, for the most part, is built around their preferences. We are expected to function well early in the morning. We can't just wake up when our bodies tell us to and work when we feel at our peak.
For Sah, this research is the first part of a broader examination.  They are currently studying whether people who have clear ethical responsibilities in their careers—financial advisers, for instance, or doctors—make decisions with greater clarity when their work schedules and chronotypes align. “We need to think not just about ethical decision-making but the quality of the work and the cognitive processes,” they told me. “It's much better to match people to schedules and structures based on their chronotype than to just force them into a schedule, knowing nothing.” They added, “I probably don't want to set exams at 8 A.M. if I don't want my students to cheat.”
Ultimately, the best policy may be to understand and embrace your chronotype. Sah says that it's incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to overcome your predisposition and train yourself to function better at times that don't match up with your inner clock. “There's very little evidence that anything really works,” they say. So, late risers can take heart: they are neither immoral nor slothful. But, as long as the world isn't operating on their terms, and unless they're lucky enough to work in a place that endorses flexible scheduling, the early birds may still get the worms.
Last year, the Iowa Supreme Court struck down a gay-marriage ban on the grounds that it violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the state constitution. The unanimous decision was written by Justice Mark Cady, a conservative placed on the court by the former Republican governor Terry Branstad. In 2008, the Connecticut Supreme Court struck down a comparable prohibition in an opinion written by Justice Richard Palmer, an appointee of Governor Lowell Weicker, a three-term Republican senator who became an independent. The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling was written by Chief Justice Margaret Marshall, named to the court by one Republican governor (William Weld) and elevated to chief justice by another (Paul Cellucci).
This summer's other major ruling on gay marriage, along with Tauro's, will come from the federal district court in California, where Chief Judge Vaughn Walker will decide whether to overturn the state's Proposition 8, which bans gay marriage. The betting is that they will, which would be notable not only because of their political lineage but because Walker's nomination by Ronald Reagan was thwarted by Democrats -- led by the current House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi -- who believed they were prejudiced against homosexuals. They were mistaken. Reappointed by George H.W. Bush and this time confirmed, Walker demonstrated no prejudice.
The Tauro and Walker rulings are federal decisions, and particularly salient as such. For years, federal courts were considered hostile territory for gay rights advocates, ever since Bowers v. Hardwick, the first of three Supreme Court decisions affecting prospects for gay marriage. The Bowers decision of 1986 upheld states' right to criminalize same-sex intimacy, and did so in a sneering majority opinion -- written by Byron White, a Democratic appointee -- that suggested a distinct contempt for any claims to gay rights.
Two subsequent decisions hinted at a thaw. In 1996, Romer v. Evans derailed an attempt to overturn state and municipal anti-discrimination laws, on which activists had focused after Bowers. In contrast to that decision, the majority opinion in Romer was strikingly respectful; it, too, quoted Harlan's dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson. In 2003, Lawrence v. Texas invalidated state sodomy laws, explicitly overruling Bowers in the process. The Court further held that ''the intimate, adult consensual conduct at issue'' was protected under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Both decisions were written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, another Reagan appointee. If either of this summer's federal decisions get to the Supreme Court, Kennedy will likely cast the deciding vote -- which would, in the end, be most fitting.
What all these judges share is their distinctiveness from Republican appointments over the last two decades, who tend to be activists affiliated with conservative outfits like the Federalist Society -- think John Roberts and Samuel Alito. This makes the Republican pedigrees of the judges moving gay marriage toward legality all the more striking, particularly in how it contrasts with conservative outcries about judicial activism. But more than that, it's a gauge of how far from the mainstream modern conservative jurists have drifted.

A Utah woman admitted in court that they encouraged their husband to shoot a neighbor they claimed had raped them “telepathically.”
Meloney Selleneit, 55, agreed to a reduced charge of guilty, but mentally ill, to criminal solicitation and unlawful weapons possession, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.
The charges stem from a shooting in 2011 in which Selleneit's husband, Michael, shot and wounded their neighbor Tony Pierce.
The Salt Lake Tribune reported that after the alleged shooting, Michael Selleneit said they acted in self-defense because Pierce had been telepathically raping their wife for years and using cocaine to control their mind.
Michael Selleneit was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the shooting.
Their wife is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 31.
Both are being held at a state hospital, until they are found competent to serve their prison sentences, authorities said.

Who would you call if you had a wood-related question? The Forest Products Laboratory, of course. But, did you even know of its existence?
The Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) was created in 1910, and was moved to its current building atop a knoll overlooking the University of Wisconsin Madison Campus in 1932.
The headquarters of the FPL conducts research on all things wood-related. Today the laboratory has 144 employees, but had over 700 at its peak. Their xylarium, or research wood collection, is the largest in the world, with over 103,000 samples. Their herbarium contains one of the largest collections of wood-decay fungi in existence.

FPL, the only federally funded wood utilization research laboratory in the United States, answers to the public as a government resource. Operating under the Forest Service, the laboratory dispenses timely advice on wood through its hotline (number: 608-231-9200).
No question is too difficult or odd for the employees manning the FPL hotline, as long as it can somehow be tied to wood products. While compiling a science fair exhibit on the use of cotton fibers in U.S. Currency, a middle school student contacted FPL looking for such information. They were not just given the standard text-book answer.
Serendipitously for her, researchers there had just completed experiments testing the durability of paper money after multiple washings–essentially, the staff had washed dollars until they degraded. They told the student about their new findings, and they mentioned the new research in their science fair project.

Infestation of mold is a more frequent question, with calls and emails requesting advice on elimination and safety of such spores and fungi. Other callers inquire on the type of lumber that would serve their construction needs. Some even ask advice on the best paint to be used.
Besides answering the public's questions, FPL is a repository of oddities. In their xylarium they have a piece of Leadwood, which is the heaviest and hardest wood in existence, weighing 85 pounds per cubic foot. Another sample, a piece of African Crossfire Mahogany, was the veneer used on the interior of Pontiac automobiles in 1973. It's a beautiful specimen with brown waves rippling through its golden grain, like caramel cascading down a candied apple. Not all artifacts in the library are simply wood samples, and some highlight FPL's contribution to society.

In 2008, Major League Baseball was plagued with a significant problem. Bats seemed to have a propensity to break, leaving a potential for wooden projectiles with every crack of the bat. David Kretschmann, a scientist at FPL, was called upon to solve this problem. Examining the broken bats, footage from games, and the wood used, they deduced that the grain in the maple bats, which producers recently began using, weakened the structure of the bat.
After giving their recommendations, the MLB and producers of the bats were able to remedy this situation. In the wood library, tucked away in a corner, leans the shards of a bat that was part of this important investigation.
During WWII, one of FPLs contributions was the development and creation of shipping crates for the war effort. (Photo: David Jester)
The collection also contains a recreation of the ladder used in the infamous Lindbergh baby kidnapping, which the FPL's Chief Wood Technologist, Arthur Koehler, was asked to analyze during the 1932 manhunt.
When Koehler matched the wood from the ladder with wood shards found in the apartment of the prime suspect, this helped conclusively link the 20-month-old's kidnapper and killer to their crimes.

Today the FPL continues to be on the cutting edge of technologies involving wood products. One process that stands out is the nondestructive evaluation of wood.
When the sarcophagus of Meretites, a noblewoman of Egypt, needed to be examined for rot, FPL took on the job. By sending sound waves through the 2,500-year-old artifact, scientists at FPL were able to identify rotted sections of wood, and advise museum specialists on the best way to preserve these damaged areas.

Weather is naturally an important part of FPL's research. The CARWASh—Chamber for Analytic Research on Wall Assemblies Exposed to Simulated Weather—tests building materials against inclement weather within a steel container.
This chamber is able to perform tests that recreate any weather condition recorded in North America, evaluating new wall assembly designs and the level of moisture within those structures, and aiding in the development of new building construction methods.

FPL also conducts structural tests on wood beams, trusses, and engineered lumber to evaluate their strengths and breaking points. A company from Hollywood, with FPL's assistance, creates compostable television sets made from 50 percent cow manure and wood fiber. These boards are strong enough for a car to drive over, yet when filming is complete, studio hands can pour water over them, and watch them dissolve into a compostable slurry.
Within the walls of FPL, innovative research is conducted on a daily basis for society's benefit. Both their xylarium and herbarium are resources which scientists use to continue their understanding of wood anatomy. And resting in cabinets sit artifacts accrued over a century, waiting to tell a story about our past and the potential future of wood technology.
The debate on whether games can be considered art or not just got a very passionate opinion from Kong: Skull Island Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts.
Speaking with Glixel mainly on the subject of making the Metal Gear movie alongside Hideo Kojima, they confessed their love for video games, to the point of admitting that the aesthetic feeling of gaming somehow bled into the Kong movie.

They also explained that he's always looking for extraordinary experiences like Zelda, Ico, The Last Guardian, obviously Kojima's games and even indie hits like Firewatch, Inside, Journey and Gone Home. Vogt-Roberts has no doubt that games like those are, indeed, art.
I just want to see things that do something new. It's really hard for me to just pick up a Call of Duty or something like that and just play it. I love Arkham Asylum, but it's hard for me to pick up a sequel to something unless I feel like it's really doing something new. Granted, I will always pick up a new Zelda and a new Metroid. I haven't played Breath of the Wild yet because I am still getting my bearings and I need to get a Switch, but there are certain things that are so seminal in my life, and a lot of that old Nintendo stuff falls in that category – Zelda and Metroid in particular. I will always pick those up, but it's hard for me to really give that much time to something if I don't feel like it's evolving the art form in some way. From Ico to Shadow of the Colossus to The Last Guardian, the fact that games like that are able to be event games now, it's amazing to me. I hope those games are able to make a profit and I'd like to think that those companies see the value in flagship entertainment that is pushing their artform forward, but for every success story, you hear a bunch of horror stories about an indie company that got shuttered before their game was released. The fact that it's even a question anymore, when people even raise the idea of whether games are art, I just want to look at them and be like, “Fuck you. Fuck yourself for even questioning.”
We don't have a lot of details on the Metal Gear movie yet, but making justice to Solid Snake and their legacy sounds very important to Kong's Director. We'll let you know once
Deep inside the Sun's interior, the fusion of lighter nuclei into heavier ones causes a tiny amount of mass to be lost, converted into energy via the famous E = mc2. At temperatures of 4,000,000 K or above, all the way up to 15,000,000 K in the Sun's very center, hydrogen and helium isotopes build their way up to more stable elements, releasing energy and providing all the power that washes over every planet in the Solar System. Yet despite these incredible energies, the protons in the Sun's core would never be able to begin this chain reaction if the Universe were completely deterministic. It requires the wave nature of quantum mechanics to make it possible, proving that Einstein's famous statement, that "God does not play dice with the Universe," was false.
In the 1920s, the world of physics was swept by two major revolutions: General Relativity, which put forth spacetime and the fact that matter and energy curved it as the cause of gravitation, and quantum mechanics, which detailed that all the particles in the Universe also acted like waves. Because of some fundamental properties in quantum physics, it was inherently a non-deterministic theory, meaning that you could only talk about probabilities of certain outcomes occurring, rather than knowing what would result from a particular setup. Two of the most important physicists of the time, Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr, had a number of famous (and public) debates over whether the Universe was inherently deterministic or not, with Einstein arguing yes and Bohr arguing no.
All the way up until their death in the 1950s, Einstein refused to believe, as they called it, that "God played dice" with the Universe. There must be some underlying laws, they reasoned, that determined which particles would behave in which particular fashion, and that it was only a failure of our experimental or observational capabilities that prevented us from seeing the real truth of the matter. When quantum physics was first developed in the 1920s, however, there were only two fundamental forces known: gravity and electromagnetism. The nuclear forces were still unknown, which almost meant that the source of the Sun's power — nuclear fusion — was unknown as well. If only Einstein knew about this, they could have realized how mistaken they truly are!
All told, by looking at the power output of the Sun, we measure that it emits a continuous 4 × 1026 Watts, which means that inside the Sun's core, a whopping 4 × 1038 protons fuse into helium-4 every second. If you consider that there are some 1057 particles in the entire Sun, of which a little less than 10% are in the core, this might not sound so far-fetched. After all:
These particles are moving around with tremendous energies: each proton has a speed of around 500 km/s in the center of the Sun's core.
The density is tremendous, and so particle collisions happen extremely frequently: each proton collides with another proton billions of times each second.
And so it would only take a tiny fraction of these proton-proton interactions resulting in fusion into deuterium — about 1-in- 10 28 – to produce the necessary energy of the Sun.
So even though most particles in the Sun don't have enough energy to get us there, it would only take a tiny percentage fusing together to power the Sun as we see it. So we do our calculations, we calculate how the protons in the Sun's core have their energy distributed, and we come up with a number for these proton-proton collisions with sufficient energy to undergo nuclear fusion.
That number is exactly zero. The electric repulsion between the two positively charged particles is too great for even a single pair of protons to overcome it and fuse together with the energies in the Sun's core. This problem only gets worse, mind you, when you consider that the Sun itself is more massive (and hotter in its core) than 95% of the stars in the Universe! In fact, three out of every four stars are M-class red dwarf stars, which achieve less than half of the Sun's maximum core temperature.
Only 5% of the stars produced get as hot or hotter than our Sun does in its interior. And yet, nuclear fusion happens, the Sun and all the stars emit these tremendous amounts of power, and somehow, hydrogen gets converted into helium. The secret is that, at a fundamental level, these atomic nuclei don't behave as particles alone, but rather as waves, too. Each proton is a quantum particle, containing a probability function that describes its location, enabling the two wavefunctions of interacting particles to overlap ever so slightly, even when the repulsive electric force would otherwise keep them entirely apart.
There's always a chance that these particles can undergo quantum tunneling, and wind up in a more stable bound state (e.g., deuterium) that causes the release of this fusion energy, and allows the chain reaction to proceed. Even though the probability of quantum tunneling is very small for any particular proton-proton interaction, somewhere on the order of 1-in-1028, or the same as your odds of winning the Powerball lottery three times in a row, that ultra-rare interaction is enough to explain the entirety of where the Sun's energy (and almost every star's energy) comes from.
If it weren't for the quantum nature of every particle in the Universe, and the fact that their positions are described by wavefunctions with an inherent quantum uncertainty to their position, this overlap that enables nuclear fusion to occur would never have happened. The overwhelming majority of today's stars in the Universe would never have ignited, including our own. Rather than a world and a sky alight with the nuclear fires burning across the cosmos, our Universe would be desolate and frozen, with the vast majority of stars and solar systems unlit by anything other than a cold, rare, distant starlight.
It's the power of quantum mechanics that allows the Sun to shine. In a fundamental way, if God didn't play dice with the Universe, the nuclear flame that powers the stars would never light, and the life-giving fusion that occurs in our Sun's core would never come to be. Yet with this randomness, we win the cosmic lottery all the time, to the continuous tune of hundreds of Yottawatts of power. Thanks to the fundamental quantum uncertainty inherent in the Universe, we've achieved a chance at existence. Fiat lux.
After a push earlier in the week that broke the Islamic State group's defences around the city centre, government forces were slowed by snipers, booby traps, roadside bombs and suicide attackers (AFP Photo/)
Baghdad (AFP) - Die-hard jihadists made a desperate last stand late Saturday in Ramadi's former government complex, the main remaining target of Iraqi forces reconquering the city they lost in May.
After a push on Tuesday that broke the Islamic State group's defences around the city centre, government forces were slowed by snipers, booby traps, roadside bombs and suicide attackers.
Initial hopes of a quick victory faded, but Iraq's elite counter-terrorism service (CTS) and the army have advanced steadily through the devastated capital of Anbar province.
They reached a key intersection in the Hoz neighbourhood, home to the government complex, whose seizure would go a long way towards ensuring a full recapture of Ramadi.
"CTS has cleared Hoz neighbourhood in central Ramadi completely and arrived near the government complex," spokesperson Sabah al-Numan told AFP.
Iraq's war media cell, which speaks on behalf of the interior and defence ministries as well as the paramilitary groups fighting IS, said the jihadists' use of improvised explosive devices had forced a shift in strategy.
"The plan was to enter Hoz from Dhubbat but because of the mines, CTS changed tack and came in from the river bank," a statement said.
The latest fighting left at least two members of the security forces dead and nine wounded, according to police Captain Ahmed al-Dulaimi.
At least three were killed on Friday, according to several senior officers and local officials.
The figures they provide for IS casualties are high, with at least 23 killed on Friday alone.
The number of IS fighters hunkered down in central Ramadi was estimated at the start of the operation five days ago at no more than 400.
- Boost for military -
"You have the 8th Iraqi Army and CTS... and they're all pushing forward," said Colonel Steve Warren, spokesperson for the US-led coalition supporting Iraqi forces in Ramadi with daily air strikes.
"CTS have made more progress; they're several hundred metres (yards) closer to the government complex," Warren said.
The government forces' advance has also been hampered by the possible presence of families trapped in the combat zone and used by IS as human shields.
Officials said Friday dozens of families were thought to still be in combat areas.
Civilians who escaped said after being taken by the army to camps east of Ramadi that there was little food for those left behind.
One of them said they and their family were rescued after retreating IS fighters used them as human shields to leave the city.
"More than 250 families residing in Ramadi have been able to get out of the city since the beginning of military operations" Tuesday, said Ali Dawood, an official from the neighbouring Khaldiya district.
They said some of them were in camps with other displaced people in Anbar while others headed to Baghdad or the northern autonomous Kurdish region.
According to the International Organization for Migration, Anbaris account for over a third of the 3.2 million Iraqis who have been forced from their homes since January 2014.
Government forces held off months of IS assaults in Ramadi until May 2015, when the jihadists blitzed their opponents with massive suicide car bombs and seized full control of the city.
That defeat was Baghdad's worst in the war against IS, and a victory now would provide a welcome boost to the much-criticised federal forces.
Elsewhere Iraqi Kurdish forces carried out a commando operation near Hawijah in which several senior members of the Islamic State group were captured or killed, local and security sources said Saturday.
The operation involved helicopters and bore similarities with a joint raid elite Kurdish troops conducted in October with US special forces also near Hawijah, the sources said.
Local Iraqi security officials said the raid took place overnight in the town of Riyadh, southeast of IS-held Hawijah and southwest of Kurdish-controlled Kirkuk.
Rokan Mekhlef Jassem, a police captain from Hawijah, said nine IS members were detained and 12 killed, but no confirmation was immediately available from the government of the autonomous Kurdish region.
You probably love or hate these. We are not referring to Donald Trump or Star Wars, though we suppose it applies there, too.
We are referencing the practice of bastardizing team logos with cultural icons, hot topics or some other theme. This summer we found Bills and NFL logos with a Canadian touch.
The latest from UPROXX and NFL.com mix in Donald Trump and Star Wars.
Of course Trump has some ties to the Bills, as they were on the periphery of the ownership search in 2014. They eventually tweeted, "Even though I refused to pay a ridiculous price for the Buffalo Bills, I would have produced a winner. Now that won't happen."
We will never know if they would have produced a winner this season, although Rex Ryan does seem to be their kind of guy and you wonder what would have been different.
In the meantime, we have the UPROXX logo to ponder. We will say it is not as sharp as the Packers and Steelers ones.
Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz on Thursday lifted a hold they placed on bipartisan legislation to address the water crisis in Flint, Mich., where lead-contaminated pipes have resulted in an ongoing public health emergency.
Senators had reached a tentative deal a day earlier for a $220 million package to fix and replace the city's lead-contaminated pipes, make other infrastructure improvements and bolster lead-prevention programs nationwide.
Cruz and at least one other GOP senator objected to a quick vote on the deal, delaying Senate consideration of the bill until at least next week.
A spokesperson for the Texas senator, Phil Novack, said Thursday night that Cruz had reviewed the bill and will not prevent it from moving forward in the Senate.
There was no word on whether other holds on the legislation had been removed. Earlier Thursday, Kristina Baum, a spokesperson for Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said there were "a few holds" on the bill. Inhofe chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and was a main architect of the Flint deal.
Baum declined to identify senators who were objecting to the bill, but said Inhofe and other senators were "genuinely trying to work through their concerns."
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairperson of the Senate Energy Committee, said they were optimistic lawmakers could next week resolve the dispute and take up both the Flint bill and a larger energy package it is tied to.
Novack declined to specify the nature of Cruz's concern, but many Republican senators have said it's too early to provide funds for Flint without specific plans from state and local officials. Some Republicans also question whether Flint is analogous to natural disasters such as floods or hurricanes, because the crisis was the result of a political decision.
Flint's drinking water became tainted when the city switched from the Detroit water system and began drawing from the Flint River in 2014 to save money. The impoverished city was under state control at the time.
Regulators failed to ensure the water was treated properly and lead from aging pipes leached into the water supply.
Elevated levels of lead have been found in some children's blood. Lead contamination has been linked to learning disabilities and other problems.
The crisis in Flint has become an issue in the presidential campaign. Campaigning in Flint on Thursday, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said they hope people will look at the city's water crisis and say, "Never again."

Hillary Clinton said there are a "lot of Flints" and that they want to help them. Flint is a majority black city, and Clinton questioned whether a similar crisis would have occurred in a "white, affluent suburb of Detroit."
The legislative impasse over Flint has blocked a bipartisan energy bill that had been moving forward in the Senate. Under the tentative agreement, the Senate would vote on the energy bill before taking up the Flint legislation as a separate bill.
Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., said the plan provides $100 million for subsidized loans and grants to any state that declares an emergency due to a public health threat from lead or other contaminants in its public drinking water supply.
"Certainly Flint is an extreme example right now, but there are problems all over the country" with lead in aging pipes, Peters said. "We've got a widespread national problem and there should be resources to help every state in the union."
Peters and other supporters said the deal would use federal credit subsidies to provide incentives for up to $700 million in loan guarantees and other financing for water infrastructure projects nationwide.
The bill would be paid for by redirecting up to $250 million from an Energy Department loan program approved in the 2009 economic stimulus law.
In comments issued after Cruz's hold became known, Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, the nation's largest environmental organization, said: "Ted Cruz only cares about one thing — and that's Ted Cruz. It's clear that he'll do anything to promote their own political aspirations without any regard for what's right for Flint and communities like Flint across the country."

Story highlights The work could take up to two weeks
The exhumation of the body of Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat begins
The inquiry was launched after Arafat's widow, Suha Arafat, lodged a formal complaint
This comes after French authorities opened a murder inquiry into their death
Work began Tuesday to exhume the body of Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat amid an investigation of their 2004 death.
The exhumation process, which started with the removal of the mausoleum's glass and its marble tombstone, could take up to two weeks due to the delicate work that needs to be done by hand, a Palestinian source said.
The exhumation comes after French authorities opened a murder inquiry into their death this year after high levels of a radioactive substance were found on some of their personal belongings.
The inquiry was launched after Arafat's widow, Suha Arafat, lodged a formal legal complaint for murder.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas subsequently approved the exhumation of Arafat's body from their mausoleum, which is in the Palestinian presidential compound in the West Bank city of Ramallah.

A CNN crew at the scene saw a huge tarp surrounding the mausoleum and said workers were starting to remove the tombstone.
Arafat died at age 75 at a Paris military hospital after they suffered a brain hemorrhage and slipped into a coma. In the days before their death, Palestinian officials said that they had a blood disorder -- though they ruled out leukemia -- and digestive problems.
Rumors of poisoning circulated at the time, but Palestinian officials denied them, and then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Nabil Sha'ath said they "totally" ruled them out.
But a Swiss doctor has said that investigators had found high levels of toxic polonium-210 on some of Arafat's belongings.
Francois Bochud, director of the Institut de Radiophysique in Lausanne, Switzerland, said their researchers had tested Arafat's toothbrush, clothing and keffiyeh, the distinctive black-and-white headscarf they often wore.
A body fluid stain contained 180 megabecquerels per liter of the radioactive isotope, while a typical sample would contain 5 megabecquerels per liter, Bochud said. A becquerel is a unit of measurement of radioactivity.
The fabric of Arafat's clothing, without body fluid, contained less than 10 megabecquerels per liter, Bochud said.
Suha Arafat told CNN they wanted their husband's body exhumed so investigators could be "100% sure" of the presence of polonium.
While BP says the decision to ends its Tate sponsorship is unrelated to climate protests, museum industry insiders say campaigners are having an effect as they turn the spotlight on the ethics of corporate funding
BP's decision to pull the plug on their sponsorship of the Tate is a milestone in the campaign to make fossil fuels a toxic brand, and not the first.
Last November, the Science Museum announced that it would not renew an agreement with Shell, after revelations that the firm had tried to influence its presentation on climate change.
Corporate sponsors have become more important for museums and arts institutes since the economic crisis began cutting off public funding sources.
Some £410m a year of museum funding now comes from wealthy patrons, with the Tate gallery group alone taking a £180m slice of that pie in the UK.
Sources in the museum industry say that this can pose an ethical dilemma, especially when it is augmented by the more practical problem of ‘brownwash'. Fossil fuel firms may hope to gain an image boost from associating with the arts scene but this can all too easily come with a nosedive in reputation for the arts institutions themselves.
BP to end Tate sponsorship after 26 years Read more
“The protests have gradually had a grinding-down effect on the Tate,” one source in the museums industry said. “The campaign was targeting the kinds of people who go to the museum – so-called ‘special audiences' - and I would imagine that these protests will have got to them and thrown doubt into their minds.”
A fossil fuels-arts world divorce was “the way the world is moving,” the source said.
Although the decision to end the Tate's sponsorship arrangement was reportedly taken by BP because of an “extremely challenging business environment”, campaigners and arts industry sources believe it was also influenced by war-weariness at the Tate.
BP's donations to the gallery were “embarrassingly small” – no more than £224,000 a year on average – and the Tate group may have felt that they no longer offset the baggage that came in tow. If so, the writing could be on the wall of other well-known tourist attractions.
Campaigners say that most big cultural institutions in London now take funding from fossil fuel firms and three big names – the British Museum, Royal Opera House and National Portrait Gallery – will be deciding whether to renew contracts with Shell and BP in the year ahead.
In 2011, BP agreed to give these three institutions – and the Tate - £10m over five years. Anna Galkina, a campaigner with Platform London, said that the next protests would target the British Museum.
They told the Guardian: “There will be all sort of interventions there, and the campaign on the other two institutions will definitely ramp up too, now that we know that it is winnable.”
The Liberate Tate campaign is a model for these pushes, and was born out of a workshop that the arts activist John Jordan gave at the Tate called ‘Disobedience makes history' in 2009. Folklore has it that they were told they could speak about anything except actions against the Tate's sponsorship arrangements – and so turned the workshop into a discussion of whether to confront the Tate.
“There is always a turning point when a certain form of culture is seen as toxic and unacceptable,” Jordan told the Guardian. “At some point in the early 19th century the slave trade was no longer perceived as business as usual but a violent inhuman practice. Our cultural perception of the fossil fuel industry is now at a similar turning point - and not a minute too soon!”
Hundreds of protesters were led away from the steps of the United States Capitol on Monday, hands secured behind their backs with white plastic zip ties after they refused to stop their demonstration against the carried-interest tax loophole, which lets wealthy hedge fund managers pay lower tax rates on much of their income. While efforts to close the loophole have stalled in Congress, advocacy groups are now pressing legislators in seven states to end the same tax preference in their local tax codes — a move that would bring in nearly $7.5 billion a year in fresh tax revenue.
Proponents of the reform argue that state tax codes should not allow hedge fund managers and private equity executives to classify the “carried interest” earnings they make off of clients' investments as capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates. They say those earnings should instead be taxed as regular income.
The trouble for those advocates, however, is that — just as in Washington, D.C. — the finance and investment industry in those states is a major campaign contributor. According to state data compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics and reviewed by International Business Times, financial interests have flooded state politician campaign coffers with $158 million since 2010, including more than $24 million to the current governors of those states. That gubernatorial cash haul includes nearly $14 million from 10 of the highest-earning hedge fund managers.
The reform fight formally began in March when Democratic assemblymen in New York introduced a bill to end the tax loophole in Wall Street's home state. According to the labor-backed group Hedge Clippers, forcing hedge fund managers and private equity executives to pay the same tax rate as everyone else would generate $3.7 billion a year in revenue in New York. To prevent Wall Street moguls from simply relocating to a neighboring state to avoid the higher tax rates, the legislation is contingent on Connecticut and New Jersey passing a similar measure.
But all roads for legislation lead through governors' offices. In Connecticut, that office is controlled by Democrat Dannel Malloy, whose state party has benefited from big contributions from the hedge fund industry and who now runs the Democratic Governors Association, which has in 2016 received $250,000 from the founder and former managing member of a major hedge fund, Farallon Capital. In New Jersey, the governor is Chris Christie, whose presidential campaign received seven-figure donations from hedge fund manager Steven Cohen and who served as chairperson of the Republican Governors Association as it raised millions from other hedge fund managers.
In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has forged a particularly close relationship with Wall Street, receiving nearly $8 million in donations from the financial industry during their career. That includes $310,000 from some of the biggest hedge fund managers. Most recently, the Democratic governor appeared at a fundraiser in wealthy East Hampton with hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb — who has been among the biggest beneficiaries of the carried-interest loophole. Ahead of a possible run for a third term, Cuomo is raising more cash from the hedge fund industry, according to Politico's Capital New York.
Illinois is facing major budget problems, some of which could be alleviated with the estimated $433 million in new annual revenue that could be generated if hedge fund managers there are forced to pay regular tax rates. But that state's government is now run by Bruce Rauner — who made their fortune in the private equity industry, which also benefits from the carried-interest tax loophole. Rauner — who maintains an ownership stake in a private equity firm — won election to the governor's office in 2014 with the help of $13.5 million in campaign donations from Kenneth Griffin, one of the wealthiest hedge fund managers in the world.
Meanwhile, in Massachusetts — which could generate almost $1 billion a year in new revenue by closing the loophole — the governor's office is occupied by Republican Charlie Baker, a former venture capital industry executive, whose campaign was boosted by the hedge fund-backed RGA.
Proponents of closing the carried-interest loophole say they recognize the political power of their opponents and expect their legislative initiatives to generate significant resistance, but they say they are confident their efforts will end up reforming state laws.
“In an era of populist outrage over a rigged economy, hedge funds are finding it harder to justify their existence; their standard playbook of greed and reckless behavior has lost legitimacy,” said Michael Kink, executive director of the New York-based Strong Economy for All Coalition, which is pushing the legislation. “Closure of the carried-interest loophole is widely seen as commonsense reform that advances basic fairness for taxpayers and for the economy."
CORRECTION: This article has been corrected to reflect that $250,000 was given to the DGA by Farallon Capital's founder and former managing partner, not by the firm itself.
The New Zealand government recorded a surplus in the first eight months of the year, compared to the Treasury's forecast for a deficit, mainly driven by higher-than-expected tax revenue.
The operating balance before gains and losses (Obegal) was a surplus of $398 million for the eight months ended Feb. 29, compared to a forecast deficit of $332 million, the government's financial statements show.
Core Crown revenue of $48.1 billion was $606 million more than expected, and included core tax revenue of $44.68 billion, or $828 million more than forecast, offset by lower-than-forecast interest income. Core Crown expenses of $48.4 billion were $113 million more than expected.
The operating balance including gains and losses was a deficit of $5.1 billion, or $4.6 billion greater than expected, mainly reflecting higher-than-expected actuarial losses on ACC claims liability and losses on financial instruments because of unfavourable market movements, the Treasury said.
Finance Minister Bill English is scheduled to release their eighth budget since the election of the National Party-led government in 2008 on May 26. In the December Budget Policy Statement, the Treasury projected an obegal-deficit of $400 million in the year ending June 30, having previously forecast a surplus of $200 million, with a return to surplus in 2017, mainly because of a slower than expected growth in the tax take. In their speech to open the 2016 parliament, Prime Minister John Key said lower economic growth forecasts would reduce anticipated tax revenues by $17 billion over five years.
In the first eight months, net debt was lower than forecast at $62.4 billion, or 25.3 percent of gross domestic product. The Crown's total assets were valued at $275.3 billion as at Feb. 29, while liabilities stood at $188.3 billion.

The NHL's salary cap for the 2015-16 season is expected to be around $71 million, a five percent increase over this season, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said.
Bettman said that amount could change slightly, depending on the fluctuations of the Canadian dollar.
The salary cap for the 2014-15 season was $69 million, after the league had a record-high in revenues.
Bettman answered questions between the first and second periods of Game 3 of the Western Conference finals between the Anaheim Ducks and the Chicago Blackhawks on Thursday.
Bettman also discussed the league's concussions issues, more than three months after the death of former defenseman Steve Montador.
Montador was found dead in their home in February and was found to have suffered from chronic traumatic encephelopathy, (CTE), a degenerative brain disease that has been linked to repeated head trauma.
More than 70 named former players have sued the NHL, claiming the league did not do enough to protect them from head injuries, failed to properly warn players of risks of brain trauma, and consistently promoted violent play.
The players also want Bettman to testify in the class-action concussion lawsuit, with a judge ruling earlier this month that Bettman possesses “unique or special knowledge relevant to this lawsuit."
• HAMILTON: Ducks show resiliency in Game 3 win over Blackhawks
“From a medical and scientific standpoint, there is no evidence yet that one leads to the other,” Bettman said.
Chris Nowinski, the co-founder of the Boston-based Sports Legacy Institute, which leads research on traumatic brain injuries in athletes, disagreed with Bettman's remarks.
''If `necessarily' means `always,' fine. If not, then `no evidence' is untrue,” Nowinski said on Twitter. “We have `some' pretty good evidence.”

Trent Richardson arrived in the NFL with great pedigree, a two-time national champion drafted out of Alabama in 2012 as the third overall pick. They were the highest-selected running back since Reggie Bush six years earlier, and signed a fully guaranteed four-year, $20.4 million contract, which included a $13.3 million signing bonus. Even a year later, when they were traded to the Colts for a first-round pick, their stock was still high. The overwhelming sentiment was that the Colts had clearly won that trade.
Richardson, of course, lasted two seasons in Indianapolis. They wound up in Oakland last season, and was picked up by the Ravens this offseason, only to be cut earlier this month. Now an NFL career that began with so much promise appears to be, at best, hanging on by a thread.
Human ATM
Richardson was the focus of a recent segment on ESPN's E:60 that caught my attention and brought back a lot of memories, especially from the chapter of my life as an agent. Richardson discussed the financial pressures from friends, assorted family members and hangers-on—pressures that took their focus away from where it should have been. They detailed 10 people living in their house and losing approximately $1.6 million of their money in a 10-month stretch between January and October 2015 (when continued football earnings were far from secure); they were faced with requests to pay rents, car payments, and even to prevent a house from being repossessed.

This kind of stories—in recent years, players such as former Raiders' top pick Phillip Buchanon and Cowboys' tackle Tyron Smith come to mind—often draw skeptical reactions from the public; people wonder why a player cannot control spending money on those around him. And while there is certainly more Richardson could have done to stem the flow, I empathize having seen these situations firsthand as both an agent and a team executive.
The Herd
One of the more common misconceptions about player management is that an agent (or team executive) only deals with the player. Agents appreciate dealing with a player who only has a wife/girlfriend/parent involved in their business; those cases, however, are exceptions. Most often, an agent must deal with what I call “the herd” when taking on a player, which can include (but is not limited to) parents, siblings, cousins, advisors, friends, wives, girlfriends, and wives and girlfriends.
While it is hopeful to think that their intentions are always in the best interest of the player, they are often in the best interests of themselves. And if the player does not support family or friends, financially and emotionally, they are often seen as turning their back on their past. I have seen it many times: people around the player can have a financial and emotional strain that can affect on-field performance.
“He's family”
As an agent, I once represented a player who had a much older half-brother who was a smooth talker with big plans to represent musical artists and build a record company using, of course, my client's money. However, besides being an engaging salesperson, they had addiction issues. The brother had asked my client (and me) for relatively small amounts of money—usually $2,500 to $5,000—that, even with my skeptical counsel, my client willingly gave to him. This led to the big “ask” when they approached my client with the record company idea and requested $100,000.
I stepped in immediately to say no and my client did the same, to which the brother backed down, but only for a while. They were soon back, finally wearing down my client who agreed to write the check. I was livid. Not knowing to whom I could vent, I wrote a letter to my file expressing my opposition, a letter I still have. My client just threw up their hands and said two words to shut me up: “He's family.” (The record company never materialized.)
“What do you do?”
I also had a difficult experience dealing with a herd member—a player's friend from childhood—when I was with the Packers' front office.
We had a young player with great potential who had moved up to Green Bay with their close friend. Although the player was constantly getting into some scrapes with the law, there was always a pattern: the friend, not our player, was the instigator.
I first tried working through the player's agent, who knew of the situation but had no success in having the player separate from their longtime friend; the player was adamant about not turning their back on him. The one time I mentioned it to the player, they simply responded, “He's my guy. And there's no black people living up here.” Once it finally reached the point where coaches and players were questioning the friend's influence, I decided to step in, with the agent's blessing.
I approached the friend in the reception area after the game, brought them to my office and asked directly: “It's great that you are here for our player, but what exactly do you do?
“Excuse me?” the friend said.
“What do you do all day?”
“Make sure my guy's s--- is right.”
“What does that mean?”
“You know, pick up things for him, get the car washed, that stuff.”
“OK. And you guys go out a lot, right?”
“We hang out, yeah.”
“Here's the problem,” I said. “We have big plans for him, but they can't live the same schedule that you do. They need to rest and recover.”
“We only hang out, say, three or four nights a week.”
“That's too many. How about one?”
“Hmm. Two or three?”
“One.”
The player slowly gravitated more to teammates and, halfway through their second year in the league, the friend left Green Bay for good. Not surprisingly, the player's performance greatly improved.
I share these personal experiences not to absolve Richardson of being a major disappointment on the field, but to expose more pressures on players than what meets the public eye. Family and friends draining players' financial (and emotional) resources can be wearing. And while we would like to think that players should be able to compartmentalize and not let it affect their performance, it is often not that easy.
Richardson's situation is a cautionary tale for many athletes. Though it sounds easy, it is actually hard—but necessary—to just say no, even to family.
Five Thoughts About the NFL's Ultimatum
Clay Matthews, Julius Peppers, James Harrison and Mike Neal have been threatened with indefinite suspensions if they fail to cooperate with the league's investigation over PED allegations made in the Al-Jazeera report that also implicated Peyton Manning, who met with the NFL and was cleared of any wrongdoing.
The deadline for speaking with league investigators has been set for Aug. 25.
1) Just as Deflategate moved way past being about deflated footballs, this is about more than alleged PED use (which, by the way, the league has a system in place to test players for). Emboldened by two Circuit Court of Appeals rulings regarding Tom Brady and Adrian Peterson, the NFL now seems to move a PED allegation—with established CBA discipline—into the player conduct realm, the Conduct Commissioner's cherished space.
2) The NFL doesn't react well to hearing the word no—especially from the NFLPA. The union provided what the NFL called “cursory statements” and then stonewalled the league's inquiry. The NFL also appears to be saying to the NFLPA that they will determine guilt or innocence, not vice versa.
3) There were reports that the players would speak to investigators earlier this summer; the reports were either wrong or the players changed their minds. It could also mean that the players and/or their agents want to talk but the union—in the interests of establishing precedent for all players—does not want to let them. We saw this internal battle between agent and union last year regarding Tom Brady's strategy in the investigative process.
4) Once again, we are back to where we started: the CBA-endorsed commissioner power over player conduct, a domain that seems to have gotten stronger, not weaker, after years of NFLPA litigation. The owners are now in prime negotiating position to leverage even more gains in the next CBA should the players decide to make this an issue (which they shouldn't).
5) As I say often, we have a 10-year labor agreement, but we have never had labor peace. NFL and NFLPA leadership not only don't trust each other, they also don't appear to like each other. One can only wonder if the NFL and NFLPA would fight each other so hard on everything if there were some kinds of relationship between Roger Goodell and DeMaurice Smith. They certainly don't need to be friends; they just need to not be such bitter enemies.

So it starts. After the back series orders for the strongest new fall series, the networks are starting to address the bubble first-year student shows. First off, ABC's Notorious, whose 13-episode order has been trimmed to 10.
This is not an outright cancellation as Notorious will remain on the air, and the network plans to air all 10 produced episodes. But, following a slow ratings start and mostly negative reviews, this is not a good sign for the new drama. Virtually no series whose initial order has been reduced has lived to see a second-season renewal.
While aided by respectable time-shifted viewing bumps, Notorious has been the weakest link in ABC's semi-TGIT lineup, squandering a large portion of its sizable Grey's Anatomy lead-in. After a soft debut with a 1.1 in adults 18-49 (Live+same day), Notorious has stayed in the 0.8-0.9 rating range for the past 3 weeks, also pushing down How To Get Away with Murder at 10 PM.
For the most recent week of Live+7 data, Notorious added a +0.7 demo rating point, or +88% to go from a 0.8 (L+SD) to a 1.5 in 18-49. That was a solid percentage increase off a small base. For comparison, the other two ABC Thursday dramas went up to a 3.7 (Grey's, +76%) and 2.4 (HTGAWM, +118%).
Notorious, from Sony TV and ABC Studios, is inspired by the true-life stories of famed criminal defense attorney Mark Geragos and cable news producer Wendy Walker, who serve as executive produced the series. Written by Josh Berman and Allie Hagan and starring Piper Perabo and Daniel Sunjata, the show is a provocative look at the dangerous interplay of criminal law and the media.
President Donald Trump told world leaders the U.S. would no longer be 'taken advantage of' as they blasted trade deals that they say caused millions of jobs to vanish.
In a speech where they also called for collective action against 'Rocket man' Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Trump saluted the United States for having prevailed in World War II only to build 'institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.'
But the president wasn't so sanguine about the international trade regime also put in place after the second world war. They blasted 'mammoth, multinational trade deals' and 'unaccountable international tribunals' that govern them.
'The United States will forever be a great friend to the world and especially to its allies,' the president said.

'But we can no longer be taken advantage of or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets nothing in return.'
'As long as I hold this office,' Trump vowed: 'I will defend America's interests above all else, but in fulfilling our obligations to our nations, we also realize that it's in everyone's interests to seek the future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure.'
Trump included the famous 'America First' phrase in their speech. It is one they used during the campaign, despite its negative association with nationalist movements earlier in the nation's history.
'As president of the United States, I will always put America first. Just like you, as the leaders of your countries, will always and should always put your countries first,' Trump said, earning some applause from some audience members at the 193-nation gathering.

To reinforce the point, Trump tweeted after their speech: 'As President of the United States of America, I will ALWAYS put #AmericaFirst #UNGA,' the abbreviation for the UN General Assembly.
Trump's concerns about the bad trade deals in place didn't keep them from touting the U.S. economy under the status quo, with NAFTA and other trade deals still in place.
'The United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8,' Trumps said.
'In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty',' the president said. 'Our government's first duty is to its people, to our citizens, to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights, and to defend their values.'

Trump blasted 'mammoth, multinational trade deals' of the kind the U.S. negotiated in past decades
Trump blasted those who would trade with North Korea, following a tightening of sanctions thanks to a UN Security Council resolution.
'In America, we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of goodwill, but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal,' Trump said.
'For too long the American people were told that mammoth, multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals, and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success,' Trump said.
'But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared. Others gamed the system and broke the rules, and our great middle class, once the bedrock of American prosperity, was forgotten and left behind, but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten again,' they said.
