An awful lot of press attention has been focused on “Innocence of Muslims,” the anti-Islamic film at the center of this week's turmoil in the Middle East. In the latest twist in the story, Google, which owns YouTube, has blocked access to the video in both Egypt and Libya.
But there are a couple of good reasons that we probably shouldn't get too consumed by the video itself or the backstory behind its creators. Shadi Hamid provides the first reason:
The anti-Islam film in question was a pretext much more than the cause of yesterday's violence. It could have been anything. Anti-American anger, even in Libya, the most pro-American country in the Arab world, remains palpable, lingering underneath the surface of apparent gratitude. But, that aside, even if the United States did everything on Arabs' wish lists, there would remain a small, influential fringe that would find another reason to hate — or at least dislike and distrust — the United States.
The extremist groups who are behind the kind of violence we saw this week will always be able to find some pretext for their actions, and the exact nature of the pretext is no more important than the exact nature of a lightning strike that starts a forest fire. As long as there's enough dry tinder around, you'll get a fire eventually. Likewise, it's the underlying hatred of the United States that provides the real fuel for anti-American violence in the Middle East, and the reason for that hatred is much more about past and present American policies than it is about some shoddily-produced YouTube video. In that sense, getting hung up on the video just distracts us from the real — and much more difficult — issues at hand.
Robert Wright provides us with the second reason, which is even more compelling: even as a pretext, the video probably wasn't the inspiration for the violence anyway.
Here is what now seems to be the case: the anti-Islam film wasn't made by an Israeli-American, wasn't funded by Jews, and probably had nothing to do with the American deaths [in Libya], which seem to have resulted from a long-planned attack by a specific terrorist group, not spontaneous mob violence. ….And there may be one more misconception: the idea that the Egyptian protests were originally spontaneous. El Amrani reports that “the initial Egyptian protests were in good part due to a call by a small Salafi group… and timed for the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.”
To recap: In Libya, the video probably had nothing at all to do with the attacks. In Egypt, it was probably little more than a convenient way to add some extra energy to a 9/11 protest that had been planned long before. This had the intended effect, of course, and now the video really is at the center of the ongoing protests. But it's still just a pretext. In and of itself, it's probably not worth all the ink that's been spilled on it.
The results of the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 may have looked different had Russia's participant not been barred entry by the host: Ukraine. Member countries of the European Broadcasting Union may apply to send a single representative to participate in the event, each performing one song of no more than three minutes. The most popular song is determined by voting of the viewers and the jury, which is composed of representatives of the participating countries.
Russia is the most successful country in the history of the contest based on its share of prize-winning appearances—i.e. the number of times a country finished first, second, or third as a share of appearances in the Grand Final—reaching the Grand Final in 8 of its 20 attempts.
Russia participated in the Eurovision Grand Final every year since its first appearance in 1994 excluding 1996, 1998, and 1999.
Only Ireland has managed a similar level of success in the Grand Final, claiming the highest share of wins. In the 2017 event, Ireland failed to qualify for the Grand Final and has in fact not appeared in the top 3 since 1997.
While Russia and Ireland missed their chances for the top prize, other countries have never experienced the glory.
Following the initial announcement, the Ubuntu emulator is going to become a primary Engineering platform for development.
Quoting Alexander Sack, when ready, the goal is to
[...] start using the emulator for everything you usually would do on the phone. We really want to make the emulator a class A engineering platform for everyone
While the final emulator is still work in progress, we're continually seeing the improvements in finishing all the pieces to make it a first-class citizen for development, both for the platform itself and for app developers. However, as it stands today, the emulator is already functional, so I've decided to prepare a quickstart guide to highlight the great work the Foundations and Phonedations teams (along with many other contributors) are producing to make it possible. While you should consider this as guide as a preview, you can already use it to start getting familiar with the emulator for testing, platform development and writing apps.
Requirements
To install and run the Ubuntu emulator, you will need:
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or later (see installation notes for older versions)
512MB of RAM dedicated to the emulator
4GB of disk space
OpenGL-capable desktop drivers (most graphics drivers/cards are)
Installing the emulator
The installation is as easy as opening a terminal, pressing Ctrl + Alt + T and running these commands, followed by Enter:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa && sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ubuntu-emulator
Alternatively, if you are running an older stable release such as Ubuntu 12.04, you can install the emulator by manually downloading its packages first.
Installation notes
Downloaded images are cached at ~/.cache/ubuntuimages –using the standard XDG_CACHE_DIR location.
–using the standard location. Instances are stored at ~/.local/share/ubuntu-emulator –using the standard XDG_DATA_DIR location.
–using the standard location. While an image upgrade feature is in the works, for now you can simply create an instance of a newer image over the previous one.
Running the emulator
The ubuntu-emulator tool makes it again really easy to manage instances and run the emulator. Typically, you'll be opening a terminal and running these commands the first time you create an instance (where myinstance is the name you've chosen for it):
sudo ubuntu-emulator create myinstance --arch=i386 ubuntu-emulator run myinstance
You can create any instances you need for different purposes. And once the instance has been created, you'll be generally using the ubuntu-emulator run myinstance command to start an emulator session based on that instance. Notice how in the command above the --arch parameter was specified to override the default architecture (armhf). Using the i386 arch will make the emulator run at a (much faster) native speed. Other parameters you might want to experiment with are also: --scale=0.7 and --memory=720 . In these examples, we're scaling down the UI to be 70% of the original size (useful for smaller screens) and specifying a maximum of 720MB for the emulator to use (on systems with memory to spare). There are 3 main elements you'll be interacting with when running the emulator:
The phone UI - this is the visual part of the emulator, where you can interact with the UI in the same way you'd do it with a phone. You can use your mouse to simulate taps and slides. Bonus points if you can recognize the phone model where the UI is in ;)

Bonus points if you can recognize the phone model where the UI is in ;) The remote session on the terminal - upon starting the emulator, a terminal will also be launched alongside. Use the phablet username and the same password to log in to an interactive ADB session on the emulator. You can also launch other terminal sessions using other communication protocols –see the link at the end of this guide for more details.

You can also launch other terminal sessions using other communication protocols –see the link at the end of this guide for more details. The ubuntu-emulator tool - with this CLI tool, you can manage the lifetime and runtime of Ubuntu images. Common subcommands of ubuntu-emulator include create (to create new instances), destroy (to destroy existing instances), run (as we've already seen, to run instances), snapshot (to create and restore snapshots of a given point in time) and more. Use ubuntu-emulator --help to learn about these commands and ubuntu-emulator command --help to learn more about a particular command and its options.
Runtime notes
Make sure you've got enough space to install the emulator and create new instances, otherwise the operation will fail (or take a long time) without warning.
At this time, the emulator takes a while to load for the first time. During that time, you'll see a black screen inside the phone skin. Just wait a bit until it's finished loading and the welcome screen appears.
By default the latest built image from the devel-proposed channel is used. This can be changed during creation with the --channel and --revision options.
channel is used. This can be changed during creation with the and options. If your host has a network connection, the emulator will use that transparently, even though the network indicator might show otherwise.
To talk to the emulator, you can use standard adb . The emulator should appear under the list of the adb devices command.
Learn more and contribute
I hope this guide has whetted your appetite to start testing the emulator! You can also contribute making the emulator a first-class target for Ubuntu development. The easiest way is to install it and give it ago. If something is not working you can then file a bug.
If you want to fix a bug yourself or contribute to code, the best thing is to ask the developers about how to get started by subscribing to the Ubuntu phone mailing list.
If you want to learn more about the emulator, including how to create instance snapshots and other cool features, head out to the Ubuntu Emulator wiki page.
And next... support for the tablet form factor and SDK integration. Can't wait for those features to land!
Since the turn of the millennium, cli-fi has evolved from a subgenre of science fiction into a class of its own. Unlike traditional sci-fi, its stories seldom focus on imaginary technologies or faraway planets. Instead the pivotal themes are all about Earth, examining the impact of pollution, rising sea levels, and global warming on human civilization. And the genre's growing presence in college curriculums, as well as its ability to bridge science with the humanities and activism, is making environmental issues more accessible to young readers—proving literature to be a surprisingly valuable tool in collective efforts to address global warming.
When it comes to courting the interest of younger generations, it certainly helps that cli-fi is emerging at the movies and on TV. Last year's Christopher Nolan epic Interstellar shows the American Midwest turning into a second Dust Bowl, with a forecast so dire it drives humans to seek a new planet. In 2014's Snowpiercer, a bungled attempt to stop global warming creates a new ice age. Margaret Atwood's popular cli-fi trilogy MaddAddam is currently being adapted into a series for HBO, whose wildly popular show Game of Thrones also flirts, if unintentionally, with global-warming themes.
The writer and climate activist Dan Bloom came up with the term “cli-fi” circa 2007, hoping to convert the dull phrase “climate fiction” into something more compelling. “I never defined or even tried to define a new genre,” said Bloom. Instead, he merely wanted to come up with a catchy buzzword to raise awareness about global warming.” The strategy worked: When Atwood used the term in a 2012 tweet, she introduced it to her 500,000 followers, according to Bloom. As the notion of cli-fi took hold, publishers and book reviewers began regarding it as a new category. In this respect, cli-fi is a truly modern literary phenomenon: born as a meme and raised into a distinct genre by the power of social media. Today cli-fi has an actively used hashtag on Twitter, two user-created book lists on Goodreads, and several Facebook groups, including one devoted exclusively to young-adult climate fiction.
Given cli-fi's contemporary genesis, it's no surprise the genre is gaining popularity with high school and college-age readers. In a February 2015 feature for The Guardian, the cli-fi author Sarah Holding wrote that the genre “reconnects young readers with their environment, helping them to value it more, especially when today, a large amount of their time is spent in the virtual world.” Environmental themes complement the current trend of dystopian narratives in YA fiction. Bacigalupi's young adult novels The Drowned Cities (2013) and Ship Breaker (2011) show how rising sea levels reconfigure America, while the protagonists of Sarah Crossan's Breathe (2012) inhabit a domed city because oxygen is a rare commodity.

What a year its been, one of the more brutal in recent memory with political and social tensions at a feverish high. For now however, the world keeps spinning, and thankfully, bands and artists keep on releasing great new music. That's why we're here, new music. Perhaps you missed some of it. As major coverage seems to be shrinking to create *stars* and leaving behind the scrappy "indie" rock bands in the process, we feel it's our duty to deliver. It's time to catch up on the releases that went under the radar, the hidden gems, and the essential records from the underground. "The Year in Review" is a comprehensive guide to our favorite releases of the year without a pre-determined length. If we loved a record, we're including it... simple as that. The strength of DIY and independent labels continues to grow but it's impossible to listen to everything and there's a great chance a potential favorite slipped on by. What's of importance is that you remember it's never too late. Your next favorite band could be out there, it's just a matter of listening to something new. Together, we've profiled 100+ of the releases that make Post-Trash the site that it is, with countless others recommended as "further listening," a section for releases you might have missed, and we might not have spent enough time with. We're not saying these are the best albums, but rather our favorites.
Discover something new. Support the music you love. Thank you for reading Post-Trash and please help spread the word if you're into the site.
There are many sides to Rajon Rondo on the court, and thats ignoring the Celtics point guards hotly debated, oft-criticized, enigmatic personality traits off of it.
On the one hand, theres the electrifyingly entertaining player who has been a catalyst for Bostons high-scoring, up-tempo offense and is capable of posting a triple-double on any given night (he has three this year); the same man who is currently averaging 8.5 points, 10.8 assists, and a career-high 7.6 rebounds over 19 games this year. Only the points category sits below his career-average of 11.
Then, of course, theres the guy who has accumulated career-worst shooting percentages from both the field (39.6%) and free throw line (32.4%).
You didnt read that last number wrong, but you probably know that if youve paid any attention to the Celts this season.
For all his warts, none is more pronounced than Rondos dreadful performance at a place that is, comically in his case, referred to as the charity stripe. There are no freebies there. Truthfully, there rarely have been in his career.
Throughout 524 regular season games, Rondo has stepped to the free throw line 1,416 times and hit just 869 of those efforts for a 61.4 percentage.
Thats close to double the success-rate the veteran has been able to achieve this year in his 34 endeavors, which have included 11 makes.
With a minimum of 125 attempts in a single season as the barometer, the NBA record for futility at the free throw line belongs to Olden Polynice, who made only 30.9 percent of his chances in 1998-99. No guard has ever shot below 43.6 percent from the line, and that was Al McGuire in 1953-54.
With the worst mark in the league this year  based on a minimum of 30 cracks to rank 192nd  Rondo is flirting with some pretty undesirable history.
Im going to work on it, Rondo told reporters late last month, in the midst of a stretch where he hit just 5-of-20 tries, including an embarrassing 2-for-10 performance in a four-point loss to the Suns on Nov. 17.
Four games later, Rondo was in position to put the Cs ahead in a tie game with the championship-contending Bulls. He went to the line with 1:04 left and missed both opportunities in an eventual 109-102 defeat.
I dont have the answer right now, he said the next day.
Only Rondo is capable of fixing his problem at the free throw line, but some feel a sports psychologist could help him determine why it exists so significantly in the first place.
Boston University graduate Gregory Chertok is a player development consultant at Telos Sports Psychology Coaching, a practice based in the Northeast that focuses primarily on on-field performance enhancement. Chertok specifically helps higher-functioning athletes sharpen their focus through emotional regulation, attention control, anxiety reduction, and body awareness. He has worked with a wide variety of clients across all sports, from youth junior-elite athletes to Stanley Cup and Super Bowl champions.
Because Chertok has never spent time with Rondo, his commentary can only be seen as speculative in nature, but his overall assessments  even from a distance  provide a fascinating look into the field of sports psychology and how it can benefit an athlete, particularly one as introspective as Rondo.
To begin in a general sense, Chertok says Rondos free throw woes are very much a correctable issue.
A return to normalcy is attainable, he said, by an athlete identifying the components that were present in his game during normal performance levels. That is, what was I concentrating on? What was my attitude? Where were my eyes placed while shooting? How about my body posture? My breathing? How was my body feeling? The more precisely he can replicate what used to be normal, the more likely hell achieve it.
Chertok believes strongly in going back to basics and returning to the simple things, rather than reinventing the wheel, as Rondo has been known to do.
In April, long before Rondos historic drop-off in success from an already paltry history at the line, Kevin OConnor from SB Nations Celtics Blog conducted a comprehensive study of the guards free throw struggles. In it, OConnor realized Rondo has altered his routine and mechanics at the line nearly every season hes been in the league in an effort to improve. He did so even more frequently while a student at Kentucky.
OConnor compiled some of the visual evidence in the following video, taking note of Rondos routine with the ball, hand movements, approach to the line, and where he elects to focus his eyes.
Clearly Rondos modifications havent worked; OConnor believes this to be the case because of Rondos adjustments to his speed and composure at the line, but not his footwork, crouch, and follow-through.
Rondo, anything but complacent, has meticulously studied his shot on tape. He claims hes holding his follow-through, but most of his misses are similarly carrying long and off the right side of the rim.
While Rondo is likely frustrated by that reality, Chertok believes it to be a positive thing in the long run.
Hes inconsistently consistent, Chertok said when told of Rondos observation. What that tells me from a rudimentary standpoint is if someone is consistently doing something and physically executing something similarly, that means theyre doing it improperly but have the cognitive and behavioral capabilities of making alterations to make it consistent in a good way.
One of the hardest things for an athlete to do is achieve consistent performance, he continued. If someone is missing in a certain area with great regularity, to me, thats a good sign because theyre doing the same things prior to each execution of that physical skill and something very minor has to change in order for the outcome to be a bit better.
As his misses have mounted, Rondo has been asked if the issue is becoming mental.
I hope it hasnt gotten mental yet, he said. I still want to get fouled; Im trying to draw fouls. Im trying to get in a better rhythm. I dont think its mental for me yet.
Since making those comments on Nov. 29, Rondo is 2-for-6 at the line in seven games. His aggressiveness in the paint has taken a dramatic step back, as hes relied more frequently on jumpers than hes attacked the basket. Unfortunately, though not shocking, that hasnt resulted well. Hes hit just 29.9 percent of his shots, going 20-for-67 from the field, though hes averaged 11.2 assists in that span.
Having not spoken with Rondo, its impossible for Chertok to know definitively whether the guard is simply putting on a brave face to deflect any perceived mental weakness, following the guidance of his coaches or advisors on how to discuss the problem, or if he has a negative association with the term mental or the practice of psychology.
To Chertok, though, thats almost irrelevant because the mental and physical are undeniably and powerfully connected.
If a basketball player walks to the free throw line and thinks to himself, Aw, [expletive], Ive banked the last few off the right edge of the rim, Im probably going to do it again, that probably leads to an increase in muscular tension, a rapid heart-rate, heightened body temperature, increased breathing patterns, and a shifting of focus, which then leads to kind of proving himself right, he explained, while dismissing the label of choking in this situation. An athlete might view that as a physical thing, thinking, My heart was beating, my arms were stiff, I have to work on my mechanics.
But what preceded the muscular tension was his own cognitive appraisal and expectation of failure, which led to the bodily reactions, which led to the performance diminishment.
Then, Chertok said, Rondo is left trying to oversimplify the situation in interviews when he may very well be lying in bed at night after his fifth shower of the day wondering what in the world is wrong.
There should be a measure of trust in your abilities, he suggested.
Basketball players at all levels are constantly trying different things to get themselves out of free throw funks, though the right methods to achieving better focus can be very successful.
During the first three years of Jason Kidds career, the Mavericks guard and current Bucks coach never reached 70 percent at the free throw line. Over the next 16 seasons, he never shot below 74 percent and consistently connected in the 80s for an overall 78.5 mark. His tactic for many of those years was blowing a kiss to his family before each attempt.
Others had distinct routines, like Jeff Hornaceks face-rub as a hello to his children, Jerry Stackhouses knee-bend that practically reached the floor, Richard Hamiltons side-dribble, and Gilbert Arenas passed the ball around his back three times before shooting.
Mailman Karl Malone could barely deliver on 50 percent of his free throws in his first two seasons in the league, but transformed into a career 74.2 percent shooter once he started using trigger words. A sports psychologist gave that guidance to him.
To this day, everyone wonders what in the world Malone was muttering to himself.
I havent thought about talking to myself, Rondo said, when asked if that technique might work for him.
Chertok supports the use of a trigger word, however meaningless the word, as a sort of motivator, but thinks its more important for a player in Rondos sneakers to just get out of his own head if in fact confidence at the line is an underlying issue.
If his head is problematic, get in other body parts  attention to fluid wrists or relaxed shoulders, say  or get outside the body to an external focal point or target, like the rim, he said. Get to a happy place; an image of a beach, even. We as humans have relatively adept capabilities of selectively attending to various stimuli in our environment, and shifting attention fluidly. He may have to learn to shift focus to something more performance enhancing. 
While its not unusual for an athlete to endure state-like confidence issues in one area while excelling in most others  in Rondos case, hes terrible at the line but a superior distributor and, for his size, rebounder  it is also quite common for inconsistencies to creep in during more tranquil moments when theres more time to think, such is the case with trips to the stripe.
Chertok believes the more tenuous moments, like what Rondo experienced in that tie-game with Chicago, can create more pressure in a single moment, but so can the anxieties of playing in a contract year because its possible to get caught up focusing on a desired outcome (hitting the shot) rather than the process of attaining success.
To that end, while it is a reporters job to question Rondo about his inability to sink a free throw, it can also be a hindrance to his progression.
I cant speak for Rondo, but I would imagine the constant inquiries make the problem worse, he said. In a situation like this, the athletes goal is to become solution-focused; that is, to dedicate his attention and energy to the cognitive and behavioral steps needed to enact positive change. Thinking about a slump gives the problem more value, whereas thinking about the steps needed to make positive improvements gives value to the solution. The media is undoubtedly offering constant reminders to Rondo about the problem.
Left alone, albeit with positive encouragement from teammates, coaches, and management, its on Rondo to solve the dilemma, be it through mental and physical repetition, in the gym, during games, and even at home.
Perhaps taking some time away from the court, rather than postgame free throw sessions, would be helpful, Chertok advised. Over-practice can lead to over-analysis, which can lead to paralysis.
Mentally rehearsing an action activates very similar neural pathways in the brain, as does the physical execution of the skill. In other words, whether Im mentally practicing a free throw or physically practicing it, the brain doesnt really know the difference and responds similarly to each.
That notion would support OConnors study, which showed Rondo has been a considerably better free throw shooter on his second and third stabs than his first entering this season, with an improvement of almost 13 percent (51.1 vs. 79.2). Over the last two years, the discrepancy for each campaign exceeded 20 percent, which is astronomical.
Needless to say, a mental rep couldnt hurt, especially for a guy whose best season at the line came as a rookie in 2006-07, when he shot 64.7 percent.
Im not concerned about [the misses at the line], Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge told 98.5 The Sports Hubs Toucher and Rich last month. Its early in the season. I think [Rondo]s just been in a free throw funk.
As is often the case for players on the court, Rondo needs to shoot his way out of this mess. He must do whatever is necessary mentally and allow the physical to naturally take over. Reaching the line 34 times in 19 games  an average of 1.8 attempts per game  isnt nearly good enough, particularly for a player who prides himself on his aggressive approach.
If Rondos ineffectiveness at the line continues, will it be the determining factor that prevents him from receiving a max-level deal from the Celtics or any other team? Unlikely, but its not the kind of glaring weakness hell want teams to key in on provided hes held off the floor in pivotal late-game moments with the Cs drawing fouls and the opposition looking for a miss.
Theres no telling if Rondo would be interested in chatting with a sports psychologist in an effort to return to his old habits, but it couldnt hurt.
After all, the All-Stars free throw shooting cant get much worse. Can it?

The Federal Court of Canada has awarded a Nova Scotia man $21,000 in damages after a judge ruled Bell TV had violated his privacy rights by checking his credit history without his permission.
In a decision released this week, Judge Michael Phelan said Bell TV's conduct was "reprehensible."
The judgment says that when Rabi Chitrakar of Beechville, N.S., ordered satellite TV service on Dec. 1, 2010, Bell conducted an unauthorized credit check that hurt his credit score.
Story continues below advertisement
The ruling says that when the service was installed almost a month later, Bell placed an electronic copy of Chitrakar's signature on a rental agreement that authorized the check after the fact.
And when Chitrakar called Bell to complain about what happened, the court says he received a "royal runaround."
Phelan's judgment says that not only did Bell violate Chitrakar's rights, the company failed to show up in court and has shown no interest in offering compensation.
Neither Chitrakar nor a representative from Bell could be reached for comment.
Two weeks ago on Reddit's largest community for Donald Trump supporters, a user named WolfOfAnarchy dropped by with a request that was becoming almost tediously common for regulars on the site.
“Sanders supporter here,” he began. “Can you convince me (just not with idiotic oneliners) that Trump is not who the media makes him out to be? Thanks.”
“If you have any time, you should watch this,” another user jumped in.
That comment, which had the highest score, linked to a website: UntruthAboutDonaldTrump.com.
Other Trump supporters piled on, saying they were sick of having to post this same video over and over again. “I really wish our mods would sticky this (or affix it to the top of the website permanently) so we don't have to link this all the time,” one user wrote.
“That one video would clear up so much all the time,” said another.
Why? Because this video, for some reason, tends to work. And now, again, Trump's online supporters got to watch it in action: someone is told the real truth about Donald Trump for the very first time.
“I'm 5 minutes in, very very interesting so far,” WolfOfAnarchy reported back. “Trump is not stupid, that's clear, damn.”
When you click through to UntruthAboutDonaldTrump.com, you simply see this: a balding man smiling through a salt-and-pepper goatee, clad in an ironed button-down shirt, and standing well-lit in front of a static white background. He greets you warmly in a trusting, even-toned Irish accent. His name is Stefan Molyneux.
“Hope you're doing well,” he says. “We're going to go through a list of untruths about Donald Trump, just so you can get a fair assessment of the man's character and avoid the sensationalistic nonsense and get to the man's actual positions and policies—which are well worth an examination, and certainly not above criticism.”
Basically, as subreddit users put it, Molyneux sets out to make a reasoned, calm, intellectual argument for the candidacy of Donald Trump.
And for the first few minutes, it's hard to disagree with him. Molyneux, slowly reading along from a PowerPoint-like text of talking points, breaks down passages from Trump's Art of the Deal. He contends that Trump can't possibly be as dimwitted as the media makes him out to be and convincingly argues that it all must be part of Trump's plan. Molyneux, 49, is charismatic, open, immediately transfixing—almost enough for you to forget the video's 73-minute run time.
“15 minutes in,” WolfOfAnarchy wrote. “Jesus, the misinformation of the media is insane. I have never listened to a Trump speech, only the media. I now read his quotes and holy fuck have the media been turning my mind into a certain direction.”
Later on comes the questionable stuff from Molyneux—sentences like, “It's crazy you have to go to the former KGB leader to get the truth about the American presidential race”—but by the time he gets there, Molyneux has you hooked.
It's a pattern all too familiar for some families who've had a child watch Molyneux's videos and listen to his podcasts. At first, it's just their kid watching videos about something controversial but familiar—The Matrix, The Martian, or Donald Trump.
Then, a few months and a few more podcasts later, there's a note on the door. After that moment, they never see their child again.
***
Barbara Weed said she never understood the appeal of Molyneux's videos. She always found him “loathsome.”
But Weed said she knows the feeling this first-time Molyneux watcher is experiencing all too well.
She said it's the feeling her son, Tom Bell, had a little over eight years ago, the last time she saw him. It's the feeling he had before he ran away from home to join what she and experts like those at the British Cult Information Center call “Molyneux's cult.”
“My son is still gone. He's alive, in a foreign country. He cut off not just me, but all of the family and all of his friends. I haven't had direct contact with him since 2008,” said Weed, a Labour councilor from South Leamington in the U.K. “It sounds a bit strange when I say that to people.”
One day eight years ago, Weed came home to see a note on her doormat from her son. It said he was moving in with a friend and it instructed her not to contact him.
About six months before that, she had heard him listening to podcasts in his room. It all started with a school assignment for his Critical Thinking & Philosophy class. That led him to a YouTube video called “Introduction to Philosophy.” It shows Molyneux pacing around a room in 2006, talking about perceptions of what is really “true.”
Tom initially tried to introduce his mother to it, but she said she simply wasn't interested.
“My politics were just very different from [Molyneux's],” she said.
Still, that Introduction to Philosophy podcast had Tom hooked. His mother thought he was listening to the same one over and over again in his bedroom, as Molyneux droned on about the same ideas: identity, an extreme version of libertarianism, and the inherent abuse embedded in the concept of family.
It turns out, however, they were all different episodes, and sometimes there were group Skype chats with Molyneux and his fellow diehards.
“He told me he was getting advice from people on the Internet,” she said. “I didn't know what he was planning to do. I didn't know how deeply he was involved.”
What she also didn't know was that Molyneux's uniform advice to his dedicated listenership was a simple, cruel plan: Move away from your parents, because it is almost impossible for any mother or father not to have abused you in some way over the course of your lifetime.
“I've interviewed former insiders, and I've learned a fair bit about [Molyneux] and about the cult,” said Steve Hassan, a licensed mental health counselor and leading American cult expert. “He thinks that anyone who has circumcised a child is a child abuser and convinces his followers to cut off all contact from family and friends—even if it was a sibling who has nothing to do with it.”
Last year, Hassan was hired by a family to help them reunite with a child who had run away under the influence of Molyneux's ideology. Hassan said he believes this kind of “YouTube cult” can often be more dangerous than a sect with a built-in church or community, as it can convince vulnerable young men and women with nowhere to go to leave on a moment's notice—and without any support system to help them get by.
All of it is part of a process Molyneux calls “deFOOing,” or extracting oneself from their “family of origin.”
Molyneux's wife, Christina Papadopoulos, a licensed therapist in Canada, was sanctioned by the College of Psychologists of Ontario in Mississauga in 2012 for appearing on her husband's podcast and advocating for precisely that. The panel found her guilty of professional misconduct for giving improper advice and telling people to leave their families.
Molyneux's group, which organizes in forums online and sometimes in person, was called a “therapy cult” by family members in Canada's Globe & Mail.
In response to allegations that his group is a cult in a 2008 Globe & Mail interview, Molyneux called it “the c-word” and said, “I'm sure a few marriages broke up because of feminism. It doesn't make feminism a cult.”
On defoo.org, however, some of the group now self-identify as a “highly profitable self-knowledge cult.”
Molyneux did not respond to repeated requests for comment from The Daily Beast.
“Partly what's going on with the people on the Internet who are indoctrinated, they spend lots of hours on the computer. Videos can have them up all night for several nights in a row,” said Hassan. “Molyneux knows how to talk like he knows what he's talking about—despite very, very little academic research. He cites this and cites that, and presents it as the whole truth. It dismantles people's sense of self and replaces it with his sense of confidence about how to fix the world.”
Molyneux's plan to fix the world may start with disassociation from family, but it also relies on devotees sending him cash—although recently he has insisted it's not necessary—in a tiered donation system not unlike the one Scientology uses. Weed said her son had been giving money to Molyneux in order to reach the highest level of membership and, in turn, become part of Molyneux's inner circle.
“That level is called Philosopher King,” said Weed. “Tom was giving all of his money to him to become one of his special little friends, despite being a starving student.”
“He's making a living off of people donating money,” said Hassan.
Worse yet, Molyneux's staff and followers publicly shame and post personal information about those who leave the group. Molyneux's group calls the process of reuniting and making amends with family “reFOOing.”
Former inner-circle members often speak out in videos posted to YouTube and in the support group for spurned family members and ex-Molyneux acolytes, FDRLiberated.com. (FDR is short for FreeDomainRadio, Molyneux's YouTube and podcast channel.)
Once members leave the group, bios are posted on defoo.org that outrank any other mention of that member's name on Google. Those bios include every previous address, phone number, family member, and traffic violation, plus texts with a clear aim to shame the individual in question. A typical example reads:
“[A former member] gave up on FDR because the community didn't support the wearing of makeup. After breaking up with [redacted], she needed to attract a new male and was having trouble without her precious face paint. She has struggled with acne and feels insecure if people can see it. [That former member] now applies a thick layer of makeup to her face every day. It's almost as thick as her False Self.”
That sort of shaming—and the thousands of dollars Tom Bell has poured into Molyneux's coffers—is why Barbara Weed doesn't think she'll see her son again any time soon.
“I don't know where Tom is. I don't have the money to get a cult expert, either. I don't think Tom would listen to anybody else, even if I did,” said Weed. “All I can do is wait and try and get the message out to people that Molyneux is doing horrible things, and that it's a cult.”
Hassan said it's standard brainwashing, but there is good news: Molyneux isn't all that good at it.
“I guess, on the scale of things, I would say he's not that successful. He doesn't have that many people in his core,” he said. “You talk to former members and critics, and they talk about what's really going on at the core, that he's acting like a total megalomaniac, that he says his gift to his mother was that he didn't kill her.”
Hassan said he worries more about what Molyneux represents: charismatic people with a platform taking advantage of disaffected people who are “upset with how the relationships in their lives are going anyway” and are in desperate search for meaning.
“My life's work is explaining it to everybody—to not get taken over by black-and-white, us-vs.-them thinkers,” he said. “In terms of politics, right now, does that sound familiar?”
***
Hassan believes there's a clear reason Donald Trump attracts people like Molyneux and his supporters, or fans of conspiracy websites like InfoWars, which sells end-of-the-world food rations and which Trump called “amazing” in December.
Basically, both cater to the same idea: Get rid of one major thing from your life, and everything will work out.
“It's no surprise he's so into Trump,” Hassan said. “When Trump first talked about banning the Internet and Muslims, it was like that: They wanted to impose a one-sided view of what reality really is.”
Both Trump and Molyneux, Hassan said, make an appeal for your respect by offering a “truth” that the media simply won't tell you. Only Molyneux and Trump can show you that it's all one big “untruth,” anyway.
“Trump is the quintessential, stereotypical cult leader in that the crux of his argument is that ‘they' lie all the time,” said Hassan. “‘Don't you wanna follow someone who is trustworthy? If they lie to the public, how do you know they're not lying to you? Why would you consciously want to follow someone who's a liar?' It's an appeal for respect for people who want a black-and-white answer.”
Weed said she has a hard time watching Trump's speeches on TV because she sees the same in Molyneux as she does in the presidential candidate.
“If you try and write down what Molyneux has said, it's incomplete sentences. It's not a logical flow of thought. There's nothing like a conclusion. He just rambles. He'll just jump midsentence to somewhere else, just like Trump does,” she said. “He uses very extreme language, except Molyneux is a bit more extreme, with a direct plan.”
Still, Weed doesn't think Molyneux is all that much of a Trump supporter, after all. She believes he's using Trump's name as a new way to drag people away from their families and into his group.
Molyneux has done the same with videos about anything slightly countercultural but accessible, above all. He's made videos about The Matrix. He's made podcasts attacking President Obama. He's created episodes about police shootings that were initially anti-police, but eventually started making videos that defended police and criticized the families of victims like Michael Brown.
“He's gotten better and better at getting attention by just being controversial,” said Weed. “It's just clickbait. At the end of the day, it's whatever will bring more people to his site.”
After all, Tom got there because he felt he was finally being told the truth about the world from a YouTube video with a search engine-friendly title: an Introduction to Philosophy.
Now, almost a decade later, Weed is still holding out hope that her son will catch wind of the dozens of ex-members who post their horror stories on YouTube, or that Molyneux's group will fold as, she said, “these cults tend to do.” Or maybe he'll just drift away, as she said the lot of Tom's friends already have.
“It's possible Tom will leave some day. Or, one day, Molyneux might just drop dead,” she said. “That would be lovely. He might get hit by a truck. A meteorite might fall on his head. I could have my son back.”
Alan Keyes is now citing Jesus Christ in his drive to elect members of Congress who will pledge to support the impeachment and removal of President Obama, who he says is practicing “socialist gangsterism” and using gun laws to have people “slaughtered by the thousands and the hundreds of thousands.”
Writing today in WorldNetDaily, Keyes claims that most Americans do support impeachment but are being ignored by leaders in Congress. He doubts that America can “wait three more years for the chance to end Obama's destructive socialist coup d'état” that is creating a “vicious, dictatorial regime.”
However, he is hopeful that Jesus Christ “has the power to restore [America] to the better path of human destiny” and help “the movement to impeach and remove Obama and his cronies from office.”
Leavened with malice and deceit, they rise to power, these hardcore socialists like Obama. Once positioned to do so, they move to consolidate unbridled tyranny. Their infamous goal: to impose the “dictatorship of the proletariat.”
That supposedly populist Marxist catchphrase slyly distracts from the fact that everywhere they achieve political success, socialist ideologues practice gangster government – of, by and for a self-serving elitist clique. As gangsters typically do, they encourage whatever vices they can manipulate. They also liberally apply the salt of fear, to make their banal rule more palatable. And when they have attained sufficient power, they do not shrink from doing so with brutally forceful measures.
The U.S. Constitution derives from an understanding that stresses the need for effective limits and constraints on governmental power. This need arises from the same inherent evils that make government necessary in the first place. It is obviously inimical to the goal of dictatorship. Therefore, since even before his occupation of the White House, Obama and his collaborators have worked to disparage, undermine and discard the U.S. Constitution.
But many Americans are still adamantly unwilling to choke down the prospect of life under a vicious, dictatorial regime. Their eyes see past the populist disguise of socialist gangsterism. Some have (I think prematurely) concluded that America's liberty is irretrievable defunct. But even they have by no means surrendered their allegiance to it.
Others, particularly those who believe in Jesus Christ's permanent resurrection of hope, look unflinchingly into the abyss, sure that if they remember and trust in God's law of love and mercy, He has the power to restore their nation to the better path of human destiny. It is especially (though not exclusively) among such people that the movement to impeach and remove Obama and his cronies from office arises.
…
With all this in mind, it makes no sense to pretend that the impeachment/removal issue must depend on a vote taken by the U.S. Congress “as things stand.” Lately, no matter how much their constituents plead with them, the elitist faction leaders in Congress have made it clear that they aren't listening, on just about every vital issue.
But if people use the power the Constitution places in their hands, the power of their votes, impeachment/removal may be made to depend on where voters decide to stand in the Congressional elections next November.
Can America afford to wait three more years for the chance to end Obama's destructive socialist coup d'état? American citizens who answer with a resounding “no” need to consider what they can do about it. They need to decide what, as individuals, they are personally willing to do to restore and preserve their government of, by and for the people, the republican form of government guaranteed by the Constitution (Article IV.4)
Shadow health secretary tells how childhood memories have inspired him to fight for more help for families of alcoholics
Childhood memories of growing up with an alcoholic father have prompted the shadow health secretary to call for greater recognition of the damage done by excessive drinking.
Jonathan Ashworth said there was a need for urgent action because the cost of alcohol-related harm was not just the £3.5bn NHS price-tag, but up to £7bn in lost productivity for the British economy.
During an interview with the Guardian, the Labour MP said he also wanted there to be much more focus on the needs of families affected by alcoholism, claiming the issue would be a priority for him and Labour in 2017.
Ashworth said he was surprised to find himself disclosing, for the first time to a national newspaper, the reason he felt so passionately about the issue.
“It's quite personal for me, because my dad was an alcoholic,” he said, suddenly spilling out early memories of his father falling over drunkenly at the school gates and of returning home to a fridge stacked with cheap booze and no food.
Ashworth said he had never really considered his experience as something relevant in policy terms. “You didn't think there was a problem, you just thought ‘that is the life I've got',” he said.
Then he came across the work being carried out by his Labour colleague, Liam Byrne, whose childhood was affected in a similar way.
The MP's all-party parliamentary group dedicated to the children of alcoholics has revealed that local authorities across the country tend to have no specific strategies to help young people affected in this way.
The group, which is publishing research on the issue in the new year, said that millions of children were “suffering in silence”.
Inspired by Byrne's work, Ashworth felt he wanted to make the issue a priority in 2017. “I wanted to do something on alcoholism so that if nothing else I'll have done something on that,” he said, before adding: “I know it's cliched.”
As well as backing Byrne's ideas he wants to support a phoneline run by the National Association for Children of Alcoholics to help make it a nationwide service. He also wants more specialised training for professionals to support children and for councils to be properly funded to be able to reach out to families affected by alcoholism through schools, via community nurses and in Sure Start children's centres.

Ashworth talked about his own experience as an only child in a working-class part of north Manchester after his mother, who worked as a barmaid, and his father, a croupier in a Salford casino, divorced.
He spoke vividly about the days that he stayed with his father – whom he said he loved dearly.
“I remember him falling over when he picked me up at the school gates and we'd get home and there would be nothing in the fridge other than bottles of wine – he drank cheap horrible bottles of white wine … and cans of lager and Stone's bitter,” said Ashworth.
“When I got to 11 or 12 then I was effectively looking after him on the weekends because he was drunk all weekend,” he said, pausing before adding: “And eventually he died.”
Ashworth recalled trying to persuade his father not to move to Thailand one Christmas. The MP said he knew in his heart it would end badly, but his father replied: “No, I'm going,” and he went.
“I never saw him again,” said the MP.
About a year later he received a call telling him to travel to the small apartment where his father had been staying. When he got there he found his bed surrounded by empty whisky bottles. “He was in Thailand for that last year drinking a bottle of whisky a day … I had to clear it up. That was my life. He was 60.”
Ashworth said his father, also called Jon, had not been offered formal help, although he himself had tried to raise the issue of his drinking as an adult. He said his dad thought he was OK because he didn't touch alcohol during his working hours. “But as a child I didn't see him at work,” he said.
Ashworth, who was politically active for the Labour party from the age of 15, through college and on into a job advising Gordon Brown, said the experience with his dad left him feeling “not damaged but determined”.
The MP for LeicesterSouth – who was promoted to shadow health secretary by Jeremy Corbyn after his second victory in a leadership contest – now feels he has an opportunity to take action.
As well as the work he outlined with charities and councils, he believes that part of the solution must also be a cultural drive to have alcoholism taken more seriously. Ashworth recalled how “people used to think it was funny – a right laugh” that his dad was a drinker.
He remembered his father in goal in the work football team and people pointing off the pitch and shouting: “Oh Jon Ash is in goal – just throw a crate of Stella in that direction and he'll go after that.”
“And I was like ‘oh yeah that's funny', but actually that was my dad and for my teenage years I was looking after him. It just became a norm. I had to grow up very fast.”
But he is not just concerned about alcohol. “Public health has been cut back by the Tories but they are storing up huge problems,” he said. “Obesity is a huge problem that costs the NHS billions. The debate on obesity and diabetes hasn't punched through.”
Ashworth said there were lessons to be learned from the bold action to ban smoking in public places, which had a massive impact. He called for much more direct action on poor diet.
“I think we have to be bold about what we say to the advertising industry – not just with kids programmes but families sitting down watching The X Factor. Think of the hundreds of thousands of calories being advertised this winter in the run-up to Christmas,” said Ashworth, arguing that fast food and supermarkets selling “tasty treats” were all over family viewing times.
“The government watered this down. There were going to be stricter restrictions on the industry, [David] Cameron was going to go for it and the story is that Theresa May got her red pen out and cut it out. I think we have got to be bold.”

(CNN) - Police in Arlington County, Virginia said Thursday they will start a criminal investigation of "election offense allegations" involving the son of Democratic Rep. Jim Moran.
The congressman's son, Patrick, resigned from his position Wednesday as a paid staff member on his father's re-election campaign after secretly-recorded video showed him giving detailed advice on how to commit voter fraud.

Moran, now in his 11th term, released a statement saying his son, Patrick, was "a well-respected member of the campaign team. This incident, however, was clearly an error in judgment. The campaign has accepted Patrick's resignation, effective immediately."
The video, which first emerged Wednesday, was released by Project Veritas, a 501(C)3 group created by conservative activist James O'Keefe. O'Keefe is known for using fake aliases and secretly record videos to try to expose fraud.
In the edited video, an undercover Project Veritas employee with a hidden camera approaches Patrick Moran, asking for advice on how to vote for 100 people.
Though remaining skeptical, Patrick Moran suggests forging utility bills or bank statements as forms of ID, as well as pretending to be a pollster in order to call voters and find out if they are inactive.
The Arlington County Commonwealth Attorney's Office and the Arlington County Police Department said in a statement that they are aware of the video that allegedly depicts Patrick Moran of "assisting another to vote illegally."
"The Arlington County Police Department has initiated a criminal investigation of this matter," the statement read.
After the video made headlines, Patrick Moran released a statement Wednesday, saying he does not endorse "any sort of illegal or unethical behavior."
"At no point did I take this person seriously. He struck me as being unstable and joking, and for only that reason did I humor him," he said. "In hindsight, I should have immediately walked away, making it clear that there is no place in the electoral process for even the suggestion of illegal behavior: joking or not."
Rep. Jim Moran represents Virginia's 8th Congressional District, which includes Washington, D.C. suburbs such as Arlington County and the cities of Alexandria and Falls Church.
Ever since Florence Nightingale was crowned with the 2017 Golden Halo, the anticipation over the 2018 Lent Madness bracket has been nearly unquenchable. Nominationtide produced a flurry of saintly suggestions from all over the the globe which were narrowed down at the Supreme Executive Committee's secretive spring retreat.
Following last week's bracket leak at the nefarious hands of the international hacking organization LentiLeaks, tensions were running high as the SEC prepared to release the official bracket. Fortunately increased cybersecurity prevented further leaks and we have arrived at All Brackets' Day with the bracket — and the integrity of Lent Madness — intact.
Longtime Lent Madness fans will be intrigued to discover that this year's bracket [click on the image to enlarge it] is broken up into four quadrants of similarly grouped saints. These include: 1) Biblical Saints 2) Monastics & Martyrs 3) Mostly Modern and 4) Miscellaneous. Who says the SEC isn't open to innovation and the movement of the Holy Spirit?!
One common complaint we hear on All Brackets' Day was recently echoed by an anonymous killjoy who happened past the Lentorium. “Why do you have to talk about Lent? It's not even Advent yet!” Well, besides the fact that the All Saints' – All Souls' – All Brackets' triduum is ALL ABOUT SAINTS, it's because we are in the perpetual Lent business. If this “season creep” causes you anxiety, we suggest turning off the Wi-Fi in your home until Lent Madness begins on Ash Thursday (February 15).
We do hope you enjoy this annual festival of bracketology and we have two suggestions (besides Googling all the saints you've never heard of) to help you prepare for the Madness that is to come:
Read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest all the saintly matchups by pre-ordering the 2018 Saintly Scorecard. Just like last year, we are selling the scorecards individually or in packs of 10. To get the best price order three or more packs of 10, for an unbelievably low price of just $1 per scorecard. Pre-order your giant Bracket Poster.
And remember, it's never too early to wish one another a Happy Lent!
The Republican primary debates are fast approaching and the stakes are high. But, while GOP hopefuls prepare how they're going to try and avoid a Donald Trump storm on the stage next week, one thing remains unclear: What about the Democratic debates?
Following a Democratic National Committee (DNC) announcement in May that the party would have six debates, not a lot of details have been nailed down. The first is expected to be in August and September, but exact dates haven't been set. They are, however, supposed to take place in the first two voting states in the primary season, Iowa and New Hampshire.
The DNC doesn't have quite the same problems that its Republican counterpart is facing. The Republican debates, because of the large number of declared candidates, have had to set up tiered debating programs. The top 10 candidates will share the stage on Aug. 6, as determined by recent national polls evaluated by the event's host, Fox News. The other candidates will get their chance, too, albeit earlier and in a cable television slot that generally gets fewer viewers.
Democrats, on the other hand, have a much smaller field of candidates. The front-runner, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is joined by four other declared Democratic candidates: U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia, former governor of Maryland Martin O'Malley and former governor of Rhode Island Lincoln Chafee.
The debates could be big opportunities for Clinton's opponents. As Bernie Sanders has been catching up in the polls, voters have become less and less convinced of Clinton's trustworthiness and leadership capabilities. Clinton has also taken some hits in potential matchups with three Republican candidates in key swing states.
After the first two debates, there is supposed to be a South Carolina debate in either October or November, a Nevada debate later in the year, then two in the early months of 2016. One of those final debates will be in Iowa, and the other state location hasn't been determined.
Clarification
When people begin to understand the basics of MBTI, there are a few preconceived notions that we're going to drop immediately:
Extraverted vs Intraverted
People assume that if they have an E in the front of their type, they are an Extrovert, or the opposite with an I. Although this tends to be true, this is not what the MBTI is talking about, whatsoever.
There are four base cognitive functions: Intuition, Sensing, Thinking, and Feeling.
Each of these four functions has an Extraverted version and and an Intraverted version.
The Extraverted and Intraverted versions of a cognitive function has unique qualities, independent of each other.
“Extraverted” means what is shown to to the outside world, and “Intraverted” is what happens on the inside.
Ever notice how when dealing with MBTI types, the terminology is “Extraverted,” not “Extroverted?”
This means that those four cognitive functions just became eight unique functions. For example, instead of Intuition (N), there is actually Ne and Ni: Extraverted Intuition and Intraverted Intuition.
“I switch between being an Exxx and an Ixxxx”
No. You don't.
It is not the person that is an extrovert or introvert, it is that the cognitive functions have an Extraverted and an Intraverted version. However, if your dominant function happens to be an Extraverted one, it does pretty much mean that you will be more of an Extrovert. So, you may have been correct, but by accident!
Breaking it Down
There are 16 Personality Types.
Each “Type” represents a unique predictable pattern of how the eight processes (functions) are used in everyday life.
In most of what we do, we rely on two of the processes, the dominate function and the auxiliary function, as a preferred way of accessing information and a preferred way of organizing and evaluating that information.
In truth, we have access to all eight cognitive processes. The other six are often in the background, playing other kinds of roles.
The Primary Processes
The primary processes are those used in the first four roles.
Each process tends to emerge and develop at different times in our lives. During these times we are drawn to activities that use these processes.
Then, learning the content and the skills that engage these processes is often nearly effortless. We find our interest is drawn to them and our interest is pulled away from things we were drawn to before.
1. The Leading Role (Dominant)
The process that plays the leading role is the one that usually develops early in childhood. We tend to engage in this process first, trusting it to solve our problems and help us be successful.
Being the most trusted and most used, it usually has an adult, mature quality to it. While we are likely to engage in it rather automatically and effortlessly, we have much more conscious control over it.
The energy cost for using it is very low. Much like in the movies, the leading role has a heroic quality as using it can get us out of difficult situations.
2. The Supporting Role (Auxiliary)
The supporting role is how we are helpful to others as well as supportive of ourselves.
Once we have developed some facility with our leading role process, we are more likely to feel comfortable engaging in our supporting role process.
In its most positive form, this can be quite like a nurturing parent. In its more negative aspect, it can be overprotective and stunting and not helpful.
When the leading role process is an extraverted one, the supporting role process is introverted.
When the leading role process is an introverted one, the supporting role process is extraverted and may be quite active and visible as it provides a way of dealing with the outer world.
3. The Relief Role (Tertiary)
The relief role gives us a way to energize and recharge ourselves. It serves as a backup to the supporting role and often works in tandem with it.
When we are younger, we might not engage in the process that plays this role very much, unless our life circumstances require it or make it hard to use the supporting role process.
Usually, in young adulthood we are attracted to activities that draw upon this process.
The relief role often is how we express our creativity. It is how we are playful and childlike. In its most negative expression, this is how we become childish. Then it has an unsettling quality, and we can use this process to distract ourselves and others, getting us off target.
4. The Aspirational Role (Inferior)
The aspirational role usually doesn't develop until around midlife. We often experience it first in its negative aspect of projecting our “shoulds,” fears, and negativities onto others.
The qualities of these fears reflect the process that plays this role, and we are more likely to look immature when we engage in the process that plays this role. There is often a fairly high energy cost for using it, even when we acquire the skill to do so.
As we learn to trust it and develop it, the aspirational role process provides a bridge to balance in our lives. Often, our sense of purpose, inspiration, and ideals have the qualities of the process that plays this role.
The Shadow Processes
The other four cognitive processes operate more on the boundaries of our awareness. It is as if they are in the shadows and only come forward under certain circumstances.
We usually experience these processes in a negative way, yet when we are open to them, they can be quite positive.:
5. The Opposing Role
The opposing role is often how we get stubborn and argumentative—refusing to “play” and join in whatever is going on at the time.
It might be easy for us to develop skill in the process that plays this role, but we are likely to be more narrow in our application of this skill, and it will likely take more energy to use it extensively.
In its positive aspect, it provides a shadow or depth to our leading role process, backing it up and enabling us to be more persistent in pursuit of our goals.
6. The Critical Parent Role
The critical parent role is how we find weak spots and can immobilize and demoralize others.
We can also feel this way when others use the process that plays this role.
It is often used sporadically and emerges more often under stressful conditions when something important is at risk. When we engage it, we can go on and on.
To access its positive side of discovery, we must learn to appreciate and be open to it. Then it has an almost magical quality and can give a profound sense of wisdom.
7. The Deceiving Role
The deceiving role fools us into thinking something is important to do or pay attention to.
The process that fills this role is often not trusted or seen as worthy of attention, for when we do engage it, we may make mistakes in perception or in decision making. Then we feel double bound—trapped between two bad options.
Yet this role can have a positive side as it provides comic relief. Then we can laugh at ourselves. It can be refreshing and join with the relief role as we recharge ourselves through play.
8. The Devilish Role
The devilish role can be quite negative. Using the process that plays this role, we might become destructive of ourselves or others. Actions (or inactions) taken when we engage in the process that plays this role are often regretted later.
Usually, we are unaware of how to use the process that fills this role and feel like it just erupts and imposes itself rather unconsciously. Yet when we are open to the process that plays the devilish role, it becomes transformative. It gives us the impetus to create something new—to make lemonade out of lemons, rather than lament their sourness.
Decoding an Actual MBTI type – ENTP
I will break down an actual type, how this all fits together. We will use my type, an ENTP, as the example.
ENTP actually means: Ne, Ti, Fe, Si, Ni, Te, Fi, Se
Dominant – Extraverted intuition (Ne)
Ne finds and interprets hidden meanings. This intuitive play weaves together insights and experiences from various sources to find the whole, which can then become a catalyst to action.
Ne allows the ENTP effortlessly to identify complex interrelationships between ideas, people, and things that are often invisible to most other personality types.
The Supporting Role (Auxiliary) – Introverted thinking (Ti)
Ti seeks precision, such as the exact word to express an idea. It notices the minute distinctions that define the essence of things, then analyzes and classifies them. Ti examines all sides of an issue, looking to solve problems while minimizing effort and risk. It uses models to root out logical inconsistency.
In the ENTP, Ti analyzes the constant stream of information that Ne provides. Ti develops structure and reconciles any inconsistencies in the ENTP's belief system.
However, Ti cannot match the activity of Ne, which leads the ENTP to juggle multiple projects and theoretical enterprises at any given time, in various stages of completion.
The Relief Role (Tertiary) – Extraverted feeling (Fe)
Fe seeks social connections and creates harmonious interactions through polite, considerate, and appropriate behavior. Fe responds to the explicit (and implicit) wants of others, and may even create an internal conflict between the subject's own needs and the desire to meet the needs of others.
When Fe is well developed, the ENTP can foster goodwill in others, and can be seen as quite charming and loyal. When it is not well developed, the ENTP can be seen as aloof and unconcerned with other people's feelings.
In most ENTPs, weakness of the tertiary function can be observed in its inconsistency or lack of endurance.
The Aspirational Role (Inferior) – Introverted sensing (Si)
Si collects data in the present moment and compares it with past experiences, a process that sometimes evokes the feelings associated with memory, as if the subject were reliving it. Seeking to protect what is familiar, Si draws upon history to form goals and expectations about what will happen in the future.
Si offsets the ENTP's natural tendency toward anarchy and non-conformity. It acts as a sort of gravitational pull that keeps the ENTP in orbit around reality.
Without this function, the ENTP can be seen as unpredictable and random, but when it is well developed, the ENTP is seen as orderly and understandable.
The Opposing Role – Introverted intuition (Ni):
Attracted to symbolic actions or devices, Ni synthesizes seeming paradoxes to create the previously unimagined. These realizations come with a certainty that demands action to fulfill a new vision of the future, solutions that may include complex systems or universal truths.
The Critical Parent Role – Extraverted thinking (Te):
Te organizes and schedules ideas and the environment to ensure the efficient, productive pursuit of objectives. Te seeks logical explanations for actions, events, and conclusions, looking for faulty reasoning and lapses in sequence.
The Deceiving Role – Introverted feeling (Fi):
Fi filters information based on interpretations of worth, forming judgments according to criteria that are often intangible. Fi constantly balances an internal set of values such as harmony and authenticity. Attuned to subtle distinctions, Fi innately senses what is true and what is false in a situation.
The Devilish Role – Extraverted sensing (Se):
Extraverted sensing focuses on the experiences and sensations of the immediate, physical world. With an acute awareness of the present surroundings, it brings relevant facts and details to the forefront and may lead to spontaneous actionn.

There were two weeks to go before summer break at the Swedish high school where Jesper Söder taught when he quit.
Söder, then 24, had concocted a different plan for himself and didn't want to place his students at risk. He left them behind on May 19 and began his journey to northern Syria.
Now, temporarily back in Sweden after helping Syrian Kurdish forces combat the Islamic State group, Söder said he has a message for the West after last week's horrific attacks in Paris: Keep up the fight, and refine your tactics.
"You can never let this stuff happen," Söder told HuffPost in an interview via Skype Thursday night, referring to the brutality that ISIS has inflicted on those living under its control and now on the West.
Söder praised the Syrian Kurdish militia that Washington now sees as a chief ground partner against ISIS in Syria. "In four years [since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011], they have done more than any groups that fight" the extremists, he said.
The militia, known as the YPG, has captured thousands of miles of territory and multiple towns from ISIS since the U.S. began supporting it with air power last fall. The militia recently played a role in the successful effort to push extremists from the area near Sinjar in northwestern Iraq. And a new coalition the YPG has formed with Sunni Arab fighters will -- if things go as Washington plans and Arab-Kurd ethnic tensions can be managed -- be the force to eventually retake the Syrian town of Raqqa, ISIS's self-proclaimed capital.
Asked why he decided to take up arms and join the Kurds,Söder replied, "I'm a human lover. I can't just watch and let this happen."

Söder began to learn about the Kurdish forces and the Islamic State's atrocities in January, as world attention was fixed on the Kurdish resistance to ISIS in Kobani. He began planning to travel to Syria and spent five months saving. After quitting his job, he headed to Suleimaniyah, in Iraq's Kurdistan region. From there, he traveled -- as scores of Westerners have before him -- to what the Syrian Kurds call Rojava, their enclave in Syria.
Söder returned to Sweden two months later for surgery after he was exposed to a mine. While home, he gave an interview to the the Swedish newspaper Expressen. He didn't like shooting, he explained -- he did it because he felt he needed to.
He returned to Rojava soon after, and began working on relief efforts and mentoring new fighters from abroad, he said.
Asked about criticisms of the YPG from Arab opposition groups that say it cares only about Kurdish concerns and from human rights organizations that have tracked alleged anti-Arab war crimes by some of its fighters, Söder said he saw the militia as open to all communities in the swathes of Syria it now controls, which include some of the country's most religiously and ethnically diverse regions.
"As long as you are not Daesh, they love you," Söder said, using a derogatory term for the Islamic State.
Most foreign fighters who have traveled to support the Syrian Kurds have similarly positive impressions, though some have reportedly been disgruntled with the Kurds' leftist political ideology and their leadership challenges. One of them, Canadian citizen John Gallagher, was killed earlier this month. He is to receive a traditional tribute of respect on Canada's "Highway of Heroes" on Friday.
Söder said he is eager to return to the front lines. He plans to be away "for two months maximum."
His trip home comes as more attention is being paid to ISIS strategy than since Kobani, or the point when the U.S. and a range of European and Arab partners launched a coalition to tackle the group last year. And Söder is not out of touch. On the Instagram feed he loyally maintained while in Syria, he posted an image of the French flag tagged #prayforfrance the day of the attacks in Paris.

His advice for the West?
"You can do airstrikes, you can do more weapons, but you also need to stand up to Turkey ... and those financing and supporting terrorists," Söder said.
Soder blasted the Turkish government and suggested that many of the foreign fighters collaborating with Syrian Kurds who are key to the ISIS fight would like to see Turkey removed from the NATO alliance.
Many observers of the Syrian civil war -- particularly the Kurdish forces Söder aligned with -- have faulted Turkey for the extremists' rise because they say its lax border policies have aided the flow of foreign fighters to ISIS and other radical groups in Syria.
Söder said he sees those attacks as attempts to provoke the YPG into responding, and shattering its fragile relationship with the U.S.
Söder's comment on financing points a finger at donors in Gulf Arab states who have funded the Islamic State group and other radical elements in Syria, such as the al Qaeda affiliate there, for ideological reasons or because of opposition to Syrian President Bashar Assad. It also implicates Senate Republicans, whose stalling over Obama administration nominees for top jobs has left a vacancy at the Treasury Department office responsible for curbing terror financing.
The Kurdish forces Söder is associated with have drawn the ire of the largely Sunni Arab opposition because they take a mostly neutral approach to Assad. His withdrawal from Kurd-dominated northern Syria in the summer of 2012, to focus on fights with fellow Arabs elsewhere, is what gave the Kurds to chance to build their own society. Assad's only presence now in the Kurdish region of Rojava is in strategic points in urban centers, like the airport in the Kurds' capital of Qamishli.
"We are not allies, we are not enemies, with the regime," Söder said. "If Daesh would attack [the city of] Qamishli ,they would, of course, fight together to save it."

Söder said he wanted European leaders to be more vigilant about the risk of ISIS infiltration among refugees pouring into their countries. Unlike the U.S., Europe does not screen refugees until after they arrive on its soil.
The volunteer fighter said he believes the Kurds' next big move on ISIS -- the push on its capital -- is inevitable. "It's as soon as possible," Söder said.
That Michael Bloomberg won't be running for president can't be considered a huge surprise. The former New York mayor was previously rumored to be seeking the White House in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, according to news reports compiled by The Atlantic's David Graham, but failed to enter each time.
Bloomberg's decision, announced on Monday afternoon, is still a reasonably big deal, however, because as Bloomberg himself concluded, his candidacy could potentially have thrown the election to Donald Trump.
There are various ways to get at this conclusion. While there hasn't been a ton of public polling testing Bloomberg's candidacy, most of it showed Bloomberg taking more votes from Hillary Clinton than from Trump in a potential three-way race.
Ideologically, Bloomberg wouldn't have all that much space to himself. Bloomberg's policies are more center-left than truly centrist, making it hard for him to differentiate himself from Hillary Clinton. And Trump already in many ways resembles an independent candidate.
Bernie Sanders, if he were the nominee, might have provided Bloomberg with slightly more running room. But after Super Tuesday, with Sanders running well behind the delegate pace he needs to win the Democratic race, Clinton now looks like the much more likely Democratic nominee — perhaps a factor in Bloomberg's decision.
It's also hard to see how the demographics would work for Bloomberg. As it happens, I've been working on a model of a potential third-party candidacy. Because we're writing this story on short notice, I'm going to be more circumspect than usual about describing it. But the basic conclusion is that it's incredibly hard to find many votes for a center-left third-party candidate without eating substantially into the Democratic coalition.
The model, which is built on data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, divides the American electorate into six roughly equal groups:
African-Americans (12 percent of voting population) : extremely Democratic-leaning.
: extremely Democratic-leaning.
Hispanic, Asian, “other” and mixed races (14 percent): Also strongly Democratic leaning, especially in recent elections.
Also strongly Democratic leaning, especially in recent elections.
White evangelicals (23 percent) : Strongly Republican .
Strongly Republican
White cosmopolitans (20 percent) : These are white, non-evangelical voters who favor both gay marriage and a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who entered the country illegally. They're a highly Democratic-leaning group, mostly concentrated in urban areas and college towns.
: These are white, non-evangelical voters who favor both gay marriage and a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who entered the country illegally. They're a highly Democratic-leaning group, mostly concentrated in urban areas and college towns.
White “picket fence” voters (15 percent) : These are whites who are neither evangelicals nor cosmopolitans, but have high socioeconomic status as indicated by income, education levels, home ownership and other factors. This is a largely suburban, center-right group who went for Mitt Romney over Barack Obama about 2 to 1 in the previous election.

This is a largely suburban, center-right group who went for Mitt Romney over Barack Obama about 2 to 1 in the previous election.
White working-class voters (16 percent): Whites who are neither evangelicals nor cosmopolitans, and have lower socioeconomic status. Once a good group for Democrats, they now vote Republican about 2 to 1.
As I've said, I've found it very difficult to get Bloomberg to more than about 30 percent of the vote. Even that would be extremely generous, in my view. But it isn't that hard to imagine him taking most of his potential votes from Clinton. Here's one hypothetical case:
PREDICTED VOTE SHARES VOTER GROUP SHARE OF ELECTORATE CLINTON BLOOMBERG TRUMP African-Americans 12% 80% 15% 5% Hispanics, Asians and “other” races 14 65 25 10 White evangelicals 23 10 10 80 White cosmopolitans 20 45 50 5 White “picket fence” voters 15 15 65 20 White working-class voters 16 15 15 70
In this scenario, Bloomberg wins about half of white cosmopolitans, along with about two-thirds of white “picket fence” voters. But he doesn't make many inroads with the other groups, especially white evangelicals and working-class voters, who mostly go with Trump. Bloomberg takes a few black and Hispanic votes away from Clinton, but not many.
This would produce a fairly close popular-vote outcome: Trump 35.5 percent, Clinton 34.7 percent, Bloomberg 29.8 percent. (To repeat, I think this is probably very optimistic for Bloomberg.) But he'd deprive Clinton of some of the white swing voters she'd need to win the Electoral College. In fact, according to our model, this scenario would result in a fairly lopsided Electoral College win for Trump, with Trump getting 311 electoral votes to 181 for Clinton and 46 for Bloomberg, whose wins would be restricted to a handful of predominantly white states like New Hampshire with a high number of moderate and independent voters.
To repeat, this scenario does not have Trump winning all that many votes: only 35.5 percent, a figure that coincides with his low favorability ratings among the general population. But that would nonetheless be enough for Trump to win most swing states if Clinton and Bloomberg split the remainder of the vote. Here are the estimates our model produces for the traditionally most competitive states:
STATE CLINTON BLOOOMBERG TRUMP WINNER Colorado 33.6 32.1 34.3 Trump Florida 34.6 29.1 36.3 Trump Iowa 30.0 32.9 37.1 Trump Michigan 35.4 29.9 34.6 Clinton Minnesota 31.7 33.6 34.7 Trump Nevada 36.4 29.9 33.7 Clinton New Hampshire 29.2 37.8 33.0 Bloomberg New Mexico 39.0 32.6 28.4 Clinton North Carolina 33.8 24.0 42.2 Trump Ohio 32.2 28.7 39.1 Trump Pennsylvania 32.8 31.8 35.4 Trump Virginia 35.2 28.8 36.0 Trump Wisconsin 31.0 34.7 34.3 Bloomberg
Clinton holds up well in states such as New Mexico, where Democrats rely on a substantial minority turnout. But she'd be vulnerable in predominantly white states, which would mostly go to Trump (Iowa, Ohio, Minnesota) or in some cases to Bloomberg (Wisconsin, New Hampshire).
As I've said, these scenarios are hypothetical. But I'd encourage you to play around with the numbers yourself and see if you can get a Bloomberg-like third-party candidate within range of an Electoral College victory. More likely, a candidate who appealed to wealthy, secular, cosmopolitan white voters, but not religious whites or working-class whites, and who still ceded most minority voters to Democrats, would have a heck of a time building a plurality (much less a majority) coalition. Essentially, such a candidate would be splitting the Democratic base, while only picking up a few voters who ordinarily vote Republican.
That would be bad news for Clinton, bad news for Bloomberg — and great news for Trump. And despite fanciful maps put forward by Bloomberg's advisors that had him competing in Tennessee and Texas, Bloomberg saw the writing on the wall and decided not to run.

It turns out that there's more than one way for guests to join in on your Chromecast party. In addition to accessing Google's streaming stick via an onscreen PIN code, friends can pair their devices to your living room entertainment setup via inaudible ultrasonic frequencies. Apparently, all one needs to do to enable this is allow the Chromecast to support nearby devices, and it'll push the necessary tones through your flat-screen's speakers, which said gizmos will receive and sync with. If it sounds simple, that's the whole point. As Gigaom tells it, Chromecast engineering manager John Affaki says that this is an effort to make using the HDMI dongle in a social setting much easier. Whether you can trust friends enough for them to not stealth-add Slayer's "Angel of Death" to the next party playlist is up to you, though.
The Rams played their first game back in Los Angeles and invited the Seahawks over to celebrate. Seattle, ever polite, brought a housewarming gift in the form of their worst game in five seasons, losing a 9-3 groaner in 90-degree heat. It's not that I hate the Rams, it's that they make me so damn uncomfortable.
Much of the talk leading up to this game centered around the battle between Seattle's O-line and LA's D-line and it went about exactly the way anyone who's ever watched these teams play each other imagined. the Rams front annihilated. The matchup was Biblical in scope, with the Rams DL boasting four Goliaths while the Seahawks' OL amounted to about one David, collectively. In this version of the story, however, the Goliaths simply stomped David into the ground, raided his pasture, and ate his bleating sheep alive.
The ‘Hawks were out-gunned across the board up front, but nobody took a beating quite like the one Bradley Sowell suffered. Robert Quinn and Aaron Donald spent the entire game dunking on Sowell, beating him with all manner of rush moves. It got so bad that Sowell began jumping the snap just to give himself a chance and while he probably should have been called for a half-dozen false starts along the way, all his premature get-off got him was more embarrassment. One one hand, he has started the season against an unrelenting wave of top-tier pass rushers. On the other hand, Bradley Sowell's picture in the team program is of him lumbering after a defensive end in his own backfield, so...
The consequences of this line-of-scrimmage beatdown was Seattle's skill position players scrambling for survival all game long. Russell Wilson's high-ankle sprain reduced him from multi-dimensional dynamo to cement-footed pocket passer with neither the time nor the mobility to go through his reads. The fact that he was even able to play today was miracle, considering the piano that fell on his foot just seven days ago, but grittiness alone wasn't enough today.
The hope among Seattle fans was that a supposedly healthy Thomas Rawls and an aggressive gameplan would jumpstart the running game and take some of the pressure off of Wilson. That went out the window as soon as the Rams' front seven kicked it in on the first play of the game. Rawls was stopped in the backfield on three of his first four carries and ran for -7 yards on seven carries before limping off the field to be replaced by a much more effective Christine Michael. It was a disappointing return to the starting lineup for Rawls but he also never stood a chance, as he was attempting to dodge tacklers as soon as he got the ball. I haven't heard the nature or extent of his injury yet but here's hoping he didn't suffer too much of a setback.
The lone bright spot on Seattle's offense was Tyler Lockett, consistently got loose early and hauled in three catches for 46 yards before a knee injury forced him out of the game midway through the second quarter as well. Not only did Lockett account for half of his team's total yardage in his brief appearance, he had another 30+ yard grab called back on a petty-ass offensive PI call, one of a staggering three OPI's called on the ‘Hawks this afternoon.
All told, Seattle managed just 147 yards on 36 plays in the first half, a limp performance that net them a measly three points. As Craig Johnstone (who you should definitely be following on Twitter, but only after you sign this waiver) put it:
Watching the Seahawks' offense is like humping concrete — Craig (@MCraigJohnstone) September 18, 2016
As if the injuries (oh yeah, Doug Baldwin also got rolled up on and hobbled through most of the game) and penalties (10 for 118 yards) weren't enough, Seattle's average starting field position was their own 17-yard line, which is like asking a toddler to climb a ladder and then greasing the rungs. Might as well have been starting from underneath their own uprights.
The saving grace for the Seahawks was the continued tenacity of their defense, who held the Rams to 283 total yards just seven days after limiting the Dolphins to 214. They shut down Todd Gurley, holding him to 51 yards on 19 carries, and gang tackling at every turn. They got consistent pressure from Frank Clark, Cliff Avril, Michael Bennett, and Cassius Marsh, recording three sacks despite having a huge one waived off on an incidental facemask* late.
*Of all the baffling rules changes in the NFL over the years, perhaps the most baffling is the erasure of the five-yard facemask penalty. Fifteen yards, automatic first down penalties are game-changers and should only be called in obviously warranted situations. What a weirddumb thing.
And while the Rams' box score doesn't have much to show, and despite the fact that the majority of their plays went for under four yards, they strung together enough mid-range completions to extend drives into Seattle territory. The result was three field goals which should never be sufficient to win an NFL game. Bobby Wagner looked especially good, as did the aforementioned pass rushers and most of the secondary. In fact, there was only one soft spot on the Seahawks defense in this one and that was DeShawn Shead, who was victimized repeatedly by Kenny Britt and Lance Kendricks.
It's not that DeShawn was getting torched, per se, but the guys he guarded were repeatedly able to find just enough space that a well-thrown ball would get the job done. I'm not worried by it and I'm not going to complain about a defense that's allowing 9.5 points per game, but in a contest in which the defense had zero margin for error, that margin was found by targeting Shead.
It wasn't as though Seattle never had a chance, though. Much like last week, Wilson and Co. got the ball back late in the fourth with a couple chances to drive for the winning score. That's when the refs, who'd been stealing scenes all night, took over. On Seattle's penultimate drive, a big first down conversion was called back when yet another questionable offensive pass interference was called against Kearse. After Jon Ryan punted it away for the 42nd consecutive drive, the Rams trickled the ball back up the field before facing a third down with about four minutes left. That's when the dam broke and Marsh came pouring through the gap in LA's OL. As Marsh corralled Case Keenum for the monstrous, field-flipping sack, flags rained down like sprinklers at a dance party. Replays showed that Marsh's hand did make contact with Keenum's facemask and, instead of calling the incidental five-yarder, the draconian rule book decreed a 15-yard penalty and an automatic first down.
Undaunted, the Seahawks D bowed up again, leveraging a couple of big tackles and a holding call against the Rams to give the ball back to the offense with time for one more drive. That's when Lockett, who had apparently talked his knee out of being injured, made his triumphant return. Smoking his man off the line of scrimmage, Lockett found himself hauling in a beautiful lob from Wilson for 53 yards, bringing the ‘Hawks within scoring distance with about a minute and a half to play. Two snaps later, facing a 3rd & 10, Wilson flipped the ball out to C-Mike, who had the ball jarred loose while fighting for the first down. The Rams smothered the ball and proceeded to kneel out the clock, evening the teams' records at 1-1.
Other stuff:
-Christine Michael, game-ending fumble notwithstanding, looked excellent today. Despite the lack of blocking up front, he managed 86 yards on just 13 touches, running quickly and decisively. I feel fine if he's the guy going forward, but the team will be in really great position if they can ever get Rawls fully back as well.
-Injuries, man. They should make them illegal.
-Jimmy Graham keeps looking closer to be all the way back. Graham worked his way back onto the field for the majority of the snaps and finished second on the team in catches (3), yards (42), and targets (4).
-The only player to top Graham in all three categories was Lockett, who had four catches for 99 yards despite only being on the field for four drives. Kid is something special.
-The moments where Frank Clark looks like an all-world defensive lineman are becoming more and more frequent. A constant harrasser of the Rams' backfield, he had a sack where he beat a double team so quickly that they patty-caked each other trying to block him after he zipped between them at the snap. With Bennett and Avril as his mentors, there really is no ceiling for this guy.
-For the second straight week, the Seahawks turned the ball over twice while recording no tunrovers of their own. Fumbles and interceptions are still fairly random occurrences and are difficult to predict, but this is starting to become worrisome.
Look, I'm not going to sugarcoat that game. That's as bad as the Seahawks have been since they've been good. The offensive line is over-matched, literally all of the team's best skill players are hobbling, and they're committing penalties like it's the Purge and they've got one day to get it out of their system. Only problem is they do this seemingly every week. It was ugly and boring and stupid.
That said, this is still a team allowing the fewest points per game and the fewest yards per game of any team in the NFL. They are, believe it or not, tied with everyone else in the division. They've gotten two bad offensive performances out of their system and are in no worse position as it relates to their postseason odds than they were before the season started.
We all knew it could look ugly at the beginning of the season. hell, it almost always does. The team's track record overwhelmingly supports the idea that they will improve mightily as the season goes on and have earned the benefit of my doubt in that regard. Doesn't mean it's not annoying as hell. Next on the docket are the 49ers back in Seattle. Chance to get healthy and feeling good. Onward, upward, and cheers!
On his first trip to Europe since his inauguration last month, Dmitry Medvedev said military expansion led by America and Nato "worried" Moscow and could destroy relations between East and West "in a radical way, for a long time".
Speaking at the end of a day of talks with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, he called for a "regional pact" to replace Cold War peace treaties.
"In the current conditions, with no one wanting war in Europe and with all of us having the experience of the 20th century, such an accord would have all the chances of success," Mr Medvedev said.
He had been expected to strike a more conciliatory tone than his predecessor, Vladimir Putin, and beamed for the cameras after inspecting a guard of honour.
But after talks with Mrs Merkel, he issued a stark warning against American plans to build a missile shield in Europe and Nato's proposed expansion to include Georgia and Ukraine.
"He wants to neutralise Nato expansion, forging agreements between the EU and Russia on many issues, with America not included," said Alexander Rahr, Russia expert at the German Foreign Policy Society.
"But he is also reaching out. He was attentive, not aggressive. He does not want confrontation at the beginning of his presidency.
''But that reminded me of Putin at the beginning of his presidency, so we shall have to see how his term ends."
Russia has vociferously objected to US plans to build a missile interceptor system in Poland and the Czech Republic, which the Pentagon insists is designed against lone missile strikes from rogue states such as North Korea or Iran.
Mr Medvedev also proposed that Europe's energy supply lines be managed by "international consortia" comprising Russian companies, European Union member states and other nations on pipeline networks.
Germany, the world's biggest exporter of goods, spent 20 billion euros (£15.9 million) on oil and gas last year and Mrs Merkel is keen to ensure reliable supplies.
All my family were totally against it. - No one in Zunera Ishaq's family wore the niqab or hijab
She arrived in Canada from Pakistan in 2008.
She decided she wanted to wear her niqab during the citizenship oath... despite a government ban.
And with that, Zunera Ishaq was on her way to becoming perhaps the most pivotal figure of the current federal election campaign.
Last year a federal court judge upheld her challenge of the niqab ban's legality. The Conservative government appealed that decision, but the court sided with Zunera Ishaq once more last month.
And this week, she won another victory when the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed a government request to suspend that ruling, pending a further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
Which means that, for now, Zunera Ishaq is free and clear to wear the niqab while taking her oath... and, if that happens in time, then she can vote come election day later this month.
She likely never imagined at the beginning of this battle just how many other Canadians' voting intentions her case may ultimately sway.
Zunera Ishaq joined Anna Maria in our Toronto studio.

Baltej Singh Dhillon on Racism
After being recruited by the RCMP, Baltej Singh Dhillon, a Sikh Canadian, requested to wear his turban along with the uniform, instead of the traditional Stetson hat. It sparked a great deal of controversy at the time, but in 1990 the policy was officially changed... and Baltej Singh Dhillon became the first turbaned RCMP cadet.
Here he is, reflecting on growing up facing racist taunts, and what it meant to be finally accepted by a Canadian insitution such as the RCMP.
Minister insists bank's green mission will be protected as they remove the clause that ensures it invests in renewable power and other green projects
The bank set up by the government to fund green infrastructure and cited frequently by David Cameron as evidence of the UK's leadership on climate change will no longer be required by law to invest in green schemes, under moves put forward by ministers.
Campaigners said that changes proposed on Tuesday by small business minister Anna Soubry effectively delete the clause enshrined in legislation that gives the green investment bank its green purpose.
But ministers insist the bank's green mission will still be protected through a ‘special share'.
The £3.8bn bank was established in 2012 to “accelerate the UK's transition to a greener, stronger economy” by investing in renewable energy and other “green” schemes.
It is frequently highlighted by government ministers, including the prime minister and the chancellor, as a key plank of the government's green credentials. Cameron cited it at UN climate meetings as a “world first”.
But the government announced last June that it would be privatised to raise more private money and cut government borrowing.
That prompted MPs on the environmental audit committee, to warn that the sell-off would strip it of its legal requirement to invest in green projects.
At the bank's beginning, the government argued that the clause guaranteeing its green mission was legislated for because “legislation provides that the bank will always have a green purpose clause”. Soubry's proposed amendment to the enterprise bill drops the clause from law.
The Green party leader, Natalie Bennett said: “There's always been a big question mark over exactly how green the green investment bank actually is and should the government remove the green purpose from the bank, then it'll be yet another example of greenwashing from this government.
“I don't want the bank to be privatised at all, but at very least, its environmental credentials should be protected and then enhanced so that it can be a reliable source of ethical investment.”
Sepi Golzari-Munro, head of the UK programme at environmental thinktank E3G, which has criticised the sell-off, said: “We need investment in essential infrastructure, everyone accepts that. After Paris [the international climate deal agreed in December] we know that we're heading towards a net zero [emissions] future.”
“Even the Institute for Fiscal Studies says the government's flagship attempts to encourage private investment have been disappointing. But in contrast the green investment bank has been one of government's most successful vehicles for getting investment in infrastructure.”
But ministers and government officials argue that the bank's commitment to green sectors will be protected by a special share held by an independent company.
“To ensure the bank's green credentials are maintained it plans to put a special share structure in place that protects its green mission and keeps it focused on what it does best,” said the business secretary, Sajid Javid, announcing the share earlier this month, after the government's initial plan to remove the ‘green lock' was defeated in the Lords last year.
Officials said the clause has to be removed from legislation in order for the bank to be removed from government books and sold off.
A Department for Business Innovation and Skills spokesman said: “Investors recognise that the green investment bank's unique green specialism is its core strength and where its value lies, and in addition the independent special shareholder will be focused solely on advancing environmental protection.
“By putting in place a special share, we can protect GIB's green mission while attracting much more capital, which all parties are agreed is a positive step.”
Sources close to the privatisation process also said the bank's green purpose would be guaranteed until the special share is in place. Neither the government nor bank will be able to influence the appointment of the three trustees for the special shareholder, they said.
Golzari-Munro said that the special share would be a much weaker form of protection than legislation, as it could be more easily unpicked.
“The green vision is not safe. It can be changed in the future according to company law, they won't need to come in front of parliament and have public scrutiny. Who knows, there was even talk of it investing in fracking in the past,” she told the Guardian.
The green investment bank declined to comment.

Swatch is not necessarily a brand that pops to mind these days, especially when it comes to mechanical watches. Yes, Swatch was extremely popular during its heyday back in the 1980's but since then has been perhaps more of a novelty. This month, Swatch introduced a new watch, and a new movement, that it hopes will help it regain some of its former glory.
The watch is the Swatch Sistem51 and while it seems an odd name when you look at the stats behind the watch it falls into place. First off, the movement in the watch is a self-winding automatic movement made entirely of an alloy of copper, nickel and zinc called ARCAP. The material has strong anti-magnetic properties and is hermetically sealed within the watch's case to prevent any foreign substances from entering and interfering with the movement's performance. Incredibly the Sistem51 movement is made up of exactly 51 components. Most mechanical watches will have two or three times the number of parts (if not many more) than the Sistem51, which was engineered as a more simple and efficient design. All 51 components are linked together as a single piece and centered on a single screw. Swatch calls it “a Copernican idea in contemporary terms” as Copernicus was the one who put the sun at the center of the solar system.
Swatch has the movement also boasting another first: the assembly of the movement is 100% automated. And in another hi-tech move the rate of the movement is set by a laser as the escapement has no regulator. Swatch claims this will prevent the need for manual adjustments during the lifetime of the watch. Along with all of that they managed to obtain 90 hours of power reserve for the movement.
It is a very interesting looking watch, yet still 100% Swatch. It has the familiar Swatch-styled case that is quite unmistakable. The dial hails back to the Copernicus ideal with a star pattern around the center of the dial. As an interesting touch much of the watch is transparent including the bi-directional rotor which offers an unobstructed view of the movement underneath.
The Swatch Sistem51 is a fascinating watch with some very forward-thinking design. The assembly of the movement being automated, the regulation via a laser all seem very next level in terms of watch making. It will be interesting to see if the Sistem51 can capture the interest of watch-enthusiasts and the general public when it is available.

The so-called bathroom wars have nothing to do with bathrooms but are all about war. The push to allow a person to use the bathroom of his or her choice is merely the latest phase of the sexual revolution. It is part of a relentless war to bring about an irrational equality that now seeks to break down the final public barriers that make the sexes different.
Let's face it. Once it is held that anyone can use the bathroom that he or she feels comfortable with, the words “men” and “women” on the door are meaningless since anyone can enter. According to the strange logic of the bathroom warriors, either you build equal bathrooms for every “gender” that appears on the scene—and there are some 60 of them out there—or you integrate them all into one (or two) bathrooms, everyone can use indiscriminately. Obviously, the latter is the only economically viable solution.
Thus, this is more than just making people feel comfortable; it is the beginning of the end of sex-segregated bathroom, locker rooms or other private places. It is a true culture shift that turns one's biological sex from a social and public reality to a mere private opinion, whim or fantasy.
The so-called bathroom wars are not only about sexual predators, as many maintain. There will definitely be those who use the new bathroom rules to open doors to prey upon their victims. However, it is all about taking away the vestiges of modesty, decency and the sense of shame that remain in society. This strong layer of protection for both men and women in their most private moments is removed.
The virtue of modesty is part of a moral framework that serves as a reasonable restraint on the less violent human passions. Modesty governs exterior actions so that they might conform to the demands of decency, propriety and decorousness that come from human nature and social mores. Attire, manner of speech, the relationships between the sexes all enter into this framework to keep society balanced and virtuous. When natural decency and modesty are not respected, the dignity of human nature is easily degraded to brutish levels.
Thus, it is no surprise in today's hyper-sexualized and violent world that there would be those who call for throwing off all restraints and taboos. They would target modesty since it is that natural and delicate sense of restraint to all acts that give rise to shame. All that safeguards a much-needed chastity must be destroyed.
Thus, contrary to the propaganda, this is not about forcing people to be uncomfortable. There never has been, nor will there be police checking identities or self-identities at every bathroom door. This is all about honoring and preserving those time-tested rules that enable society to function and that help individuals maintain their personal dignity.
Finally, the so-called bathroom wars have nothing to do with reality. It has everything to do with empowering the fantasies of those who wish to escape the restraints of identity and reason.
This new activism involves the empowering of fantasy, which by definition is the power or process of creating unrealistic or improbable mental images in response to psychological whims. In times past, those with fantasies were called down to the reality found in society and nature. Today, society as a whole is being asked to pander to and be complicit with the unnatural fantasies of a few.
Yes, the so-called bathroom war is not about bathrooms and all about war. It is a new phase of the Culture War. Those who thought the war was over with their surrender to same-sex “marriage” will come to see that it is only the beginning.
This new phase is an extension and radicalization of what came before. The difference is that the old phase destroyed external structures—tradition, custom, or community—that hindered self-fulfillment and pleasure. The new phase seeks to destroy those internal structures—reason, identity, and the sense of being—that impede the “right” to instant gratification.
The old phase of the Culture War still worked inside the social structures that it destroyed and thus offered more opportunities for people to resist. The new phase assaults the very core of being and identity. It is more tyrannical and allows for little opposition. Anyone who disagrees is immediately and furiously attacked—individuals, businesses and even whole states. If there is to be a return to order, then society must recognize this new development for what it is. This is no frivolous bathroom war but a Culture War so total that it extends even to the use of the bathroom.
When organizations begin to think of users as cattle instead of unicorns we begin to remove their pride for, and their responsibility to, an organization. When responsibility for their actions are only out of necessity or self-preservation then you have lost the battle, but not necessarily the war. You can change people's mindset but it just may take a little more effort.
I believe that people are the answer to most security problems. Empowering people by making them part of your security team enhances their awareness and fosters a sense of shared responsibility. Organizations that encourage (and consistently preach) a shared responsibility will have continual communication and awareness of their responsibilities in order to protect themselves and their fellow employees. Those organizations that treat employee's as another expense (or cattle) will push their employees away which allows them to disassociate themselves from their responsibility. You have now created more resistance, and ultimately your security team has another force fighting against them – and not with them.
Cattle organizations encourage people to use their creativity in an unproductive way. The results include employees who attempt to bypass your security measures, instead of identifying and reporting potential incidents. Most organizations have warmed up to the idea of phishing simulations (I hope your organization has) to provide an immersive and lifelike training experience. Some cattle organizations have gone as far as to let go of employees that fail these tests. By taking this approach, you have now forced your employees to either report everything, report nothing, or use creative ways to fight against the security team instead of for it. Employees in a cattle organization will begin to use their creativity to bypass their training by creating Outlook rules to detect these simulations, or completely ignoring (caring) about a new face walking through the halls. The first question that should come to your mind is, why are my employees doing this. The second is identifying and preventing these (negative) creative ideas within your environment.
Unicorns are majestic and beautiful creatures. Organizations and security teams that believe, and routinely encourage, their employees have equal (shared) responsibility for the protection of their organization, their data, and ultimately their job, will obtain an army of security agents to constantly watch for suspicious activity both digitally and physically. Our security teams now have more actionable intelligence to do their jobs successfully.
Just imagine, if everyone (Finance, HR, System Administrators, Shipping, etc.) in your organization is encouraged to protect themselves, their fellow employees, and their organization from suspicious email, people, system configurations, and so on. If you have worked in security for any amount of time you know that the best information about problems or incidents comes from employees. Unicorn organizations create a culture of responsibility – a stake-hold of sorts – which enables a form of peer pressure to report and communicate any suspicious activity. I don't know about you, but I would rather believe in unicorns than step in cow shit.

Leila Abdelrazaq elaborates on her representation of the Palestinian diaspora and the ability for comics to convey dense issues in a more easily digestible format.
For artist and organizer Leila Abdelrazaq, comics are a means of communication as much as a beautiful mode of self-expression. In her solo show, Drawing the Diaspora: Comic Art & Graphic Novels by Leila Abderazaq, at the Arab American National Museum (AANM), the Palestinian-American artist presents common narratives of the Palestinian refugee and immigrant experience. The goal, she has said, is to connect with and instruct a Western audience that may be less familiar with these stories.
On display at the AANM are selections from Baddawi, Abdelrazaq's debut graphic novel, which interprets her father's life experiences, growing up in the 1960s and '70s amidst the civil war and the Palestinian refugee camps of Lebanon and Beirut. Other works on display include Mariposa Road, a short comic highlighting an intersectional fight for Palestinian and undocumented rights, through the true story of two men from Gaza who enter the United States undocumented via the US– Mexico border.
Her work promotes a sense of solidarity amongst marginalized voices, as with her #Arabs4BlackPower series, which is meant to highlight the tangible connections between the Palestinian struggle and the Black struggle in the United States, and features captions in both Arabic and English.
I spoke with Abdelrazaq over e-mail and asked her how she characterizes her own work, which defies easy interpretation as either art or activism. She elaborated on the themes she tackles, including the representation of the Palestinian diaspora, and the ability for comics to convey dense and complex issues in a more easily digestible format.
* * *
Sarah Rose Sharp: It seems like your work is largely politically motivated. Was that a conscious decision on your part, to use comics as a platform for activism, or were you just drawn to this subject matter naturally?
Leila Abdelrazaq: Since I was a teenager and began developing a political awareness, I have always been making art to explore a variety of political themes. I actually studied theater in college and realized that for me, the most important thing is selecting the medium that will best communicate my message in any given project. So my commitment artistically is definitely more to my message than any particular medium necessarily.
SRS: Do you consider yourself a comic book artist? A political activist?
LA: I consider myself an artist and an organizer.
SRS: I know you reference Palestinian graphic artist Naji-al-Ali and his popular charcter Handala, a childlike character that symbolizes Palestinian refugees, in the exhibit. Can you say more about what you find inspiring about that character or approach?
LA: I admire artists who communicate their political messages in a clear and beautiful way, without necessarily hitting people over the head with the message, and while still creating beautiful works that are emotionally evocative. The thing I find incredible about Naji al-Ali's work is his use of symbolism and how expressive his stark, black-and-white images are. In many ways I see my work drawing on traditions he established and strategies he utilized to create his images.
SRS: It strikes me that you have a strong mastery of both the narrative, graphic, and infographic aspects of your medium. How long have you been drawing? Do you work in other media, as well?
LA: I've been drawing since I was a kid, though I was never formally trained in it. My love for visual art got me into theater — I was drawn to set design and construction (I currently work part time in a wood shop). I also did a bit of directing in college, but lately I've really returned to my roots as a visual artist.
SRS: What inspires you to take on a subject? Are you drawn to the narrative elements, or the visual, or the political?
LA: Generally speaking, the political is the impetus for a lot of my work. It's not that other things don't inspire me. But the big projects that feel urgent and worthy of the most labor are the ones with a strong political grounding. Story and visuals come as I think about the work and the message I want to send with it.
SRS: I don't know if you're familiar with the Art Spiegelman story Maus, but Baddawi reminded me very much of that.
LA: I'm of course very familiar with MAUS, it's an incredible work.
SRS: In Maus, the victims of genocide and ethnic cleansing are Polish Jews, and in Baddawi, just 20 years later, these same atrocities are being perpetuated by the Israeli army and people. Do you think we are able to learn from the past? Do these stories help us to make different decisions? Or are they more a way for you and others to process or express themselves?
LA: I'm honestly so cynical, I really believe that humanity repeats its mistakes over and over and continually fails to learn from the past. I've been feeling that way especially as I see what the Syrian regime and its supporters have been allowed to get away with. And despair does warrant processing, and for that art can be useful. But for me it goes beyond that.
SRS: What are your hopes for your stories?
LA: Part of it is preserving our histories — ones that some don't deem important enough to write down, or maybe too despicable, or not “reliable” or “balanced” enough to be valid. I think that's a big value of this work — preserving history and memory, especially in the face of ethnic cleansing and erasure, is an act of political resistance. But I don't think art alone can change the world or prevent atrocities. I think it can change the way people think though, and give them knowledge and courage to behave in different ways.
SRS: What would you like people to know about the Palestinian diaspora? What do you think people see, versus what you see? How has your international upbringing given you a different perspective on everyday life and geopolitics?
LA: People in the US, often subconsciously, see the country as the world. I feel there is a lack of awareness of other places, and how we impact one another in a global sense. I want people to know that Palestinians, as a diasporic people who continue to survive ethnic cleansing, live all over the world. I want people to know that there is no one way to be Palestinian — that Palestinians living in the West Bank lead radically different lives than ones living in the '48 territories (“Israel”), or Gaza, or in the Palestinian camps in Lebanon, or diaspora Palestinians living in the US or UK or Chile or anywhere else — that there are as many experiences of being Palestinian as there are Palestinians in the world, and none are more “real” or “legitimate” than others. I hope my work can give people a heightened awareness of the many faces and facets of the global Palestinian diaspora and an understanding of the ways and reasons that we resist ethnic cleansing and colonialism from our various vantage points.
Drawing the Diaspora: Comic Art & Graphic Novels by Leila Abderazaq continues at the Arab American National Museum (13624 Michigan Ave, Dearborn, Mich.) through April 19.
Super Wants AHHS Whistleblower Fired
by Betty Brink
It is not official yet — the Fort Worth school trustees as well as a Texas Education Agency hearings examiner will still have to hear his case — but if they uphold district superintendent Melody Johnson's recommendation, former Arlington Heights High School assistant principal and whistle blower Joe Palazzolo will soon be looking for work. Johnson wants him fired.
“Melody Johnson should resign or be fired herself for her handling of this case,” said Jason Smith, Palazzolo's attorney. “This is a classic institutional response [to a whistle blower] – don't fix the problem, attack the messenger. … Joe has been a teacher for 12 years, been with this district for three years. He reported violations of the law, misuse of funds, and only after that did the district go after him.”
Last spring, allegations of sexual harassment, attendance fraud and mishandling of booster club funds were among the most serious charges brought against persons in principal Neta Alexander's administration by Palazzolo and a dozen or more teachers at the school, triggering a lengthy, internal investigation. Johnson, sources close to the investigation say, has also recommended that Alexander be fired as well for her role in the scandal that has shaken the venerable old school to its foundations.
Those allegations were first made public by Fort Worth Weekly in August. Shortly after, Alexander and assistant superintendent Chuck Boyd, who was also alleged to have been involved in the scandal, were placed on administrative leave with pay.
Sources within the administration say that the district has upheld most of the allegations, first reported to the district in May by Palazzolo and the teachers, many of whom said in their signed statements that they had been reporting the problems to Alexander and even to its board representative Judy Needham for years to no avail.
The attendance fraud, which included changing the attendance records of more than 20 seniors with high truancy rates allowing them to graduate in order to keep the school's completion rate high, is being laid at the feet of Izzy Perry, the former Heights girls' athletic director, and former Heights assistant principal Harold Nichols, sources said. Both resigned in June. Boyd, a long-time friend of Perry's who was accused of protecting her, is likely facing a non-renewal of his contract, these same sources said.
Adding to the district's woes, the Tarrant County district attorney's office is currently investigating the misuse of the school's booster club funds.
Despite the fact that so many of the allegations reported by Palazzolo and the teachers have been upheld, Johnson has recommended that Palazzolo be fired on the grounds that when he was hired by the Fort Worth district three years ago, he failed to report two misdemeanor convictions that happened in Oklahoma 13 and 20 years ago. One was for failing to pay past-due child support following a “rough period of unemployment,” he said. The money was repaid and he became current with his payments, he said. A check of federal and state court records show that there have been no other child-support issues filed against Palazzolo since that time. The second had to do with a security firm he owned in 1988 when an employee allowed her security license to expire without his knowledge. As the owner, he was charged with a misdemeanor violation of a state licensing act and fined, he said.
The “failure to report” accusation has replaced the district's earlier reason for placing him on administrative leave shortly after school began this year: an alleged complaint filed against him a year ago by a former Heights student who has since graduated. She said that Palazzolo refused her entrance to a school dance on grounds that she had been drinking, which the student denied, and that Palazzolo put his hands on her shoulders during the incident.
Palazzolo and his representatives say both charges are without merit, both on procedural and factual grounds.
According to both Palazzolo and Larry Shaw, head of the county's largest teachers' group, administrators who told Palazzolo on Wednesday that his firing was being recommended said it was because he had failed to report felonies. But Palazzolo, Shaw, and Palazzolo's attorney Jason Smith all said that Palazzolo has no felonies on his record in any state. A computer search of federal and state court records appears to bear out their contention.
“When I questioned an administrator about this, she told me his crime was a felony,” Shaw said. “I said ‘No, it is a misdemeanor.' She insisted, ‘No, it is a felony.'”
Palazzolo said it is true that he did not list the misdemeanor convictions on his employment application three years ago – because he believed he was only required to report felonies. Although the district's current application asks for felonies and misdemeanors, Shaw said that for years the applications for employment in the district only asked applicants to report “felony convictions.”
Palazzolo understood that he had to report any felony convictions and did not know that he had to report misdemeanors, he said. A copy of the two-year contract that Palazzolo signed as well as the employee handbook in force at the time of his hiring specify that only felonies or certain other crimes that relate to an employee's fitness for dealing with children, such as sex- or drug-related charges or crimes against children are reportable.
Moreover, the district did a criminal background check on Palazzolo at the time of his hiring and again a year later when he was promoted to assistant principal. Nothing appeared. Palazzolo passed criminal checks that were done in earlier years when he served for 14 years in the U.S. Army and when he worked for the Government Services Administration.
The complaint against Palazzolo by the former student was based on an incident that allegedly happened at the homecoming dance last year. After the district told Palazzolo about the complaint that they said was filed a year ago, officials refused to tell him who had filed it.
When he learned the specifics of the complaint this week (after reading the names of the complainants in the Star-Telegram) Palazzolo said he remembered the incident, and that he never touched the young woman, who at that time was the Heights' student body president.
“I was one of five assistant principals at the dance, along with about three Fort Worth police officers,” he said. “We [the principals] were not checking the students for alcohol, the police officers were. I remember this young woman, and she was not accused of drinking, her date was. I think the parents were called, since that would have been the policy, and if it had been my daughter, that's exactly what I would have wanted done.”
Shaw, head of the United Educators Association, said firing Palazzolo is the administration's way of sending a message to employees not to bring forward any allegations of wrongdoing. “This has happened too much in the past,” he said, “with this administration finding a way to get rid of people it doesn't want. But this time Joe is fighting back.”
The past year has been a roller coaster for Palazzolo and his family. After he first reported the wrongdoings, the district transferred him to a lower position at another school with a cut in pay, citing a “poor evaluation” from his principal Alexander. When Palazzolo refused the transfer and filed a grievance against the district charging retaliation, Johnson pulled back, allowed her deputy superintendent to change the evaluation to a positive one and sent him to an assistant principal's job at Western Hills High School. The job at Western Hills lasted about a week before he was put on administrative leave with pay because of the complaint that had surfaced that dated back more than a year — even though district policy and state law state that any complaint against a teacher must be filed within ten days and that during that time the teacher must be given notice of the complaint and its contents.
The district chose to ignore its own policy and state law, Palazzolo, Smith and Shaw all pointed out. Not only was it out of time, Palazzolo said, he never heard of the complaint until the district used it to justify his suspension in late August. Even then, the district would not tell him who the complainant was nor would they tell him its contents.
When this paper asked for a copy of the complaint, it was told that the information was confidential and part of “an investigation.”
Shaw said that when Palazzolo was first transferred in early June, his group represented him.. “I sat with him and Neta Alexander and asked her if there were any complaints against Joe in his file, she had the file in her lap, and she said ‘No, none.'”
“Now a year later a complaint pops up? No way,” Shaw said. “I believe the district is going to have a very tough time proving they have grounds for termination once Joe's case gets before the TEA hearings examiner. …That hearing will be completely independent, and in the past the Commissioner of Education has set the bar very high on termination cases,” Shaw said.

Getting up close and personal with the MX-5 RF showcases the slightly improved refinement and premium design. The fashionable Targa-style roof gives it an advantage in the style stakes, but we'll have to wait until next year before we get behind the wheel ourselves. Still, our first impressions suggest it won't be any kind of letdown.
When Mazda tinkers with the MX-5 it certainly doesn't go unnoticed. The new “Retractable Fastback”, or MX-5 RF for short, caused quite a stir when it was revealed at the New York Motor Show back in March.
Rather than think of the RF as a hard-roofed drop-top like the previous MX-5 Roadster Coupe, consider it instead predominantly as a coupe but with an occasional supply of fresh air. This is our first taste of the RF as we get an exclusive preview from the passenger seat.
• Best convertibles cars to buy right now
The focal point, obviously, is the roof. Pressing the button under the air-con controls starts the folding ritual, with it dancing away in four parts. The rear fins are raised, two roof segments disappear along with the rear windows, and then the fins return to position. It takes all of 12 seconds and can be operated at up to 6mph.
Image 2 of 7 Image 2 of 7
With the roof stowed, the rear section resembles the ‘flying buttresses' that were a feature of the old Jaguar XJ-S. In the process Mazda has made the RF look more expensive than its expected £21,000 price when it goes on sale in the autumn.
Alongside the soft-top we brought for company, the RF looks incredibly sleek and is, to us, the more attractive MX-5.
Closed up again, and thanks to the insulated roof parts made of plastic, the Fastback is quieter and more comfortable than the soft-top roadster.
When driving the RF with its top down, the cabin can become a bit blustery. The absence of the small roof section isn't the issue, it's more the fact there's no rear wind deflector; put down the windows and things become decidedly breezy. Perhaps a small wind deflector may well solve that issue, which has been promised on production models.
Mazda plans to offer the RF with a choice between the standard MX-5's sweet-shifting six-speed manual gearbox or the six-speed automatic transmission that was fitted to our test car. The auto will make up just five per cent of RF sales in the UK.
Image 3 of 7 Image 3 of 7
The self-shifter has a sports button in front of the gearlever to sharpen the throttle response and ferocity of gearshifts. Mazda has also tweaked the suspension and steering to work with the RF's additional 40kg, so it's softer than the standard roadster. Enthusiasts shouldn't worry, though, as the RF is still a sports car.
The exclusive metallic matrix grey paint of our model makes it look as if it's been cast from one piece of metal, while the central roof section can be finished in the body colour or gloss black.
The RF is expected to carry a price premium of round £2,500 over the soft-top MX-5, and order books will open some time in the autumn, with deliveries scheduled for early next year. We'd wager that the first RFs to hit the road will be admired as much as the MX-5 was in the early nineties.
Eight people have been shot dead, including the shooter, inside of a Texas home on Sunday during a football watch party.
Police officers responded to calls of shots fired at a single-family home in the 1700 block of West Spring Creek Parkway, near Custer Road in Plano around 8pm.
An officer who was nearby responded to the scene and fatally shot the suspect, who was male, authorities said.
Of the officer, who has not been publicly named, Plano Police Department spokesman David Tilley told CBS Dallas: 'He actually heard gunshots and that's when he made entry into the house.
'That's when he observed several victims inside then engaged the suspect. And that's when he shot him.'

It was not immediately clear if the shooter knew the victims.
Two other people at the home were shot and have been hospitalized; their conditions were not known.
The identities of the victims or the shooter have not been released.
No officers were injured in the incident in Plano, which is a suburb north of Dallas.
'I've been here all my life,' Tilley told the Dallas Morning News. 'I've never heard of anything like this.'
Authorities said all of the victims were adults. A motive for the shooting has not been released, as police are still investigating.
The shooting reportedly happened during a Dallas Cowboys watch party.

Witness Crystal Sugg, who works nearby the scene, described what she witnessed outside of the home before the shooting started to Allison Harris, a reporter with Fox 4.
Sugg said she saw a man arguing with a woman outside of the home and said you couldn't really hear what the disagreement was about.
'And as they were arguing, the woman was trying to go back in,' Sugg said.
'As she was going back in the house, you see the man pull out his gun and started releasing.
'So as he released, I ran back in because I didn't want to get hit by nothing.'
Steven Featherland said he heard between 30 to 40 rounds go off at the scene of the shooting.
'I pulled up and cops were already positioning themselves,' Featherland told the Fox4 News reporter.

'I heard you know the first couple of shots and we came outside. Next thing you know all you heard was pop, pop, pop, pop... there was like 30, 40 rounds. That's when we both went inside.'
It is not clear if those shots also include the bullets fired by responding police officers.
Another neighbor, Lauryn Nichols, is shocked by the incident and said she had a friend who was in the house.
Nichols said she's not sure if her friend made it out before the shooting or not.
'I'm worried,' Nichols told the newspaper. 'It's like one big family here in Plano.'
More than 30 police officers were at the scene Sunday night continuing to investigate, the Dallas Morning News reported.
Police were expected to be at the home throughout the night, the newspaper reports.
The Texas Rangers were responding to the scene to lead the investigation because a Plano officer was involved, according to the newspaper.
Starting tomorrow (June 7) about 9.2 million Chinese high-school students will take nine hours of tests that will determine where they go to university. Taxis have been ordered to be silent near testing centers and construction crews have been sent home. To prevent cheating via listening devices, schools in the northeast have installed metal detectors and warned female students that even bras with metal clips will be confiscated.
China's national college entrance exam, or the gaokao, is criticized for how much stress it causes. Nervous breakdowns and suicides aren't uncommon—students have been in cram classes, often for more than 10 hours straight over the past year. But it's even more stressful for students from rural parts of the country who need to score especially high to get into one of the top universities. China's best schools like Peking University and Tsinghua in Beijing, or Fudan University in Shanghai, for example, give preference to students who have resident status in those cities and take the exam locally.
This preferential treatment is one of the top complaints among young Chinese. At the heart of it is the hukou, China's national household registration system that dates back to the 1950s. Under it, China's millions of migrant workers and their families aren't eligible for public benefits in the cities they move to, and their children have to return to their hometowns to take the gaokao. Officials worry that the presence of such large, transient populations in cities is breeding social instability. Authorities estimate that 37% (paywall) of Beijing's 20 million residents do not have a Beijing hukou.
Thus, hukou reform is at the top of the new leadership's agenda. And some of that reform has begun with the gaokao, which as we've said before, is possibly the lowest hanging fruit of needed policy revision. Reforms announced last year are now going into effect. In Beijing this year, children of migrant workers who have worked and contributed to state social insurance for at least three years can take exams for secondary vocational schools (paywall), though not universities, if they completed middle school there. In Guangdong province, starting in 2016, children of workers who have worked and contributed to social insurance for three or more years will be eligible to take the local university exam.
Similar reforms are being instituted in eastern Jiangsu province and also in Henan province. Authorities say that this year 30,000 university spots will be reserved for students from rural areas of the country for an 8.6% increase in enrollment by rural students at China's top schools.
The reforms may not be fast enough to meet the growth in Chinese demand for good higher education. More and more families can afford to send their children to universities. Already thousands of Chinese are going to Hong Kong and Singapore to take the SAT, the American version of the gaokao, so they can apply for US universities. It's spawned a small industry known as “exam tourism” (paywall). The number of Chinese nationals enrolled at US universities has tripled in the last five years.

This is a jaw-dropping, masterfully done comic book. Godzilla: Half Century War #1 is as good as it gets. Whether you are fan of Godzilla or not -- why the hell aren't you a fan of Godzilla, jerk?-- this comic delivers. It's huge in scope and drawn so perfectly, you'll wonder why you bothered buying any other comic books this week. This one has has it all.
James Stokoe writes and draws this book better than you can possibly imagine. His finely detailed artwork covers every page, giving each and every panel a truly epic feel. Seriously, at least once per page I thought “damn, that should be a poster!” As Godzilla tears through the city, you get see every window break, every car smashed, every building burned. Even if you know absolutely nothing about the giant, mega-ton lizard, do yourself a favor and just peek into this book when you are at your shop. I guarantee that you will be blown away. This art is, dare I say, perfect.
Art aside, what really makes this book work is the way Stokoe tells his story. All of the IDW Godzilla books have been pretty good, but they have always focused on the bigger story; the story of several monsters tearing the world apart. Stokoe tells the story of one guy, Lieutenant Ota Murakami, and his battle to save the citizens of Tokyo from Godzilla's rampage. It's a story told from the street, from the view of a single tank commander. It's engaging, thrilling and beautiful. I can't stress this enough, folks, buy this book. It's a must-read and I must own.

President Barack Obama has begun 2014 by following up on a vow he made in 2013—to further strengthen gun control.
Obama failed in 2013 to win enough support in the U.S. Congress for tougher background checks for gun purchases and new limits on assault weapons. Obama said his proposed changes were among his highest priorities in the wake of the shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. When legislation failed, Obama said he would do "whatever it takes" to bring new controls and issued 25 executive orders intended to tighten rules for gun ownership.
And on Jan. 3, while still on vacation in Hawaii, Obama proposed two new regulations aimed at clarifying restrictions on gun ownership for the mentally ill and strengthening a database used for background checks before firearm purchases.
The first action, proposed by the Department of Justice that will not require Congressional approval, would clarify who is prohibited from possessing firearms because of mental illness and would outline for states what information can be shared with the federal database.
The department will seek public comment over the next 90 days about whether the ban should encompass people under the age of 18 who were either adjudicated by a court to be suffering from a serious mental illness, or who were involuntarily treated for a mental illness.
The second measure, led by the Department of Health and Human Services, would remove barriers that could prevent states from passing on information to the database.
"The administration's two new executive actions will help ensure that better and more reliable information makes its way into the background check system," the White House said in a statement on Friday.
Mental health advocates have expressed some concern that somehow, whether intentionally by a hacker or unintentionally through bureaucratic bungling, mental health data could be made public.
Being 'the kids own show that adults adore' brings more risk than the phrase suggests. Having to appeal to a wide range of ages has occasionally meant Doctor Who has run foul of moral outrage, the parents of traumatised children, and idiots who think that kids' TV is automatically rubbish. On top of that, the show's strong performance despite its budget, and its reputation as child-friendly have given it problems within the BBC itself. That's before you take into account fandom, behind-the-scenes infighting, an ageing audience, and increased media focus in the twenty-first century.
Here, then, are fifty controversial incidents from the history of Doctor Who.
50. Bug-Eyed Monsters
Sydney Newman, a genius of telly, occasionally had his off-days. One of his stipulations in the creation of Doctor Who was the lack of any 'BEMs', or 'Bug Eyed Monsters'. He was therefore quite annoyed with Producer Verity Lambert at the prospect of the Daleks, having envisioned the show as being more educational. Lambert and Script Editor David Whittaker had to fight to include the monsters. The rest, as they say, is Terry Nation's bank balance.
49. William Hartnell
On top of the notorious 'Billy-fluffs', where Hartnell would mangle his lines due to a combination of intense production schedules, illness, and as a deliberate character trait, Hartnell was a difficult man. He had his favourites amongst the guest actors, and wanted things to be just so. His attitudes to race and religion have also been remarked on by Nicholas Courtney and Anneke Wills, who attributed anti-Semitic and racist comments to Hartnell respectively. Yet, actors from those backgrounds spoke of getting on well with the actor. The issue will most likely remain inexactly detailed, a complex and unedifying blight.
48. Regeneration
Without regeneration we wouldn't be discussing the show's 50th Anniversary, yet in 1966 the first regeneration did not go swimmingly. BBC archives show a generally negative reaction to the Second Doctor: 'Most of the comment centred round Patrick Troughton as Doctor Who. Much of this took critical form.' Though there is some positive comment in the report, the words 'idiotic new character', 'playing for laughs', and 'His character is peculiar in an unappealing way' are among the choice criticisms.
My personal favourite is 'I feel the character is over-exaggerated – whimsical even.'
Hindsight, eh?
47. Patrick Troughton's Affairs
A recent biography of Troughton revealed that his personal life was chaotic, littered with affairs, cover-ups, and indiscretions. The Second Doctor was a very tactile man, and his attitude caused difficulties for his wives and children.
Also he liked to pee on golf courses, but that's not so much controversial as just a bit weird.
46. Toberman
The character of Toberman was written as deaf, and wearing a hearing aid. Roy Stewart was cast, but the hearing aid and the deafness was lost en route to the screen. Thus, we have a black man who barely speaks a word, and is treated as a primitive and a slave.
When showing Tomb of the Cybermen to people for the first time, the explanation of 'He was meant to be deaf' really doesn't help.
45. Questions and test-tubes > Scientists in mini-skirts
Barry Letts and Terrance Dicks inherited the character of Liz Shaw from the previous production team. As a scientist, albeit one whose interest in mini-skirts coincided with being drafted into a top secret military organisation, it was felt that her character made it harder to provide exposition. As a result, she was replaced by someone who could 'pass the Doctor his test-tubes and tell him how brilliant he was.'
This continues to be a source for debate, as it implies Doctor Who's lead female role cannot be anything but intellectually limited, proposing characteristics such as feistiness, bravery, feistiness, curiosity and feistiness as positive alternatives.
44. Terror of the Autons, Police and troll dolls
Not content with revealing policemen to be blank faced, gun-handed Autons, Robert Holmes further destroys your sanity by making you afraid of flowers, chairs, and your teddy bear.
Amazingly, there were complaints. Barry Letts took these on board, rather than issue a statement demanding that the nation's children 'Man the hell up'.
43. We've got the wrong Sarah-Jane
For years, it was known that another actress had initially won the role of Sarah-Jane Smith, and that Lis Sladen had come in after it hadn't worked out. Research for The Invasion of the Dinosaurs DVD discovered it was in fact April Walker, and it was because Jon Pertwee felt she was physically imposing and had poor chemistry with him. Barry Letts let Walker go, paying her in full for her Season 11 contract.
42. Pertwee, money, and leaving
The team was breaking up. Roger Delgado had died. Terrance Dicks, Barry Letts and Katy Manning were leaving. Jon Pertwee decided to leave as well, partly to avoid being typecast. The man himself also stated that his request for a raise had been turned down, leading to speculation that his departure was motivated by money. More likely, he was planning on leaving anyway but thought 'What the hell?'
41. 'He's a Chinese...'
At the time of The Talons of Weng-Chieng it was not unknown for Caucasian actors to play characters of other ethnic backgrounds using make-up. It had been common practice previously. Now, though, it looks both racist and desperately unconvincing. The fact that a group of Chinese criminals features one Asian actor and then some stuntmen in make-up makes the distinction all the more apparent. Li H'Sen Cheng comments 'I understand that we all look alike', and that's even more untrue when John Wu is standing next to Pat Gorman.
40. Hinchcliffe and Holmes vs Mary Whitehouse
In making the show for 'the intelligent fourteen year old' (but without actually telling anyone in advance), the early Tom Baker stories teetered on the edge of what was acceptable for a family show. The knock-on effect of Whitehouse's 'Won't someone please think of the children?' protestations was that Hinchcliffe decided to overspend on some episodes of his final series, meaning that Mary Whitehouse not only effectively curtailed the Hinchcliffe era, but weakened the Williams one before it had even begun.
39. The BBC vs Graham Williams
Graeme Williams struggled at times as the producer of Doctor Who. Not only had he to cope with BBC edicts demanding he rectify the overspending and adult tone of the previous regime, but he had to cope with inflation, strikes, and Tom Baker. As a result, his era is saddled with a reputation as cheap and cheerful, when in many respects it was a massive battle to get anything on screen at all. In some cases, they didn't succeed.
38. It's not finished... it's finished
Shada is unfinished. It always will be. Industrial action made it impossible to complete, but since then we have had a VHS edition with linking narration, an Eighth Doctor webcast, a Gareth Roberts novelisation, and an animated version intended for DVD release. Ian Levine put in a lot of time and effort to this version, but for various reasons it was decided that it wasn't acceptable. Cue lots of grumbling, capital letters and online malcontent.
37. Stop that, it's silly
Douglas Adams' tenure as Script Editor is typified by two things. Firstly, there are some glorious bouts of imagination tied up with strong Science-Fiction concepts. Secondly, the levels of silliness occasionally veer into the unacceptable. Partly this is down to Tom Baker, who by this stage felt untouchable, and his willingness to muck about rubs off on the rest of the cast (including his drinking buddy, Graham Crowden). Doctor Who attracts people who want things to be taken very seriously indeed (begging the question of what the hell they're doing watching Doctor Who), and this approach was a step too far for some.
36. Tom and Lalla, sitting in a tree
Doctor/Companion romances aren't unexpected anymore, but there still remains only one that took place off-screen. Tom Baker and Lalla Ward's off-on-off relationship appeared to be digital rather than analogue, and its state affected a lot of their scenes together. There's City of Death, where they run around Paris holding hands (basically all of the Doctor/Romana shipping comes from here), and then there's State of Decay, where they can barely look at each other. Anyone who's heard her on a DVD commentary will know that Ward's scorn could power a national newspaper for months.
35. Out with the old...
Kids love K9. So what better way to bring them on board with your new uber-serious version of the show than by blowing him up after five minutes?
Like K9, the Sonic Screwdriver was deemed too useful a device, a hindrance to creative storytelling, and it too had to go. Script Editor Christopher Bidmead's thoughts on the current iteration of the Sonic Screwdriver make for amusing reading.
34. Stop that, it's also silly but in a different way
In a response to the silliness that had crept into the programme, Season 18 went in the opposite direction. This not only made the show less fun for some people, but it also fell prey to the inherent silliness of the show. The problem is that few things are funnier than someone treating something inherently ridiculous with the utmost severity. Hence we have Logopolis, home to some of the most ludicrous ideas in the show's history but with an oppressive funereal tone.
No amount of Tom Baker looking moody is going to detract from Tegan's bewildering obsession with planes, 'Adric, can you swim?', or how little sense the Master's plan makes.
33. Do-able Barkers
Eighties producer John Nathan Turner and his partner Gary Downie were revealed to have pursued young fans at conventions, some of whom were below the legal age of homosexual consent at the time. Their term for fans they deemed sufficiently attractive was 'Do-able barkers'.
This was only revealed in a 2013 biography of JNT, and it made the national press. If it had been reported at the time it would probably have resulted in convictions, scandal, and potentially cancellation. Would you rather have Eighties Doctor Who or spare some young men a potentially traumatising indignity?
32. Too Many Adrics on the Dancefloor
With Nyssa being added to the roster as a late addition, it was decided that the Fifth Doctor's TARDIS was too crowded, and one of the three companions had to go. After Peter Davison stated the case for Nyssa remaining on board, the axe fell elsewhere. And what an axe. Grown men admit to weeping as those silent credits rolled.
The next time you watch Jurassic Park, just remember that none of it would have been possible without your fourth-favourite Alzarian teenager.
31. The Six Doctors
For the Twentieth Anniversary story, a few bridges were burned, and kindling was laid for future burnings. Director Douglas Camfield was reportedly annoyed at not being first choice, although his health would have prevented him from returning. Robert Holmes, brought in at the request of script editor Eric Saward, was unable to make his idea for a multi-Doctor story work (though his involvement would later lead to The Caves of Androzani, and Saward falling out with John Nathan Turner). The tick-list writing process was compounded by the uncertainty over whether Tom Baker was going to appear. When Terrance Dicks took over the writing, he was annoyed when Saward kept inserting Cybermen into the script. For a celebratory story, it was something of an ordeal.
30. Cyber-disagreements
The authorship of Attack of the Cybermen is disputed. Credited to Paula Moore (real name Paula Woolsey), it was either written by Woolsey, written by Woolsey and heavily re-written by Saward, written by Saward, or plotted by continuity adviser Ian Levine with Saward adding the dialogue.
To this day, no-one has been able to agree about it, nor satisfactorily answer the question 'Why on earth would anyone claim to have written Attack of the Cybermen Part Two?'

At 2:00PM today, our game has been on Greenlight for exactly 24 hours, and the response continues to amaze me.
We are 21% of the way to the top 100 with 1100 yes votes. Here's the chart from Greenlight with our stats so far:
One bit is particularly interesting (zoomed in here):
I'm really trying not to read too much into this, but it's hard not to get excited. I couldn't sleep at all last night because I kept refreshing the screen to see where we were, and reading all the comments.
Here are a few of the comments people are making:
“This is only the second time I've voted for something on Greenlight. Looks like a fun concept. Best of luck!” “This game look nice i would buy it :D Keep up the good work guys” “This one looks seriously fun, best of luck to the devs getting Greenlit, looking forward to playing We Slay Monsters.” “I love the characters, especially the monsters. They are crazy, yet inviting! I want to play through the game just to see them all.” “Love the art style and sense of humour of the devs that you can just sense. Excited to see where this goes!”
And it goes on like that. There have really only been a couple of negative comments, mostly about platform availability (people want linux!) and translations to other languages.
I was also expecting a drop-off after the first burst of traffic, but we're only seeing an increase:
The yellow line represents visitors, the white line is votes, and the green line is “Yes” votes. I can only hope this trend continues!
A couple of things I'd probably do differently the next time around:
I think I may have launched a few days before I really should have. I've been working on putting together presskit() pages (from the awesome guys at Vlambeer, who have been super supportive of the indie community). I finished them up today, and I'm getting ready to send them out to my first wave of press contacts. I'm focusing on the press that are attending the Screw Attack Convention next week, and then starting to contact a wider group of people that might be interested in talking about the game.
My press list is woefully inadequate, and I don't want to just shotgun it out there. Sending this game to a site that covers first-person shooters would just be a waste of everyone's time, so I need to curate my list and send it to the folks most likely to cover the game.
I should have been in contact with more Youtubers about making Let's Play videos. I'm working on that now, but timing all of this with the launch of Steam would have most likely been better.
At this point, only time will tell if doing this differently had mattered.
P.S. If you haven't voted for us on Greenlight, go do it now!
Rep. Michele Bachmann Michele Marie BachmannGillibrand becomes the latest candidate scrutinized for how she eats on campaign trail Trump will give State of Union to sea of opponents Yes, condemn Roseanne, but ignoring others is true hypocrisy MORE (R-Minn.), who last year said she was not going to fill out her census form, intends to vote for a measure this week that encourages Americans to participate in the 2010 census.
According to an aide in Bachmann's office, the North Star State lawmaker intends to vote for a “census awareness” measure on Wednesday.

The resolution, offered by Rep. Silvestre Reyes (D-Texas), implores “individuals across the United States to participate in the 2010 census to ensure an accurate and complete count beginning April 1, 2010, and expressing support for designation of March 2010 as Census Awareness Month,” according to a description of the measure.
Bachmann is not among the resolution's 56 co-sponsors, most of whom are Democrats. The Reyes measure, which was placed on the suspension calendar, is expected to easily pass the lower chamber.
Bachmann communications director David Dziok explained to The Hill that the congresswoman recognizes the importance of Americans participating in the census.
“We are where we are right now in 2010, and she hopes the population is counted accurately as the resolution calls for,” Dziok said.
Over the past year, Bachmann criticized the census on a number of occasions. At one point, she threatened to boycott the census amid the debate on ACORN's involvement in the counting of U.S. citizens.
Bachmann's position shifted after the federal government broke ties with the scandal-plagued group.
“In the past she expressed concerns with certain groups like ACORN that were involved in the census ... and the intrusiveness of the questions that have been added throughout the years, particularly on the American Community Survey. And to address some of those concerns, she introduced the Census Improvement Act to work toward fixing the census process going forward,” Dziok said.

JAGTIAL, India, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - On a hot, sleepy afternoon at Kalleda village in the southern Indian state of Telangana, Laxmi Malaya sat on the porch of her house where the body of her husband Chittam - a daily wage labourer in Dubai - was to be brought the next day.
Chittam, 45, was the second migrant worker from the village to have died in Dubai in September and among the nearly 450 Indian migrant workers shipped home in body bags since 2014.
"There were three deaths (of workers from the village) last year as well. We were told Chittam died of a stroke, but he was healthy when he came home for a visit last month," said Ankathi Gangadhar, the former village head of Kalleda.
Another local man, aged 24, died in Dubai last month after suffering a heart attack, villagers said.
Officials of the Telangana state government cite stress, ill health and working in searing temperatures as the most common causes of death and say fatality numbers among migrants who travel to the Gulf from the state have remained stable.
"People discuss these deaths for a week, but then there is no initiative (to offer jobs here) so they keep leaving," Gangadhar told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
For decades, people have migrated from Telangana - a largely rural region with the tech hub of Hyderabad as its capital - to Indian cities such as Mumbai and to the Gulf, unable to make a living from farming, mainly due to water scarcity.
About 10,000 people migrate to the Gulf states every year from Telangana, and about 200 on average from Kalleda, according to government figures.
Most migrants believe they will be able to make good money in Dubai in just a few years - an illusion unscrupulous agents create.
"When people started leaving for Gulf states (in the 1980s), this region was reeling from years of drought. They had no option but to migrate," said Suresh Reddy, a politician from Telangana who has worked on the migration issue.
"When they left, there were some economic gains but they paid a heavy price for it - working in inhuman conditions and leaving their families behind."
Chittam's annual savings rarely exceeded 12,000 Indian rupees ($185) and he sent home 4,000 to 5,000 rupees every few months. He worked in Dubai for 13 years and visited his wife and two children just five times during that period.
"He was planning to return for good next year after making a little more money," Gangadhar said, as Chittam's wife Laxmi looked on, numb and impassive.
FALSE PROMISES
Ramanna Chitla had worked in Dubai for 16 years when he returned to Jagtial, a town in Telangana, last year, determined to work to stop others from being tricked by agents.
"I saw a lot of misery there. Workers were underpaid and poorly treated. They were cheated by their agents with false promises so I thought I would come back and bring a change," Chitla said.
Over the years, the Indian government and non-governmental groups have received a steady stream of complaints from migrant workers, ranging from non-payment of wages to torture and abuse.
Workers often take loans of 50,000 to 100,000 Indian rupees ($750 to $1,500) to pay agents, hoping to earn enough from working as cleaners and as labourers on construction sites to repay the loan, but their salaries rarely match promises.
"They don't visit doctors when they are unwell to save money," Chitla said, adding that deaths attributed to ill health are often due to exploitative work conditions.
Government figures show there are some 6 million Indian migrants in the six Gulf states of Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman. According to official data, more than 30,000 Indian nationals died in the Gulf states between 2005 and 2015.
The UAE embassy in New Delhi said in an emailed statement the Gulf state had introduced a number of reforms over the last few years to combat abusive labour practices including improving transparency of contracts, a wage protection system for foreign workers and a "Know Your Rights" campaign in five languages.
As a government-authorised agent, Chitla's job is to ensure migrants understand their job contracts, the employer does not alter the terms of employment later, and that all the paperwork of the applicant is fair and complete.
But he fails to attract the same number of workers as illegal agents.
"There are at least 50 unlicensed agents who are sending hundreds of workers. I have sent 48 so far," Chitla said.
India's foreign ministry has made attempts to streamline the recruitment process and help workers in need. Jingles asking workers to go through only authorised agents play on radio every day but many are lured by the promises unauthorised agents make.
Chandrasekhar Boragalla, 26, a father of two, stepped out of Jagtial for the first time two years ago when he sat on a bus to Mumbai about 800 km (500 miles)away and had an interview in a sea-front office for a cleaner's job in Dubai.
"I paid 70,000 rupees to the agent for this job. When I reached there, they made me sign a two-year bond for a salary much lower than what was promised. I wasn't even paid for three months. I was asked to pay 85,000 rupees for leave to go home," he said.
Boragalla returned penniless to Jagtial three months ago. He now works as a welder and is still repaying the loan he took to pay the agent from the 400 rupees he earns as daily wages.
"It's not enough. Dubai is danger. I will not go back," he said.
WATER, JOBS
Kalleda could easily be mistaken for a prosperous village with lush farmlands and maize fields lining its roads. But earnings from farming are rarely enough to feed families.
"They are marginal farmers and own less than 5 acre (2 hectares) of land which does not support their families. Water is scarce as this is a rain fed region," said land rights lawyer Sunil Reddy, who takes up cases of the rural poor.
"When Telangana was created as a separate state in 2014, two promises were made - more jobs and more irrigation water. But the situation is the same," Reddy said.
Laxmi Malaya, now a widow, has a small piece of land on which she grows maize, turmeric and rice. Two harvests yielded an annual income of about 60,000 Indian rupees ($925), which supplemented the money her husband sent home.
Migrant rights campaigners are seeking a compensation for the widows of Gulf migrants.
"Compensation is their right. The money workers send back is pumped into the state's economy," said activist Bheem Reddy.
Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary with the Telangana government said financial compensation for widows has been proposed as part of the state's Non Resident Indian policy.
For now, all that's on offer is the free transportation of bodies of workers like Chittam from Hyderabad airport back to their home villages.

A college student from Trichy was stabbed mercilessly on Wednesday by her stalker for not accepting his advances.
She was severely injured and admitted to a hospital. She is kept under observation and is still critical.
Monica, 23, is a third year student of Microbiology at a private college in Trichy. Her father is a constable and mother, a sub-inspector.
WHAT HAPPENED
She was on her way home from her college aboard a bus. As she got down from the bus and started walking towards her home, she felt a severe sheath of pain on her back and when she turned she realized that someone had stabbed her.
As Monica fell on the ground, the ruthless man continued stabbing her repeatedly on her neck, hands and legs.
She cried for help. Shocked bystanders surrounded the stalker and before they could apprehend him, he himself threw away the knife and surrendered.
'WANTED TO KILL HER, CONSUMED POISON MYSELF'
People took him to a nearby police station where he confessed that his name was Balamurugan and that he was in love with Monica for the past one year but she did not accept his advances.
He said that he wanted to kill her out of rage and that he himself had consumed poison.
The stalker
The police immediately rushed him to a hospital.
This is the third such incident in the state where a girl was attacked by a stalker in the past three days.
Earlier a student was killed at Trichy by a stalker inside the classroom and a teacher was killed inside a church by a mad stalker who later took his own life.

The agent for unrestricted free agent Jeff Green said Saturday that the framework for a deal is in place for his client to return to the Boston Celtics next season.
Green's agent, David Falk, would not reveal the specific length or value of the contract, but confirmed that the details have been ironed out and a deal likely will be consummated after the leaguewide moratorium on new business lifts Wednesday.
"This is where Jeff always wanted to be," said Falk, who continued to heap praise on the Celtics organization for the way it handled Green's heart ailment last season.
Falk stressed that Boston's goodwill played a major factor in his decision to return and said he's not surprised a deal got hammered out since the two sides were on the same page from the start of the process.
Both Falk and Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge expressed optimism that a contract would get done earlier this week and, after watching Ray Allen elect to sign with the Miami Heat on Friday night, the Celtics appear to have moved quickly to finalize with Green.
Green, traded to Boston in February 2011, sat out all of last season after undergoing surgery to repair an aortic aneurysm that was detected in training camp as the two sides prepared to sign a one-year, $9 million deal.
The relationship between Green and the Celtics was strengthened through his heart woes as Ainge accompanied him to doctor visits throughout the detection and repair, which will allow Green to resume his basketball career next season without limitations.
"Jeff, when he got traded to the Celtics, he loved his experience, he wanted to prove that he's a better player than he played when he got here (at the end of the 2010-11 season)," said Ainge, who dealt Kendrick Perkins and Nate Robinson to Oklahoma City in exchange for Green, Nenad Krstic, and a first-round pick (used to select Fab Melo in this year's draft) at the 2011 trade deadline.
The most ardent and vocal Trump supporters I know aren't Millennials or even Boomers. They're my own peers, Gen Xers.
Millennials think Trump is pathetically out of touch – an obese, senile great grandpa sitting on his porch raving about the “coloreds” and “queers.” They'd compare him to Archie Bunker if they knew who Bunker was.
And Boomers, many of whom actually are Archie Bunkers, don't even bother to make a spectacle of their political views because, well, they already bought their retirement homes or cashed in on Social Security. Their best years are behind them, and now they're sitting back, eating hotdish, watching the world burn like it's an episode of Fox & Friends.
No, it's Gen Xers who get into the most vicious political arguments; laugh the loudest about drinking Snowflake tears; and seem most willing to defend Trump despite all the graft, lies, and treason.
When I see them doing this, I want to ask them, “Did you guys even watch the same movies in the ‘80s that I did?”
If so, they must not have learned a damn thing.
Pretty in Pink should have taught them that the rich guy in Wayfarers, blazer, and loafers is almost always an entitled dick who only cares about himself. James Spader's sneering Steff is Jared Kushner, a trust fund slumlord who has lied over and over on security clearance forms.
Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark should have taught them that scientists are good and Nazis are bad. No, there aren't good people on both sides. In fact, there are never good people on the Nazi side, yet Trump supporters disparage climate change experts and university professors while ignoring—sometimes even cheering—the real damage white nationalists are doing to this country.
The Star Wars franchise should have groomed them to recognize and resist authoritarian rule and fascism. How the hell did they miss all that Third Reich imagery? Or do you suppose in their warped Fox News worldview they see Darth Vader as Obama, the Empire as the Democratic Party, and the Rebel Alliance as oppressed conservatives?
The Day After should have scarred them for life, leaving them with a fear of nuclear weapons instead of an “America, fuck yeah” attitude about deploying them like President Dum Dum and his creepy doomsday cult of cabinet members and donors.
Die Hard, beloved and quoted by gun-fetishizing, cop-worshipping conservatives, should have taught them that terrorists aren't always brown guys from the Middle East.
Red Dawn should have taught them that Russia isn't our friend. Yet now many of us are forced to hunker down in survivalist mode to defend our basic rights, to think like guerrilla war strategists as a coping mechanism for surviving the dangers of an administration compromised by Russia.
ET should have taught them that illegal aliens aren't always rapists or criminals, that they can contribute meaningfully to society even when that society fears them because they're different.
Blade Runner should have taught them that what seems human might actually be a Replicant. Yet the conservatives I know are the first ones to be fooled by bots on social media.
Wall Street should have taught them that that just because someone is a successful businessman doesn't mean he can be trusted to follow through on promises or do the right thing. But we ended up with President Gekko anyway, a guy who lives by the creed “greed is good” as he bleeds blue-collar America dry.
I could go on and on like this, and of course I'm sort of joking, but not completely. And maybe the joke's on me and other Gen X members of The Resistance because watching They Live and V should have prepared us for all this.
The truth is, a lot of us have been asleep. That's how the Nightmare on Main Street begins:
One, two GOPs coming for you.
Three, four pay the oligarchy more.
Five, six the voting's fixed.
Seven, eight gonna make America great.
Nine, ten won't have healthcare again.
Remember back in the ‘90s when pop culture conditioned us to believe reality bites? We bought into the idea even though we really had no context for judging whether it was true. We tried on the slacker brand like it was a Members Only jacket someone left behind at that epic kegger in '85 because it was as close as we were ever going to get to having a generational identity. In the absence of catastrophic wars, moonwalks (other than Michael's), or assassinated presidents in our formative years to define us, and with only MTV to tell us who we were, we were never going to be taken seriously by Boomers anyway.
In retrospect, lots of us didn't have big problems in the ‘90s at all — especially if we were white and middle class. Most of us weren't losing our right to vote, right to protest, power to make decisions about our bodies, government aid, or healthcare. We didn't worry about mass shootings, nuclear war, or economic collapse.
We definitely didn't worry about losing our democracy, and if anyone had tried to warn us then that it was going to happen by the time we got to our parents' age, we would have laughed at them like they were Cameron Frye and slammed another Zima.
But guess what? Reality really does bite now, and it's snarling and foaming at the mouth like Cujo.
So, here's the deal: Millennials are going to get their chance later to remake the world in their own progressive image. And the Boomers? They're cashing in and saying “Peace oot.” That leaves us, Gen X, and we stand to lose the most as a consequence of the tyranny of the GOP. There's never been a president who has represented us or our interests, and the chances of it ever happening dwindle by the day.
But most of us have already been working for twenty to thirty years or more. This country rattles and hums along because of our labor and spending. What will we do when the GOP raids our Social Security benefits? How are we going to pay back our own student loans, let alone our kids' loans? What happens when our unions are hamstrung by right-to-work laws? How will we get ahead when we're only one medical emergency away from losing everything? (All problems, by the way, that Bernie Sanders‘ platform addressed.) What happens when the highest-paying blue-collar jobs, in industries like steel and coal, become obsolete – after being hyped and unsuccessfully revived like Crystal Pepsi?
I hate to break it to you, Gen X, but there aren't going to be any “let's work together” montages. Members of The Resistance and Trump supporters aren't going to pull a Breakfast Club, a goonie, or a St. Elmo's Fire. There's never going to be a moment of insight and reconciliation when we say “Even though we're from different races, ethnicities, genders, social classes, religions, etc. we're going to fight this together.”
Nope. There will be no seamless and predictably-satisfying denouement at the end of this movie. John Hughes can't help us now. Things are going to get messy when Trump is impeached.
Stay strong, Wolverines.

1. Give warm clothes and sleeping bags: Make no mistake, cold weather can be life-threatening if you're sleeping on the streets each night. So have a look through your wardrobes and lofts for any hats, gloves and coats that you can spare. But don't just leave a box out on the street and assume rough sleepers will get to it donate to your nearest homelessness charity.
2. Give hot drinks and food: Every other day I get asked: “Is giving money to rough sleepers the right thing to do?”. The simple answer is there's no way to know where the money will go after you've let it out your sight. But if you want that money to go towards food, then cut out the middle man and buy that person a bite to eat or a hot drink. Soup, tea and coffee are very popular on our food distribution runs at this time of year.
3. Volunteer: Most people offering front line services such as food and clothing distribution are volunteers. The charity that I run, Rhythms of Life, is staffed entirely by volunteers, myself included. There are countless organisations recruiting helpers, so make some time and do your bit, if you can.
4. Donate: We may all be tightening our belts again, but any amount we can squeeze out of our weekly budgets and donate can make a real difference in the lives of rough sleepers. These days, most distribution is done by recycling surplus food so cash donations of £5, £10 or £20 can be used to keep small charities in business or support a rough sleeper to attend a GP visit or job interview.
5. Referral services: Over 60% of rough sleepers are new to the streets according to No Second Night Out. One of the best things anyone can do is refer a rough sleeper to an organisation that can help. If you have any concerns about someone sleeping rough then you can contact StreetLink, in England or look up your local agency in other parts of the UK. We recommend that you talk to the person first to get their consent, and see if they're willing to provide their mobile phone number to help outreach coordinators contact them.
6. Have a chat: From my experience as a rough sleeper, one of the toughest daily struggles is living with the sense of social isolation and loneliness. So respond to the person in front of you and have a quick chat. Ask them about their day, learn their name and just be prepared to listen and be empathetic. We especially recommend this if you pass the same rough sleeper during your daily routine. But don't be too pushy, show the homeless the same respect you would show anyone else.
Nobody knew it then, but the genetic mutation came to Utah by wagon with the Hinman family. Lyman Hinman found the Mormon faith in 1840. Amid a surge of religious fervor, he persuaded his wife, Aurelia, and five children to abandon their 21-room Massachusetts house in search of Zion. They went first to Nauvoo, Illinois, where the faith's prophet and founder, Joseph Smith, was holding forth—until Smith was murdered by a mob and his followers were run out of town. They kept going west and west until there were no towns to be run out of. Food was scarce. They boiled elk horns.The children's mouths erupted in sores from scurvy. Aurelia lost all her teeth. But they survived. And so did the mutation. Earlier this year, I met Gregg Johnson, Lyman and Aurelia's great-great-great-great grandson. The genetic mutation that had traveled the Mormon Trail was now in Gregg, one of hundreds of the Hinmans' descendants in the Utah area. Gregg is 61, with blue eyes and a white goatee. He frequently travels for his job as a craftsman for Mormon temples, but Utah is still home. “I'm just a Salt Lake City boy,” he says.
The mutation that came with the Hinmans turns out to be a troublesome one. It lies dormant just long enough for people to have children and pass the mutation along, but not long enough to watch their children start their own lives. Gregg's mother died of colon cancer at age 47. Her mother also died early of colon cancer, as did her mother. And who knows how many other relatives succumbed, stretching all the way back when the Hinmans came to Utah. Gregg knows the history of this mutation in a gene called APC because he's spent more than 30 years in a series of studies at the University of Utah—made possible by a vast trove of Mormon genealogy records. Detailed family trees make it easier to trace genes that cause disease. After the Hinmans and other pioneers settled in the state, the Mormon church kept records that over time became an unusually detailed and complete genealogy. In the 1970s, university researchers had the foresight to combine these genealogy records with the state cancer registry to create what ultimately became the Utah Population Database. So when scientists began suspecting a genetic cause for cancer, they went hunting through the Mormon family trees. They found patterns of deadly inheritance: BRCA1, one of the infamous cancer mutations, as well as mutations for cardiac arrhythmia and melanoma. And of course, they found the APC mutation behind the colon cancer in Gregg's family. Utah became an accidental genetics laboratory. When Lyman hitched his wagon for Utah a century and a half ago, he ended up setting a course for colon cancer research.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or the Mormon church, has one of the largest genealogy databases in the world. Today, it operates a family-history library just steps from the temple in downtown Salt Lake City, where banks of computers await visitors interested in digital genealogy records. The Church has physical records, too. They are stored on microfilm under 700 feet of rock in the climate-controlled Granite Mountain Records Vault, secured with doors so heavy they're supposed to withstand a nuclear blast. Mormons are, by stereotype, family oriented, and this intense interest in family trees is a matter of theology. Mormons believe in baptism of the dead—including, in some cases, the long-dead. The baptisms are meant to give those who did not find the gospel of Jesus Christ in their mortal lives a chance at salvation, so that entire families stretching back generations might be reunited, forever together in Heaven. (This practice has attracted controversy, especially when the dead have included Holocaust victims.) The actual ceremonies are performed by proxy in temples. Members of the church line up and step forward for baptism as the name of an ancestor appears on a screen. But first, you need names. So the Church sends crews around the world to collect records of the dead. In the 1970s, one such genealogy team looking for old parish records arrived in Parma, Italy, where a young American named Mark Skolnick was working on his Ph.D. thesis.
As luck would have it, Skolnick was using parish records to construct a genealogy database of his own. His thesis looked at how genes spread as people from different Italian villages moved and intermarried. The study was a nice “theoretical exercise,” he says, but nothing practical really came of it. Meanwhile, because he spoke Italian, Skolnick helped translate for the Mormon team that came to microfilm parish records. “I was a lowly gofer,” he says. A great many things, however, would come out of this. When Lyman hitched his wagon for Utah a century and a half ago, he ended up setting a course for colon cancer research. The Mormon church, Skolnick realized, was sitting on a vast trove of population genetics data. After finishing his thesis, he got a job at the University of Utah, where he set out to combine Mormon church records and cancer registry data into what would become the Utah Population Database. The genealogies and cancer records were a daunting amount of data, especially in an era when money was tight and computers were still the size of refrigerators. “It was like going from one year to the next to try to get the funding,” recalls Lisa Cannon-Albright, one of Skolnick's graduate students at the time. They worked out of an old VA hospital building, infested with bats and painted an awful pale green. Getting all that data into the computer was a low-tech slog. Skolnick convinced the church to let him copy 186,000 pages of family records covering all the pioneers who came on the Mormon trail. The records went back eight generations and comprised about 1.6 million people in total. A team of typists, many of them genealogy enthusiasts, turned the handwritten records into a digital database. The data entry took the equivalent of 15 person-years.
As Skolnick was casting around for projects that could use the database, he met a young gastroenterologist named Randall Burt. Having grown up in Salt Lake City, Burt had recently returned to take up a fellowship at the University of Utah. He's a gregarious guy, with a knack for putting patients facing colonoscopies at ease. “I just think of him as a big teddy bear,” one of his former patients told me. Gregg's mother was one of Burt's patients. By the time of her diagnosis, it was already too late to cure her colon cancer. She died a year later. Burt and his colleagues were seeing other families like Gregg's, where colon cancer had cut down whole branches of the family tree. What's more, when you looked at the young, still-healthy members of these families, their colons were also strange—covered in dozens of mushroom-like growths called polyps that can turn cancerous. The doctors called it attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis. They didn't yet know what caused the profusion of polyps, but they reasoned if they could trace it through the family trees, they could identify who had the mutation and eventually the mutation itself. “I can't tell you how many reunions where I've been to eating corn and potato salad and talking polyps.” In retrospect, finding a mutation whose effects are so stark does not sound difficult. And indeed, today it isn't especially difficult. But in the early 1980s, still two decades away from the first draft of a human genome, finding a gene was hard—especially if you weren't so sure the gene even existed. Perhaps, as many thought at the time, cancer is simply a product of lifestyle or other environmental factors. Tracing a genetic mutation back to a common ancestor is no easy task either. Family trees get exponentially bigger as you go back in time: You have two parents, four grandparents, eight great grandparents, and so on. Eight generations back, you have hundreds of ancestors. A family tree for the Mormon pioneers is more like a tangled bush.
To prove that the polyps were hereditary—rather than just the unfortunate result of say, a family living in the same house drinking the same toxic water—the researchers needed to find more families elsewhere that looked like Gregg's. So they went looking through the Utah Population Database. With the family trees and cancer registry data, they could identify clusters of colon cancer. Then Burt and his team hit the road with his colon screening scopes—driving through Utah but also Idaho and Wyoming, where descendants of Mormon pioneers had settled. They set up in local hospitals and spent a day looking for colon polyps in the local population. “These dairymen would come in between milking the cows, and the next day cowboys would come in,” he says. And they went to family reunions. “I can't tell you how many reunions where I've been to eating corn and potato salad and talking polyps,” says Burt. They took blood for genetic tests and invited patients to schedule future colon screenings.
It helped that the Mormons they were studying lived up to their reputation for friendliness. “I don't know if people told you how receptive they are to research,” says Cannon-Albright, who herself comes from a Mormon background. “People recognize what you're doing. ‘It won't help me but it'll help my kids and kids' kids,' and they were in just like that.” Participating in the study required an invasive colon screening and a blood draw. Still, she says, “Nobody ever said no.”
Slowly, after hundreds of colon screenings and blood draws, a picture began to emerge. All of the families with this profusion of polyps seemed to have the exact same mutation, which pointed to a common ancestor. Those common ancestors, we now know, are Lyman and Aurelia. It's not clear which one of the couple had the gene, but they passed it along to at least two of their five children. In 1991, research groups in Utah and at Johns Hopkins simultaneously discovered the gene, which became known as APC. In the decades since, this colon cancer research has kept going at University of Utah. Deborah Neklason, who took over Burt's research after he retired, keeps a large white roll of paper in her office. She took it out when I visited and motioned me over to the big wood conference table, where she unfurled it and kept unfurling it, until half of it ran off the edge. It was the Hinmans' pedigree on paper. Actually it was only part of it. The family had five branches: A, B, C, D, E, corresponding to each of Hinmans' children, and this pedigree covered just branch E. Neklason found that she wanted to show me: a square with a black dot in the middle. It was Gregg—square for male, a dot to mark him as a carrier. Neklason's office is in the university's Huntsman Cancer Institute, a hospital and research center founded by businessman Jon Huntsman Sr. The Huntsmans wield unusual influence even for wealthy donors—hence a recent and ugly power struggle with university administrators—and this influence is apparent even in campus geography. The university's building climbs up the foothills on Salt Lake City's eastern edge, and the Huntsman Cancer Institute, wrapped in green glass, sits at the campus's highest elevation. It's more alpine ski resort than hospital. Huntsman jokes that when cancer is cured, he's turning it into a Ritz-Carlton. The Utah Population Database, which began in the bat-infested old VA hospital, is set to move into the Huntsman's new wing later this year.
Last February, then Vice President Joe Biden spoke at the Huntsman to promote his cancer moonshot. The event took place in the institute's cafeteria, though calling it a hospital cafeteria is a bit of a disservice. Bon Appétit named it one of the world's “coolest workplace cafeterias,” thanks to the floor-to-ceiling glass that overlook the mountains around Salt Lake City. On that day though, the windows were blacked out, per the request of the Secret Service. Gregg spoke at the event, too, and he was starstruck. (“Joe is Joe. He's cool. I would have voted for him in a heartbeat.”) He swallowed his nervousness and began telling his family's story, starting with his mother's diagnosis. After his mother's death, Gregg began seeing Burt for regular colonoscopies. Polyps, if removed early enough, never become cancerous. Each time Gregg had a colonoscopy, he got hundreds of polyps snipped off. He's been doing this long enough that he can hold forth about how it used to be. “It used be,” he says, “you had to drink an Imperial gallon, five quarts of saline solution, within an hour and keep it down.” He paused to grimace. “Just thinking about it now makes my skin crawl.” The prep for colonoscopies requires much less liquid now, and it tastes a lot better. Stop putting off your colonoscopy, he added, slipping into the role he often plays for his family and friends, encouraging people to get tested.
Gregg has two sons, Dan and Patrick. The mutation has a 50-50 chance of being passed on, and the laws of chance were followed perfectly in this case: Dan, the older son, has the mutation, and Patrick does not. Dan is 32 now, at the point where he's thinking about having kids. Having watched his father live a pretty much normal life despite this ticking time bomb of a mutation has given him an equanimous outlook. “That doesn't affect my decision at all,” he says. In the future, Dan might not need such regular colonoscopies either. Gregg participated in a recent clinical trial using two drugs called sulindac and erlotinib to prevent polyps in the duodenum, a section of the small intestine that is difficult to reach with a scope. It worked beautifully for shrinking polyps, though it did have some side effects that are being ironed out in a follow-up trial. Gregg's digestive tract was the “poster child” for the initial study. “The advancements are amazing,” says Dan, “It's so cool, even in the time that Dad's started with this.” In this era of hype about precision medicine, Gregg's family shows its power—as it's already being applied. The particular mutation in Gregg's family only accounts for a tiny sliver of colon cancers in the U.S., but the research on his family may have a much larger impact. The APC gene is known as a tumor suppressor gene. Gregg's family members are born with a mutation in APC, but it is also possible and common to acquire a mutation in the APC gene over one's lifetime, through random chance or environmental exposure. Eighty percent of all colon cancers have such a mutation. “It's such an early step in colon cancer, it's perfect target for prevention,” says Neklason. If something can prevent colon cancer in this high-risk family, then perhaps it could prevent it in the rest of us too. That's in part why the clinical trial results were so exciting.
Excruciating emergency-room wait times and prison-like boarding conditions for adults dealing with mental-health crises are well known. Yet we rarely hear about the kids who have to endure such squalid treatment.
When you think of hospitalized children, you think of emergencies like broken arms and asthma attacks. But young, mentally-ill inpatients are tragically common. In fact, one in ten hospitalized kids are admitted due to a mental health condition, according to a new study to be published in the journal Pediatrics next month. Depression is the most common and costly reason kids are turning up in the ER, accounting for 44 percent of all mental-health admissions of young people ages three to 20, and $1.33 billion annually in hospital charges.
Other common reasons for hospitalization are bipolar disorder and psychoses, two relatively rare conditions in the general population. Yet both often require frequen hospital care. “The fact that they're hospitalized as frequently as they are means that these kids are really quite sick and we need to be paying attention to how to provide the best care for them,” says Dr. Naomi Bardach, lead author and assistant professor of pediatrics at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital.
If, for the first time, we have a clear picture of why kids with mental health disorders—and there are over 4 million of them, or one in five children under 18 according to the CDC—are seeking medical help, the question follows: Just how effective is hospitalization? And what about the ones who never make it past the ER's waiting room?
Mental-health hospitalizations for kids are on the rise—up 24 percent from 2007 to 2010. For mood disorders like depression and bipolar disorder, the hospitalization rate has jumped 80 percent since 1997. While the need for urgent care continues to grow, the number of facilities throughout the country equipped to treat these children are steadily declining, at considerable costs to families. And even when urgent care is adequate, the reality of mental health is such that by the time most children end up in emergency rooms, the system has already failed them.
Late last year, Marie Yates' 17-year-old son, Steven (diagnosed with schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder) was denied a bed in a Phoenix mental health facility after he used scissors to cut his throat in a suicide attempt at school. He stayed for 11 days in the hospital before being discharged. So when Steven became suicidal again in January, Yates took him to another ER, this time one linked with a mental health care center. Again, she was told there was no space for her child. Steven was eventually admitted by the hospital, but only after Yates physically brought her son to the Behavioral Health Center a block away. “You might have to call the cops,” she said as a staff member opened the door, “because I'm not leaving.”
Emily Bell, CEO for the trade association representing Arizona's behavioral health workers, described the number of inpatient beds for children in the state as “woefully short.”
Boise's Intermountain Hospital is just one of the most recent hospitals to reduce its capacity for psychiatric patients—cutting 17 beds last year. Now, when the 30 adolescent spaces get full, children are sent to neighboring emergency rooms like the one at St. Luke's Hospital, which has neither the space nor the resources to treat non-life-threatening psychiatric issues. St. Luke's Medical Director for Outpatient Pediatrics echoed the frustration of other emergency departments to a local reporter on a segment about the hospital bed reductions: “What do we do with them when they have particularly complex mental health needs?”
CBS also documented the problem on 60 Minutes in January. It highlighted the emergency room at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut, where 52 psychiatric beds were full, leaving seven young people waiting for care—five of them for at least three days.
Sadly, these anecdotes are neither new nor unique.
In the 2006 landmark case Rosie D. v. Romney, a Massachusetts judge ruled in favor of thousands of children with serious emotional disabilities, some of whom spent days lying in hallway hospital beds waiting for treatment. The court found that by inappropriately detaining or denying access to children in need of mental-health treatment and failing to provide home-based services, the state had violated the Federal Medicaid Act.
Massachusetts has made real progress (PDF) in complying with the ruling—the number of children screened and provided with services for behavioral health conditions has increased significantly, as has the number of professionals tasked with providing these services. Nationally, though, the problem persists.
The issue of access to mental-health care took on a tragic urgency after 20-year-old Adam Lanza, a boy with a long history of mental illness, killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary school in 2012. It resurfaced again last year when it was discovered that Virginia State Senator Creigh Deeds' son, Gus, had been turned away from a mental-health care facility in Virginia hours before attacking his father and killing himself.
Though both the 23-year-old Gus Deeds and Adam Lanza were technically young adults at the time of their attacks, their problems had started years earlier. And since half of all mental health disorders start by 14 years of age (PDF), earlier intervention and quality care has a direct impact on an individual's life, and on the overall mental health of the country.
Following high-profile tragedies like Sandy Hook, politicians have been quick to offer platitutdes about reforming the country's broken mental-health system—but such rhetoric rarely results in lasting change.
“There hasn't been enough action or investment,” says Darcy Gruttadaro, Director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Child & Adolescent Action Center.
“As soon as a financial crisis or economic downturn happens, often mental health is back on the chopping block,” Gruttadaro says. “And that's a penny wise and a pound foolish because we end up paying ultimately when we don't provide adequate service and supports.”
Indeed, overall state mental-health budgets are continually being cut. A report from NAMI found that states cut over $1.6 billion from their mental health agency budgets from fiscal year 2009 to 2012.
When you add in cuts to other services that affect mental-health programs like Medicaid, the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMPHD) (PDF) estimates the cuts end up at $4.35 billion.
As suicide is the third leading cause of death in young people ages 15-25, few would disagree that hospital beds are needed to help stabilize kids in crisis—though child health experts agree that a hospital shouldn't be the first or only option.
But for many parents, it is. A series of focus groups led by Maryland's Department of Health found that even though families consistently reported hospitals to be unhelpful, the emergency department was the service accessed most often by families with children “in crisis,” e.g. displaying violent behavior or threatening self-harm. Along with judgmental treatment, the parents consistently complained of long delays and inability to access treatment: “We were there three days waiting for a bed,” one parent said.
When asked “what would help,” families spoke about the desire to skip the ER in favor of direct urgent mental-health services, facilities that have been proven to reduce the need for inpatient psychiatric beds by up to 75 percent.
Further, these families stressed the need for more individualized treatment and services like “wraparound care,” a community-based approach that involves a team of people dedicated to the well-being of the child.
Indeed, experts note that more targeted prevention, outreach, and treatment services would in fact reduce the need for expensive and ineffective hospital care. As Portland, Oregon emergency physician Sharon Meieran said in a recent column for the Oregonian on the barbaric treatment of teen psych patients, “The question of whether someone must board in the [Emergency Departments] is challenging, but by the time we are even considering the question, it's too late.”
Thousands of Taiwanese protested Thursday outside the island's legislature both for and against a bill that could make Taiwan the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage.
Organizers estimated that more than 20,000 people protested, carried placards, flew flags and chanted slogans as lawmakers deliberated the bill inside.
Most were affiliated with conservative religious and social groups that chartered buses to bring protesters to the capital, Taipei.
Some demanded an island-wide plebiscite with slogans such as “Marriage and family, let all the people decide,” while speakers argued that same-sex marriage would psychologically harm future generations.
Backers of the bill, separated from the main group by a line of police, waved rainbow flags and chanted their support for gay rights.
Both the ruling and major opposition parties support legalization of same-sex marriage, as do a majority of the public along with President Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's first female head of state.
The bill would change the legal definition of marriage from between “male and female parties” to between “two parties.” Supporters hope to pass it by the end of the current session in December.
Taiwan would join Canada, Colombia, Ireland, the United States and 16 other countries that have legalized same-sex marriage. But it would be a notable exception in Asia and the Middle East where many countries still ban gay sex.
Gays and lesbians in Taiwan have formed an effective lobby in recent years, with an annual Gay Pride march in Taipei last month drawing tens of thousands.

Düsseldorf state court said on Tuesday that eight of the nine accused men can face trial on the grounds of "violating laws against wearing uniforms with political messages."
The decision overturned a ruling by Wuppertal district court last December, in which the judge said the behavior of accused Islamist preacher Sven Lau did not amount to a "criminal violation of the ban on uniforms." The decision sparked controversy in Germany and led to an appeal by prosecutors. The latest ruling by the Court of Appeal cannot be overturned.
Lau, who is widely regarded as a leading figure in the German Salafist scene, was also indicted by federal prosecutors last month on suspicion of supporting a terror group linked to the self-declared "Islamic State" (IS) in Syria.
City patrols to enforce Islamist ideals
The Salafists, who are all aged between 24 and 35, first made headlines in September 2014 after they patrolled the streets of Wuppertal, in Germany's western industrial Ruhr region, in an attempt to enforce a strict interpretation of Islam.
Wearing orange vests, emblazoned with the words "Shariah police," the defendants allegedly demanded people at nightclubs stop drinking alcohol and listening to music.
The bearded fundamentalists were also observed calling for an end to gambling as they carried notices, in English, declaring a "Sharia Controlled Zone."
NRW popular state for Salafists
At the time of the reports, German Chancellor Angela Merkel commented that no one had the right to do the police's work for them.
Wuppertal Police Chief Birgitta Rademacher said: "Intimidation or provocation won't be tolerated," adding that only police appointed and employed by the state had the legitimate right to act as police in Germany.
Germany has seen a growing Salafist population in recent years, especially in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), where there are currently an estimated 1,800 followers of the ultra-conservative branch of Islam. Wuppertal is Germany's most popular city for Salafists, who preach a very conservative interpretation of Islam and reject any form of democracy.

Hundreds of people are swarming up ladders, scaling the cliff-like sides of a gargantuan, man-made pit. Is it a picture of hell? Some kind of spirit photograph showing life in the Aztec empire? In fact, Sebastião Salgado's photograph captures gold-grubbers pouring up the side of an opencast mine at Serra Pelada in Brazil. One of a jaw-dropping series he took of the crazed gold rush that created this great hole in the Earth in the 1980s, the shot is bizarrely timeless and disorienting. Few photographs have such power – to make you question your assumptions about the world, to show you something unbelievable yet utterly real.
Salgado is a photojournalist who seeks out the most moving, unsettling, perspective-shifting images of life on Earth. From his mind-swarming images of the Serra Pelada gold mine to his most recent epic labour Genesis, which documents the last pockets of undamaged nature and unmodernised peoples on Earth, Salgado shows secrets from remote places: things you thought were lost, crimes you never imagined. There could scarcely be a better choice for a lifetime achievement award from Photo London, an art fair opening at Somerset House this week. In addition to an exhibition of the Genesis prints, it will feature works by, among others, Stephen Shore, Rut Blees Luxemburg, Vik Muniz and Ori Gersht.
Salgado is not just a great photographer. He may well be the last great photographer – at least in the classic, humane tradition, working in black and white, telling profound truths. You can leaf through any of Salgado's books and every few pages be pulled up by a shot that seems like one of the best photographs ever taken. In Genesis, the eye of a whale peeps out of the sea, looking back at the photographer. A group of African herders move among long-horned cattle in an ethereal dust cloud. A baboon balances on a sand dune. These pictures rank with the masterpieces of Cartier-Bresson. But Salgado is not sure if his kind of serious photography can survive the digital age. Photography, he says, is now turning into something else: “Your father and mother, when you were a child, they took precious photographs of you. They went to the shop on the corner to get them developed. That is a memory. That is photography.”

Digital photographs, he says, cannot have that treasured sense of embodied memory because a photograph “is not something material today – it's inside a computer. You lose your phone, you've lost your photographs.” Worse, we no longer see photographs as documents but as things that can be manipulated with Photoshop, glamorised on Instagram. “Before, we took a picture. It was reality.”
Even before the birth of the digital camera, though, critics were questioning photography, suggesting it actually creates a rhetoric of the real. But Salgado proves it truly can reveal new dimensions of the physical, human world, the richness of the peculiar, lovely, terrifying, yet somehow universal things he sees through his viewfinder. “When I first took a camera, I had never looked through a viewfinder in all my life.” It was, he says, an electrifying moment.
Salgado was born on a farm in the state of Minas Gerais in southeast Brazil. He and his wife Lélia Wanick studied in Paris, where their studio is still based. It is very much a collaborative enterprise: Lélia designs the beautifully structured books through which Salgado tells what he calls his “stories”. More recently, they have worked together to replant a section of Brazilian forest on the farm where he grew up. Yet he never studied photography or art – he has a PhD in ecomomics. It was while travelling the world for the International Coffee Organisation in the 70s that he had that epiphany when he looked through a viewfinder and fell in love with photography.

“The human animal is a political animal,” he says, and his humanitarianism is unmistakable in his pictures of crises and endangered ways of life. But he insists he is not motivated by “activism”. Instead, what he stresses is the sheer fun of what he does. Photography has taken him all over the world, has been his passport to see astonishing things, people, places. He remembers standing in the Kuwait desert photographing oil wells on fire after the first Gulf war. It was an incredible spectacle. “All these wells burning - all the adventure to be there.”
Looking at Salgado's most memorable pictures – not least his hellish scenes of the blazing oil wells – you are punched in the stomach by reality. Special effects can create all kinds of cheap magic. Yet Salgado shows raw, real events that outdo digital fantasy. That shocking, sensational, or utterly poetic moment of truth is what Cartier-Bresson called “the decisive moment”. How does he catch them? To get great shots, he says, you “need a lot of time”. You have to put yourself where things are going to happen, and get into the flow of events, the mood of people. “You know where you'll go, but you don't know what you will bring back.” When the subject does suddenly appear, you have to be ready – and fast. “Photography is one 250th of a second,” says Salgado. And so much can go wrong. “There are a lot of variables. There must be light. There must be power. There must be personality if it's a portrait.”

The picture is not being taken by a passive camera, though. It's by the person holding the camera. And this may be what makes Salgado so special: the economics PhD, the political idealism, the connection with nature and the past that comes from his forest childhood – he somehow gets all that into the picture, somehow puts his soul into the image. “In this moment, you bring your history and your ideas to what is in front of you. That is a photograph.”
Salgado, in that instant when “photography freezes things”, transmits his own vision of a vast, suffering, interlinked planet. The grandeur of his crowd scenes is heartbreaking. People fade into the distance among the tents of a refugee camp. They process exhausted along a jungle road. They lie dead, uncountable, in his most horrific photographs of genocide in Rwanda. Always, there is a sense of depth and scale, of the hugeness of human history and the story of the Earth itself. He gets the superb depth of field that makes his pictures so haunting with techniques he has learned over a lifetime:
“I work with very fast film. I always close my diaphragm to give a huge depth of field. Volumes for me are very important.” The result, the expansive yet immensely detailed scope of his pictures, is what makes them so moving. The migrants are moving through a forest, too tired to think. Some have collapsed by the pathway. Behind them, so many more are coming. Fear fills the air. “Reality,” says Salgado, “is full of depth of field.”

As we await the results from the DeflateGate investigation, reports about what happened continue to leak out.
The Ravens tipped off the Colts about the deflated footballs, according to the latest report from FOX Sports' Jay Glazer,. The Ravens had recently complained about underinflated balls during the AFC divisional round game against the Patriots. Although SBNation points out how the Ravens' claim doesn't hold much value.

The Colts may not have needed a heads-up, however. The Colts had concerns about underinflated balls after their regular-season game against the Patriots on Nov. 16, according to an ESPN report.
Glazer's report also claims the league was already planning to inspect the balls at halftime, before linebacker D'Qwell Jackson noticed something was off when he intercepted Tom Brady.
The whole controversy surrounding the deflated balls isn't affecting the Patriots' next opponents. The Seahawks don't seem overly concerned with what the Patriots may or may not have done.
"If it's against the rules, it's against the rules," Richard Sherman said Wednesday. "But it's not going to have any effect on this game. Nobody is going to get suspended [for the Super Bowl], and nothing's going to happen. We're gonna play this game. Whatever they did, the risk/reward was greater.''
The NFL's investigation is supposed to be concluded within a few days according to multiple reports.

The Air Force is revving up electronic warfare upgrades for its F-15 fighter as a way to better protect against enemy fire and electronic attacks, service officials said.
Boeing has secured a $478 million deal to continue work on a new technology called with a system called the Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System, or EPAWSS.
"We expect the F-15 to maintain its air superiority edge, especially with all of its new advanced capabilities — now and into the future," Steve Parker, Vice President of the Boeing F-15 program, told Scout Warrior.
These updated EW capabilities replace the Tactical Electronic Warfare Suite, which has been used since the 1980s, not long after the F-15 first deployed. The service plans to operate the fleet until the mid-2040's, so an overhaul of the Eagle's electronic systems helps maintain U.S. air supremacy, the contract announcement said.
Boeing won the initial contract for the EPAWSS project last year and hired BAE Systems as the primary subcontractor.
The multi-pronged effort not only includes the current addition of electronic warfare technology but also extends to super-fast high-speed computers, infrared search and track enemy targeting systems, increased networking ability and upgraded weapons-firing capability, Air Force and Boeing officials said.
"The Air Force plans to keep the F-15 fleet in service until the mid-2040's. Many of the F-15 systems date back to the 1970's and must be upgraded if the aircraft is to remain operationally effective. Various upgrades will be complete as early as 2021 for the F-15C AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar and as late as 2032 for the various EW (electronic warfare) upgrades," Air Force spokesman Maj. Rob Leese told Scout Warrior last year.

The Air Force currently operates roughly 400 F-15C, D and E variants. A key impetus for the upgrade was well articulate in a Congressional report on the US and China in 2014. (US-China Economic and Security Review Commission — www.uscc.gov). Among other things, the report cited rapid Chinese technological progress and explained that the US margin of superiority has massively decreased since the 1980s.
As an example, the report said that in the 1980s, the US F-15 was vastly superior to the Chinese equivalent - the J-10. However, Chinese technical advances in recent years have considerably narrowed that gap to the point where the Chinese J-10 is now roughly comparable to the US F-15, the report explained.
Air Force and Boeing developers maintain that ongoing upgrades to the F-15 will ensure that this equivalence is not the case and that, instead, they will ensure the superiority of the F-15.
Among the upgrades is an ongoing effort to equip the F-15 with the fastest jet-computer processor in the world, called the Advanced Display Core Processor, or ADCPII.
"It is capable of processing 87 billion instructions per second of computing throughput, translating into faster and more reliable mission processing capability for an aircrew," Boeing spokesman Randy Jackson told Scout Warrior.
The technology is also being engineered into the Navy F-18 Super Hornet. The technology can detect the heat signature, often called infrared emissions, of enemy aircraft.

"The system can simultaneously track multiple targets and provide a highly effective air-to-air targeting capability, even when encountering advanced threats equipped with radar-jamming technology," Navy officials said.
IRST also provides an alternate air-to-air targeting system in a high threat electronic attack environment, Navy, Air Force and industry developers said.
The F-15 is also being engineered for additional speed and range, along with weapons-firing ability. The weapons-carrying ability is being increased from 8 up to 16 weapons; this includes an ability to fire an AIM-9x or AIM-120 missile. In addition, upgrades to the aircraft include adding an increased ability to integrate or accommodate new emerging weapons systems as they become available. This is being done through both hardware and software-oriented "open standards" IP protocol and architecture.
The aircraft is also getting a "fly-by-wire" automated flight control system.
"Fly by wire means when the pilot provides the input — straight to a computer than then determines how to have the aircraft perform the way it wants — provides electrical signals for the more quickly and more safely move from point to point as opposed to using a mechanical controls stick," Boeing officials explained.
Along with these weapons upgrades and other modifications, the F-15 is also getting upgrades to the pilot's digital helmet and some radar signature reducing, or stealthy characteristics.

However, at the same time, the F-15 is not a stealthy aircraft and is expected to be used in combat environments in what is called "less contested" environments where the Air Force already has a margin of air superiority over advanced enemy air defenses.
For this reason, the F-15 will also be increasing networked so as to better support existing 5th-generation platforms such as the F-22 and F-35, Air Force officials said.
The intent of these F-15 upgrades is to effectively perform the missions assigned to the F-15 fleet, which are to support the F-22 in providing air superiority and the F-35 in providing precision attack capabilities, Leese said.
"While these upgrades will not make these aircraft equivalent to 5th generation fighters, they will allow the F-15 to support 5th generation fighters in performing their missions, and will also allow F-15s to assume missions in more permissive environments where capabilities of 5th generation fighters are not required," Leese added.
Boeing officials added that the upgrades to the F-15 will ensure that the fighter aircraft remains superior to its Chinese equivalent.
To judge a plan or budget, it is necessary to consider the goals its creators want to achieve. Donald Trump's budget framework, released this morning, comes with a clear set of intentions. In turn, the goals sit upon a series of assumptions. But no matter how you juggle the reasoning, the result will likely be that the new budget, if used by Congress, will undercut the very things that Trump claims to embrace and, in the process, increase income inequality and deeply hurt those who already bear much of the pain in this country.
The intent of the budget, according to the document, is threefold:
Put the need of Americans first.
Increase domestic safety and security through reprioritizing federal spending "because without safety, there can be no prosperity."
Achieve these changes without increasing the budget deficit.
The three major points contain a number of assumptions:
Someone's needs have been put before those of Americans in the past, presumably, given the budget orientations, immigrants, refugees and foreigners via aid to other countries. There has been a growing threat to citizens from sources abroad and domestic. The budget deficit is a problem.
Some economists would argue that the third actually isn't a problem because of the ability to borrow through the creation of debt and pay over time. Although that has been the "sophisticated" take, history has proven repeatedly that theories can go awry. The Keynesian school suggested that deficit spending might be necessary at times of economic malaise to maintain employment and, therefore, consumer consumption. Periodic deficit spending is different from the constant level of deficit in which the country has indulged for decades. From a politically pragmatic view, constant deficit spending also requires constant increases in the debt ceiling, hardly something to take for granted given the dynamics on Capitol Hill that have shut down the government over the issue.
Misplaced motivations
Grant, then, that at the very least, the goal to avoid growing the deficit is reasonable. The other two issues may sound solid, but actually are not. Moving up the list to the second item, the country is far more secure than it has been in many years. Despite an uptick in violent crime in some cities (that still managed to remain near historical lows), the overall crime rate in 2016 was about the same as it was in 2015, and that has been after a long period of decline.
Terrorist threats from foreigners are of microscopic size, even counting the 9/11 attacks in 2001, according to an analysis by the Cato Institute, which is hardly a bleeding-heart liberal organization. As for homegrown terrorism, it falls under violent crime and, so, isn't on the rise. That doesn't mean concerns over immigration are imaginary. We have a significant immigration problem, but one of a different nature than claims of danger, which means it requires a different orientation than "security."
The first point assumes that the bulk of attention of the federal government has been on non-Americans. Spending doesn't reflect that, unless you look at military campaigns, and those are, by Trump's definition, something that is supposed to be for the good of the country. Foreign aid is a tiny slice of the budget — less than 1 percent, the military portion generally is paid to U.S. arms manufacturers, and even the humanitarian aid goes through U.S. organizations.
Therefore, it is reasonable to argue that Trump's first two priorities as expressions of urgent need are misplaced. More Americans need well-paying jobs, affordable and robust healthcare, ways to reconcile our use of economic immigrants with their non-permitted status, better education within the means of most families, a clean environment, energy sources that aren't dependent on petroleum and coal, and less control of government by large moneyed interests.
However, even assuming that Trump's first two priorities were correct and that they addressed the most pressing issues in this country, which they do not, the overall budgetary treatment of them is highly flawed.
Misplaced money
The increase in budget of the Department of Defense is currently ludicrous because the organization has less control over its spending than a hormonal teenager with his or her first credit card. The DoD has continually been given a pass in its inability to present books that could be financially audited, a requirement for every other department and agency in the federal government. It is impossible at the moment to know how much waste there is in the Defense Department, although some of the largest opportunities to cut waste and increase inefficiency, according to an Office of Management and Budget report from last year that Trump has touted, can be found in the DoD. Until the problems are addressed and it is possible to know where money goes, the additional $54 billion Trump wants to transfer from other agencies and programs could be flushed away in a giant custom-built titanium toilet for all anyone knows.
The deep cuts in other departments Trump's budget envisions undermine his claimed interest in true security and welfare for the American people. He expresses an interest in a more efficient government, and on the surface that is eminently reasonable. Who could make a cogent argument for inefficiency?
There are two essential business and system management problems with the argument. One is that not all efficiencies are the same. In organizational dynamics, there is a concept called suboptimization. There are times that a part of an organization should run in a less-than-optimal fashion because that part is an important cog allowing bigger activities to happen. If you rely on too close a view of what efficiency should be for the part, you may drive behavior that slows down the whole. An example would be a company whose ordering department keeps such tight control over inventory costs that often there aren't the parts or materials to complete customer orders in a timely fashion.
The second problem is that you don't announce the need to reorganize government, looking for efficiency, and then deliver a budget that was crafted before the analysis phase of the reorganization has taken place. On a less complicated level, the equivalent would be to have a mechanic repair your car without diagnostic procedures to identify what was wrong with it. You could easily spend money unnecessarily and not get the necessary results.
Mistakes and misrepresentations aplenty
Such mistakes abound in Trump's budget. One example is the elimination of the Office of Community Services, which includes the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), with the following rationale: "Compared to other income support programs that serve similar populations, LIHEAP is a lower-impact program and is unable to demonstrate strong performance outcomes."
Someone who can deny strong performance outcomes of an energy purchase assistance, which generally means fuel for home heating in cold climates, has never spent a day outside in the depth of a New England winter. When you are cold and cannot afford fuel, you become desperate, particularly when you have a family. Desperate people can do desperate things to remain warm, have food to eat, and meet other basic requirements. Leave people cold and you're likely to drive the crime rate up. Now you've introduced someone into the criminal justice system and you spend money on police, prosecution, and possibly incarceration. The costs may not be obvious in the federal system, as the infractions are likely at the state level, but taxpayers are responsible still for the bill that is now much higher than the few hundred dollars that might have been provided to keep warm enough to live.
That is just one part of the 17.9 percent cut in the Department of Health and Human Services. More money is shifted into the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) program for Medicare and Medicaid, pointing to the $5 return for every invested dollar from 2014 through 2016, assuming that more spending necessarily will get the same return. The National Institutes of Health's budget, which funds much of the necessary medical research in the country, is cut by 18.3 percent. Perhaps efficiencies of operation will be realized, but, again, how much? Restructuring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to use block grants to states — a mechanism proven time and again to allow states to divert money into other areas rather than the ones targeted by allocations — is likely a mistake. Public health can become an expensive problem with ramifications that have an impact on localities, states, and businesses.
There is inherent dishonesty in how many individual figures are presented devoid of historical context. The Department of Housing and Urban Development will see a 13.2 percent decrease from baseline funding, as an example. The corresponding section of the budget framework mentions that it will provide "over $35 billion for HUD's rental assistance programs and proposes reforms that reduce cost while continuing to assist 4.5 million low-income households." Compare that to the 2016 budget that sought $49.3 billion to support 4.7 million low-income families. Can a 29 percent cut in that part of the budget provide the same services given that the claimed number of people being aided drops by only 4 percent?
Cuts in all the wrong places
In the Department of Energy, which will see a 5.6 percent cut, a number of programs that support basic research would be eliminated "because the private sector is better positioned to finance disruptive energy research and development and to commercialize innovative technology." Only, such a statement ignores the history of energy research. Commercial interest spikes when oil prices go up and then drops when the cost of a barrel recedes. A big reason the country hasn't seen much further development of solar is because of the coquettish affections of the private sector.
The Department of Commerce sees a 16 percent budget decrease, including the elimination of the Minority Business Development Agency, which is supposedly "duplicative of other Federal, State, local, and private sector efforts that promote minority business entrepreneurship." The examples given include Small Business Administration District Office and Small Business Development Centers. The SBA will see a 5 percent decrease in budget, including elimination of grant programs "where the private sector provides efficient mechanisms to foster business development and investment," although the clear effect of letting the market do as it will have been the reduction of opportunities for minority entrepreneurship, if you look at apparent discrimination in lending and investment.
The investment in infrastructure to improve roads, fix bridges, and provide jobs Trump claimed he would make as president? The Department of Transportation budget is cut by 13 percent, not increased. Improving the balance of trade? Education? Cut by 13 percent and with $1.4 billion of the $59 billion budget directed at supporting "school choice" of private schools, so ignoring market supply and demand when convenient. The Department of Justice's 3.8 percent decrease also sees a heavy shift toward terrorism, drug enforcement, unauthorized immigration, and border security, suggesting that other areas like white-collar crime, antitrust, and civil rights will be underfunded and ignored.
There are likely proposed actions in the budget that will make sense. But overall poor readings of history, deceptive comparisons, and an apparent ignorance of the underlying conditions that lead to crime and insecurity appear to have driven much of this budget. Income inequality will be hit hard. Many other important things, as well.
By his own account, Yoely, a resident of Williamsburg in his early 30s and a member of the Satmar Hasidic sect, was raised conservatively. He was taught to see other religions as “idol-worshippers” and, in accordance with Satmar belief, to reject the Zionist movement, considering Israel to be insufficiently religious and dangerous by its very existence to Jews elsewhere in the world. But after reading Zionist writings online, his views have softened.
“It's okay what they do; I accept it,” he told me at a Williamsburg cafe, where he asked that his last name not be used. But he's torn. “I really believe I should be more firm about it,” he said.
Yoely has come to regret going online, and his wife and children — the oldest is 11 — have never been. That's by design. “I don't want to have it at home,” he said. “According to the rabbis, I'm not supposed to.”
Yoely, one of tens of thousands of Satmar Jews living in Williamsburg, is far from alone in viewing with skepticism and suspicion the growing pervasiveness of the Internet in modern life. (Last May, Orthodox Jews of a similar mind filled the stands at Citi Field to audit a discussion of the dangers unfettered Internet access can pose to members of their faith.)
But in a borough where 20 to 40 percent of households still lack access to high-speed Internet, those reluctant to embrace change have thrown a wrench in the plans of a local telecom company and the Federal Communications Commission, which together are trying to bring broadband to the underserved.
■
Borough Park-based Xchange Telecom is a regional telecommunications company of modest size, providing phone and broadband service to homes and businesses around the New York metropolitan area. The majority of its customers are in Brooklyn. Xchange participates in the FCC's Lifeline program, which provides discounted phone service to low-income consumers, subsidized by taxes that are paid by phone companies and, typically, partially passed on to non-subsidized consumers in the form of higher rates. It's also one of a handful of companies nationwide, and the only one in New York state, taking part in an FCC pilot program to extend Lifeline subsidies to broadband Internet service.
Unsurprisingly, studies show that access to a reliable Internet connection puts local students and households at an advantage. A report from the Office of the New York City Comptroller cited evidence that middle school students whose families were given free computers and discounted Internet service did better on tests, and that having a computer at home increased the likelihood teenagers would graduate from high school. In an October speech, acting FCC Chairwoman Mignon L. Clyburn cited research (industry-sponsored, it's worth noting) claiming consumers can save thousands of dollars per year shopping online.
“Obviously, broadband delivers value in many other ways, like jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities,” she added.
But some residents just can't afford to pay for a computer and Internet access. The comptroller's office's report found New Yorkers without high-speed access were disproportionately less educated and less affluent. A SUNY-Stony Brook survey cited in the report notes that a majority of those without broadband access cited expense as a reason they hadn't signed up.
“What the FCC realized is access to broadband is the next digital divide, and a lot of people are not getting broadband because they just can't afford it,” Xchange general counsel Mordy Gross said.
Under the pilot, Xchange accepted applications for subsidized home broadband service from households in certain ZIP codes in Williamsburg, Borough Park, Kensington, and Midwood from February through October. Applicants had to meet FCC eligibility requirements, which factored in income, participation in other public assistance programs, and whether candidates already had broadband Internet at home. The subsidized access will last for a year.
It's hard to know the exact number of eligible customers in the pilot areas, said Gross; he pegged it at between 15,000 and 20,000. Now that the nine-month application period is over, however, it's clear that the program failed to gain significant traction with those eligible. Only 400 customers signed up.
“Because of the limited window of availability, I don't think it was as successful in terms of numbers,” Gross said. Whether the program continues beyond the initial pilot year, and in what form, is ultimately up to the FCC, which is set to review the results of the pilot and surveys given to customers next year, he said.
Marketing the program was somewhat of a challenge, said Itzy Eckstein, vice president of consumer sales at Xchange, since part of the pilot's goal is to determine the right level of government subsidy by charging different rates in different ZIP codes. That made it difficult for the company to advertise prices for the program at large, as customers in less-subsidized neighborhoods might have felt like victims of a “bait-and-switch,” he said. And some people eligible for the program just weren't interested, Gross said.
“The pilot helped solve the cost, but to get people to want to use the Internet they need to want to use the Internet,” he said. “A lot of low-income people don't see the need for Internet access at all, and that's what we've been finding.” Others want access only to a sanitized subset of the Internet.
“Residentially Brooklyn is a collection of neighborhoods, and those neighborhoods, whether it's Asian communities, Jewish communities, other communities, Muslim communities — they want certain subsets of clean information,” Xchange President Darren Feder said. “These are pious people.”
■
To help put these pious customers at ease, Xchange has long offered a custom filtering service.
“We work within ethnic groups like the Hasidic groups and other groups if they want to have a community-based filter, where they have a community standard on what kind of Internet they'll allow through. Some of them say ‘No YouTube,” some of them say ‘Yes YouTube', etc.,” Gross said.
The filtering technology, called JNet, was developed for the Orthodox Jewish community, but it's general software that can work for anyone who wants filtered access, Eckstein said.
Some customers only want access to email or sites they use for their businesses, or to shopping and banking portals, he said. “It can vary: some people will say, ‘I'm a travel agent — I only want travel sites open; I don't want anything else open,'” he said, while some want to allow at least limited recreational use. Since even seemingly innocuous sites sometimes contain images customers might find objectionable — like a scantily clad woman in an ad on a bank home page — the filters can detect and weed out images showing too much skin, Eckstein said.
“There has been a big movement in the Orthodox Jewish world over the past two years to increase awareness of the fact that you can't trust yourself and everybody should have a filter,” said Gross. “My oldest is nine years old and he knows way too much. So if I didn't have a filter at home, I'd be very worried giving him access to a computer, and in today's society, you can't give them access.”
Yoely, on the other hand, considers even filtered Internet too potentially corrupting to introduce into his home. When he needs to get online, he mostly uses the Internet at friends' offices, he told me. There, he checks his email, shops, reads blogs and news sites, and visits YouTube.
Rabbi Moshe Drew, president and founder of Technology Awareness Group, a nonprofit that staffs a round-the-clock phone bank to help Orthodox Jews deal with issues of technology and faith, says that there's no “one-size-fits-all approach” to filtering.
“There's a difference between LinkedIn and Snapchat,” he said. “If they're going into it for a legit reason, and they want to use it for business or they want to use it for a family connection, so be it.”
■
Those same basic desires — to conduct business and stay in touch with family and friends while steering clear of the seedier side of the Internet — were echoed by the students and staff at Older Adults Technology Services, a nonprofit that offers computer classes and access to seniors throughout the five boroughs.
“The biggest thing we address is fear: I'll break it; I can't do it; I'm too old to learn,” said Barbara J. Kelly, OATS's director of program development. “You still have people who say, ‘I don't need it.'”
At a recent beginning-level class in a computer lab at Quincy Senior Residence in Bedford-Stuyvesant, OATS instructor Susan Paul asked her students what they thought about the Internet, before guiding them to their first websites.
“You can buy, sell and trade — and also get ripped off,” one woman said.
But despite such misgivings, demand for classes is always high at Quincy — where nonresident seniors are also allowed to enroll in the computer classes and, once they graduate, use the computer lab — and other OATS sites, said Kelly.
Quincy resident Lenette Kinion, who worked as a social worker and ran a daycare center before retirement, said she was among the first to take the OATS class.
“I learned how to Skype with my family,” Kinion said. “My grandson was in Germany, and I learned how to talk with him, when he was in the Army.”
Now, she even has her own Facebook account and iPhone.
“I didn't have an iPhone but my daughter had one, so I kept complaining, ‘I want an iPhone,'” she said. Now, her daughter's helping her learn to use FaceTime.
“She was laughing at me trying to use the right buttons,” Kinion said with a laugh of her own.
Kinion still visits Paul's classes at Quincy to help others learn to use technology.
“There's just such an incredible need and desire to learn,” Paul said. “It's kind of an overall hunger.”
Paul previously worked as a typist and word processor at law firms. She always enjoyed showing lawyers and secretaries tricks to help them create nice-looking documents electronically, she said. Now, she helps seniors at OATS sites around the city master the mouse and find everything from medical information to music online.
“Pandora, of course, is really big,” she said, though the music seniors like can vary from neighborhood to neighborhood. Motown is popular in Bed-Stuy, and she watched Psy's “Gangnam Style” video with a class in Flushing, she said.
“I'd forgotten how many pelvic thrusts are in that video, so I was very embarrassed,” she said. She quickly decided to play Taiwanese pop star Teresa Teng, a student recommendation, instead.
“It's the most fun job I've ever had,” she said.
The OATS classes are focused on senior citizens, but other New Yorkers who want to get online or take computer classes can turn to the network of computer resource centers in dozens of the parks department's recreation centers. Access to those computer labs and classes is included with rec center membership, which is free for anyone under 18 and $25 for those between 18 and 24 or age 62 and up.
“I have people of all ages learning to use Excel and people of all ages writing blogs and making video,” as well as students simply doing homework, said Ana-Maria Campos, the director of the resource centers.
“People are writing off-Broadway plays in some of our rooms or creating their own music videos,” she said. “Anyone who might be looking for work [or] in work transition and needs a place to get work done or work away from home, it's a great resource.”
The New York City Housing Authority also operates bookmobile-style roaming computer labs that tour some of the authority's housing developments, offering Internet-enabled computers and wireless access to housing residents and others in the area.
“Many use them to search for jobs; apply for employment online; print out forms; and work on their résumés,” according to a statement from the housing authority. “Senior residents generally come to learn how to use a computer and/or open an email account; youth use social media sites and research information for school; while others may need assistance in looking for a doctor, a school or to register for an exam.”

With the Internet now vital to so many ordinary tasks — including some, like job hunting, that are increasingly difficult to do any other way — it's not surprising that the FCC and companies like Xchange are working to get holdouts online. But the challenge remains of convincing some that the Internet's benefits outweigh its costs — financial and otherwise.
Yoely, for his part, said his children will likely one day need to go online, even as he remains conflicted about his own experience with the Internet.
“It's a good thing and it's a bad thing,” he told me. “It's a good thing that I accept people more, but I feel like I cheated on my own religion.”
A man who flew from Liberia to Dallas this month was diagnosed with Ebola on Tuesday, becoming the first person to board a passenger jet and unknowingly bring the disease here from West Africa, where it has killed thousands of people in recent months
Experts had said that such an event was increasingly likely the longer the epidemic rages in West Africa. But health officials were quick Tuesday to tamp down any hysteria, emphasizing the ways in which the U.S. medical system is well equipped to halt the spread of the disease.
“We're stopping it in its tracks in this country,” Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a news conference Tuesday afternoon.
The infected man, who was not identified, left Liberia on Sept. 19 and arrived in the United States the next day to visit family members.
Health officials are working to identify everyone who may have been exposed to him since he began showing symptoms last week. Frieden said this covered just a “handful” of people, a group that will be watched for three weeks to see whether any symptoms emerge among them.

“The bottom line here is that I have no doubt that we will control this importation, or this case of Ebola, so that it does not spread widely in this country,” Frieden said. “It is certainly possible that someone who had contact with this individual could develop Ebola in the coming weeks. But there is no doubt in my mind that we will stop it here.”
People who traveled on the same planes as this man are not in danger because his temperature was checked before the flights and he was not symptomatic at the time, Frieden said. Ebola is contagious only if the infected person has symptoms. The virus can be spread through bodily fluids or infected animals but not through the air.
“There is zero risk of transmission on the flight,” Frieden said.
There were more than 6,500 reported cases of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone as of Tuesday, and the illness has been blamed for more than 3,000 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Ebola was first identified in 1976, and the current outbreak in West Africa is considered the largest and most complex in the known history of the virus, with more cases and deaths than every other outbreak combined.
Until now, the only known cases of Ebola in the United States involved American doctors and aid workers who were infected overseas and returned to the country for treatment. All have survived.
One of them, Richard Sacra, was discharged last week from a Nebraska hospital. Days later, the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., admitted an American physician who was exposed to the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone. There were reports of possible Ebola patients in New York, California, New Mexico and Miami, but all of them tested negative for the virus.
The unidentified person with Ebola is being treated in intensive care at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, according to Edward Goodman, the hospital's epidemiologist.
Three Dallas Fire/EMS crew members — two paramedics and one paramedic intern — are being monitored after transporting the patient to the hospital, a Dallas official confirmed. They will remain at home during a 21-day period and checked often for symptoms of the deadly virus, Lt. Joel Lavender of the Dallas Fire Rescue said. The ambulance was also decontaminated later, he said.
From television to Twitter, Tuesday's news made the distant health crisis seem like something that could appear almost anywhere. But experts said it was hard to imagine that Ebola would not find its way across other borders — a CDC estimate recently projected that more than a million people in West Africa could be infected by the end of January if the epidemic is left unchecked.
“It was inevitable once the outbreak exploded,” said Thomas Geisbert, a professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, who has researched Ebola for decades. “Unless you were going to shut down airports and keep people from leaving [West Africa], it's hard to stop somebody from getting on a plane.”
But Geisbert quickly underscored how unlikely the virus is to spread in the United States. For starters, he said, officials placed the sick man in quarantine quickly to prevent him from potentially infecting others. In addition, health workers are already contacting and monitoring any others with whom he might have had contact in recent days.
“The system that was put in place worked the way it was supposed to work,” Geisbert said.
That doesn't guarantee that no one else will be infected, because the sick person could have transmitted the virus to someone else before being isolated. But that approach almost certainly ensures that the United States will quickly contain the disease. In addition, while there is no approved treatment for Ebola, hydration and other basic medical care is far better in the United States than in West Africa, making it more likely that Ebola patients will survive here.
President Obama spoke with Frieden on Tuesday afternoon about the patient and the efforts to seek out any other potential cases, the White House said.
At a news briefing later in the day, Frieden said that the infected man did not develop symptoms until about four days after arriving in the country. He sought medical care on Sept. 26 but was sent home. He was admitted to the hospital two days later and placed in isolation, but it remained unclear Tuesday how many people he might have encountered since he became contagious. Frieden, who would not say whether the patient is a U.S. citizen, said the man is not believed to have been working as part of the response to the Ebola outbreak.
David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of Health Services, said the state's laboratory in Austin received a sample of the patient's blood Tuesday morning and confirmed the presence of Ebola several hours later. The laboratory was certified to do Ebola testing last month.
The deadliest Ebola outbreak in history is centered in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, although there is a separate outbreak in Congo. The affected countries have fragile or barely existent health-care systems, people are being turned away from treatment centers, and family members are caring directly for those sick and dying from Ebola.
For months, the CDC has been conducting briefings for hospital workers and clinicians about the proper protocol for diagnosing the infection in patients suspected of carrying the virus, as well as the kinds of infection control measures to manage hospitalized patients known or suspected to have the disease. Many procedures involve the same types of infection control that major hospitals are already supposed to have in place.
Early recognition is a critical element of infection control. Symptoms include fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, severe headache, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea and contact within 21 days before onset of symptoms with the blood or other bodily fluids or human remains of someone known or suspected to have the disease, or travel to an area where transmission is active.
The CDC also has scheduled more training for U.S. workers who plan on volunteering in West Africa or want to be prepared if cases surface at their own hospitals.

Claire Ricke | KXAN - AUSTIN (KXAN) - The lawsuit against Whole Foods for writing a gay slur on a cake has been withdrawn.
Jordan Brown apologized to the company for using "the media to perpetuate this story." He said the company did nothing wrong and he wants to apologize for questioning their values, and the bakery associate he questioned in the lawsuit.
Brown also said he was sorry for diverting attention away from "real" LGBTQ issues. He ended his statement apologizing to his partner, family, church, and attorney.
In April, Brown said he went to Whole Foods for a cake that said "Love Wins," but instead discovered the words "Love Wins F-," an anti-gay slur. Brown claimed the cake was sealed with a sticker when the employee handed it to him.
Whole Foods countered the suit claiming the charges were fraudulent. Surveillance video from the grocery store showed Brown buy the cake April 14. A Whole Foods spokesperson said the UPC label was visible on the top of the cake in the video, and moved to the side of the box in the video Brown released.
The lawsuit stated Brown did not notice the additional word on the cake until he was at a stop light and looked down at the cake. He claims he left a voicemail to the Whole Foods corporate office but never heard back.

Non-theistic beliefs, spiritual paths, etc. Apatheism: "Do god(s) exist?
I don't know & I don't really care" Sponsored link. Terminology: The term "Apatheism" is a portmanteau 1 -- a combination of two words. They may be considered a fusing of: "Apathy" and "Theism" or "Apathy and "Atheism." When spoken, the emphasis is on the "pa," as in the word "apathy." Apatheism is more an attitude than a belief or belief system. An Apatheist is a person who regards the question of the existence or non-existence of a god or gods to be essentially meaningless and irrelevant. However, some define the term more broadly to refer to apathy towards all religions or belief systems, not just toward a belief in god. Unlike most Theists, Agnostics, Atheists, etc, an Apatheist doesn't really care whether it is possible to prove either the existence or non-existence of a god. Apatheism is a.k.a. pragmatic Atheism, and practical Atheism. An associated term is Apathetic Agnosticism, a.k.a. Pragmatic Agnosticism. This is the view that millennia of debate has neither proven nor disproven the existence of a god or gods. However, even if one or more deities exist, they do not appear to be concerned about the fate of humans. Thus, their existence has little impact on humanity and should be of little interest. The origin of "Apatheisms" is unclear: According to the Wikipedia article on Apatheism, 2 the website titled "The Church of Apatheism" went online in the year 2000. 3 The latter is believed to be a satiric web site, although it is often difficult to determine which religious web sites are satiric and which are serious.
According to the Global Oneness Commitment Foundation, the term was used on message boards as early as 2000-JUL. 4
Johnathan Rauch wrote an article on Apatheism in the 2003-MAY edition of The Atlantic magazine. 5
According to the Urban Dictionary, it was coined in 2004 by Grayson Scantelbury in Vancouver, BC, Canada. 6 A possible benefit of Apatheism: Johnathan Rauch, who describes himself as " ... an unrepentantly atheistic Jewish homosexual ," wrote an article in The Atlantic , saying, in part: "Apatheism -- a disinclination to care all that much about one's own religion, and an even stronger disinclination to care about other people's -- may or may not be something new in the world, but its modern flowering, particularly in ostensibly pious America, is worth getting excited about." "Apatheism concerns not what you believe but how. In that respect it differs from the standard concepts used to describe religious views and people. [Strong] Atheism, for instance, is not at all like apatheism; the hot-blooded atheist cares as much about religion as does the evangelical Christian, but in the opposite direction. "Secularism" can refer to a simple absence of devoutness, but it more accurately refers to an ACLU-style disapproval of any profession of religion in public life -- a disapproval that seems puritanical and quaint to apatheists. Tolerance is a magnificent concept, John Locke's inestimable gift to all mankind; but it assumes, as Locke did, that everyone brims with religious passions that everyone else must work hard to put up with. And agnostics? True, most of them are apatheists, but most apatheists are not agnostics. Because -- and this is an essential point -- many apatheists are believers. ..." "Religion, as the events of September 11 and after have so brutally underscored, remains the most divisive and volatile of social forces. To be in the grip of religious zeal is the natural state of human beings, or at least of a great many human beings; that is how much of the species seems to be wired. Apatheism, therefore, should not be assumed to represent a lazy recumbency, like my collapse into a soft chair after a long day. Just the opposite: it is the product of a determined cultural effort to discipline the religious mindset, and often of an equally determined personal effort to master the spiritual passions. It is not a lapse. It is an achievement." 5 In his article he refers to the well known fact that about 40% of American adults tell public opinion pollsters that they attend religious services weekly. However, when nose counters actually try to verify this number, they find that about half of Americans lie about church attendance. Only about 20% actually go. Canadian statistics are similar: about 20% say they go; 10% do go. He concludes: "A great many Americans ... apparently care about religion enough to say they are religious, but not enough to go to church." Some tentative conclusions: Apatheism may well be one of the largest religious divisions in the U.S., although few people know the meaning of the term. To our knowledge, no public opinion pollster has ever attempted to measure the number of Apatheists.
If Apatheism became a dominant force in the world, religiously-motivated terrorists would have major recruitment problems. No Apatheist would be prepared to fly an airliner into a tall building in order to make a religious statement.
Mission programs would similarly suffer if Apatheism became dominant.
A great deal of human suffering would result if Apatheism became prominent and was coupled with a lack of commitment to the Ethic of Reciprocity -- the Golden Rule regarding the treatment of other people. A mixed view of Apatheism by a Unitarian Universalist minister: The Rev. Mark Stringer of the First Unitarian Church of Des Moines sees positive and negative aspects of Apatheism. In a 2004 sermon he said, in part: "On the surface, apatheism sounds like a good idea, and compared to the rigidity of fundamentalism, it is definitely a cultural improvement. Certainly most of us would agree that, throughout recorded history, enormous amounts of damage have been done by humans wound too tightly in their own religious zeal. An increase in the number of people who are committed to more relaxed religiosity, who do not see it as their religious duty to separate the saved from the unsaved, the sheep from the goats, the pure and holy heterosexuals from the wicked and evil homosexuals, just to name one currently pertinent example, canât be anything but good, right? The rise of apatheism, then, could be seen as a welcome indication that more and more people are not taking religion so seriously and frankly, in a world where those holding fanatical religious views can put entire countries on the defensive, itâs about time. ..." "As I have pondered the concept of apatheism this week, Iâve come to see that Iâve moved away from it as a descriptor for my own beliefs because I now realize that there is too much at stake to be indifferent about matters of religion." "I recognize that I canât be an apatheist because, while I donât wish to deny your individual perceptions of the God you may follow, I do care and am affected by what you think the God you may follow feels about me, my friends and companions, and this earth we share." I need to be something more than indifferent, for example, if your God is telling you to discriminate against, withhold civil rights from, or persecute people simply based on their gender or sexual orientation, class, race, or politics. "I need to be something more than indifferent if your God requires you to support wide-ranging censorship or the disregard of scientific fact in favor of creationism." "I need to be something more than indifferent if your God requires you to support unfair distribution of income or privilege." "Or if your God sanctions misuse of the planet or doesnât question a lack of environmental responsibility." "Or if your God is calling upon you to take up a crusade or holy war against another people, whether the facts support this crusade or not." "My ever-evolving Unitarian Universalist faith has helped me see that in all of these cases, and many more, I need to be something more than indifferent, something more than apatheistic." 7 YouTube entries concerning Apatheism: "Apatheism - the New Anti-Religion" at: http://www.youtube.com/

An activist dressed as Scrooge McDuck throws counterfeit money from a golden mountain onto protesters during a demonstratio Getty Stock for stock and dollar for dollar, Silicon Valley companies give more political donations to Republicans than Democrats, and are more likely to have right-leaning stockholders to boot, according to a new report by news site The Daily Dot.
This runs contrary to Silicon Valley's reputation as waving the banner of American liberalism — but the numbers don't lie.
The data, gathered by the Daily Dot's in late February using government watchdog OpenSecrets.org, had a number of surprising findings. Key among them:
The top 20 tech companies (corporations and their employees) gave $8,140,277 to Republican politicians and $7,952,915 to Democratic ones.
The biggest political spenders were Comcast ($2.9 million), AT&T ($2.8 million), and Verizon ($2.6 million). Comcast gave its money to an almost-even split of Democrats and Republicans, but AT&T and Verizon gave more to conservatives.
Among the US Congress, 30 Republicans are Apple stockholders to 21 Democratic ones, while Google counts 16 Republican and 9 Democratic lawmakers as stockholders.
Microsoft and Intel are both just about exactly 50/50 on the Democrat/Republican split.
Not a single American legislator owns stock in Twitter. Sorry, White House social media team.
Only Facebook and Time Warner Cable have more Democratic legislators than Republicans in terms of share ownership.

Opinion Section: Bribery, Part II
Last weekend, I preached about Bribery, and how there were no “magic words” that would let you get across the idea that you were bribing someone without actually getting penalized for bribery. The responses I got, in comments and elsewhere, were interesting. One group of comments seemed to say that this wasn't really that big of an issue, because pro players knew how to “get around the rule so easily.”
First off, Bribery is a big thing, because it has a real impact on other players. The outcome of a given match does not just affect the two players in that match, it affects the tiebreakers of every player either of the players involved in the bribery had played at any time during the event. The first tiebreaker, after your own match wins, is opponent match wins. If one of your opponents accepts a bribe and loses a game that they would have won, that player's match win percentage – your first tie-breaker – is significantly lower than it would have been. That can easily be the difference between 8th and 9th place. And that sort of thing does not just affect the Top 8.
The difference between 32nd and 33rd place finish at a Grand Prix is $250. At GP Atlanta, Rob Pisano (32nd) finished ahead of Michael Segal (33rd) by 0.0004%. Had even one opponent of either flipped their result in any match in the event, Mr. Segal would be $250 richer. At GP Providence, it was the gap between 16th ($1,000) and 17th ($500) that was razor thin.
Bribery for match wins affects the integrity of the entire tournament, which is why it is a disqualification offense. It is why Wizards must oppose it, and must try to prevent it.
In one of the announcements of a Bribery DQ, Wizards commented that some pros do not appear to know that Wizards does not condone bribery, collusion or even IDs, since they all affect the tiebreakers – and tournament results – of other players. ID's are a different discussion, but the point about pros not knowing why bribery and collusion are problems is well taken. Pros should understand the impact their actions can have.
Commenters also said that “if a rule is difficult to enforce, it is a bad rule.” I strongly disagree. The fact that something is difficult to enforce does not make it a bad rule or law. It is difficult to catch or prosecute all shoplifters, or catch every vandal, but that does not mean that society should make theft or destruction of other people's property legal.
It is hard to prevent collusion between players, since judges cannot be everywhere. If players discuss and agree to collusive behavior before they arrive at the event, or have an understanding that, if a player cheats (and throwing a match in expectation of a payment is cheating, both under the rules and morally) with an unspoken expectation that the other player will make it up to them later, that can be very hard to prove. Note that I did not say detect, I said prove. Players can have a legitimate reason to concede a match and it is not possible to get inside a player's brain to determine why the player conceded a match. Sometimes friends concede to each other. Sometimes players need to leave an event early. And sometimes players concede because they expect to be paid later. As a judge, it is our job to figure out which reason applies, and DQ if it is the later. If we are convinced it is the later, we DQ. If we are unsure, we may have to give players the benefit of the doubt.
Again, policing bribery is hard, but that does not mean that we should allow it. Too many other players are harmed every time a bribe affects the outcome of the match.
One additional thought – we judges know that bribery exists, and that pro players often concede to each other with the unspoken expectation of getting something later on. We also know that most of the time we cannot prove it. As a result, when we do catch someone offering and/or accepting a bribe, we have very little sympathy. Bribery is illegal. The head judge generally makes an announcement to that effect at every event, and even without the announcement, people should know that corruption is wrong. That means that when we catch someone offering a bribe, they are highly unlikely to get off with a warning. Just saying.

Eternal Weekend was last weekend. 410 players converged to play the format, somewhat offsetting SCGs announcement that it will greatly reduce its support for Legacy. Coverage is here . The SCG announcement is here . The winning deck was one I had not seen much of – a green based Dark Depths combo deck.
Vintage: I am having trouble getting to the eternal weekend coverage page, so I'm pulling my deck from the European eternal weekend event. Instead, a reminder that the next season of the Vintage Super League will begin in early January.
Card Prices
Note: all my prices come from the fine folks at MTGOTraders.com . These are retail prices, and generally the price of the lowest priced, actively traded version. (Prices for some rare promo versions are not updated when not in stock, so I skip those.) You can get these cards at MTGOTraders.com web store, or from their bots: MTGOTradersBot(#) (they have bots 1-10), CardCaddy and CardWareHouse, or sell cards to MTGOTradersBuyBot(#) (they have buybots 1-4). I have bought cards from MTGOTraders for over a decade now, and have never been overcharged or disappointed.
Standard staples: Standard prices are doing about churning a bit. These changes reflect the metagame changes – the price drops from lots of KLD being opened have ended.
Modern staples: Modern prices have bounced around a bit this week. I wonder if the big losses on Liliana and other staples are a result of treasure chests being opened.
Legacy and Vintage: Legacy and Vintage are up just a touch overall. A lot of cards have shown very small price increases, but almost all no losses. Misdirection is down, but Misdirection is rarely more than a one-of in Vintage (Stephen Menendian aside), so a small number of Treasure Chests might well cause the drop despite the overall uptrend.
Set Redemption: You can redeem complete sets on MTGO. You need to purchase a redemption voucher from the store for $25. During the next downtime, Wizards removes a complete set from your account and sends you the same set in paper.

Weekly Highlights
Not a ton of Magic again this week. Family obligations plus work meant I never even got to load the program. I also did not get a chance to watch the Warsaw coverage, but apparently the Internet connection was giving Wizards problems, so I guess I didn't miss anything.

“One Million Words” and “3MWords” on MTGO
This series is an ongoing tribute to Erik “Hamtastic” Friborg.

For the first time in its 83-year history, Family Circle magazine is featuring a set of parents with their transgender child in its pages.
The magazine, which boasts a readership of 18 million, has been running a monthly column called “Modern Life” for the past year. The August issue, which hit stands on Wednesday, features Jodie Patterson and her partner Joseph Ghartey with their 7-year-old transgender son, Penel, one of the family's five children. “We had to take the time to learn. It's been an eye-opening experience that's given all of us a better understanding of the world,” Patterson says in the story about raising Penel. “I'm just starting to comprehend ‘identity' in its true meaning.”
STORY: Family Circle Defends Decision to Include Gay Dads
Just last year, Family Circle faced backlash when it ran a “Modern Life” column featuring a family with two dads, and the reaction to this story has been similar. “Final straw! Canceling my subscription after many years,” wrote one long-time reader when the magazine posted the column on its Facebook page. “Kids don't know what they want for breakfast, why are we letting them change their sex?” asked another. One reader even called the article “wrong on so many levels.”
STORY: Magazine Features Breastfeeding Model on Cover
Suzanne Rust, lifestyle editor at Family Circle and the author of this month's column, says she isn't surprised that there have been negative comments, but she's not deterred by them, either. “We knew it was going to cause some stir,” she tells Yahoo Parenting. “A lot of people associate us with a traditional family magazine, and we are, but we are a modern traditional family magazine, and that means our goal is to reflect all families.”
The intention of the “Modern Life” column, Rust says, is to tell “real stories about real people,” and to enlighten readers. “The concept of having a transgender child is confusing and complicated for some readers, but when you present a loving family like this, my hope is to educate,” she says. “We want readers to see how loving this family is so we can all have a little more understanding about what it means to have a transgender child.”
And the reaction hasn't been all negative. “We've gotten nice emails saying ‘this is not my mother's Family Circle,'” Rust says. And mixed in with the outrage online are messages of support, like this one: “Why shouldn't Family Circle do a story about a family adjusting to a new norm for them? I think Penel is a very lucky young person to have such a wonderful support system.” Another user chimed in, “God made us exactly who we are for a reason. Changing our sex doesn't change our heart, mentality, intellectual capacity or the world around us.”
The portrayal of a family that is supportive of a transgender child is important not just for readers who are unfamiliar with the LGBT community, but also for readers who see themselves in Penel and his parents and siblings. “It's important for children and youth who are transgender to see themselves reflected back in the world,” Pamela Wool, director of family services and administration at the support organization Gender Spectrum, tells Yahoo Parenting. “It's also important for parents [of transgender children] to see that their families are not the only ones, for them to have a model of a family who supports their child and that [the] child is thriving and having a good life.”
Rust says she's proud to showcase how Family Circle has changed. “We want to be honest and relevant and keep things current and reflective of the times,” she says. “We want our readers to evolve with us. These are beautiful stories of beautiful families.”

On January 7th, Darrin Manning, a 16-year old honor student at Philadelphia's Mathematics, Civics & Sciences Charter School, was the victim of what is undeniably the most horrifying “stop and frisks” on record. After being stopped by the police for no valid reason, Manning was “frisked” so hard that they ruptured one of his testicles, rendering him sterile.
This terrible injustice began on the afternoon of January 7th, when Darrin Manning and a few of his friends from his school's basketball team were walking home after practice—it was brutally cold (the polar vortex was hovering over the city and the “high” temperature of the day was a blistering 14 degrees) and they were bundled up in scarves and gloves provided by their school.
During the ten minute walk from the school to the subway, police saw Manning and his friends—a group of young black males wearing scarves—and decided that they were suspicious and in need of a stopping and frisking. When the police told the kids to stop, they took off running, but Manning decided to stop after only a very short distance.
At this point, the stories of the police and Manning diverge:
Manning claims that he walked back to the police and let them handcuffed and search him—in violation of police procedure, this search was performed by a female officer. Here is a quote from Manning describing the search in question: “She patted me down and then she touched my butt and then my private parts, and then she grabbed and squeezed and pulled my private parts and I felt something pop.”
The police claim that Manning walked back to them and started swinging, beating one officer and ripping off his radio set before being subdued. According to these officers, they had no idea that Manning was hurt until he was rushed to the Hospital for emergency surgery. Because of the account of these police, Manning is currently being charged with counts of resisting arrest, assaulting a police officer, and reckless endangerment.
Put simply, the story of these police officers is nonsense coming from a disreputable source. The officer who says that he was attacked by Manning had no bruises or damage to his clothing, but he does have two accusations of false arrest in his Internal Affairs file. To further refute his claims, witnesses to the incident have corroborated Manning's story.
Finally, the idea that any man could have his testicles crushed without signaling any distress is flat-out absurd.
A crushed testicle is an 11 on this chart
Darrin Manning is a straight A-student who has no history of violence or discipline problems, making the accusations against him extremely suspect. Given the Manning's history, along with the credibility of the officer involved and the witnesses, this is likely a case of police inflating charges to justify the excessive force that they used in handing the kid (not an uncommon occurrence).
Hopefully, Manning will be cleared of all charges and will file a 7+figure civil suit against the Philadelphia PD that brutalized him. In addition to ensuring that Manning is taken care of, I would hope that the police fire the officers involved in this brutality—both the arresting officers and the female officer who searched the boy—and that the city pursues all possible legal action against them.
Unfortunately, I have serious doubts that any of these things will happen.
The Larger Context
Whenever proponents of stop and frisk programs argue in support of the program, they use some permutation of the argument that the stop and frisk is a minor inconvenience that innocent people don't need to worry about—after all, it takes a few seconds for them to empty their pockets, then they can be on their way if they aren't carrying anything illegal.
Put simply, these people have no understanding of the 4th Amendment and are likely people who are wealthy or white enough not to worry about being stopped and frisked. To these people, the false sense of security that comes from stop and frisk programs simply outweighs the constitutional violations of the program and the humiliation of those who are stopped.
While it is important to note that nothing illegal was found on Manning during the search, this fact is actually of secondary importance to the story's greater context: In this case, police accosted a minor who, by the police's own admission, was not suspected of any crime, and inflicted irreparable and excruciating damage to him. It wouldn't matter if the police had found a grenade launcher in Manning's backpack during the search—the fact remains that the police stopped and maimed a kid based upon nothing more than a whim.
Unfortunately, as this case illustrates, stop and frisk can have terrible consequences on even the innocent. Darrin Manning was innocent of carrying any illegal goods and was stopped for the simple reason that he was walking while black; to add a little irony into the situation, he was also the only one of his friends to voluntarily go to the police and submit to the search (as a “good law-abiding citizen” would do).
In an interview with a local paper, Manning's father reflects on this aspect of his son's arrest and maiming. He said that “I blame myself; I taught my son to respect cops, not to fear them. Maybe if he was afraid, he would have run like the other boys and he would have been OK.”
Despite the fact that he was innocent, Manning was detained under false charges and had his testicles crushed—to put his pain into perspective, being kicked in the testicles registers a 9000 del, which is the pain equivalent to breaking bones in 3200 places at the same time. To compound the injury to Manning, doctors have said that Manning will likely never be able to have children due to his injuries.
The next time that somebody asks why some poor black man runs from the police if he isn't guilty of a crime, you need only point to this case. Being innocent of a crime means little if the police crush your testicles while searching you… or shoot you while “arresting” you… or beat you into a coma… or do any other terrible thing that some police have done in the past.
This terrible tragedy is simply the latest reason why we must end stop and frisk while implementing police reform that prevent future brutality. Stop and frisk is a stain on our Constitution that violates the 4th Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure while police brutality is an evisceration of the 8th Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment.
Put simply, the next person to be a victim of these egregious violations of our rights could be somebody who you care about—demand that your local and state politicians work to protect your rights.
As a final note, here is a link to the ACLU's guide on what to do if you are stopped by police.
Microsoft is introducing its own version of Apple's AirDrop feature in Windows 10. The software giant has started testing its “Near Share” feature of Windows 10 in the latest Insider build (17035) today, and it's designed to make file sharing easier. Like AirDrop, Near Share will let Windows 10 PCs share documents or photos to PCs nearby via Bluetooth.
A new Near Share option will be available in the notification center, and the feature can be accessed through the main share function in Windows 10. Files will be shared wirelessly, and recipients will receive a notification when someone is trying to send a file. We haven't tested the new feature fully, but it sounds perfect for sending space sloths during company meetings. Microsoft's addition comes just a day after Google unveiled its own AirDrop-like app for Android.
Alongside the new Near Share feature, Microsoft is also adding mute a tab to the Edge browser. Like Chrome, mute a tab will silence irritating auto playing videos or ads in a browsing session. Microsoft is also bringing Surface hardware into its Microsoft Store app, allowing Windows 10 users to purchase devices and accessories.
A 10-year-old Philip Womack had a Eureka moment reading The Iliad by Homer, transported all the way back to the Trojan War and experiencing the unique connection to the past that storytelling brings
The Iliad, Homer, 18 October 1991.
I know the date as it's stamped into the front of my book. I was 10 years old, just, and in my first term at a small, kindly boarding school, itself in a Norman manor house, which nestled in the Arun valley in between the two castles of Arundel and Amberley.
Every week there was a bookshop. A prefect would open up a cupboard in the corner of the library and lay books out for us to browse. I remember, perhaps the second or third time, staring at a Penguin Classic, on the cover of which a chariot was in the process of tipping over. Men bearing shields stood around it, in various poses of fright. The book was called simply, The Iliad; the author, Homer; the price, astonishing now, £2.99.
I bought it, along with The Odyssey, much to the chagrin of one of the classically minded prefects who'd had them in his sights. I took them back to my dormitory, and that night, during the half hour of “silent reading” we had before bed, began to read.

Of course, most of it went over my head. Even to, as I was, a precocious 10-year-old who delighted in Latin tables and JRR Tolkien, the language of EV Rieu's translation seemed archaic and difficult. But it didn't deter me. There was something about it that cast a glamour – a spell that I've never really been released from. Even now, walking down the streets of London, thousands of years after a war that, if it happened at all, was probably only a skirmish about some cattle, I find myself seeing Achilles, the best warrior of the Greeks, dragging the Trojan Hector round Trafalgar Square, while Helen, the gorgeous cause of it all, looks down from the arch above.
How libraries brought out my inner book geek Read more
Since then, I've read The Iliad in its original Greek, and have consumed new translations, even reviewing one for a national newspaper. And yet it's still that first book I return to. Battered, bent, the front cover almost torn, the back cover ripped off, it sits on my shelf, next to the Hammond translation I had as a teenager. I used it for years, to read, re-read, and later to teach from.
What was it that appealed so to me, in my grey corduroy shorts, long grey socks, and grey jumper, in a cool Sussex autumn? The Iliad tells the story of a few weeks in the last year of the Trojan war - a war that lasted 10 years, as the Greek armies besieged Troy to retrieve Helen, their captured princess. At first, I think, it was the alien quality of it. Here were people, long ago, doing things that seemed impossibly strange. They quarrelled about things I didn't really understand – but they also talked to gods. Athena herself came down to stay Achilles' hand in the very first pages. Theirs was a world where the supernatural was simply accepted as part of the normal course of affairs. Gods stalked the battlefields; fretted and cooed over their favourites; Zeus sent black rain to mourn the loss of his son Sarpedon. These Achaean warriors on the shores of Troy fought with rivers; Achilles had immortal horses that wept at the knowledge of his approaching death.
Reading Dragonsbane was my ultimate eureka moment Read more
In this way, the Iliadic knights seemed to me brothers of the Arthurian knights that I was also obsessed with. They rode through forests, chancing on white harts and magicians. Was our reality so? Could the trees talk, the rivers sing?
That was my Eureka moment. I couldn't pinpoint it exactly, but it was a growing sense that people had been telling stories - fantastical, beautiful stories - for as long as there had been people, and that we were still reacting to and talking about them. There was a universe of difference between the warriors of my imagination – blood-stained, grim, but with their own cast-iron code of honour - and the paperback in my hand, as I sat absorbed by it among the comforting rituals of school and play.
But that paperback was, and is, a time-machine, transporting the reader right into the thick of that battle. In those pages I found Homer's poetry among the 1950s prose; violence, tenderness, love and magic; and most importantly, what it was like to be a human, right at the edge of time.
Philip Womack's fifth novel, The Double Axe, will be published by Alma in 2016. His sixth novel, The King's Revenge, the final part in the Darkening Path trilogy, will appear later in that year.
Nestled between Madagascar and Africa, Mayotte is part of the Comoro archipelago in the Indian Ocean. The sun-drenched tropical isle - 10,000 kilometers from Paris - was purchased by France in 1841 and has enjoyed administrative autonomy since 1946.
For many Mahorais, as the local residents are called, March 31 is a day to celebrate because the long-held desire to become a part of France has finally been fulfilled.
Tropical fruits are typical for a market on Mayotte
For a while, there was confusion about whether Mayotte would actually become France's 101st administrative department.
Councillors on the island had held a vote to approve the island's change in status, with French Overseas Territories Minister Marie-Luce Penchard scheduled to attend the celebrations on Thursday. When several members of the council from French President Nicolas Sarkozy's UMP party stayed away, it was ruled that the change of status could not take place until a meeting on Sunday.
Penchard, who was on her way, promptly put off her visit. However, she was soon on her way back to the island after the government in Paris ruled that enough councillors had in fact been present for the change to go ahead.
The development is a significant one for islanders, with many Mahorais seeing a better life for themselves by becoming a part of France.
"The Mahorais have struggled for more than 50 years to get this far," said Thoihir Yousouffa, the deputy director of Mayotte's General Council, the administrative body that runs the day-to-day affairs of the island.
"Just think, back in November 1958, the Mahorais held their first convention to demand their incorporation into France," Yousouffa explained. "In 1975, and again in 1979, the local population voted against independence. And on March 29, 2009, an overwhelming majority voted to become a department of France."
Of Mayotte's 160,000 inhabitants, 60,000 are illegal immigrants
Prosperity or poverty
Christophe Wargny, a historian at the Paris engineering school, the Ecole Nationale des Arts et Metiers, said that it was quite easy to understand the hopes of the local inhabitants.
"When you see the dilapidated environs of the inhabitants on the other three Comoro islands and how impoverished the people are, then there is no reason whatsoever not to be French," he said. "Would you ask the residents of Guadeloupe if they want independence and the same bad standard of living as Haiti?"
He adds that the transition of Mayotte to a departement means that the standard of living will be 50 times higher than the rest of the Comoro archipelago.
"Mayotte doesn't produce anything, but will get all the social benefits offered by France," he said.
Even before its official integration, Mayotte received funding from France, but now all the laws of France apply to the island. This means low-income housing, unemployment benefits, minimum wages, and so on - considerable expenditures for France. Wargny explained why France decided to go ahead with it.
"It was more by accident than anything else. The motherland wasn't really sure what to do with the island. I think France has no coherent policy for its overseas territories. It is fate and the Mahorais have no reason to regret it."
Problems, but also opportunities
The island of Mayotte lies some 10,000 miles southeast of the Eiffel Tower
Mayotte joining France could potentially turn the island into a magnet in the region. In the Comoros, Mayotte is viewed as a blessed island. It enjoys a much higher standard of living than the other islands. Every third inhabitant of Mayotte is either a foreigner or a refugee, and new immigrants arrive every day. Every year, the island expels some 24,000 illegal immigrants, one reason why France has sent hundreds of extra police to Mayotte.
Thoihir Yousouffa, the General Council deputy director, is concerned that Mayotte could turn into another Lampedusa, the Mediterranean island overwhelmed by migrants from Africa.
"Just recently, because of its proximity to North Africa, we have seen what problems Italy is confronted with. The situation on Mayotte is similar."
The issue is not only a problem for Mayotte and France, but also for the European Union in the foreseeable future. On January 1, 2014, Mayotte officially becomes a so-called European external region, like some French, Dutch and British territories in the Caribbean. That means that Mayotte is then a part of the European Union.
However, the geographical location of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean could also be advantageous for the European Union. Yousouffa said he already has plans to make Mayotte an important European outpost in the struggle against piracy off Africa's east coast.

SoundCloud recently announced it struck a long-awaited licensing deal with Universal Music, whose hit roster includes Kanye West, Adele and Taylor Swift. This latest deal provides SoundCloud with 50 percent coverage among the “Big Four” — Warner Brothers also has a deal with SoundCloud; Sony BMG and Sony/ATV are still holding out. The Universal deal, in addition to SoundCloud's latest round of funding, is a strong indicator that the Berlin-based music-content platform is a serious competitive threat to Spotify.
The YouTube of audio
While SoundCloud usually gets much less media buzz than Spotify, you wouldn't know it based on their numbers. First, while both SoundCloud and Spotify have large user bases, Spotify has only 75 million active users compared to SoundCloud's more than 175 million monthly listeners.
Why does SoundCloud have twice as many registered users? Spotify is more of a paid service for streaming music. The total number of users matters less to Spotify than how many of them are willing to pay. In contrast, SoundCloud is less focused on monetization (for now) and can afford to provide free content in the name of growth.
Second, SoundCloud has much better unit economics than Spotify. Why? SoundCloud's producers, the users uploading content, are there to build a following and are not as focused on monetization. The agreement with Universal simply wards off any potential lawsuits over copyright infringement. In contrast, Spotify pays out 80 percent of its revenue to content license holders.
As this stat suggests, the Spotify and SoundCloud business models are radically different.
SoundCloud has a platform business model where its content is created by its network of users, not acquired through licensing deals. For SoundCloud, the more audio producers that join the network, the more listeners will want to join. This increase in users, in turn, incentivizes more creatives to post their music or podcasts on SoundCloud, and the network effects continue to build from there. Once you find an artist you like on SoundCloud, you can … get lost in a rabbit hole of music awesomeness.
In contrast, Spotify is primarily a reseller of music inventory owned by record labels and publishers. It's simply a distributor for the latest releases, sort of like a Walmart for music streaming. Most of the songs on Spotify you could find on Apple Music, Pandora or another streaming service. As a result, Spotify lacks the network effects that SoundCloud enjoys.
Consider the difference between YouTube and Netflix. The distinction is the same here, but with music rather than video content. Given Netflix's relative success, you might think this is a favorable comparison for Spotify, but it isn't. YouTube is valued at $85 billion, or two times the value of Netflix. And you only need to understand one number to know why: Netflix will spend more on content in 2016 than any of CBS, Viacom, Time Warner or Fox. Like Spotify, the vast majority of what Netflix earns goes to license owners.
Could SoundCloud be the YouTube of music and Spotify its Netflix?
If you dig deeper, this analogy makes a lot of sense. Just like Netflix, creatives don't build their own following on Spotify. Instead, they get famous on SoundCloud, just as the best users do on YouTube. Fetty Wap started as a SoundCloud sensation before dominating the billboard charts. DJ titans Diplo and Skrillex each built their presence and notoriety by remixing already famous songs on SoundCloud and using their following as a jumping off point to produce original music. This also helps explain why SoundCloud has a much better relationship with its creatives than Spotify seems to.
Additionally, finding new songs and podcasts is an important part of the listening experience. But on Spotify, most of the music is content you can find elsewhere. The majority of Spotify's content comes from major record labels and is freely available on other streaming services, like Apple Music or Pandora. But if you want to find the latest hot tracks outside of the mainstream, you'll only find them on SoundCloud.
SoundCloud is increasingly becoming a place where users can discover unique content, such as new music and new artists. Users can follow each other, which allows you to find music based on another user's musical taste and preferences. The platform provides a simple like-and-repost feature, which exposes troves and troves of activity that enables discovery by other users. Once you find an artist you like on SoundCloud, you can then see which songs that artist likes and get lost in a rabbit hole of music awesomeness.
This kind of musical serendipity is very specific to SoundCloud because of the platform's unique content. This unique content gives SoundCloud network effects that improve everyday as more and more new artists (who aren't ready for Spotify) and content producers upload their content. While the inventory on Spotify is finite and expensive, SoundCloud has the potential for YouTube-like hyper growth.

Lo scorso giugno le immagini del violento sgombero dei migranti bloccati a Ventimiglia avevano fatto il giro del mondo. A tre mesi di distanza, mentre il confine francese è ancora sostanzialmente sbarrato, proprio stamattina è andato in scena un altro sgombero—quello del "presidio permanente No Borders – Ventimiglia."
Sorto all'indomani della protesta sulla scogliera, il presidio autogestito da migranti e attivisti italiani (in tutto, si parla di più di un centinaio di persone) è descritto nel sito ufficiale come "un laboratorio permanente di convivenza e di resistenza alle politiche repressive, che si manifestano in varie forme sui territori di confine." Oltre all'accoglienza, tra le varie attività previste dal presidio—che fisicamente si trovava a Ponte San Ludovico, tra le arcate ferroviarie dei Balzi Rossi—c'erano anche corsi di lingua e il sostegno medico e legale.
Le operazioni di sgombero sono iniziate all'alba, quando davanti all'accampamento si sono presentati una dozzina di blindati carichi di agenti in assetto antisommossa e alcuni pullman per portare via i migranti. Ma già da ieri sera c'era il sentore che la polizia sarebbe intervenuta.
"Siamo stati avvisati di un movimento di blindati nei dintorni di Imperia," mi racconta Cristina, un'attivista del presidio che ho raggiunto al telefono. "Abbiamo iniziato a organizzarci intorno alla mezzanotte, facendo una riunione collettiva con i migranti per decidere cosa fare. Loro hanno comunque deciso di restare e rivendicare i loro diritti, come hanno fatto fin dall'inizio."
Migranti e attivisti hanno dunque spostato tende, oggetti, cibo e medicine sugli scogli, "che è un luogo sia simbolico, perché è qui che è partita la loro protesta, sia perché è difficile che la polizia scenda a caricare." In mattinata, poi, sono comparsi dei container per raccogliere il materiale e anche una ruspa per "distruggere quello che avevamo costruito."
Una volta rifugiatisi sugli scogli, migranti e attivisti sono stati circondati dalla polizia. A quel punto, prosegue l'attivista del presidio, molti ragazzi hanno minacciato di buttarsi in mare "se la polizia si fosse messa a fare un atto di forza, o comunque se avesse costretto i migranti a lasciare le impronte digitali o essere identificati." Non si è verificato alcun tipo di scontro, visto che "non abbiamo risposto in nessun modo se non cantando e battendo le mani."
Sempre in mattinata, sul luogo dello sgombero è arrivato anche il vescovo di Ventimiglia, monsignor Antonio Suetta, per aiutare migranti e attivisti nella trattativa con le forze dell'ordine. Solo poco tempo fa il vescovo aveva donato duemila euro al presidio in segno di solidarietà, attirandosi le critiche di alcuni politici locali.
Ora come ora, le strade sono completamente bloccate e la situazione è ancora in evoluzione. Le richieste del presidio "No Borders" sono sostanzialmente due. La prima, mi spiega l'attivista, è che la polizia si allontani: "ci pressano sempre di più e abbiamo paura che i ragazzi si facciano male;" la seconda è che "nessuno di loro venga identificato, schedato e costretto ad andare in un centro, o che ci siano conseguenze peggiori. Sono tutte persone che non vogliono stare in Italia, e sono disposti veramente a buttarsi in mare e rischiare di morire pur di non essere identificati. Hanno familiari che li aspettano in Europa e vogliono andarsene."
Al termine delle operazioni di polizia, stando a quanto riportato dai giornali, una persona è stata arrestata e alcuni attivisti sono stati accompagnati in commissariato "ma non risultano in stato di fermo." Secondo l'attivista, un migrante di 17 anni "è stato portato via semplicemente perché si è avvicinato troppo alla linea di polizia." La procura di Imperia, inoltre, avrebbe aperto un fascicolo per i reati di occupazione abusiva e di furto di acqua ed energia elettrica.
Il sindaco di Ventimiglia, Enrico Ioculano del Partito Democratico, ha dichiarato che lo sgombero era "necessario," perché il presidio sulla scogliera "con il passare del tempo ha creato disagi e problemi a tutta la comunità di Ventimiglia." L'ostilità di Ioculano è stata palese sin dai primi momenti, e a luglio il sindaco aveva emanato un'ordinanza che vietava ai "non autorizzati" di portare cibo ai migranti per il rischio di "tossinfezioni alimentari"—una decisione che il presidio aveva definito una "provocazione."

Il sindaco non è stato il solo a scagliarsi contro il presidio "No Borders." Ad agosto la vicepresidente leghista della giunta regionale, Sonia Viale, aveva chiesto esplicitamente lo sgombero "di un vero proprio campo di addestramento che i figli di papà dei centri sociali hanno allestito da ormai un paio di mesi."
Cionostante, gli attivisti del presidio non riescono a spiegarsi fino in fondo perché lo sgombero sia stato portato avanti con queste modalità. "Noi abbiamo fatto comunque un'azione di cuscinetto con lo Stato," spiega Cristina. "Abbiamo raggiunto centinaia di migranti che non possono materialmente stare al centro della Croce Rossa in stazione, quindi li abbiamo letteralmente levati dalla strada."
Tra l'altro, proprio stasera era previsto un incontro in città con il vescovo e la Caritas, e "da un punto di vista umano non capiamo questo accanimento, soprattutto in un momento in cui erano avviati validi contatti con la Chiesa e la cittadinanza. In più, ci stavamo organizzando per diventare un comitato, quindi anche con una figura giuridica di riferimento. Ma ci hanno tagliato le gambe."
Forse, prosegue l'attivista, il vero motivo di questo sgombero andrebbe ricercato nel fatto che "diamo fastidio," perché "la nostra presenza—oltre a essere una proposta alternativa all'accoglienza—si accompagna al monitoraggio degli abusi e delle violazioni dei diritti di queste persone." L'impressione, quindi, è che si sia aspettato "il momento in cui l'opinione pubblica si stava di nuovo interessando a noi, nel bene e nel male."
Nelle ultime settimane, infatti, la pressione sul presidio si era intensificata non poco sia da un punto di vista mediatico—basti pensare alla vicenda, al contempo delicata e poco chiara, della denuncia per stupro nel campo—che da quello dell'ordine pubblico. La sera del 24 settembre, ad esempio, migranti e attivisti avevano bloccato per mezz'ora il confine a Ponte San Luigi prima di essere allontanati fisicamente dalla polizia italiana.
Il 20 settembre, inoltre, era uscita la notizia che diversi attivisti e persone che portavano solidarietà ai migranti—tra cui un contadino che aveva allestito una specie di pannello solare per ricaricare i telefonini—sono stati allontati dalla Questura con una serie di fogli di via.
Per un attivista del presidio, provvedimenti del genere puntavano a "decimare il nostro movimento, sperando di fermarci." Secondo l'articolo di Repubblica, inoltre, le misure amministrative sarebbero state un tentativo di "allentare le maglie della protesta evitando lo sgombero del campo, che farebbe esplodere la polveriera di confine."
Ma alla fine—come è già successo in altri casi più o meno analoghi—i blindati hanno prevalso su ogni tentativo di mediazione e incontro.

Small driving report of the 2015 Sella 2.0 Tour (1Addicts):
First a biiiiiig thanx to Dackelone, Artemis and all the others for planning and having so much fun (you know who I mean 😉 )
I was a few weeks ago on the road in the Sella area (South Tyrol) with 18 other BMW-crazies. Among others were: a M3, 1 Series M several, several 335i, 135i and M235i, another M135i …
My M135i is a non modified one with the 8-speed automatic transmission.
Participants 1
Participants 2
Participants 3
The tour was scheduled on 8 Passes: Passo Sella | Passo Val Gardena – Gardena | Passo delle Erbe – Würzjoch | Passo di Giove – Jaufenpass | Passo delle Palade – Gampenjoch | Passo Mendola – Mendola | Passo Carezza – Carezza | Passo Pordoi – Pordoijoch
The M3 is obviously not a fair comparison because he plays with his performance and with the ceramic brakes in an entirely different category. The 1 Series M cars (as most of them were chipped neatly and with aftermarket sports braking systems) clearly had a paper advance. Moreover, I was not at the limit on the road (the female passenger thanked me;)) and also wanted to relax and enjoy.

I was surprised that the small M135i better pulled compared to the 135i and 335i (I felt like…). In the uphill rides I had a constant feeling that I could run into the car in front. In my opinion, this is due to the spreading of the short 8-speed automatic transmission in the lower gears, which allows in manual mode at any time and quickly to retrieve the needed punch. The M235i seemed absolutely on par.
With the M3 and 1 Series M's things looks different. In this case probably the other drivers a felt a small superiority…
The downhill drives are the ultimate test for the brakes. Several models were equipped with performance or 3rd party brake systems, the M3 even with ceramic brakes. I had no problems with hot brakes in my driving style. On the tour the year before last I once had overheated brakes after a hot downhill drive. That was probably the first real stress for the factory new brake system these days. The second M135i this year had similar problems …
Perforated brake discs and performance ceramic brakes are in another world… Interesting (and shocking) aside: The ceramic brakes of M3 overheated at least once, which was clearly visible through smoke after stopping…
Conclusion: The M135i is my opinion (almost) the ultimitative fun machine on the passports (for the buck)!!

The wonderful episodic adventure Life is Strange delighted us from start to finish last year, and now publisher Square Enix and developer Dontnod Entertainment have announced that the first episode will be free starting tomorrow. There's no end date for the promotion so presumably it'll be free from here on out.
"Although our team set out to create an award-winning narrative we still cannot believe the response we've had from players of Life is Strange" said Oskar Guilbert, CEO of Dontnod Entertainment. "We're really glad that Square Enix have decided to give the first episode away for free so more players can begin their journey and see why people have fallen in love with the game for themselves".
All platforms the game has seen release on PC/Mac, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One are included in the offer. So if you've been on the fence, you can now pick it up and give it a go at no cost.
If you want to read up on the game here's our review of the full game.
At this point, we've heard plenty about the miracles Christian Vazquez worked upon his return to the Red Sox. The starting rotation received a much-needed boost with Vazquez calling the shots. Now the hope is he can help transform a mediocre staff into one flirting with slightly above average.
Rick Porcello, however, is a Red Sox starter who deserves credit all his own so far this year. Through three starts, Porcello looks more like the middle-of-the-rotation arm the Sox acquired from Detroit than the club's biggest disaster behind Hanley Ramirez and Pablo Sandoval in 2015. Porcello has been far from spectacular, but he's been arguably the Red Sox's most reliable starter nearly a month into the season.
Some stats suggest Porcello is no better than he was last year. His FIP sits at 4.53, his groundball rate is an underwhelming 42.9 percent and he owns a whopping 2.33 HR/9. However, the Red Sox will take what he's given them thus far all season long. Porcello has posted two quality starts in three tries – the outlier was an outing in which he allowed four runs over six innings in a sock win – and his K/9 is an impressive 11.17. He's been as steady as they come, which is all the Red Sox could ask for after last season's roller coaster ride.
Porcello didn't look like an $82.5 million pitcher last season. In fact, he looked nothing like the player the Sox thought they were trading for. He went from a sinker-ball pitcher who induced groundball contact at roughly 50 percent rates to a pitcher who attacked the upper half of the strike zone with a four-seamer (which he threw a career-high 26.9 percent of the time last season, per Brooks Baseball) and curve en route to in ugly first half in which he posted a 5.90 ERA over 17 starts. It was bad. So bad that five-, six- or seven-run nights were becoming the norm. But Porcello's turnaround over the final two months of the season offered hope. He once again made his sinker his premier pitch and the result was a 3.53 ERA through his final 11 starts.
That's the pitcher Porcello looks more like thus far in 2016. According to Brooks Baseball, Porcello has thrown his sinker 58.86 percent of the time this season. That's far more than his four-seamer (11.39 percent) and curveball (8.23 percent) combined. On top of that, he's done a better job of keeping the ball in the lower half of the zone. The result has been a lower LD% (18.4 percent), BABIP (.227) and opponents TAv (.241).
Here's the funny thing. Despite the improvements to Porcello's pitch selection and location, his groundball rate would mark a career low and his strikeout rate a career high. Such drastic numbers, of course, are a result of it being three starts into the season. However, it's still eye-catching. Porcello is seemingly doing everything right given his abilities, yet the results have been far from what you'd expect.
Although Porcello has relied heavily on his sinker, he's getting high whiff rates on his secondary pitches, particularly his changeup and his cutter. Batters are whiffing at a 27.59 percent rate against his change and 17.95 percent against his cutter, according to Brooks Baseball. Those pitches become especially tough to hit after being fed sinkers at the knees for a majority of the at-bat. Porcello has used his cutter in particular to jam hitters inside to create swings and misses.
Take Porcello's debut in Toronto, for example. He jammed Kevin Pillar in the first inning with a well-placed 2-2 cutter on the hands to finish the at-bat with a strikeout, showing he can still put away hitters with his secondary pitches. Nine of the 12 whiffs Porcello got that night came from either his changeup or his cutter, according to PITCHf/x, and a majority of those swings and misses came low.
Porcello's second start of the season – his first with Vazquez on April 15 against Toronto – was similar to his first start in many ways. He struck out eight batters and forced two whiffs with his cutter, but he relied on his sinker even more, throwing it 62 times at a 67.7 percent strike rate. The results were what you'd expect. He induced grounders when he kept the ball down, and picked up strikeouts by attacking the corners.
His most recent start against the Rays was arguably his most unique, but he still had a solid night, allowing three runs and striking out nine over seven innings. He remained sinker-heavy, but he also had a 33.3 percent whiff rate on his changeup and threw his four-seamer, which he allowed just one hit against, a season-high 17 times. He generated more flyball outs and got strikeouts with pitches out of the zone.
Porcello's reversion back to his sinker and keeping the ball down has been key. He's laid off the four-seamer and curve, pitches that hurt him last season, and has instead looked to his changeup and cutter on the corners to put away hitters. It's a welcomed adjustment, especially when seeing how hitters performed against Porcello on pitches in the middle-to-upper half of the zone last year.
Three games is a small sample size. If this was enough to draw conclusions, David Price would be a bust and Steven Wright would be the ace. For all we know, Porcello could have the first of a string of 2015-esque clunkers in him Monday night. However, it's ok to feel hopeful about 2016 Porcello.
He's shown some of the same flaws, of course. He's given up homers at a 7.69 percent rate with his cutter, per Brooks Baseball, and he's still getting hammered on pitches up in the zone. But this season has been all about balance for Porcello. His sinker is certainly his go-to pitch, but he's mixing in the right secondary stuff in the right locations to get outs. And he's yet to let innings get away from him, which has allowed him to limit the damage and go deeper into games. That's the pitcher we were expecting to see last season. This is the pitcher the Red Sox are hoping to see over the next four seasons.

For Thor's third solo outing, Marvel wanted to lighten things up – and not just a smidge.
Out with the stoic seriousness, in with a bucket of colour and a script that shows moviegoers how funny the God of Thunder can be.
So the studio turned to New Zealand director Taika Waititi, who made a name for himself with What We Do in the Shadows – the vampire mockumentary horror comedy that won a People's Choice Award at TIFF in 2014 – and 2016's coming-of-age festival fave, Hunt for the Wilderpeople.
“[Marvel] wined and dined me and treated me really romantically in the opening stages of our relationship,” Waititi jokes during an early-morning interview in a Toronto hotel.
The studio, which has made unconventional choices with its big screen takes on Guardians of the Galaxy (James Gunn), Ant-Man (Peyton Reed) and the new Spider-Man (Jon Watts), as well as its sequels to Captain America and the Avengers (Joe and Anthony Russo), wanted Thor: Ragnarok to feel nothing like its predecessors – 2011's Thor and 2013's Thor: The Dark World.
Whatever expectations we satisfy with this one, we'd need to go in a completely new direction and do something unpredictable. Who knows, maybe that means it would be a black and white silent film. Thor 4, black and white. Taika Waititi
“Right from the beginning I could tell they were supportive of the idea of my style and my sensibility coming into this film,” Waititi says. “They wanted to take Thor in a new direction, not just the character, but the franchise itself. Chris [Hemsworth] wanted to do something new with the character. And for me, coming in as the third director, I wanted to have some sort of ownership over it and feel like it could be my unique thing. To do that, we had to change the character and almost reboot the franchise without the hassle of recasting and rebranding everything.”
Ragnarok finds Earth's mightiest hero teaming up with his slithery brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), his Avengers mate Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), a hard-drinking ass kicker named Valkyrie (Creed's Tessa Thompson) and a chilled out CGI rock creature dubbed Korg (voiced by Waititi) to battle his evil sis Hela, played by Cate Blanchett.
With the movie now in theatres, Waititi spoke with Postmedia Network about giving one of Marvel's oldest heroes a fresh coat of paint, revealed why he wishes he put a real Easter Egg in Ragnarok and told us the reason a movie should be two hours (or less).
You come from an indie-film background. Why did you pick Thor to make your grand entrance into the Marvel Cinematic Universe?
To be honest, coming into it, Thor wasn't the obvious choice for me as a superhero film. I never read Thor when I was growing up. I wouldn't say he was one of my favourite characters. But… Chris is one of my favourite actors and I knew for this thing to become something else and have the energy I thought it needed, we had to tap into some of his best qualities, which are: he's funny, he's charming and he's the kind of person you want to follow on an adventure. That's what I concentrated on. Let's make this character as close to Chris as possible because it's his qualities that will be what sells this.
The movie has a great beginning, there's lots of fun stuff between Thor and Hulk on planet Sakaar with Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster, there's an awesome battle at the end. What was your favourite scene to film?
I think my favourite stuff has to be the scenes between Chris and Mark. We ad-libbed a lot of the film and you can really tell that they enjoyed that. You can see them smiling and cracking up. There's a scene where Thor is talking to Hulk on a bed about who's more like fire and Chris starts laughing, and he really was. Those human moments help get the audience onside. If you look at the poster it's outrageous. You look at that and think, ‘How am I going to connect with all of these elements?'
What convinced you that Cate could be such a badass villain?
Me looking at Hela, she has this kind of swagger where you think, ‘She's seen it all. She's got nothing left to prove.' That's very much like Cate. She's seen it all, she's won all the awards. She doesn't have to prove herself anymore. She can just saunter into the film and do her thing. And the audience is left believing she can take over Asgard and she can wipe out an army.
Your character Korg is like the Rocket Racoon of this movie. Any chance he shows up in Avengers: Infinity War?
I don't know. Potentially… they're still shooting.
Why did you want to play him?
I'm in all of my films and I like carrying that tradition on. I'm better suited to these smaller characters who, for a lack of a better way of putting it, are kind of pointless.
There was a rumour going around that this was going to be a 90-minute movie. What did you add in to make it over two hours?
I was toying with the idea of making it 95 minutes because I like movies that are short and leave you wanting more, but there are so many things going on in this movie it had to be two hours. Look, audiences have a short attention span and their bladders have an even shorter attention span. You have to remember in the third act, people want to go to the bathroom. There are only so many things you can put in that final battle before people are looking at their watches and thinking, ‘Please wrap it up.'
You mention wanting more. Audiences are going to want more Thor after this. Will you be back for Thor 4?
Whatever expectations we satisfy with this one, we'd need to go in a completely new direction and do something unpredictable. Who knows, maybe that means it would be a black and white silent film. Thor 4, black and white.
I heard you might be interested in making a funny Black Widow movie with Scarlett Johansson.
Don't believe anything I say. I think I said, ‘I'd love to see that.' I'm not sure I'd be suited to it. I kind of feel like it should be a female director. But that's a character that I've always loved.
Just where is Ragnarok in Marvel's movie timeline?
I guess in the timeline – actually I'm not an expert – I have a feeling this has happened just after Civil War. This is two years after the end of Ultron. Thor has been on the road that whole time looking for the [Infinity] Stones and now it's catching up with him. Banner has been in Hulk form for two years now that's why we've got this great personality for Hulk.
How many Easter Eggs should Marvel fans keep their eyes peeled for in Ragnarok?
I have no idea [laughs]. There's a Beta Ray Bill Easter Egg on the side of a building [in the
Grandmaster's tower] to suggest he was one of the great gladiators at one time. But Easter Eggs? I don't know. I wish I had put a real Easter Egg in there somewhere.

1. All things being equal, Ohio State's first botched two-point conversion attempt in Saturday's win over Penn State doesn't mean much. Nobody will remember it when thinking back on this game. And they'll do that for years to come.
But what was supposed to happen on that play -- a reverse to Johnnie Dixon -- is interesting.
“He should've thrown it,” offensive coordinator Kevin Wilson said. “There was a blitz. He was fighting. There's an option for a reverse and a pass. Under stress he wasn't able to throw the ball. Marcus (Baugh) was open in the corner of the end zone. Couldn't get it launched.”
He wasn't talking about J.T. Barrett.
He was talking about Dixon.
On a crucial play that would've put the Buckeyes within a field goal inside of five minutes to play, they wanted Dixon to throw a pass to Baugh off the reverse. And it would've worked if Dixon didn't hold onto the ball.
Maybe Dixon thought he had the edge, and after a good Isaiah Prince block to seal the outside, it looked for a moment like he did. But Penn State rallied, brought Dixon down before the goal line -- and there was Baugh standing alone in the end zone with a sure two points gone off the board.

The first two beginner courses are offered in a 31 day format (20+ hours of content) that are designed to provide a daily lesson schedule that is manageable and structured, yet allows for flexibility while trying to fit learning into your busy routine.
Each 31 course consists of:
20 Daily Lessons (60 minutes/day)
3 Weekend App Challenges (2-hour projects)
5 day Final App Competition (1 weekend + 3 days)
The courses are taught utilizing tactics that will ensure you understand the material and that you are ready to move on to the next topic:
Video lectures to teach concepts
Code exercises to encourage practice
Q&A videos to answer you and your classmates' most frequently asked questions
App challenges to cement learning
Do you want to build an app, but think you're too busy?
Each course features content that is split into daily lessons, which are flexible chunks of course materials that won't overwhelm you. There will be actionable tips and tricks that you can leverage in your own apps.
The daily format allows you to fit learning iPhone app programming around your schedule, life commitments, and to explore at your own pace. You can follow the daily material two or three days a week and you will finish each 31 Day course within three months. Or you can accelerate your learning using daily lessons five days a week and finish within 31 days.
When are these courses offered?
These courses will be a hybrid of online videos and personal feedback. All videos will be recorded and hosted online for your convenience (streaming with subtitles and DRM free downloads).
Your daily questions and feedback will be used to create bonus materials and Q&A videos.

The Inspiration Behind These Courses and the Kickstarter
Last year I started my first Kickstarter because I wasn't happy with how people were being taught how to make apps and games. Online and college courses were out of date or non-existent.
Fast forward a year, and I'm still not satisfied. I felt like the communication loop was not complete and that creative people weren't learning how to actually bring their apps full circle and put them on the App Store.
There's a lot to learn beyond the basics.
That's why in this Kickstarter, I've adjusted my courses to include personal feedback and Q&A videos to help students overcome the hurdles that often can be associated with app development. I'll be teaching you how to publish your app after you finish design it. I'm so excited to help you understand app and game development, while utilizing the latest technology from Apple.

For years the country has agonized over an endless stream of horrifying stories about how the VA system treats veterans in desperate need of care.
We've seen infinite wait times result in thousands of veteran deaths, bodies left in morgues for months, roaches crawling across hospital room floors and suicide hotlines going unanswered. Just last week we learned a VA dentist in Wisconsin allegedly infected nearly 600 veterans with HIV and other deadly diseases after repeatedly ignoring protocol and using dirty utensils. Instead of being fired, the dentist was moved into an administrative position.
Current federal law protects federal employees like the dentist. In order for reform at the VA to take place these policies, which reward bad employees rather than punishing them, must and can change.
Back in September the House passed the VA Accountability First and Appeals Modernization Act of 2016, which allows for bad VA employees to be fired quickly. The legislation was passed with a veto-proof, bipartisan majority 310-116. Here's what it would do:
-Shorten the firing/demotion/appeals process for rank-and-file VA employees from more than a year on average to no more than 77 days
-Remove entirely the Merit Systems Protection Board from the firing/demotion/appeals process for VA senior executives
-Provide VA whistleblowers with a means to solve problems at the lowest level possible, while offering them protection from reprisals and mandating strict accountability for those who reprise against them
-Give the VA secretary the authority to recoup bonuses and relocation expenses from misbehaving employees
-Give the VA secretary the authority to reduce the pensions of senior executives convicted of felonies that influenced their job performance
-Reform the department's broken disability benefits appeals process
“The Department of Veterans Affairs will never be truly worthy of the veterans it serves until it addresses its pervasive lack of accountability among employees at all levels. The VA Accountability First and Appeals Modernization Act gets rid of the loopholes that have been unfairly forcing veterans and the many good VA workers to deal with deadwood employees for years," House Committee on Veterans Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller said when the bill was passed. "I'm proud to stand with my colleagues in the House in passing this important legislation. Additionally, I would like to thank Sen. Marco Rubio for leading the fight in the Senate to fix VA's accountability problems and sponsoring the Senate companion bill to H.R. 5620, which the Senate should take up and pass in short order.”
It's now up to the Senate to take a vote and get the legislation to the president's desk.
Variety is now reporting that Lego has announced a broad license for DC Comics. What's more, it appears that they're giving away some promotional Batman and Green Lantern figures at San Diego Comic Con this weekend.
Warner Bros. has expanded its relationship with Lego, granting the toymaker access to DC Entertainment's complete library of comicbook characters and stories to launch DC Universe “Super Heroes” as figures and playsets.
The multi-year licensing deal, made through Warner Bros. Consumer Products, will start rolling out the new line in January, starting with 13 characters, including Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and villains the Joker, Bane, Harley Quinn and Lex Luthor.
The first toys will be shown off at the Lego booth at Comic-Con Intl. in San Diego, where 3,000 exclusive Batman and Green Lantern minifigures will be distributed to launch a promo that runs August-December, enabling fans to create and submit videos, photos or illustrations of the characters to win trips to Legoland and Warner Bros. Studios.
WB and Lego had already been producing toys and videogames around the Batman franchise, and will launch a new set of playthings around next summer's “The Dark Knight Rises” through the Lego Batman collection. The “Lego Batman: The Videogame,” published by WB Bros. Interactive Entertainment, has sold more than 12 million units since 2008.”This partnership gives builders a chance to recreate the characters, vehicles and worlds of some of the most iconic superheroes, so they can relive the action and even customize it, a proven and winning formula in Lego construction,” said Jill Wilfert, VP, licensing and entertainment for the Lego Group.
There's no real new problems for tabletop RPGs. A lot of the issues people have are the same problems you can read about in old issues of Dungeon Magazine from the early 80s, or even older newsletters. These problems boil down to trivial problems (things that are a matter of taste and easily adjusted, like small house rules), problems that take a lot of time (“retool this complicated set of rules to support a completely different setting”) and non-solveable problems.
The last category is where a lot of gamers waste an incredible amount of time and once you recognize them, you stop wasting energy trying to fix what is unfixable.
Honest Communication
If you sit down to play poker with your friends, you understand there is an expectation of how you will communicate within the game – you are totally expected to lie about your hands and bluff and all of that. That's part of that game, right? However, no one would consider it “fair play” to set up a fake call from the hospital telling a fellow player their mom is dying, just so you could look at their hand.
A game can include deception within the bounds of the game, however, people are expected to be honest outside those boundaries.
Here are two things, which you need honesty from for a game to work:
– What game are we agreeing to play? – What do I want from this game?
If there is dishonesty here, the game will simply dysfunction. When people can't communicate with you honestly as one person to another, what can you build on top of it? The trust around most games is a super low bar to meet. (Yes, there are super emotional games where trust matters. Most Imaginary Elf games are not it).
Yes, everyone can show up, yes all the players except one player might be playing the same game, but it's rather like playing a boardgame with a toddler who picks up random pieces or throws their crayons on the board when their turn comes up – no one looks at that and imagines the child is playing the game with you, or that their actions aren't sometimes disruptive to the actual game being played. Unlike a toddler, however, you're dealing with someone cognizant enough who should be able to make a choice to play or not play and communicate it.
Emotional Dishonesty and Intentionality
Now, in nearly every case like this with tabletop games, it's not like someone showed up and said, “I'm totally going to lie about these things, let me get my story straight”. Emotional dishonesty is often a reaction that people don't realize they're doing, a pattern. HOWEVER, when you present the differences between what they say they want to do and what they're doing, there's basically only 3 options:
“Oh shit, you're right. This isn't what I wanted to have happened at all. Let me figure out how to change what I'm doing.”
This is the path where you can FIND honesty and create functional communication.
“Well. damn, you're right. I guess I actually want this OTHER thing and maybe this game isn't the right one for me.”
Hey emotional honesty and an end to wasting time on things that aren't going to change.
“No, that's not what I did at all!!! Let's just have fun! Why can't we just play?”
I've pointed out before that when everyone is interested in the same type of play, it's really easy to make happen. When someone isn't interested in actually playing that way, everything “somehow” becomes a problem. And that a lot of this kind of “don't talk about it” attitude is about the idea of either forcing each other into “One True Way” to play or else trying to avoid the elephant in the room that the group doesn't actually want to play the same game.
Problems that cannot be honestly described, problems that you don't have cooperation in addressing? Those can't be solved. This is not a matter of time. You can't force any individual to “want” something they don't want (well, you can abuse and brainwash people, however, that's certainly not about fun or enjoyment…)
Pretty much after the point where the group has talked to a player or set of players about what the expectations of play are supposed to be, and they continue to be violated? Then that's someone who isn't interested in communicating – they're not listening.
People don't want to hear it
You ever have friends in a bad relationship, and you point out obvious A to B connections about behaviors and what's going on and the one option that never comes up is “just leave” or when you bring it up, they have a million and one reasons including “..but I love them!”? Yeah, that's the same pattern when it comes to dishonest communication in a game group. You can read forums and see this question pop up again and again, “What do I do about X player?” and pretty much it boils down to: “Talk to them, and either they change or they leave.”
The answer they really want is “How do I change their mind? How do I make them want what I want? How do I change who they are?”
There's no answer to that. It's an unsolveable problem.
Some of it is that people don't want to admit the difference in goals and that they actually just like different things. Some of it is that the person in question is abusive or a jerk, and most importantly – never was your friend to begin with. Self examination can reveal a lot and not all of it is pretty. “Are THESE people and THIS game giving me what I want?” There's a question to consider. Like a relationship, “Is this even working?” is a question people don't bring up for themselveses enough. Being honest with yourself often is half the hurdle here.
I deal with enough unreasonable people in life in general – why spend my time gaming with them as well?

Reports on Monday said Erasmus is leaving Munster to head back to SA.
Reports on Monday said Erasmus is leaving Munster to head back to SA.
THE IRELAND MANAGEMENT have not heard any confirmation that Rassie Erasmus may be departing Munster.
Scrum coach Greg Feek said they were unaware of any developments and that it had no impact on the Munster players in Tokyo preparing for Saturday's concluding test with Japan.
“I think these guys are probably used to that rumour by now. I don't know why it keeps coming up. Obviously, the South Africans are trying to get him back, so there is always going to be that rumour.
“At the end of the day we haven't heard any confirmation and I haven't heard anything from the guys as such.”
“I heard it this morning and a few of us just went, ‘Jeez, again?' I feel sorry for Rassie is some ways,” he said.
But whatever about their existing coach, several Munster players linked up again with Rob Penney yesterday in Tokyo.
Ireland are using Penney's NTT club as a training base this week and the former Munster coach is assisting them.
“I think the Munster boys firstly were happy to see him. They all went over and were chatting to him,” Feek added.
“I've known Rob for a long time back at Canterbury and obviously when he was Munster he was a great man to have a chat to and Joe knows him. He's got a great way about him. He loves rugby.
“He always innovative and got new ideas and hopefully we get to catch up with him properly over a coffee in the next few days while we're here.”

But Feek said they weren't expecting to get much of an inside track from Penney about what Japan might produce next Saturday.
“He's pretty loyal. He probably won't give us too much inside info on it and such, but he'll definitely point us in the right direction in terms of lifestyle parts.”
Meanwhile, three players who sat out training yesterday morning are expected to be available for selection later in the week.
Prop Finlay Bealham, scrum-half Luke McGrath and flanker Dan Leavy all suffered either facial or eye injuries.
If McGrath does not recover then it will pave the way for John Cooney — the only uncapped player in the touring party — to make his bow.
Feek said there was no danger of complacency despite the 50-22 win on Saturday and feels there is plenty of room for improvement.
“Well, we missed a lot of tackles at the weekend, that's one thing we want to focus on because the Japanese attack is really good. It is something we need to get right. Although the scoreline was high, some of the tries were fortuitous and I think we are going to have to work a lot harder this week to those tries this week.
“It's going to be physical and it was a step up from the US, I think, in some exchanges and the way they play the game and if you look at the way the Highlanders played in the past under Jamie Joseph, they like to pressurise teams by field position, by contact and by good defence. So, they keep a good spread of the field.”

The two presidential candidates didn't just disagree on solutions to the deadliest shooting in American history, they disagreed on what the problem was.
In rival speeches Monday about the mass shooting at an Orlando gay bar, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump largely talked past each other, showing vastly different understandings of the underlying causes.
For the presumptive Democratic nominee, the Orlando shooting was a time to come together in the kind of unity shown after Sept. 11, another argument in favor of gun control and support for the LGBT community. To the extent that Islam was a factor, she said it involved a radicalized misreading of a religion in which most oppose terrorism.
“Millions of peace-loving Muslims live, work and raise their families across America,” Clinton said in an industrial park on Cleveland's East Side. “They are the most likely to recognize the insidious effects on radicalization before it's too late. They are in the best position to help us block it. We should be intensifying contacts in those communities, not scapegoating or isolating them.”

For the presumptive Republican nominee, the Orlando shooting was a time for Americans to draw bright lines on immigration, another argument in favor of a blanket ban on Muslim immigration (though the suspected shooter was born in America) and a reason to question “political correctness.”
“Can you imagine what they will do in large groups?” Trump asked his audience at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire.
Clinton had planned Monday as the kickoff to her general election, scheduling a rally in Cleveland that was morphed into a policy speech with unusual overtones. Campaign signs were ditched for American flags, and the audience was clearly on edge the day after largest mass shooting in U.S. history left the country in shock and sorrow.
“Today is not a day for politics,” Clinton said as she began her remarks.
Trump had zero interest in that tactic. He ripped into his remarks with typical bravado and said the deaths were the fault of the political establishment.
“They have put political correctness, above common sense, above your safety,” Trump said. “ I refuse to be politically correct.” He said Clinton was beholden to “politically correct special interests” and cast himself as an above-the-mix outsider.
The lopsided approach is a cue for how the balance of this campaign will play out. Clinton is a thoughtful, cautious leader; Trump shoots from the hip and trusts his gut. The imbalance, especially at this moment when the country is rightfully anxious about terrorism, is an untested proposition in national elections. When four Americans died in a 2012 attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney were offering symmetrical rhetoric. Eight years before that, when Osama bin Laden released a video just before President George W. Bush's re-election campaign, he and Democratic rival John Kerry were mostly working off the same script.
Not this year.
Clinton is typically careful, with an ear to how the world will hear her words. She broadly vowed to dismantle terrorism, but noted that “we have to see what the investigation uncovers.” She added of Islamic extremism: “We cannot contain this threat. We must defeat it.”
Trump, by contrast, already knew what he knew. Though the shooter was born in New York, immigration, as Trump saw it, was the core of the problem, just as he sees it on the country's reduced manufacturing base and stagnant wages. “We can't keep bringing people who add to the problem,” Trump said. “Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?”
At the same time, Trump took a moment to note that the killer targeted the nightclub because he wanted to kill gays and lesbians, “an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.” He argued that gays and lesbians should support him because he wants to stop terrorism.
Still, Trump's words on Muslims and immigration earned him criticism. “The bigotry, the hate that is spewed by Donald Trump, the words that incite and encourage violence,” said Representative Marcia Fudge, an Ohio Democrat who backs Clinton. “Now, more than ever, the United States needs a steady hand.”
The dueling visions for the 2016 battlefield offered a preview of the two often disconnected fights happening in real time. The two sides couldn't even decide on the terms of the fight: religion, extremism, immigration, guns. The only term they agreed on was terrorism, and even there they took strikingly different approaches.
Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Clinton and President Obama for not using phrases like “radical Islamic terror” bragged that he had swayed her, as Clinton had debated the most diplomatic phrasing during morning interviews. “Whether you call it radical jihadism or radical Islamism, I'm happy to say either. I think they mean the same thing,” Clinton said.
Meantime, Trump was hinting darkly that President Obama somehow has ulterior motives to not fight terrorism. “Look, we're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he's got something else in mind,” he told Fox News. “There's something going on. It's inconceivable. There's something going on.” And a Trump ally, Roger Stone, was elsewhere suggesting the vice chair of Clinton's campaign was a “terrorist agent” and a “Saudi spy.”
The differing reality is shaping a campaign that could test Americans' patience for competing narratives. Clinton has made her bet that Americans' anxiety will lead them to her deep experience. Trump is wagering that their uneasiness will prod voters, frustrated with years of worry over terrorism, to his side. Voters at the moment might be torn as to which promises a greater feeling of safety, even if the reality of security is more elusive.

The Republicans badly damaged themselves with their contrived government shutdown and debt crisis, but it remains for the Democrats to drive home their advantage. Will they?
Based on the cost to the Republican brand and the pressure from corporate elites not to harm the economy, the days of shutdowns and games with the debt are probably over for the foreseeable future. If the Tea Party faction tries to repeat these maneuvers, House Speaker John Boehner would likely permit a free vote again, and enough Republicans would vote with Democrats to keep the government open.
The Republicans seem hopelessly split between a Tea Party faction that relishes governing crises and a more mannered corporate faction that kills government softly. But the GOP is still one party when it comes to destroying government as a constructive force in the economy and society.
Since Barack Obama took office, the two Republican factions have complemented each other in a successful “good cop, bad cop” effort to ratchet down public spending. Wall Street creates one sort of crisis; the Tea Party creates another; government takes the hit. Except for the short-lived stimulus of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009, this is the first prolonged slump of the postwar era in which government cut rather than expanded public spending.
President Obama's pivot to deficit reduction in late 2009 was in response to the pressures of the corporate elite, while his several capitulations in the budget cuts since 2010 have been driven by the Tea Party. In effect, the Tea Party and corporate Republicans have executed a pincer movement. Domestic discretionary spending relative to gross domestic product is now below that of the Eisenhower era.
With everything else having been cut, the pressure has shifted to the big social-insurance programs—so-called entitlements—that have thus far been protected. Once again, the corporate right and Tea Party right have called for a grand bargain targeting Social Security and Medicare.
A bargain connotes giving something and getting something. Republicans are disinclined to give anything in exchange for cuts in social insurance, least of all tax increases. Their opening gambit was an improbable offer to shrink Social Security and Medicare in exchange for increases in defense spending.
The Democratic caucuses in both the House and Senate are resolute defenders of Social Security. Polls show that more than 80 percent of Republicans and Democrats alike don't want Social Security reduced. With Republicans pressing for cuts, defense of Social Security is a clear, bright line that benefits Democrats.
Unless, that is, President Obama chooses to blur it. He has already proposed in his 2014 budget a change in the annual cost-of-living adjustment to Social Security (the chained Consumer Price Index). Although a grand bargain is unlikely, Republicans are pushing a mini-bargain of sequester relief in exchange for cuts in other domestic spending or in Social Security. The chained CPI would yield about $34 billion of deficit reduction per year. This disguised benefit cut would split the Democrats as badly as the government shutdown split the Republicans.
A better mini-bargain would be relief from the depressive impact of the sequester without any offsetting cuts. The Democrats have some leverage here, because the sequester mandates at least $23 billion of defense cuts to take effect in January, requiring cancellation of multiyear weapons contracts dear to key Republican legislators. In exchange for restored military spending, Democrats could demand, and get, $23 billion in social spending. That $46 billion would help stimulate a stagnant economy.
Looking forward to the 2014 midterm, pollsters discern a paradox. Support for the Republican Party is down sharply. In October, Gallup found that 28 percent of those polled approve of the Republicans, down from 38 percent in September and the lowest since Gallup began asking the question in 1992. Yet message testing also shows that large majorities of voters are still inclined to fault “partisan bickering”—blaming both parties—rather than Republican obstruction for the government's failure to make substantive progress in improving a feeble recovery.
So the shutdown debacle helps the Democrats but only marginally, unless they maximize their moment. Midterm elections are notorious for low turnout. Democrats have a prayer of taking back the House only if they energize their core voters. If President Obama goes into the midterm bragging about how much progress has been made, that won't resonate with Americans suffering from flat or declining incomes and job insecurity. The Democrats need to stand for restored, broadly shared prosperity, not tinkering, and brand Republicans as the party that would cut your benefits.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, of all people, has set a fine example. In the deal that opened the government, McConnell sneaked in the only earmark: $3 billion for a dam in Kentucky. If we ramped that up to the whole country based on Kentucky's share of the economy, the outlay would translate to about $200 billion. Call it the Mitch McConnell Memorial Infrastructure Program—a nice down payment on the public investment America needs.
A 30-year-old man was killed early Friday, as the first taste of winter hit the London region, when a pickup truck rolled over in a ditch following the overnight snowstorm.
Middlesex OPP said the collision occurred about 6 a.m. on Eight Mile Road between Hyde Park and Denfield roads, northwest of London.
The pickup truck, travelling west on Eight Mile, left the roadway and struck the south ditch, causing it to roll over.
Police said the male driver, Jason Derks of Middlesex Centre, died in the collision and no other vehicles were involved.
Investigators hadn't confirmed whether weather was a factor in the collision, said Middlesex OPP Con. Max Gomez.
The morning commute was a mess along highways 401 and 402 in the London, OPP Sgt. Dave Rektor said.
But other than the death in Middlesex, there were no other major collisions or injuries as the season's first snowfall — much worse in other parts of Southwestern Ontario — swept the region.
“Highway(s) 401 and 402 (are) littered with vehicles in the ditch – people driving way too fast,” Rektor said in his online traffic report.
By 8 a.m. the snow had cleared in the London area and all highways were open despite whiteouts in the Strathroy area.
Huron, Lambton and Middlesex counties were hit with rain followed by classic lake-effect streamers overnight as the temperature plunged and northwesterly winds picked up moisture from relatively warm Lake Huron.
In London, plows and salt trucks hit the main roads and transit routes starting the previous night at 7 p.m. Secondary streets were being monitored, but the first snowfall fell below the threshold for a full cleanup, said John Parsons, the city's transportation manager.
The snowfall was noticeably heavier in western neighbourhoods of the city, he noted.
The snow will linger at least a bit, with Environment Canada forecasting a high barely above freezing on Saturday.

There's a reason you're not able to find video evidence of Al Golden‘s postgame presser from Saturday night's deflating loss in Tallahassee. At least from the Miami Hurricanes.
As we can see in the snippet below courtesy of WPLG's Will Manso, the Miami Hurricanes head coach was dejected, as lifeless as we've ever seen him in his four-plus years as coach. Back-to-back losses in a do-or-die season and consecutive close losses to your rival will have that effect.
@HeatKush they normally have it on YouTube Canes channel, but not there. This is glimpse of what I meant. pic.twitter.com/5jEYT84z3W — Will Manso (@WillManso) October 11, 2015
The Canes did upload several players' postgame interviews to their YouTube channel but failed to upload Golden as of early Sunday evening.
And I highly doubt it was an oversight.
This is the same program that used to stop tweeting game updates when things went south. This is the same program that doesn't show negative replays at home games on the jumbotron when some fans would like to, ya know, SEE the previous play like you can at home. They try to sweep any potential negativity under the rug at all costs, as if that will somehow help right this sunken ship.

An omitted proviso and a tweaked sub-section, buried deep in a money bill passed in Parliament's recently concluded Budget Session, has fundamentally altered India's democracy by letting corporations anonymously donate unlimited amounts of cash to the political party of their choice.
The 2017 Finance Bill prompted token resistance from opposition parties when it was passed late last month, but has attracted relatively little attention, analysts and activists say, for something so transformational.
Now, as the implications sink in, many are sounding the alarm.
“This is huge,” said Milan Vaishnav, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who has written extensively on political funding in India. “Till recently, we could at least try to join the dots of corporate funding of political parties. With the new rules, we won't even have any dots to join.”
Interactive | Electoral Trusts: How some of India's biggest companies route money to political parties
So far, a company could contribute up to 7.5% of a three-year average of its net profits, and had to disclose the name of the recipient party. This put a cap on donations by each company and made it harder to finance parties using shell companies - entities that exist only as a postal address.
The Finance Bill 2017, passed this session, removes the contribution cap and the corporate disclosure requirements, and enables the creation of a new financial instrument called an “electoral bond”, issued by the Reserve Bank of India, which can be anonymously bought and deposited in the account of the beneficiary political party.
The government claims these changes will make political funding more transparent -- a claim echoed by India's corporate honchos, who insist anonymity is essential to guard against India's “vindictive” political culture in which parties could penalise donors for funding rival political forces.
“Whilst the ultimate objective is to bring about transparency in political donations, it is only possible when our political system demonstrates maturity like developed countries,” said Sunil Alagh, former managing director and CEO of Britannia Industries. “This might take some time and currently, therefore, the bearer bonds are a step in that direction and should be welcomed.”
But critics say removing funding caps and disclosure norms will buy corporations -- both Indian and foreign -- disproportionate influence over regulatory policy, and offer a lucrative tax-free conduit to launder money through India's 2,041 registered parties – most of whom have never fought an election and exist only in name.
“Donations to political parties are tax-free,” said Shahid Khan, former Member of the Central Board of Direct Taxes. “Now a company can donate any amount to a party, claim a tax rebate, and the party can show ‘cash expenses' in its income tax return to cycle the money back to the company and charge a pass-through commission.”
“Every political party is against transparency,” said Jagdeep Chhokar, founder of the Association for Democratic Reform. The last such reform, Chhokar said, was in 2013, when the United Progressive Alliance regime passed a law allowing for Electoral Trust Companies: secretive entities that collect donations on behalf of India's biggest corporates and disburse the money as per the whims of their trustees.
Electoral trusts have since emerged as a major source of funding for political parties. Between April 1, 2013, and March 31, 2016, donations from seven electoral trusts amounted to more than Rs 428 crore — about a third of all the funding disclosed by political parties in that time — according to parties' contribution reports.
Satya Electoral Trust, the largest of the seven, distributed about Rs 256 crore — more than all the other electoral trusts combined — to national and state parties alike. Satya's money, in turn, came from companies representing a broad swath of corporate India invested in highly regulated sectors where seemingly minor changes in policy can have a disproportionate impact on balance sheets. The trust's contributors include Indiabulls Housing Finance, DLF, Hero Motocorp and Torrent – a Gujarat-based group with separate businesses in thermal power and pharmaceuticals.
While trusts must disclose their contributions to the Election Commission of India, trustees are loath to discuss the rationale behind their donations.
“We are a private company, we don't have to answer such questions,” said Mukul Goyal, Satya's director, who revealed that Satya was set up in 2013 by Bharti Enterprises, but has functioned independently with its own board since 2014. Mr. Goyal declined to name the board members.
HT reached out to several of India's biggest political donors to understand the rationale behind their funding decisions. None replied save for Tata Sons Ltd, whose Progressive Electoral Trust disburses money on a predetermined formula: In national elections, parties must hold at least 3% of Lok Sabha's seats to qualify for funding; while state parties must hold at least 10% of the total seats in their respective Vidhan Sabhas.
Fifty percent of the funds are disbursed on the basis of seats held prior to elections, and another 50% on the basis seats won in the election.
For corporations, electoral trusts give an impression of an arms-length transaction, creating a buffer that allows companies to give money to parties without appearing to favour one over the other.
But trusts have their downside, too. In 2013, Chhokar and ADR zeroed in on the Public and Political Awareness Trust – which turned out to be an electoral trust associated with the Vedanta Group, a global mining conglomerate registered in London.
“Vedanta is a foreign source of funding, because it is registered in the UK,” said Chhokar, noting that the trust structure allowed money from a foreign source to pass under the radar. At the time, political parties could not accept foreign funding under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act of 1976 (FCRA).
But when ADR raised the issue, the government used the 2016 Finance Bill to amend the FCRA to allow parties to accept foreign contributions as long as they are routed through an Indian subsidiary.
Yet trusts, for all their drawbacks, are still required to file disclosures with the Election Commission India. The new election bonds, likely to be rolled out this year, are specifically designed to evade disclosure. As corporates switch to election bonds, trusts are likely to fall out of use.
Under the new regime, the darkness around election financing in India is likely to deepen.
“It's introducing additional opacity in the finances of political parties,” said Lakshmi Sriram, a program officer at ADR. “It's really bad.”

It's Feminist Theory Friday, people, and I've decided we should take a brief interlude from critiquing so-called “third wave” feminist politics to explore the idea that “disability, like gender, is a social construction” — a social construction that disproportionately disadvantages women.
As I've mentioned a number of times, I am the overbearing older sister of a young man with both Down Syndrome and Autism and recently married into a family which gave me a brother-in-law with a similar profile. This undoubtedly shapes my understanding of disabilities but, readers will notice, both of my developmentally disabled family members are male and so their experience navigating the world doesn't give me much insight into how women with disabilities experience the combination of sexism and ableism.
I'm going to speak from a place that I typically avoid. At sixteen I was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (which the current diagnostic manuals call ADHD Inattentive). Later on in life I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, the symptoms of which had been presenting themselves before my ADD diagnosis, but weren't legitimized or treated until every other possible diagnosis was ruled out. This took over 15 exhausting years of testing, filling out forms, going to specialist appointment after specialist appointment, and trying to convince medical professionals that my inability to keep my eyes open for more than a few hours wasn't “all in my head.”
Technically, these two factors make me a person with “an invisible disability.” I don't call myself a “disabled woman” and I don't like to talk about it for several reasons. First, while I believe that any feminist practice that excludes women with “multiple oppressions” is not a feminist practice at all, I also can't support the idea that in order to talk about sexism in a meaningful way, a woman must have an additional trump card or risk being called out for non-intersectional feminism.
Secondly, while I experience systemic problems as a woman who has Added and Chronic Fatigue, I don't experience overt person-to-person ableism in which others question my worth and capabilities because of a visible condition which cannot be hidden from the world. For this reason, I experience most of the privileges that come with being of able body and typical cognitive development.
Thirdly, I'm aware of the stigma that comes with being considered disabled. I accept that many of the ways I operate are influenced by having ADD and Chronic Fatigue (like my inability to notice mess, my tendency to lose important paperwork, or the fact that I'm unable to stay on top of the bureaucratic shit-storm that comes with receiving any sort of support for my conditions). However, I'd much rather have people treat me like a human rather than a walking pathology. The fact that this is something I can more or less choose is part of abled privilege.
Back to the socially constructed part. That is why we're here after all. In Susan Wendell's “The Social Construction of Disability” she asserts:
… Neither impairment nor disability can be defined purely in biomedical terms, because social arrangements and expectations make essential contributions to impairment and disability, and to their absence. […] [The] distinction between the biological reality of a disability and the social construction of a disability cannot be made sharply, because the biological and the social are interactive in creating disability.
Wendell argues that disability can be a device of our own creation (societally) in three ways.
First, “Social conditions affect people's bodies by creating or failing to prevent sickness and injury.” Take, for example, the “work/life balance” culture of the North American workplace.
As Health Sciences PhD student Zoe Krupka notes in her article “No, it's not you: why ‘wellness' isn't the answer to overwork,”
“We're working longer hours than ever before, and as our employment conditions continue to worsen, they're simply repackaged into a new version of normal in an effort to make the truly pathological state of many of our workplaces appear acceptable.”
This kind of (socially constructed) workplace culture (minor compared to the disabling features of war, domestic violence, prostitution, physically dangerous labour, poverty, and elitist refusals to inoculate our children from things like measles and polio) has physically disabling implications. As Lauren La Rose recently put it in The Globe and Mail:
Researchers cited studies associating overtime and extended work schedules with heightened risk of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, fatigue, stress, depression, chronic infections, diabetes and death. They also noted some studies found evidence of links between long working hours and an increased risk of occupational injuries, including among construction workers, nurses, miners, bus drivers and firefighters.
The culture North Americans (and much of the rest of the world) have created around work is, in many cases, physically disabling.
Secondly, we fail to provide people with physical, mental, and developmental challenges with the supports they need to fully participate in the parts of life that many of us take for granted. When we fail to challenge the backbreaking pace of the workplace, or the fact that many places people go to socialize are not equipped to service someone in a wheelchair or someone who is non-verbal, it is us and not people's individual limitations that are disabling people.
Lastly, we construct disability when we stereotype people with disabilities in ways that create obstacles to full participation in life. As Wendell says:
Stereotypes of disabled people as dependent, morally depraved, superhumanly heroic, asexual, and/or pitiful are still the most common cultural portrayals of people with disabilities. Stereotypes repeatedly get in the way of full participation in work and social life.
We do this all the time don't we? Take, for example, the fact that many people believe prostitution is necessary in order to satisfy the needs of disabled people (okay, let's be serious, just disabled men). Many people consider themselves enlightened for having this opinion because it counters the idea that disabled people are non-sexual beings. However, if you look at it more closely, it also reinforces the false and socially constructed stereotype that portrays the disabled as people no one would consider sleeping with for free or people that always need extra (read: burdensome) help during sex. Progressive? Far from it.
So what does this have to do with feminism? For starters, many of the ways that we classify or recognize disabilities are based on male experience. Because male socialization and female socialization are different, the sexes often don't present disability in the same way. I was well aware as a child that I didn't fit well into the mainstream school system. However, I wasn't diagnosed with Attention Deficit until the eleventh grade and had never been given any learning support (in elementary school, high school, and even university) because I didn't exhibit any symptoms of hyperactivity, a symptom which is more common among males than females.
Additionally, we're less likely to take conditions experienced by women more often than men — like Chronic Fatigue, Fibromyalgia, and Anxiety — seriously. For myself this meant a 15 year battle with the medical system to prove that I wasn't somehow hysterical, chronically lazy, faking my experience, or simply overreacting.
Lastly, women with disabilities are penalized more harshly for failing to live up to the gendered expectations placed upon all women. When we treat women as a class as a population of sex objects, guess who is the most severely ostracised? The women who have been stereotyped as asexual by abled people. (P.S. For those of you who think hypersexualizing disabled women will solve this… you're wrong. And a pain in the ass.)
Unfortunately, Wendell doesn't have any quick fixes for us in this essay but I have a few (non-exhaustive) pointers based on my personal experience:
1) We need to make women's experience of disability a topic of interest and pursuit in feminist scholarship.
2) We need to challenge the fallacy that employers can recklessly expect more work while blaming the resulting disabilities on individual employee's failure to practice “work/life balance” or “wellness” or whatever horseshit term is the flavour of the corporate week.
3) Women need to congregate in numbers to insist that medical communities take their experiences with illness seriously. The isolation and privacy is working against us in this way. It's much easier to tell a single woman that she's hysterical than a massive group.
4) We need to challenge both the stereotyping of women with disabilities, and the sexual objectification of women as a whole.
It's critical to develop strategies to deconstruct disability and ensure that we are not, as a society, disabling women as a class.

Major League Soccer made some good news on Friday, signing UC-Davis defender Ramon Martin Del Campo despite interest from Club Tijuana and Saprissa. Brooke Tunstall has the details.

seen it lose several top college players to foreign teams, Major League Soccer has kept at least one top college prospect from signing abroad.
Ramon Martin Del Campo , a strapping defender from UC-Davis who came from obscurity to being a member of the U.S. U-23 national team pool this summer, turned down offers from Tijuana Xolos in Liga MX and Saprissa in Costa Rica and has come to terms with MLS, American Soccer Now has learned.
A six-foot-three center back who is strong in the air, Martin Del Campo has drawn plaudits for his on-field leadership and vocal ability.
“He's a coach on the field,” said UC Irvine coach Chris Volk, who recruited and competed against Martin Del Campo. “He's always talking, always leading and organizing. Coaches notice things like that.”
Martin Del Campo was unknown in most soccer circles a year ago despite three solid-but-unspectacular seasons at UC-Davis, which plays in the Big West Conference. But last winter he successfully auditioned for the Premier Development League team of the San Jose Earthquakes, and Martin Del Campo's profile suddenly began to rise.
Because of its proximity to Stanford University, where last spring the U.S. national team was training in preparation for the World Cup, the Earthquakes' U-23s were asked to scrimmage the U.S., and it was there that Marin Del Campo shined.
“It was crazy," Martin del Campo said. "I hardly knew any of my teammates names because we hadn't been together that long. I'm pretty vocal in the back and instead of calling a player by name I was like, 'Hey, No. 4, push-up!' or whatever," Martin Del Campo told American Soccer Now this summer.
“And on corner kicks I marked Omar Gonzalez and [John] Brooks. I was nervous but not bad-nervous. More like Rocky Balboa-nervous, on your toes. I knew what I needed to do and I went and executed it.”
He played so well marking the likes of Aron Johannsson and Chris Wondolowksi during the run of play that he caught the eye of U.S. assistants Tab Ramos and Andreas Herzog, who are running the U-23 program until Jurgen Klinsman appoints a coach. They invited Martin Del Campo to a friendly against the Bahamas in August. In his international debut, Martin Del Campo played the second half and had an assist.
Meanwhile, he continued to shine for the Earthquakes' PDL team, being named to the team's 11-person All-League team. Earthquakes management were enamored enough with Martin Del Campo's potential that they inquired to MLS about trying to sign him last summer but were told they had no homegrown claim to him because he had not been developed in their academy.
Instead he returned to Davis for his senior year, where he helped the Aggies become the last team in Division I to lose a game this season. Unfortunately, many of those games were ties and the Aggies finished 7-4-9 and missed the NCAA Tournament, though Martin Del Campo was named all-Big West Conference.
The Earthquakes will now get a chance to draft Martin Del Campo, though now he's no longer an unknown and he'll be on display at the league's annual scouting combine, which begins next Friday in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.
A dual citizen, Martin Del Campo was born in Mexico to American parents of Mexican descent and raised in the United States on the border town of Chula Vista, Calif., just outside San Diego. That heritage and proximity to the Mexican border made him a natural candidate for Tijuana Xolos, the border outfit that has become a power in Mexican soccer in part by signing several Mexican-American players, many from Southern California.
However, after trialing with Tijuana and Saprissa, MLS increased its offer to Martin Del Campo and the defender came to terms earlier this week.
This was a much-needed signing for MLS for this draft as the league has already seen several college players leave for overseas. Maryland sophomore goalkeeper Zack Steffen signed with Freiburg in Germany while Saint Louis University's All-American forward Robbie Kristo signed with a team in Italy's Serie B and two-time All American Leo Stolz is in Germany looking to find a club there after rejecting an MLS offer.

Banerjee, whose story was told in the film "Escape from Taliban", was pulled from her home by gunmen in the eastern province of Paktika on Wednesday last week and shot dead.
Paktika provincial police chief Dawlat Khan Zadran said two insurgents were detained while planting a roadside bomb and their features matched the description of the killers given by Banerjee's Afghan husband.
"During the interrogation, one of them confessed to killing the Indian author but said he had other accomplices," Mr Zadransaid.
"They said they killed her because she defamed the Taliban in her writing and set up an internet connection in her home to spy for India."
The Afghan Taliban denied involvement but Mr Zadran said the two detained men identified themselves as members of a militant faction allied with the Taliban called the Haqqani network.
The Haqqanis, an ethnic Pashtun group with strongholds in southeastern Afghanistan and across the border in Pakistan, are seen by the government and Western force as the most experienced militant fighters in Afghanistan.
They have been held responsible for some of the most serious attacks in the capital, Kabul, and elsewhere.
Banerjee, who was 49 and from Calcutta, moved to Afghanistan in 1989 after marrying Afghan businessman Jaanbaz Khan. She converted to Islam and changed her name to Sayed Kamala.
She opened a dispensary providing medicine, but her life changed in 1993, when the Taliban emerged in southern Afghanistan after years of war.
Branded a woman of poor morals, she was forced to close her dispensary and whipped for refusing to wear a burka, she said in a book she wrote.
She fled to Pakistan but was brought back by her husband's family and kept under house arrest. According to her book, she escaped in 1994 by tunnelling a hole through a mud wall.
She fled but was quickly detained near Kabul. Despite threats of execution, she convinced the Taliban to send her to the Indian embassy from where she was repatriated to India.
She was making a documentary about the lives of women in Paktika when she was killed.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana's top lawyer said Thursday that a Indiana Senate bill that would allow schools to teach creationism in science classes clearly violates the U.S. Constitution and invites legal challenges.
U.S. Supreme Court precedents "going back many years" have established the unconstitutionality of teaching creationism in public schools, Ken Falk said.
"The idea that somehow our state legislature can trump the Constitution just doesn't make sense," Falk said in a news release issued by the ACLU. "When lawmakers propose legislation they clearly know will end up in the courts, it wastes valuable time and resources, disrespects the legislative process and confuses an already complicated issue."
The Senate Education Committee voted 8-2 Wednesday to send the bill before the full Senate despite experts and even some senators saying teaching creationism likely would be ruled unconstitutional if challenged in court. The bill's prospects for advancing to the House weren't certain Thursday. Next Wednesday is the deadline for bills originating in the Senate to win approval from the full chamber.
Falk said the U.S. Supreme Court in its 1987 case Edwards v. Aguillard struck down a Louisiana statute that required instruction on evolution to be accompanied by teaching on "creation science." The court found that the Louisiana statute had no identifiable secular purpose, but that the "pre-eminent purpose of the Louisiana Legislature was clearly to advance the religious viewpoint that a supernatural being created humankind."
The Indiana Senate bill doesn't require instruction of creationism, but allows it.
In committee debate Wednesday, Sen. Scott Schneider, R-Indianapolis, said there are legitimate questions about the theory of evolution and that many scientists agree with the concept of intelligent design, the theory that life on Earth is so complex it had to be created by an intelligent higher power.
"What are we afraid of? Allowing an option for students including creation science as opposed to limiting their exposure?" Schneider said.
Senate Education Chairman Dennis Kruse, R-Auburn, said he knew of nothing in state law that prohibits public schools from teaching creationism. He said he sponsored the bill because he believes creationism should be taught among the theories on the development of life and that the proposal wouldn't force any changes in schools teaching evolution.
Some committee members suggested that they would support amending the bill in the full Senate to instead encourage schools to teach about the world's religions in literature or history classes. Sen. Luke Kenley, R-Noblesville, voted in favor of the bill even though it called its current form a "lawyer's dream."
Falk said that since public school curriculum must always serve a secular educational purpose, religion can be taught if the purpose is to examine religion's role in history, art, literature, society or other secular subjects. He said religion can only be taught in an objective, unbiased manner that does not promote or criticize any particular religion or set of beliefs.
CNBC's Sara Eisen asked me last Tuesday if I was still bearish on one of Wall Street and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s (NYSE: GS) favorite stocks, even after it had already fallen more than 45% since I warned you last May that it was a bad investment.
"You know this environment, Keith," she told me. "People are paying up for growth companies. The bulls would say this has great brand presence, great brand awareness, and is continuing a careful and steady expansion in the U.S. and abroad."
All excellent points, I replied… but not one of them changes the fact that a tiny company taking market share from huge competitors in a non-growth market does not make it a growth stock.
Then I went for the jugular…
…if this company traded in line with its biggest competitor, the company's stock price would be only $0.66 a share, or 98.22% less than Goldman Sachs suggests.
Here's why this stock's bulls are still in for plenty of heartburn.
When I first pointed to Shake Shack Inc. (NYSE: SHAK) as an investment to avoid last May, the company was trading at roughly 1,200 times earnings – in an industry that had an average price/earnings (P/E) ratio of 40. That's come down to a forward P/E of "only" 376, according to Yahoo! Finance, now that the stock has fallen by 35%.
The bulls take this as a sign of encouragement, noting that the company's stock is somehow more reasonable at $60 a share than it was at $90.
Don't fall for it.
There's still plenty of potential heartburn on the menu.
Shake Shack remains a highly speculative company at best, and not the investment millions of people think it is. Here are five reasons why:
1. Insiders are bailing out.
Shake Shack recently filed for a secondary offering of up to 4 million shares on the eve of the expiration of the company's IPO lock-up period. According to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission documents, sellers include Chairman Danny Meyer, Green Equity Investors VI, and LP SEG Partners LP, and the chain will not receive a dime.
If they believed Shake Shack stock was cheap and that the company had better days ahead, they'd be holding on or even buying more.
As I noted in this article, individual investors are the last in line when it comes to making money from initial public offerings.
Further, a company like Shake Shack couldn't have been brought public a decade ago when you had to have results rather than just "potential."
2. SHAK still trades at an unwarranted premium compared to the competition.
I realize this is hard to internalize, so let me break it down another way by using the value per restaurant as of last May.
Do you really believe that Shake Shack is worth $50 million per location?
The markets didn't, and I still don't.
In fact, if the Shack is going to achieve a McDonald's-like valuation per location, the company would have to do this…
5-star defensive end Xavier Thomas has been a solid commitment to the defending champion Clemson football program since his commitment to Dabo Swinney and has even tried to sway potential teammates to TigerTown to join a stellar 2018 recruiting class.
Thomas' father Ezra posted his thoughts to Facebook on Monday afternoon to hopefully clarify his son's current recruiting situation since some decommitment rumors were floating around the Internet.
"ALL IN"
Over the past couple of weeks my son and I have been talking in depth about reopening his recruitment in order to conduct all five of his official visits. As a parent I believe that as a athlete of his stature and with so many options available to him. He is placing himself at a disadvantage by NOT taking advantage of his official visits. The only true way to know for a fact that Clemson is the BEST program for him is to visit the other college programs such as USC, Ohio State, Alabama and Florida State. Primarily because he has NOT visited some of these programs at all. Which sincerely concerns me. THEN and ONLY THEN should he make his decision based off of his own personal research and knowledge. NOT off what someone else is telling him.
YES! I have from day one encouraged him to remain in state and invest his all to our Home State of South Carolina. Hence his initial commitment to play in state for either our Gamecocks or the Clemson Tigers. BUT this is not about what I want nor will it ever be. I am simply striving to guide my Son in the best possible manner to ensure that he is absolutely certain about his decisions and achieves the greatest possible results through those decisions. Also that he is making those decisions based off of factual information and NOT a recruiting sale pitch.
Za, has made it passionately clear that his heart is with Clemson and that he IS very much "ALL IN". His willingness to still do the official visits at my desire speaks volumes to me of his character and the strength of his resolve. He may decide to respect my concerns and still take advantage of his official visits. But I will not ask that of him nor demand it of him. He and I have agreed that he will not be decommiting his verbal commitment from Clemson. There is no doubt in my heart nor mind about his commitment to play at Clemson and I will support that commitment completely without any complaint.
Therefore, I will carry the responsibility for all of the controversy regarding my Son's verbal commitment and his recruitment status. He is a great kid only doing what he has been told by his parents. Thank you. God Bless!
This is true facts. & I'm not taking the visits. We are ALLIN ?? https://t.co/iL2twahrC2 — Xavier Thomas 1??9?? (@atxlete) September 18, 2017
When we remember our past selves, they seem quite different. We know how much our personalities and tastes have changed over the years. But when we look ahead, somehow we expect ourselves to stay the same, a team of psychologists said Thursday, describing research they conducted of people's self-perceptions.
They called this phenomenon the “end of history illusion,” in which people tend to “underestimate how much they will change in the future.” According to their research, which involved more than 19,000 people ages 18 to 68, the illusion persists from teenage years into retirement.
“Middle-aged people — like me — often look back on our teenage selves with some mixture of amusement and chagrin,” said one of the authors, Daniel T. Gilbert, a psychologist at Harvard. “What we never seem to realize is that our future selves will look back and think the very same thing about us. At every age we think we're having the last laugh, and at every age we're wrong.”
Other psychologists said they were intrigued by the findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, and were impressed with the amount of supporting evidence. Participants were asked about their personality traits and preferences — their favorite foods, vacations, hobbies and bands — in years past and present, and then asked to make predictions for the future. Not surprisingly, the younger people in the study reported more change in the previous decade than did the older respondents.

Back in April, Kanye West and several members of the Kardashian clan headed to Iceland for what appeared to be a standard family vacation; however, it turns out the trip was more for business than it was for pleasure.
During Sunday night's episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kim revealed that the purpose of the visit was to film the video for a Life of Pablo track. Since images from the trip emerged, rumors began circulating that Kanye did, in fact, shoot a video for either "Ultralight Beam" or for "Highlights," but no one could confirm ... until now. Though the show never mentions the name of the song that Kanye is filming for, Kourtney Kardashian says it's for her "favorite song." Not too long after the album dropped, Kourtney revealed that her favorite track from The Life of Pablo was "Highlights." So, there we have it.
Kim just confirmed that Kanye did shoot the video for "Highlights" during the trip to Iceland! #KUWTK — TeamKanyeDaily (@TeamKanyeDaily) July 11, 2016
The video has a lot to live up to, considering all the buzz that surrounded the "Famous" visuals, as well as all the discussion that followed after its premiere at The Forum in Los Angeles last month. But, if we know Kanye, we're sure he's going to deliver something epic.
Throughout the episode, Kim would talk about how the video was filmed on top of an Iceland glacier that could only be accessed through helicopter, so it's safe to assume we can expect some insane imagery on the way. All we have to do now is wait for the video to drop.
Rhelena of Crochet Pattern Bonanza AND CrochetN'Crafts
When choosing guest bloggers for my Cre8tion Crochet I primarily work with blogs that I either really love or with bloggers who are open to sharing and helping each other. Rhelena of Crochet Pattern Bonanza fits into both categories.
Crochet Pattern Bonanza is a pattern directory run by Rhelena that offers free crochet patterns. Crochet Pattern Bonanza is the sister site to CrochetN'Crafts which is where Rhelena primarily shares her own patterns, as well as patterns from other crochet designers.
I “met” Rhelena when she approached me about putting some of my patterns on Crochet Pattern Bonanza. We have since formed a great friendship. I truly believe in reciprocity and so does Rhelena. We have both tried to help each other along the way.
Rhelena is also a fantastic crochet designer. I love her patterns. This pattern is offered exclusively to fans of Cre8tion Crochet. This gorgeous Picot Arm Warmer and Picot Cowl are definitely going on my list of things to crochet.

Lets get to know a little more about Rhelena and her sites Crochet Pattern Bonanza and CrochetN'Crafts
1- How long have you been crocheting?
I was taught the basics of crocheting when I was about 9 or 10 and crocheted on and off throughout my childhood and teenage years. It wasn't until my early 20's that I got serious about it and taught myself to read patterns. In 2006 I started playing around with my own designs and started publishing them online in 2008.
2- How long have you been blogging?
I started my first website in late 2008 after I lost my job due to health reasons.
3- What are your favorite items to make?
When I first got serious about crocheting I enjoyed making thread doilies. I made them for all my coffee tables and dressers. Now I enjoy anything that allows my mind to be free, such as blankets, bags, hats and scarves. I also enjoy making tops for myself and hope to get into designing more of those in the near future.
4- What is your favorite thing about crocheting and or blogging?
My favorite thing about crocheting is that it helps me to relax while giving me a sense of accomplishment. As for having a website, it gives me the hope of earning a living one day by doing what I enjoy most.
5- What are your favorite yarns (brands or types) to work with?
It depends on how I look at it in terms of price and what I enjoy working with most. But I tend to favor Patons Canadiana – The New Generation and Aunt Lydia's Size 3 Crochet Thread because they are reasonably priced and result in beautiful fabrics.
6- What was your inspiration for your pattern?
A lot of my inspirations come from what I actually need for myself, or from requests. It forces me to brainstorm and often one project idea will lead to another. I keep a list of things I need/want to make for myself, and I usually take it from there as time and inspiration allows. Also, a lot of my inspiration comes from other designs. That's one of the beauties of owning a crochet pattern directory as it allows me to see many inspirational designs.
7- Tell me a little something about your personal life… kids, family, pets, etc.
Currently I live by myself in a small apartment. I'm trying to overcome a life-long illness with natural remedies and cleansing. So naturally, solitude is one of the best friends I could ask for at this time. Also, I love to do yoga and meditation.
8- Tell us a little bit about Crochet Pattern Bonanza and CrochetN'Crafts.
When were they created. CrochetN'Crafts was created in late 2008. That's where I have published the majority of my free patterns. All patterns are free at the time, but I hope to design some for sale in the future so as not to put all your eggs in one basket. As for Crochet Pattern Bonanza, a free crochet pattern directory, it was started in 2011.
9- What type of patterns are you looking for.
I'm looking for all types of crochet patterns as long as they are free and the designer/publisher is allowing me to use the image in a thumbnail link.
11- How do fellow bloggers get their patterns featured on your sites?
To get listed on the directory, simply send me an email or fill out the submission form on my directory. You'll find my contact information under the “contact” and “submit link” tabs at the top of the page. You can write up a short summary of yourself or website and I'll put you in the “featured designers” spot for a day.
I hope you enjoyed getting to know Rhelena as much as I have. If you are a crocheter you will want to visit Crochet Pattern Bonanza for lots of free patterns. Be sure to take a peek at CrochetN'Crafts which features more of Rhelena's original designs.
The GOP's new Islamophobic narrative Mainstream Republicans aren't suggesting Obama is a Muslim -- just that he's "acting" like one
Those who fervently believe that Barack Obama is a Muslim generally practice their furtive religion in obscure recesses of the Internet. Once in a while, they'll surface in public to remind the news media that no amount of evidence can undermine their convictions.
In October 2008, at a town hall meeting in Minnesota for Republican presidential candidate John McCain, a woman called Obama “an Arab.” McCain responded, incongruously enough, that Obama was, in fact, “a decent family man” and not an Arab at all. In an echo of this, a woman recently stood up at a town hall in Florida and began a question for Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum by asserting that the president “is an avowed Muslim.” The audience cheered, and Santorum didn't bother to correct her.
Advertisement:
Though they belong to a largely underground cult, the members of the Obama-is-Muslim congregation number as many as one-third of all Republicans. A recent poll found that only 14 percent of Republicans in Alabama and Mississippi believe that the president is Christian.
These true believers treat their scraps of evidence like holy relics: the president's middle name, his grandfather's religion, a widely circulated photo of Obama in a turban. They occasionally traffic in outright fabrications: that he attended a radical madrasa in Indonesia as a child or that he put his hand on the Qur'an to be sworn in as president. An even more apocalyptic subset believes Obama to be nothing short of the anti-Christ.
By and large, however, this cult doesn't attract mainstream support from the larger church of Obama haters. Indeed, these more orthodox faithful have carefully shifted the debate from Obama being Muslim to Obama acting Muslim. Evangelical pundits, presidential candidates and the right-wing media have all ramped up their attacks on the president for, as Baptist preacher Franklin Graham put it recently on MSNBC, “giving Islam a pass.”
The conservative mainstream still calls the president's religious beliefs into question, but they stop just short of accusing him of apostasy and concealment. What they consider safe is the assertion that Obama is acting as if he were Muslim. In this way, Republican mandarins are cleverly channeling a conspiracy theory into a policy position.
There is a whiff of desperation in all this. After all, it's not an easy time for the GOP. The economy shows modest signs of improvement. The Republican presidential candidates are still engaged in a fratricidal primary. By expanding counterterrorism operations and killing Osama bin Laden, the president has effectively removed national security from the list of Republican talking points.
One story, however, still ties together so many narrative threads for conservatives. Charges that the president is a socialist or a Nazi or an elitist supporter of college education certainly push some buttons. But the single surefire way of grabbing the attention of the media and the public -- as well as appealing to the instincts of the Republican base -- is to assert, however indirectly, that Barack Obama is a Manchurian candidate sent from the Islamic world.

Obama and the Muslim World
A succession of Republican candidates have attempted to run to the right of party favorite Mitt Romney by asserting that only a true conservative can defeat Obama in November. Most of them boasted of the same powerful backer. Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and Rick Santorum all declared that God asked them to run for higher office. Together with Newt Gingrich, they have deployed various methods of appealing to their constituencies, but none is more potent than religion.
Rick Santorum, a Catholic and the favorite of the evangelical community, has been particularly adept at using his soapbox as a pulpit. The president subscribes to a “phony theology,” Santorum has claimed, “not a theology based on the Bible, a different theology.” Although he occasionally asserts that “Obama's personal faith is none of my concern,” he nonetheless speaks of the president's attempt to “impose values on people of faith”-- implying that the president is certainly no member of that community.
In his attacks on the president's spirituality, Santorum is cleverly attacking Mitt Romney's Mormonism as well (a theology also based on text other than the Bible). At the same time, the suggestion that Obama is somehow “other” operates as a code word for “black” in a race in which race goes largely unmentioned.

It's an odd set of charges. Obama, after all, did everything possible during his first presidential campaign to foreground his Christianity. He was repeatedly seen praying in churches and assiduously avoided mosques. He never made a campaign appearance with a prominent Muslim. He talked about his “personal relationship” with Jesus Christ.
The day after he clinched the Democratic Party nomination in 2008, he gave a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in which he reaffirmed that he was “a true friend of Israel.” Although he would occasionally mention his Muslim relatives and the time he spent in Indonesia as a child, he generally did whatever he could to emphasize only two out of the three major monotheisms.
As president, Obama has certainly “reached out” to the Muslim world. In Cairo, in June 2009, he spoke of seeking “a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world, one based on mutual interest and mutual respect, and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition.”
Advertisement:
That new beginning, however, has yet to come. At home, for example, the Obama administration provided federal funds that the New York City Police Department then used to expand its surveillance of Muslim American neighborhoods. (Even the CIA was involved in this “human mapping” project.) The FBI has spent the Obama years rounding up suspected Muslim terrorists in operations that flirt dangerously with entrapment. The administration has expanded the no-fly list, though because the list is secret it's difficult to know whether Muslim-Americans are specifically profiled. Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests that they are.
The administration's record internationally is even more disappointing. The conduct of U.S. troops in Afghanistan -- the night raids, massacres (including the recent murders of 16 Afghan villagers), and the Qur'an burnings -- have enraged local Muslims. Obama has expanded the CIA's drone air campaign by a considerable margin in the Pakistani borderlands. Civilian casualties, overwhelmingly Muslim, continue to occur there and in other “overseas contingency operations” as U.S. Special Operations Forces have dramatically expanded their activities in the Muslim world.
Despite right-wing charges, Obama has maintained a tight relationship with Israel and the Israeli leadership. As former New Republic editor Peter Beinart concludes, “The story of Obama's relationship to [Prime Minister] Netanyahu and his American Jewish allies is, fundamentally, a story of acquiescence.”
Advertisement:
It's no surprise, then, that surveys in six Middle East countries taken just before and two months after the Cairo speech in 2009, the Brookings Institution and Zogby International discovered that the number of respondents optimistic about the president's approach to the region had suffered a dramatic drop: from 51 percent to 16 percent. A 2011 Pew poll found that U.S. favorability ratings had continued their slide in Jordan (to 13 percent), Pakistan (12 percent) and Turkey (10 percent).
And yet, perversely, the hard right in the U.S. maintains that the Obama administration has behaved in quite the opposite manner. “There's something sick about an administration which is so pro-Islamic that it can't even tell the truth about the people who are trying to kill us,” Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich typically said while campaigning in Georgia.
Pro-Islamic? That's news to the Islamic world.
But it's nothing new to the world of the U.S. right wing, which portrays Obama as anti-Israel and weak in the face of Islamic terrorism. At best, the president emerges from these attacks as a booster of Islam; at worst, he is the leader of a genuine fifth column.

Although the administration's policy on Iran is virtually indistinguishable from those of his Republican challengers, they have presented him as an appeaser. The president who “surged” in Afghanistan somehow becomes, through the magic of election-year sloganeering, a pacifist patsy. Although Obama never endorsed the location of the “Ground Zero mosque,” his opponents have suggested that he did. Although he was slow to withdraw support from U.S. allies in the Middle East like Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and Ben Ali in Tunisia, Republican candidates have accused the president of practically campaigning on behalf of the Islamist parties that have grown in influence as a result of the Arab Spring.
Barack Obama, the right wing has discovered, does not have to be Muslim to convince American voters that he has a suspect, even foreign, agenda. They have instead established a much lower evidentiary standard: he only has to act Muslim.
For this, they don't need a birth certificate. All they need are allegations, however spurious, that the president is in league with Iran's Ahmadinejad, Arab Spring jihadists and anti-Israel forces at home. This more subtle but no less ugly Islamophobia has already insinuated itself into the 2012 elections in a potentially more damaging way than did the overt disparagement of Obama's religious bona fides back in 2008.
The Upcoming Elections
Advertisement:
The 2010 midterm elections witnessed a sharp uptick in anti-Islamic sentiment. In addition to the concocted “Ground Zero mosque” controversy, Florida preacher Terry Jones threatened to burn the Qur'an in front of the world's cameras; a group called Stop Islamization of America bought anti-Islamic ads on buses in major cities; and a movement to pass anti-Sharia legislation at a state level began in Oklahoma. In response to this brushfire of hatred, Time magazine devoted a cover story to Islamophobia that year. On the right at least, Islam seemed on the way to becoming a litmus test in the way communism was during the Cold War.
Two years later, the hysteria seems to have subsided. The Islamophobes haven't gone into hiding. They tried to organize an advertising boycott of the TV show "All-American Muslim"; they campaigned against halal meats. But these efforts didn't get much traction.
Meanwhile, Park51 -- the real name of the cultural center inaccurately dubbed the “Ground Zero mosque” -- opened in its original Park Street location with an exhibition by a Jewish photographer. Terry Jones is pursuing a quixotic bid for the presidency far from the media spotlight. Time has returned several times to the topic of Islamophobia, particularly after Anders Breivik's bombing and shooting rampage in Norway in July 2011, but with none of the intensity of the summer of 2010. The anti-Sharia campaign has passed legislation in several states, and laws are pending in more than a dozen more. But the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the Oklahoma anti-Sharia statute unconstitutional, and the anti-Sharia crowd has been unable to provide a single piece of evidence that Islamic law poses any challenge to the U.S. legal system.
Don't be fooled, though, by the relative quiet. It's still early in the election cycle. The Republicans, arrayed in a circular firing squad, have been largely focusing their attacks on each other. The last man standing will marshal his resources to challenge Obama. In the unlikely event that Rick Santorum emerges as the Republican candidate, religion will be central to his attack on Obama and the Democrats.

Mitt Romney has a more ambivalent relationship to religion as a wedge issue, given the level of discomfort that many American have toward Mormonism. But there are no Mormon countries to which Romney can be accused of owing primary allegiance. It will be safe, in other words, to challenge Obama for acting rather than being Muslim, for deferring to the Muslim world much as anti-Catholic voters in 1960 imagined John F. Kennedy to be taking his orders directly from the Pope.
Romney is already lining up his ducks, welcoming onto his team Islam critic Walid Phares and attack ad specialist Larry McCarthy (who did an distortion-laden spot on the “Ground Zero mosque” back in 2010). After securing the nomination, Romney will simultaneously appeal to the center and shore up support among evangelicals. The message that Obama is weak, anti-Israel, and appeases Islamic movements and countries could catch the attention of both constituencies.
A disconnect between accusation and reality hardly matters in American politics these days. Obama the “socialist” somehow manages to work hand in hand with Wall Street financiers. Obama the “Nazi” courts AIPAC. Obama the “peacenik” has been very much a war president. And Obama the “Muslim” gets a big thumbs-down from the Muslim world.
The president makes a lousy Muslim Manchurian candidate, for he has disappointed his imagined Muslim handlers at virtually every turn. In an election in which racist slogans are off the table, however, the Islamophobic accusation of “acting Muslim” remains a politically acceptable chauvinism. Given the deep anti-Islamic currents in American culture, such accusations might unfortunately prove effective as well.

This is a striking report. It's about a remarkable inner-city school in Detroit named Catherine Ferguson Academy — and the Michigan Republican power-grab that's being referred to as “financial martial law.” Watch:
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32545640
Rachel's right; this really is the next big move in what I've been calling the Movement Conservative Coup, the cadre coup of modern American government and institutions (for example, the Southern Baptist Church and the group that determines textbooks for the state of Texas).
While there were many minor steps along the way (victories for their side, defeats for the other), there are probably three major moves in recent years, three great leaps forward, to borrow a Maoist phrase.
▪ The birthing room has to be Bush v. Gore, the corrupt and judicially indefensible handing of the U.S. presidency to the Movement Conservative candidate by Movement Conservative judges on the Supreme Court. The broader coup has been a work in progress for decades, but the current on-steroids phase starts here.
▪ After that comes the U.S. Patriot Act, Bush II's response to the 9/11 attack.
▪ Then comes Citizens United, the gift that keeps on taking. We've just started seeing those effects. That by itself almost guarantees that the Coup's owners and chief beneficiaries will own us for a generation.
▪ And now Michigan and its “financial martial law” — a test bed for near-dictatorial control of local government by state governors.
Michigan is just the start; these Teabag-enabled Republicans want it all, and if Michigan isn't rolled back, these laws will roll out in every Republican-controlled state.

ISIS TAKES ABU GHRAIB – Within Artillery Range of Baghdad Airport
ISIS begun their assault of one of the Iraq's largest military bases.
The Sunni terrorists held a massive military parade in Abu Ghraib in March.
But only recently took control of the key cities in the region.
ISIS has taken complete control of Abu Ghraib west of Baghdad.

The Islamists are now within artillery range of Baghdad.
The News Tribune reported:
Islamic State militants have taken control of key cities in Iraq's western province of Anbar and have begun to besiege one of the country's largest military bases in a weeklong offensive that's brought them within artillery range of Baghdad. The Islamic State and its tribal allies have dominated Anbar since a surprise offensive last December, but this week's push was particularly worrisome, because for the first time this year Islamist insurgents were reported to have become a major presence in Abu Ghraib, the last Anbar town on the outskirts of the capital. “Daash is openly operating inside Abu Ghraib,” according to an Iraqi soldier, who used a common Arabic term for the Islamic State. “I was at the 10th Division base there two days ago, and the soldiers cannot leave or patrol,” he said, asking that he be identified only as Hossam because Iraqi soldiers are barred from speaking with foreign reporters. “Daash controls the streets.” Hundreds of miles to the west, Islamic State forces continued their push into the Syrian Kurdish city of Kobane, where it appeared unlikely that Turkey would intervene to stop the advance. Kurdish officials from the town said the Turkish government had yet to respond to their pleas for weapons, and reports from the Turkish-Syrian border said there was no evidence Turkey was preparing to take action… …A diplomat in Irbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdistan region, said an Islamic State presence in Abu Ghraib would put Baghdad International Airport within artillery range of the militants. “We know they have captured substantial numbers of 155 mm howitzers,” said the diplomat, whose country is participating in the U.S.-led anti-Islamic State coalition. The diplomat spoke only on the condition of anonymity, lacking permission to brief the news media. “These have a range of about (20 miles) and if they are able to hold territory in Abu Ghraib then the concern they can shell and ultimately close BIAP becomes a grave concern.”
Once again, ISIS posted photos today of the arms they captured in fighting north of Baghdad.
In December 2010, bombings in Jos killed at least 32 people and sparked sectarian reprisals [AFP]
At least two blasts have rocked the Nigerian city of Jos, with one death and a number of injuries reported at a bar where fans were watching Barcelona play Real Madrid.
One of the explosions was said to have occurred near the outdoor bar where residents were watching the Spanish football match.
"Two bombs have just exploded in Jos," Pam Ayuba, spokesman for the governor of Plateau state, told the AFP news agency.
"We are yet to establish the numbers of casualties, but reports I got said some people were injured."
Ayuba said the blast occurred in an area where Christian and Muslim groups often clash.
A Red Cross official told Al Jazeera that his team took at least ten people to hospital, adding that there could be more.
Resident Stanley Ejeh said: "The blast occurred ... close to a soccer viewing centre.
"The viewing centre was packed with people. There was at least one death while several other injured victims were taken to hospital."
Jos, the capital of Plateau state, has been hit by waves of sectarian violence in recent years which have killed thousands of people.
Plateau lies in the middle-belt region between the mainly Muslim north and predominately Christian south.
The north has been hit by scores of attacks blamed on the armed Islamist group Boko Haram, which also claimed responsibility for the August suicide bombing of the UN headquarters in the capital Abuja which killed 24 people.
Police in Florida are trying to figure out how a wild alligator ended up with a dead body. The identity of the victim is unknown.
Lakeland Police received a 911 call (you can listen below) on Tuesday afternoon following sightings of an alligator walking around the edge of a lake with a human body in its mouth.
"I noticed something bobbing in the water... At first, I thought it was a tire or something just from the looks of it,” a witness told local news WFLA Channel 8. “I noticed there was a gator on it because he kind of took it up and rolled it. ”
When police arrived on the scene the gator was still holding the deceased body in its jaws. On approaching it, the alligator let go of the body and swam away.
According to a statement by the Lakeland Police Department, the investigators have still not established the identity of the body, and so far have only figured out that the body was male and had been in the water for at least a day. It is also unknown whether the alligator killed the body or just found it. On the Sunday before the body was found, police also received a call from someone saying they saw “something large floating in Lake Hunter with an alligator circling it,“ but police couldn't find anything suspicious.
A contract trapper from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission captured a 2.7 meter (9 foot) long alligator the following day, Tampa Bay Times reports. A medical examiner analysis showed that the alligator had human remains inside of its stomach, strongly implying this was the culprit.
Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission says there were five fatalities from gator attacks in Florida between April 2016 and 2006.
A Guest Post by Abby Goldsmith
General audiences praise "Star Wars" as a great space epic, with magic powers and high stakes. But that story is more than forty years old. While space stories populate video-game franchises, manga, anime, and TV/film, they're less popular in literature. Few people can name a living author who dominates the Space Adventure sub-genre (Space Opera and Space Fantasy). The "Vorkosigan saga" is beloved, but not on the same global scale as "Harry Potter."
Fantasy has historically outsold Sci-Fi, and I believe it's due to a dichotomous approach to story premise. Fantasy stories are built from a premise of personal conflict. For example: What if you need to conquer your inner darkness in order to save everyone you love? Another example: What if you're expected to go insane and become a tyrant in order to save the world?
By contrast, Sci-Fi builds stories around postulations. For example: What if dangerous dinosaurs could be bioengineered? Another example: What if global poverty ended because of nanotech replicators?
Some Sci-Fi is full of personal conflict, and some Fantasy is full of big ideas, but they consistently differ at the premise level. Audiences seem enchanted when a story combines a personal premise--common in Fantasy--with the machinery of Sci-Fi. "Star Wars," "Dune," and "Wool" are built that way.
Likewise, some of the most beloved Fantasy epics use a generous helping of big ideas in their premise. Fans of "The Wheel of Time" cite its magic system, which is based not on personal conflict, but rather on a postulated synergy in the way males and females think. In that respect, a healthy chunk of its premise is Sci-Fi.
I think general readers are starving for more Fantasy premises with Sci-Fi trappings, and vice versa. Space Adventure is fertile ground for such stories. It's only a matter of time before a new "Star Wars" makes a big enough splash in the public zeitgeist to open the floodgates. Horror used to be a dying genre, until Stephen King showed up. Few readers noticed Techno-thrillers before Michael Crichton. Middle Grade and Young Adult Fantasy used to lag far behind other types of Fantasy, until J.K. Rowling began her author career.
A lot of aspiring writers are excitedly working on Space Adventure novels that combine magic and technology. None have gained an astronomical fan following . . . yet. To quote from Scott Sigler's GFL series: The only variable is time.

City workers' bonuses at a record high
Senior City workers within the financial services sector are expecting an average 21% rise in their bonus payouts for this year, according to a survey by recruitment firm Astbury Marsden.
The increase would take the average bonus to £124.6k, reports the survey of 1,500 senior City staff.
According to the BBC, The European Union is introducing a new law that limits a bonus to no more than 100% of a banker's fixed salary, or twice that level with shareholder approval
Staff working in private equity expect an average bonus of £145.6k, which would be 115% of their average salary.
The survey also found that more than half of the employees who responded said they would change roles if they were not happy with the bonus they received.
Adam Jackson, a director at the firm, said: “Business conditions in the City have improved significantly over the last year,”
“Despite shareholder and public pressure to limit bonuses and with the EU bonus cap now set to be introduced at the start of 2015, City staff clearly feel that their employers are in the position to reward them well.”
Anyone in the political or public relations game knows that the best way to make a disclosure but minimize its impact is to do so on day before the long holiday weekend.
If the government had the ability to make an announcement they'd rather not make during a major holiday break, they would. And the New York Times, which does have that luxury, looks to have done precisely that with an important article on private equity fee abuses by Pulitzer Prize winning reporter Gretchen Morgenson. As we'll see shortly, this isn't one of her 1000 or so word weekly “Fair Game” columns; this is substantial piece of original reporting discussing several types of private equity fee abuses.
So why would the Grey Lady bury an important article by running it on long weekend? Oh, and worse, that has anodyne headline, “The Deal's Done. But Not the Fees,” which doesn't flag who the perps are? One has to assume that the Times isn't too keen about rocking the boat with powerful financiers, particularly since the incoming New York Times editor, Dean Baquet, who has a track record of avoiding controversial reporting. In addition, former Lehman Brothers partner and art world denizen Michael M. Thomas dates the beginning of the end of the New York Times as a journalistic institution from when Punch Sulzberger joined the board of the Metropolitan Museum. As Thomas remarked, “He needed to be dining with people he should be dining on.”
Make no bones about it, the Morgenson story, which comes on the heels of a Wall Street Journal exposing industry leader KKR's far too clever and potentially impermissible dealings with its house consulting firm, KKR Capstone, discloses important new fee abuses, including getting paid for services never rendered.
One of the things that the broader public may not realize is that the normally complacent investors in these funds, known as limited partners, have been pushing back against the fees charged to them by the private equity firms, who in industry parlance are called general partners. Thus this fee chicanery is particularly important because it reveals a concerted effort by the general partners to out-fox the limited partners and continue to extract more in rents from the limited partners than they think is warranted and thought they had agreed to pay. It's an up-market version of Elizabeth Warren's famed “tricks and traps.” . From the Morgenson story:
“In some instances, investors' pockets are being picked,” Andrew J. Bowden, director of the S.E.C.'s office of compliance inspections and examinations, said in a recent interview. “These investors may be sophisticated and they may be capable of protecting themselves, but much of what we're uncovering is undetectable by even the most sophisticated investor.”
Actually, what Bowden is suggesting is worse than Warren's objections to sneaky hidden terms in impenetrable consumer contracts. While Bowden says that the general partners are waging a successful document/deal structuring complexity war against limited partners, his “pockets are being picked” suggests the SEC is also seeing cases of flat-out embezzlement.
The public assumes that the private equity kingpins get rich by virtue of their success fees, the 20% (or more in some cases, typically after a hurdle is met) that they get when their investments show a profit. It is much less widely known that general partners charge a raft of other fees, including transaction fees (which are on top of the fees paid to investment bankers and funding sources) and monitoring fees (which are in addition to the management fees). The exhaustively researched new book Private Equity at Work by Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt explains where the general partners' income really comes from:
The conventional understanding is that general partners have earned about two-thirds of their compensation from carried interest [the upside fees] and one-third from fixed components such as fees. At some point that relationship changed. One econometric study of 144 buyout funds from 1993 to 2006 found that almost two-thirds of the revenues of PE firms came from fixed components, but this study did not show how or when the proportion of fixed-to-carry changed over this time period. (p. 254)
Why does this split matter? To the extent that private equity general partners earn their pay from sources that don't depend on the success of the investment, their incentives are not aligned with those of the limited partners. It may be no surprise that Appelbaum and Batt (consistent with other reports on the industry) find that the shift to “heads I win, tails you lose” fee components took place during a time frame when buyout returns have been declining.
Morgenson explains, as did the Wall Street Journal in its KKR story, the big way that investors have tried pushing back is to have a big chunk of all those extra fees offset against the annual management fee (the 2% of the prototypical “2 and 20” although for bigger funds, the management fee level is lower), via this graphic (click to enlarge):
But this approach of rebates caps how much the limited partners can recoup, as Morgenson notes:
There are two problems with these reimbursements. Because they can offset only the amount an investor pays in management fees, ancillary fees in excess of those payments are not shared; they are kept solely by the private equity firm. And some fund advisers have found ways to limit the amount of fees they must give back. One example involves senior advisers hired by private equity firms to help oversee acquired companies. These advisers tend to be corporate executives with experience in a particular industry who work with the acquired companies; a former hotel executive might work with a portfolio of companies in the hospitality business, for instance, to help them run more efficiently. Traditionally, these executives have been employed directly by the private equity firms, meaning that the firms, not their investors or the portfolio companies, have paid the executives' salaries, which can be substantial. In other cases, they are paid by portfolio companies, which means that the salaries may be considered a fee to be partially reimbursed to the investors. Recently, however, some private equity firms have found a way around this. Salaries of executives hired as unaffiliated contractors are not subject to reimbursements, private equity filings show, and by making these people contractors, rather than employees, firms can avoid reimbursing the investors for their costs. The private equity firms also increase profits by shifting the salary of the contractor to the payroll of portfolio companies.
This, readers may realize, is a more general version of the issue with KKR Capstone: limited partners were presented with a management team when the fund was marketed, and assumed all its members were on the payroll of the private equity firm and hence paid for out of its management fee charged. They were unaware that they'd be billed for many of them separately, by having their compensation charged against the income of portfolio companies.
Trust me, this practice is common in the industry. If you go on the website of many PE firms, you'll see people identified as “senior advisors” who are nevertheless on the “management team” page. The odds are high that many of them were presented in marketing documents as if they were private equity firm members.
Morgenson concurs with this reading and flags one example:
Silver Lake Partners is a huge Silicon Valley private equity firm with $23 billion in assets, including investments in Dell, Groupon and Virtu Financial, the high-frequency trading firm. In a 2014 filing, Silver Lake noted that when it retained “senior advisers, advisers, consultants and other similar professionals who are not employees or affiliates of the adviser,” none of those payments would be reimbursed to fund investors. Silver Lake acknowledges that this creates a conflict with its investors, “because the amounts of these fees and reimbursements may be substantial and the funds and their investors generally do not have an interest in these fees and reimbursements.” Similar language is found in regulatory filings across the industry.
Morgenson identifies an even more dubious fee practice early in her article, that of managing to get paid for services never performed. She discusses the sale of Biomet, a Warsaw, Indiana- based company sold by a Blackstone-led consortium for $13.4 billion, which included a $2 billion profit. But the carried interest and the transaction fees weren't all the general partners got out of this deal:
But for Blackstone and the other private-equity partnerships in the deal — overseen by Goldman Sachs, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and TPG Capital — this deal will be a gift that keeps giving. That's because, beyond the profits they share with their clients, they will be paid millions more in fees — for work that they are never going to do. In addition to a 20 percent share of gains from the sale, as well as management fees of 1.5 percent to 2 percent charged to investors, the private equity firms will also share in an estimated $30 million in “monitoring fees.” These fees were to be charged through 2017, but given that the deal is expected to close early next year, Blackstone, Goldman Sachs, K.K.R. and TPG will be paid for two years of services that Biomet isn't receiving.
The SEC and the media have only started peeling the many layers of the onion of private equity firm exploitation of too-trusting (and even when not that trusting, outmatched) limited partners. You'll be reading more about these abuses in the coming weeks and months. Pass the popcorn.

A representative of the FBI was grilled by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform regarding the agency's growing biometric database.
Washington D.C. – On Wednesday the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform questioned Kimberly Del Greco, Deputy Assistant Director at the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services Division, about why the bureau broke the law by failing to file a privacy impact statement acknowledging the collection of millions of Americans' faces for the agency's new biometric identification system. The FBI's Next Generation Identification (NGI) system is made up of fingerprints, iris scans, faceprints, and other facial recognition data. The NGI organizes Americans' biometric data into a single file that includes personal and biographic data like name, home address, ID number, immigration status, age, race, etc.
The Committee reports that nearly half of all adult Americans' photographs are in the database. The 2013 U.S. Census Bureau estimated that there are over 242 million adults living in the U.S. If the Committee's numbers are correct, over 121 million adults are in the FBI's database. Other revelations include that 18 states have a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the FBI to share photos with the federal government, including from state departments of motor vehicles (DMV). According to the Electronic Privacy Information Center:
The FBI also widely disseminates this NGI data. According to the FBI's latest NGI fact sheet, 24,510 local, state, tribal, federal and international partners submitted queries to NGI in September 2016.
Committee Chairman Congressman Jason Chaffetz (R- Utah) scolded Ms. Del Greco for the FBI's failures. “The failure here is years after you were supposed to make it public,” Chaffetz stated. “You were using it in real world circumstances, you were actually using it and didn't issue the statement.” Chaffetz also asked Del Greco whether the FBI had plans to gather faceprints via social media. “Are you collecting that information that is available on social media?,” the chairman demanded. “We do not have any other photos in our repository.”
Alvaro Bedoya, Executive Director, Center on Privacy and Technology Georgetown Law, questioned the FBI's claim, stating that the bureau has access to driver's license photos. “We have access to that data but we do not use it,” Del Greco answered. Jennifer Lynch, Senior Staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation also stated that the FBI has access to “civil photos” in the NGI database.

Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-MI) also questioned Del Greco regarding the FBI's activities. “I think the issue goes beyond the First Amendment concerns that were expressed. . .and is broader,” Mitchell stated during the panel. “I don't want to just protect someone if they're in a political protest from being identified, the reality is we should protect everybody unless there is a valid documented criminal justice action. Why should my photo. . .be subject because I get a driver's license, to access?” Rep. John Duncan (R-TN) expressed similar fear regarding the possibility that the expectation of privacy is quickly fading. Duncan worried that Americans looking at the information, “would wonder if were ending up in a federal police state that's gotten totally out of control, and has far too much power.”
Duncan is not far off. The databases include photos those of people who aren't suspected of any criminal activity that come from driver's license and passport and visa photos. Other issues with the FBI database include misidentifying females and blacks at a higher rate. The FBI is currently facing a lawsuit from EPIC regarding the database. EPIC is asking a judge to force the FBI to release records about its plan to share the biometric data with the U.S. Department of Defense. EPIC filed Freedom of Information Act request in 2015, but the FBI has so far refused to release the 35 pages of responsive records.
EPIC and privacy advocates are concerned about the potential for cases of mistaken identity and abuse of the collected data. EPIC also argues “the FBI stated that ‘[i]ncreased collection and retention of personally identifiable information presents a correspondingly increased risk that the FBI will then be maintaining more information that might potentially be subject to loss or unauthorized use.”
In 2014, the EFF received documents from the FBI related to the NGI system. At the time the FBI estimated the facial recognition component of NGI would include as many as 52 million face images by 2015. The Committee's hearing on Wednesday indicated that number was more than double as of 2017. The danger of abuse from facial recognition programs is on the rise. Activist Post recently highlighted a new report from Georgetown Law University's Center for Privacy and Technology that details how law enforcement is using facial recognition software without the knowledge or consent of the people. The report, “The Perpetual Line-Up: Unregulated Police Face Recognition in America,” examines several cases of misuse or abuse of facial recognition technology.
How can we protect our privacy in a world that is quickly becoming a digitally interconnected panopticon of audio recording devices, faceprint collection machines, and cameras from every direction? The answer is not simple. Most of us live our lives with these devices and use them for several hours each day. When we are staring into our phones to send text messages, the camera is potentially stealing our faceprint and sending it to your cell phone provider and/or law enforcement. We are giving away our privacy for convenience, luxury, and entertainment. How can we stop the fast march to a total surveillance state? Perhaps abandoning all technology and living off the land. Short of that, we need to take measures to encrypt our communication and practice a culture of security.
Atlético Madrid winning La Liga last weekend has been great endorsement for the Spanish game. “Los Colchoneros” well deserved league title has provided a welcome respite desperately needed in Spain, breaking the long standing duopoly that Barça and Madrid have monotonously commanded at the top of the Spanish league table.
However, for anyone looking for the real fairy-tale story of Spanish football this season, it's still currently being played-out in the Basque town of Eibar.
Situated in a valley off the main AP-8 motorway that connects major Basque cities, Bilbao and San Sebastián, the town of just 27.500 inhabitants (the smallest population for any catchment area with a professional football team in Spain's top two divisions) has played host to SD Eibar since their formation in 1940.
During their history the club has won no major titles or cups; their only dubious honour is being that of the team with the longest continuous run in Spain's second tier, running 18 years from season 1988-99 through to 2005-06. They also developed a reputation as Spanish Cup “giant-killers” with their last scalp being local rivals Athletic Bilbao in 2012.
The club's only other claim to fame is that of having World Cup winners Xabi Alonso and David Silva in their list of ex-Eibar players when they played for “Los Armeros” at their compact 5,250 capacity Ipurúa stadium at the beginning of the century.
The club returned to the Spanish second division this season but with the lowest budget in the league and were tipped as clear favourites to make a swift return to the depths of 2B again.
This incredibly hasn't happened. With three games remaining in the league campaign they sit in second place, in an automatic promotion position to Spain's top flight behind a Deportivo la Coruña side with a budget seven times that of Eibar's.
What's more, Eibar are one of those few teams in Spain who are financially sound. They have no debts, pay their players on time and have a solid economic model that even head of the Spanish league governing body (LFP) Javier Tebas has commented on positively.
Eibar hold a four point advantage on nearest rivals Las Palmas and have two home games remaining (against relegation threatened Alavés and mid-table Lugo) and an away trip to Numancia. Everything seems to be set for this fantastic “Cinderella” footballing story to have a happy ending and illustrate that, just occasionally footballing success can indeed be accomplished in an age when the economics of the game dictate that, achievement on the pitch is directly proportionate to investment and financial muscle off the pitch.
Sadly this where the fairytale ends. Eibar need to come up with €1.7 million by August 6th otherwise they face an administrative demotion back to 2B.
A law passed in 1999, decreed that: Every team has to have capital equal to 25% of the average expenses of all the teams in the Second Division, excluding the two clubs with the biggest outgoings and the two clubs with the smallest outgoings in the division.
Eibar don't have this kind of capital and face being punished for being financially sound when their rivals, whilst having bigger budgets the majority of these clubs also have bigger debts.
Faced with this situation and with the possibility of a historic promotion being taken away from them the club has responded with an engaging campaign: “Defiende Al Eibar” / Defend Eibar, designed to raise capital via a share option. Shares can be bought via the club at €50 per share, with certificates to be issued to shareholders in September 2014.
There is also talk of a commemorative plaque to feature the names of all new shareholders and new “Defenders of Eibar” at Ipurúa.
This week Eibar's club president Alex Aranzabal, flanked by Xabi Alonso and Aiser Illaramendi amongst others, made a plea to the football world in Madrid to support the campaign. He also flatly rejected the proposal that the club could be sold to outside investment by capping shares. “We´d rather take the punishment and get demoted rather than share the soul of what SD Eibar is as a football club” he told journalists at a packed press conference.
Why do I care? Why am I taking the time to write this article?
I saw my team (Rayo Vallecano) play at Eibar back in the play-off final in 2006. Rayo lost and Eibar were promoted. The Eibar fans were magnanimous in victory and took time to commiserate with the travelling fans who made the trek north.
What did make an impact on me was how visibly clear the importance and role the football team played in this small town.
Every balcony was adorned with club colours, every shop, bar and cafe had posters wishing the team well. The football team and its fortunes visibly mattered to the people of Eibar.
Seeing a small but well run club like Eibar overachieve, make history and get promoted and then face the possibility of having that promotion unfairly removed should matter to all football fans!
Please do what you can.

White House counselor John Podesta said Monday that attempts by congressional lawmakers to block the Obama administration's climate action plan will fail.
Podesta told reporters during a briefing at the White House that President Obama is committed to moving forward with controversial Clean Air Act regulations to cut carbon dioxide emissions for all new coal and gas-fired power plants.
"So they may try, but I think that there are no takers at this end of Pennsylvania Avenue. And I think -- with respect to the commitment of Democrats to support a cleaner energy future, I think there's a strong sentiment there," Podesta said.
Republicans have branded the president's climate plan as a "war on coal" and have sponsored legislation to roll back planned Environmental Protection Agency greenhouse gas standards they argue will harm the nation's economy.
"They'll find various ways, particularly in the House, to try to stop us from using the authority we have under the Clean Air Act. All I would say is that those have zero percent chance of working. We're committed to moving forward with those rules," Podesta said.
He cited an energy efficiency bill sponsored by Sens. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., as an example of bipartisan support for clean energy.
Some Republicans want to add an amendment to the bill approving the Keystone XL pipeline, leaving Obama with a more complicated choice, since large numbers of lawmakers in both parties are likely to favor the broader measure.
"We hope that it passes," Podesta said of the legislation. "But if it passes with unacceptable riders, then it will be headed to the watery depths, I guess."
Meanwhile, the Obama administration will argue in a report to be released Tuesday that global warming is changing Americans' daily lives and will worsen, according to study co-author Donald Wuebbles, a climate scientist at the University of Illinois.
"We're already seeing extreme weather and it's happening now," Wuebbles told The Associated Press on Monday. "We're seeing more heat waves, particularly in the West and in the South."
This final report is a rewritten and shortened version of a draft that was released in January 2013, with more scientific references, reviews by experts and the public, and a thorough review by the National Academy of Sciences, said Wuebbles and report lead author Gary Yohe of Wesleyan University in Connecticut. There is even stronger evidence than in 2013, Yohe said.
The draft came out just as meteorologists calculated that 2012 was the hottest year on record for the United States, but last year was slightly cooler than the 20th century average. And in the time since the draft report was released, the United States has seen lots of extremes.
And since the draft was released, there's been a dramatic new extreme that a good part of the country is worrying about: The drought in California, where a few rural places are in danger of running out of water.
In January 2013, none of California was in either extreme or exceptional drought; now nearly 77 percent of the state is. It is too early to point directly at the near-record California drought as another sign of global warming, but it fits the pattern, Yohe and Wuebbles said.
The Obama administration will likely use the 840-page report as scientific justification to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gas from the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil and to encourage local communities to adapt to changes in the climate.
Podesta called it "the most authoritative and comprehensive source of scientific information" on how climate change will hit all parts of the nation and the economy.
"Hundreds of the best climate scientists from across the U.S., not just in the public sector but in the private sector as well, have worked over the last four years to produce this report," Podesta said at Monday's briefing. "This assessment is about presenting actionable science."
Republican lawmakers have criticized the move as alarmist.
"This report is part of the game the president is playing to distract Americans from his unchecked regulatory agenda that is costing our nation middle-class jobs, new economic opportunities and our ability to be energy independent," Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., told The Wall Street Journal.
Also Tuesday, Obama will speak with TV meteorologists to reassure environmental leaders who have urged more aggressive action on climate change, The Journal reported.
The Associated Press contributed to this report.
OK, die-hard Auburn fan. Give me all your excuses for another offensive dumpster fire against Clemson. You have 10 seconds. Go.
It was one game, an early game, a game that doesn't count in the SEC standings, a game against the reigning national champions in their house. Kam Pettway has a bad heel, Kerryon Johnson was out, Jarrett Stidham is still rusty. We can still win the SEC!
Time's up for you, and the clock's ticking on Gus Malzahn.
If Clemson 14, Auburn 6 was merely one ugly outing on the road against a great team, with a new Malzahn low of 117 total yards, it would be understandable. It would be easier to believe Malzahn's postgame vow: "We're going to be a good offense before this is all said and done. I promise you that."
The trouble is, this debacle just adds to the growing mountain of evidence that, against the better teams on the schedule, Malzahn has lost his way on the side of the ball where he made his name.
Consider some of these not-so-fun facts:
This is the third time in the last six games that Auburn has produced fewer than 200 total yards. This is the seventh time in the last 15 games that Auburn has produced fewer than 20 points.
Since the start of the 2016 season, Auburn has lost games in which Kevin Steele's defense has held opponents to 19, 13 and 14 points.
In Malzahn's first two years as head coach in 2013 and 2014, Auburn won games in which its defense, before Steele arrived, allowed 41, 38, 42, 35 and 31 points.
Auburn has produced 30 or more points against a ranked team only once since the start of the 2015 season. That came in last year's 56-3 destruction of then-No. 17 Arkansas.
In Malzahn's first two seasons as head coach, Auburn scored 30 or more points against ranked teams 10 times.
As good as Clemson's defense has become, it's not as if Brent Venables unit has shut down everyone in its path. Last year, Clemson held Auburn to 262 yards in a 19-13 Clemson victory. Eight of Clemson's other opponents put up more yards than Auburn did and seven put up more points.
In this year's opener, Clemson beat Kent State 56-3. The Golden Flashes had 120 yards of offense - or 3 more than Auburn did in Death Valley.
So, yes, there's no doubt, have faith that Auburn will have a good offense this season - against the likes of Mercer and Missouri. But what happens when the Tigers meet LSU in the other Death Valley or Georgia and Alabama in Jordan-Hare Stadium?
The good news for the Tigers: It's a long way from here to there.
The bad news: It's been a long time since the Auburn offense made noise against a defense with a pulse.
Why will the rest of this season be any different?
Over the weekend, Guests reported some mysterious white tents in Magic Kingdom Park situated in an out-of-the-way area of Tomorrowland near Space Mountain. More details on these “cabanas” have since surfaced and we thought we'd share the details with you.
It appears as though Disney is testing another premium option as a spin-off of cabana rentals at some of the Disney Resorts and Castaway Cay, Disney's private island in the Caribbean. It has also been reported that if testing goes well, the “tents” will be replaced by something more permanent as the photo below shows what they currently look like in the Park.
These cabanas will be available to rent for the hefty price of $649 per day. The cabana will accommodate up to eight guests, and will include private and shaded seating, cold beverages, snacks and reserved viewing for parades and fireworks. Admission to the Magic Kingdom is not included in the price.
Booking for these cabanas begins today for 11/27/16 and beyond and can be made by calling (407) WDW-PLAY or visiting a Concierge desk at a Walt Disney World Resort hotel.
What are your thoughts on this new premium option? Love it? Hate it? Let us know in the comments below!

Players will be given a maximum 10 day "cooling-off period" for any contract they sign under a new rule proposed by the NRL.
Head of Football, Todd Greenberg said the current rule, that was introduced to allow clubs until round 13 to retain players who have signed with a rival club, will be scrapped.
Instead, a contract signed with a rival club will be registered once a 10 business day cooling-off period expires.
Mr Greenberg said fans and clubs were frustrated with the "round 13" rule because it can create uncertainty and speculation for a long time after a contract has been signed.
"I think everyone agrees it is unseemly to have months of speculation about whether a player is going to a rival club," he said.
"Our view is a 10 day cooling-off period is an acceptable solution for all involved."
The introduction of the new rule is subject to further consultation and approval from the Rugby League Players Association.
If approved, it will stipulate that:
• A player may sign an extension of his contract with his existing club at any time
• A player may sign with a new club only during the final year of his contract
• A 10 business day cooling-off period will apply to all contracts
• A club signing a player is prohibited from making an announcement until the cooling-off period has expired
Mr Greenberg stressed that the proposed new rule will be an interim measure pending the outcome of Shane Richardson's "whole of game" review.
The right-wing British politician who helped persuade Britain to vote to leave the European Union has claimed Donald Trump's sweeping victory in the U.S. presidential election as the latest result of a populist wave that is set to upturn the political order in Europe in 2017.
“Brexit was the first brick that was knocked out of the establishment wall. A lot more were knocked out last night,” Nigel Farage, the interim leader of the U.K. Independence Party, told TIME on Wednesday. “This is Brexit times three. It is a bigger country, it is a bigger position, it is a bigger event.”
The potent mixture of antielitism and nativism that drove “Brexit” was effectively harnessed by Trump to tap into the discontent of millions of Americans who felt left behind by globalization and the establishment. “Brexit is a story that had so many parallels with what happened in the U.S.” says Farage in a telephone interview from the U.S, where he flew after the results emerged. “And it is something, very wisely, that Team Trump cottoned on to very early.” The former investment banker was even invited to give a speech alongside the Republican on Aug. 25 at a Jackson, Miss., rally.
Now, populist parties in Europe — which include Italy's Five-Star Movement and Marine Le Pen's National Front in France — stand ready to continue the fight, says Farage. “I don't think it is finished yet, I think this phenomenon is set to sweep other parts of Europe over the course of a couple years.”

“Hungary is now is basically giving two fingers up to Brussels,” he continues, of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's attempt to reject the E.U.'s plan to relocate refugees. “You get much the same language in Slovakia, in Poland and the Czech Republic.”
Farage was one of the central figures in Britain's campaign to leave the E.U. in the June 23 referendum. He led the fight for Britain to “take back control” of immigration, its laws and the perceived control of U.K.'s national sovereignty by the E.U. Like Trump, the campaign came under fire for its divergence from facts, xenophobic messaging and dog-whistle racism, recriminations that didn't stop 17 million Britons from voting to leave the European bloc.
The UKIP politician — a lawmaker in the European Parliament — says he was initially drawn to Trump for his views on small government and border control. “Donald Trump believes in nation-state democracy, Hillary Clinton used the E.U. as a prototype for a larger global union, Donald Trump believes in sensible immigration controls … [and] recognizes the threat posed by Islamic terrorism; Hillary Clinton can't even bring herself to use the words, Donald Trump believes in helping small and medium-sized business by relieving the regulatory burden, things like this just aren't even on the agenda on the people who want global government like Hillary Clinton.”
The 52-year-old also praises the President-elect's approach to foreign policy, even though Trump has been criticized for refusing to commit to defending NATO allies. He's a pragmatist rather than an isolationist, and will not lead the nation into foreign misadventures like some of his predecessors, says Farage. “Saying you don't want to enter every potential war in the Middle East doesn't make you an isolationist, it makes you wise,” he says.
Where Brexit differs from the policy proposals of America's 45th President, he says, is the issue of trade protectionism: Trump wants more while Britain is desperate to forge new trade deals with other countries after it leaves the E.U. But the special relationship is strong, Farage says. “The only positive trade comment he has made is about the U.K,” he says. “He has said we would be at the front of the queue.”
“One of the good things from a U.K. perspective is we now have an American President who likes our country rather than Obama and Clinton, who look down on us and sneer at us.”
Farage feels personally responsible for this Western, nationalist movement— which he calls “nation-states democracy.” He plans to embark on a tour of Europe in 2017 to continue preaching the gospel of Brexit. “This is the extraordinary thing, those who of us who have these points of view are treated by the establishment as being so disreputable what we shouldn't even exist,” he says. “I think it is too late now. The genie is now completely out of the bottle.”

It wasn't just Exxon that knew fossil fuels were cooking the planet.
New investigative reporting by Neela Banerjee with Inside Climate News revealed on Tuesday that scientists and engineers from nearly every major U.S. and multinational oil and gas company may have for decades known about the impacts of carbon emissions on the climate.
Between 1979 and 1983, the American Petroleum Institute (API), the industry's most powerful lobby group, ran a task force for fossil fuel companies to "monitor and share climate research," according to internal documents obtained by Inside Climate News.
According to the reporting:
Like Exxon, the companies also expressed a willingness to understand the links between their product, greater CO2 concentrations and the climate, the papers reveal. Some corporations ran their own research units as well, although they were smaller and less ambitious than Exxon's and focused on climate modeling, said James J. Nelson, the former director of the task force. "It was a fact-finding task force," Nelson said in an interview. "We wanted to look at emerging science, the implications of it and where improvements could be made, if possible, to reduce emissions."
The 'CO2 and Climate Task Force,' which changed in 1980 its name to the 'Climate and Energy Task Force,' included researchers from Exxon, Mobil, Chevron, Amoco, Phillips, Texaco, Shell, Sunoco, and Sohio, among others.
One memo by an Exxon task force representative pointed to 1979 "background paper on CO2," which "predicted when the first clear effects of climate change might be felt," noting that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was rising steadily.
And at a February 1980 meeting in New York, the task force invited Professor John A. Laurmann of Stanford University to brief members about climate science.

"In his conclusions section, Laurmann estimated that the amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere would double in 2038, which he said would likely lead to a 2.5 degrees Celsius rise in global average temperatures with 'major economic consequences,'" Banerjee reports. He then told the task force that models showed a 5 degrees Celsius rise by 2067, with 'globally catastrophic effects,'" Banerjee reports.
The documents show that API members, at one point, considered an alternative path in the face of these dire predictions:
Bruce S. Bailey of Texaco offered "for consideration" the idea that "an overall goal of the Task Force should be to help develop ground rules for energy release of fuels and the cleanup of fuels as they relate to CO2 creation," according to the minutes of a meeting on Feb. 29, 1980. The minutes also show that the task force discussed a "potential area" for research and development that called for it to "'Investigate the Market Penetration Requirements of Introducing a New Energy Source into World Wide Use.' This would include the technical implications of energy source changeover, research timing and requirements."
"Yet," Banerjee notes, "by the 1990s, it was clear that API had opted for a markedly different approach to the threat of climate change."
The lobby group teamed up with Exxon and others to form the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), which successfully lobbied the U.S. to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol.
The damning revelations are the latest in an ongoing investigation into what the fossil fuel industry knew about climate change and then suppressed for decades —all while continuing to profit from the planet's destruction.
Reports that Exxon, specifically, lied about climate change were published early October in the Los Angeles Times, mirroring a separate but similar investigation by Inside Climate News in September. Those findings set off a storm of outrage, including a probe by the New York Attorney General.
Nelson, a former head of the API task force, told Banerjee that with the growing powers of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the early 1980's, API decided to shift gears.
"They took the environmental unit and put it into the political department, which was primarily lobbyists," he said. "They weren't focused on doing research or on improving the oil industry's impact on pollution. They were less interested in pushing the envelope of science and more interested in how to make it more advantageous politically or economically for the oil industry. That's not meant as a criticism. It's just a fact of life."
The Supreme Court yesterday delivered an important but substantially mitigated victory to advocates of individual rights by throwing out the ObamaCare requirement that business owners pay for health insurance when doing so violates their religious convictions. At issue in the case, Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, was whether the federal government could force businesses to provide health insurance that covers forms of birth control that may act as an abortifacient. The Court decided 5–4 in favor of Hobby Lobby.
Some of the good is that the Court not only explicitly defended “religious liberty,” it did so explicitly on behalf of for-profit business owners:
When rights, whether constitutional or statutory, are extended to corporations, the purpose is to protect the rights of these people [associated with a corporation]. For example, extending Fourth Amendment protection to corporations protects the privacy interests of employees and others associated with the company. Protecting corporations from government seizure of their property without just compensation protects all those who have a stake in the corporations' financial well-being. And protecting the free-exercise rights of corporations like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel protects the religious liberty of the humans who own and control those companies.
The decision, along with important aspects of the reasoning behind it, deserves high praise. However, the reasoning behind the decision does not actually uphold the principle of individual rights and the propriety of freedom of conscience. The problems on these counts include the following:
Rather than reject the ObamaCare mandate based on the clear language of the First Amendment, which states that “Congress shall make no law . . . prohibiting the free exercise” of religion, the Court based its decision on the language of the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The Court's decision thus implies that if, in the future, Congress decides that it no longer wants to protect religious freedom, it can simply alter the statutes.
The Court based its decision on its finding that the ObamaCare mandate was not “the least restrictive means of furthering [a] compelling governmental interest.” But the notion that “governmental interests” properly can trump individual rights is alien to the spirit of the Declaration of Independence and of the Constitution, and it is antithetical to the principle of individual rights.
By creating an exception to the mandate on grounds of religious liberty rather than on the grounds of the propriety of freedom of conscience, the Court failed to protect the rights of those who may not want to offer the type of insurance in question for rational reasons—such as that insuring such things as birth control is economically senseless or that individuals and businesses have a reason-based right to decide for themselves how they will or will not spend their money. People of reason, no less than people of faith, have a moral right to run their businesses as they see fit and to contract freely with others. The Court effectively ruled that those who base their decisions on faith—that is, on acceptance of ideas in support of which there is no evidence—may decide what insurance to offer, but that those who base their decisions on reason and evidence may not. This is the worst, most fundamentally flawed aspect of the decision.
Despite such significant problems, though, the Court's ruling is a much-needed strike against government-controlled health care and for individual rights. On balance, given the expansion of illegitimate government programs in recent decades, this is a decision to celebrate.

Single-payer health coverage is back in the news these days. But what is it, anyway? Here's a very brief primer on the five basic forms of health insurance:
Socialist: The government owns the hospitals and directly employs the doctors. Britain's NHS is the best known example. In the United States, VA health care works on this model.
The government owns the hospitals and directly employs the doctors. Britain's NHS is the best known example. In the United States, VA health care works on this model. Single-payer: Doctors and hospitals are mostly private entities, but are paid exclusively by the government. Canada is single-payer, with each province acting as the sole source of payment to doctors and hospitals. In the US, Medicaid and traditional Medicare are single-payer.
Doctors and hospitals are mostly private entities, but are paid exclusively by the government. Canada is single-payer, with each province acting as the sole source of payment to doctors and hospitals. In the US, Medicaid and traditional Medicare are single-payer. Multi-payer: Same as single-payer, but doctors and hospitals are paid by multiple sources: the government, regulated sickness funds, regulated insurers, etc. There's a continuum in multi-payer systems, from those that are almost single payer (France) to those where other payers play larger roles (Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, etc.). This is the most common form of universal health care, and its advantage over single-payer is that it offers a little more flexibility in coverage. In the US, Medicare Advantage is basically multi-payer.

Switzerland uses this system. In the US, this is the Obamacare model.

Private: In the rich world, this is used only in the United States. Employer health care in America is essentially entirely private, although government is involved indirectly via the tax code, which allows employees to receive health coverage free of taxes.
All of these except the last are universal health care systems. They differ only in how they deliver services and pay for them, and they can all work well. France, often cited as the best health care system in the world, is technically multi-payer, but really only a hair's breadth away from single payer. In practice, this is a semantic distinction for most of us, since there's usually little difference between universal single-payer and universal multi-payer. Because of that, in America we tend to refer to all universal systems as single-payer.
None of these systems cover literally every dime of health care coverage. Canada, for example, is single-payer but doesn't cover all prescription drugs. Different provinces have different rules. In most countries, it's possible to purchase supplementary insurance to cover the gaps in the national system, something that's necessary because they all have various copays and exceptions:
You can put all this together to get a single number that represents how generous a national health care system is. For example, Switzerland covers about 65 percent of all medical costs. Canada covers about 70 percent. France covers about 78 percent. Medicare in the US covers about 80 percent. Denmark and Germany are the most generous, covering about 84 percent.
UPDATE: I originally used the wrong OECD table above. The correct one for our purposes is the table for “basic” care provided by tax-funded health coverage or compulsory social health insurance. The more expansive table, which I used initially, includes coverage from supplementary policies purchased by individuals. Sorry.
Gary Oldman: quite possibly the finest actor of his generation. A charismatic force of nature, capable of blazing through the screen as a central villain (like killer cop Norman Stansfield in Leon), or even in relatively small roles, like the bizarre Drexl Spivey in True Romance. Then there are the stunning character portrayals, like Sid Vicious in Sid & Nancy, or Beethoven in Immortal Beloved, or the troubled Jackie Flannery in the little-seen but wonderful State Of Grace.
Typecast for a time, at least in Hollywood, as the go-to villain type - see Air Force One, The Fifth Element or Lost In Space to name three - Oldman has since, as he puts it, "turned the ship around", and has more recently starred as Sirius Black in Harry Potter, Jim Gordon in the Dark Knight trilogy, and British spy George Smiley in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.
Most recently, he's appeared in RoboCop, playing the conflicted science genius Dennett Norton in Jose Padilha's remake. The sci-fi scientist is the kind of genre staple we've all seen a legion times, and Oldman could easily have sleepwalked through it, cashed the paycheque and moved on. But as ever, he didn't; as he did with Jim Gordon, or Sirius Black, or even Rolfe in the critically-panned Tiptoes, Oldman brings something special to the character - there's the sense that some sort of emotional war is playing out behind his eyes.
Given just how intense Gary Oldman is capable of being on screen, we were nervously wondering what he'd be like in person. Yet the Oldman we sat down with in a London hotel one rainy afternoon couldn't be different from most of the characters he's played; if he's like anyone, he's like Jim Gordon on a day off. He sits well down on a comfy sofa, relaxed, and speaks in a gentle, quiet voice that phases melodically from a London accent (he was born in New Cross) to American (he now lives in California) with an occasional hint of Royal Shakespeare Company-trained luviness sprinkled on top.
Taking time to answer each question, and pausing as if to make sure he has every statement exactly right, he's the very definition of reserve. And while we dearly wish we had more time to talk about some of his other stunning performances and career moments (say, an entire afternoon rather than a dozen minutes), what he has to say about the new RoboCop, Paul Verhoeven's classic original, politics, and refusing to play the villain in Batman Begins makes for some fascinating reading.
Were you familiar with the original RoboCop movie before you signed on for this one?
You know, it's always interesting when you've got someone like Paul Verhoeven, who's a maverick kind of outsider, who comes in and tinkers with Hollywood or pop culture. That's what fascinates me with this remake - you've got someone [like Jose Padilha] who first and foremost is a physicist, a brilliant guy, a documentarian, a Brazilian, doing RoboCop.
And I always think it's fascination when you have people like this doing genre films. You've got Alfonso Cuaron doing Harry Potter, Tomas Alfredson doing Tinker Tailor - they give it their own... spice. It has an edge to it.
Do you feel the themes in the script chime with your own world view? Because it has quite a dystopian view of the present in the way it relates to current events.
Yeah. It's as if we've... with the original, it was a kind of fantasy about a future, that as you watch it as a viewer, it's sci-fi. This one, I think you watch it and it's science fact - you watch it and it looks recognisable. I think the debate of security and safety versus liberty, and how, in the name of security, liberty has been encroached upon... drones is a big argument at the moment, and how they're saying troops on the ground will be robotic troops at some point.
Freedom of choice. The cynicism of the media. He's sort of touched on all of this. And in many ways, there's also the question of the soul versus machine - is it morally and ethically right? Just because you can do it, should you do it? All those questions are important. It's a political film wrapped up in a [sci-fi story].
I mean, if this was a political movie, but Paul Greengrass was doing it, it would hold up, wouldn't it? So it's got a lot going for it.
Do you think it holds up against the first one?
I think it dares to be its own thing. It does similar things to the original, because that looked at how the media represented real-world events, and the role of the police, corporations - as a corporate satire, it was really brilliant. The remake explores those themes in a different, modern way.
Yeah. I like the touch of the inside marketing. "Let's make him look like a Transformer - the kids want him to look like a Transformer. What do you think? Shall we go for the silver suit or the black suit?" Even the candidates!
It's a PR campaign, essentially, isn't it? He's a puppet.
Yeah, yeah. That idea of, "No, I'm going to give them a man inside a machine. That's what the public wants." And the more you find out, the more... I live in America at the moment, in California. But you look at American politics at the moment, and it's one mess after another, one scandal after another. I mean, it's falling around him. The empire is crumbling.
You mean it's crumbling around Barack Obama?
Right, yeah. And you've got footage of him speaking in 2008 and 2009 talking about Bush, and how against the Executive Order he is, and how everything was going to be transparent, and now he's doing the same thing but on steroids. It's Bush on steroids.
I saw the movie - I've only seen this version of RoboCop once - but I thought, "My God, this is the world we're living in." I could turn on the regular TV and see this.
On the news just now, I saw Britain's top-secret drone aircraft being unveiled on the BBC.
Really?
Yes. Quite a coincidence, given the premise of the film.
Yeah. And we're going to have drones delivering things. [Laughs]
So when it comes to the roles you've taken - and I mean all of them - you always bring something else. In RoboCop, he isn't just a stock sci-fi scientist, though he could easily have been.
Jim Gordon could have been a stoic cop, but he was so much more. So what's your process for bringing the nuances to those characters?
Well, it was almost there on the page. And then we were very fortunate to have rehearsals, and we sat around with the script and the other actors and Jose, and we weeded out all those things that are what I call "Stupid people doing stupid things." Because it's a certain type of genre, filmmakers think they have the license to just insult you, you know? And you sit there watching these movies and rolling your eyes, thinking, "Oh come on, how could that happen", or, "That's ridiculous."
And I think what Jose wanted to do was weed out all those moments and make it as smart as it could possibly be. Then we talked about who Norton [Oldman's character] was, and how he underestimates Sellars [Michael Keaton's OmniCorp CEO]. He's in a situation where he's working for a company that he knows has a military aspect to it. He's in the research department, he's the head of the research department, which is very much experimentation. And he tries something and it doesn't work, so he goes back to the drawing board, and he doesn't have a clock.
Then he's reluctantly taken into this project with the promise of unlimited funding. And he's flattered - that's one of his weaknesses, his vanity. So he goes on board, and he's in this hideous cut-throat corporate world, where it's all about release dates and deadlines. And he's up against the wall. He's challenged, ethically.
My thing is, what's he going to do? He forms a relationship with this man [Alex Murphy], who trusts him. Is he going to walk away and let someone else come in who doesn't have that relationship and doesn't really care? Or does he stay and give him a little tweak?
I'm not sure whether in the script the end's the same, but we wanted Norton to ultimately take responsibility, and that redeems him. And in a world where nobody wants to take responsibility for anything, that makes him unique in my book.
In Hollywood, things seem to have changed a great deal over the last 10 years. In the 80s and 90s perhaps, British actors or European actors tended to be cast as villains, certainly in mainstream films. Whereas now you can have a British Batman, a British Superman, a British Spider-Man. What's changed?
Well I think what happens is a trend. And someone starts the trend, and it's so blinkered that they go, "Oh yeah, now it's this," and off they go.
I got typecast as a villain, the bad guy, and I wanted to turn that around. Slowly, slowly, I turned that ship around, but you're at the mercy of the imagination of who's casting you. And Chris Nolan came to me with a villain, and I said, "I don't want to play the villain." I think it was [suggests scary mask over face, with hands].
The Scarecrow?
Yeah, maybe. I said I wasn't interested. I said, "What about Commissioner Gordon?" And to his credit, he thought about it, came back and said yes. Now, Chris auditioned people for Batman, and there are qualities you have to have, and you have to have a good jaw. You've got to look good in that suit as well. So he cast, he auditioned, liked Christian [Bale], called him back, did another test to be sure, and cast him as Batman. And that caused a whole trend, like dominoes. I think it takes one person with imagination like Nolan.
Gary Oldman, thank you very much.

OTTAWA — A Russian bank hired John Baird's onetime provincial chief of staff to lobby the federal government to get the bank removed from the list of Russian firms facing sanctions over Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine.
The then-Foreign Affairs Minister subsequently removed the bank from the list, but he and the lobbyist both say they never spoke about the matter. Meanwhile, ExpoBank LLC's representatives say that it was only added to the list as a result of mistaken identity.
Expobank was added to the list April 28, 2014. A month later, lobbyist Will Stewart registered with the commissioner of lobbying “for the purpose of making an application to remove ExpoBank from the Schedule to the Special Economic Measures (Russia) Regulations.”
Mr. Stewart was chief of staff when Mr. Baird served in the Ontario government. He was media director last year for the campaign of Ontario Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak, and is a good friend of Mr. Baird's.
NDP foreign affairs critic Paul Dewar said he would like a better explanation from the government of how it came to list then delist ExpoBank.
“What we need to find out is how this happened,” he said in an interview. “When we find out that there was a lobbyist who had been working for Minister Baird, representing the company in question — we were under the impression that this was a sanction that was not relevant — but it is interesting and worthy of explanation.”
In an interview last week, Mr. Stewart said he didn't lobby anyone on the file. His firm, Ensight Canada, was hired by the law firm McCarthy Tétrault to provide “political intelligence.”
“We provide them with who's who in Canada in terms of politics, how the system works, who the important people are, that type of thing,” he said.
Mr. Stewart said that he and Mr. Baird have been friends since the days when he worked for Mr. Baird in Queen's Park, so he doesn't lobby him.
“I don't lobby Baird, period, full stop,” he said. “For this exact reason. I don't need anybody suggesting he's done anything wrong or I've done anything wrong based on our past relationship.”
In an emailed statement, Mr. Baird said he didn't know his friend was on the file.
“In no way, shape or form did I know Mr. Stewart was representing this bank, and no representations were made to me on this file by Mr. Stewart,” he said. “The delisting was recommended by departmental officials after their review, and I accepted that advice.”
A month after Mr. Stewart registered on the file, John Boscariol, a lawyer with McCarthy Tétrault who often works on disputes over sanctions, registered to lobby on the file.
He and Mr. Stewart both say that lawyers guided the formal appeal process, ultimately convincing departmental officials that the firm had been added to the list in error. Mr. Baird delisted ExpoBank in Sept. 18, along with another Russian bank: Rosenergobank.
“The evidence was so clear is this case the government couldn't sustain keeping ExpoBank on the list,” said Mr. Boscariol in an interview Tuesday.

Rachael Ray‘s 5th annual Burger Bash at the South Beach Food and Wine Festival took place last week and the only three words we can say are “Too Much Cow.”
Thank goodness Ray is vegetarian friendly and often includes veg recipes on her Food Network shows.
Her vegetarian chickpea burger is one such meat-free recipe, but this chef realizes that although nothing beats a handmade veggie burger where you can witness the culmination of oats, beans, veggies and other plant goodies come together, sometimes it's nice to have a frozen or otherwise prepared patty to nuke in the microwave.
That's why she conducted the veggie burger taste test. You could call it the sans animal flesh version of her burger bash.
The following vegetarian and vegan burgers with judged best in their category.
Best Veggie Medley: Lightlife Light Burgers-Veggie
Best Mushroom: Gardenburger Portabella
Best Original: Amy's All American Veggie Burger
Best Flavored: Boca Cheeseburger
Best Black Bean: Morningstar Farms Spicy Black Bean Veggie Burger
For more information on why these were top of the line, visit here.
The chickpea burgers are easily veganized by substituting the one egg for an egg replacement, such as Ener-G and using vegan cheddar cheese on top, or leaving the patties bare.
Ray also says you can make these spicier by adding ground cumin, curry pepper or cayenne pepper to the mix.
Have your own veggie burger bash by giving Ray's prepared veggie burger recommendations a try. Don't forget to add these chickpea patties to the taste test.

In the midst of profound turbulence in the negotiations between Greece and its international lenders, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras flew to Moscow last week for an official visit to President Vladimir Putin. This meeting, portrayed by many commentators as a bargaining chip with its European creditors, was officially intended to improve the bilateral relations between the two countries in various economic sectors.
In the midst of profound turbulence in the negotiations between Greece and its international lenders, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras flew to Moscow last week for an official visit to President Vladimir Putin. This meeting, portrayed by many commentators as a bargaining chip with its European creditors, was officially intended to improve bilateral relations between the two countries in various economic sectors. Greece had high expectations from this meeting, in terms of financial assistance, potential gas discounts and a lift of the Russian ban on the food imports from Greece.
However, during the press conference that followed the meeting it emerged that Russia had something else to offer to Greece: strong cooperation on natural gas projects. This prospect was presented by President Putin as a sort of potential game changer for the Greek economy. Firstly, he stated that Greece could earn “hundreds of millions of euro” through natural gas transit annually. Secondly, he declared that Greece could use these revenues to pay off its debt to international creditors. Prime Minister Tsipras reacted favourably to this proposal, by saying that this might also boost jobs and investment in Greece. But is there any evidence that a strong natural gas cooperation with Russia would have a considerable impact on the Greek economy? This blog is intended to provide insight on this controversial issue.
Source: Bruegel
During the press conference, President Putin declared that Russia would consider the option of providing loans to Greece for joint large-scale natural gas projects. This was a reference to Turkish Stream, a project launched in December 2014 by the Russian President himself, intended to deliver substantial volumes of Russian gas to Turkey and Europe while completely bypassing Ukraine from 2019.
According to President Putin, Greece would primarily benefit from the pipeline project by enjoying significant transit revenues. Let's try to figure out whether this statement has a solid basis. Turkish Stream is set to have a capacity of 63 billion cubic metres per year (bcm/y). Considering that 14 bcm/y will be exclusively devoted to the Turkish domestic market, the maximum volume that might transit through Greece would be 49 bcm/y. Considering that Slovakia applies a transit fee of about EUR 7.8 per thousand cubic metres (tcm) for the natural gas transit from Ukraine to Austria via its 400 km-long transit route, Greece might collect about EUR 380 million annually in transit charges.
According to Prime Minister Tsipras, the construction of a pipeline connecting the arrival point of Turkish Stream at the Turkish-Greek border with the Greek-Macedonian border (from where natural gas might flow northwards to Austria via Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary) might have a considerable impact in terms of job creation in Greece. To put it into perspective, Trans Adriatic Pipeline AG, the company working on a similar pipeline project -TAP- optimistically projects the creation of around 2,000 directly related new jobs and a further 10,000 peripheral new jobs in Greece. These numbers indicate the limited impact of these projects on the Greek labour market.
Furthermore, Greece hopes that enhanced natural gas cooperation with Russia will also lead to a significant discount on its imports of Russian gas, at a level of around 10 percent. Considering that the average price paid by Greece for Russian gas was around EUR 440 per thousand cubic metres in 2013 and that Greece annually imports from Russia around 2.4 bcm of natural gas, the annual natural gas bill of Greece vis-à-vis Russia could be estimated at about EUR 1 billion. A 10 percent discount would thus represent a net saving of about EUR 100 million.
To put it into perspective, we compare the “Russian gas package” with Greece's actual bailout package. In short, the sum of the potential annual transit charges of EUR 380 million and the potential annual savings on the natural gas bill of EUR 100 million have a net present value of EUR 4.8 billion (calculated with the current long-term interest rate of 10 percent). This is two orders of magnitude smaller than the Second Economic Adjustment Programme approved by euro area finance ministers in 2012 which foreseen financial assistance of EUR 164.5 billion until the end of 2014.
Furthermore, considering that Eurostat estimates Greece's total annual government spending at EUR 107 Billion, the impact of the “Russian gas package” on the country's total annual government spending would be limited, at 0.5 percent.
Following on from the enthusiastic tones of the Moscow meeting, over the next week Russia and Greece will sign a memorandum of cooperation concerning these gas issues. However, as the previous figures illustrated, the overall impact of Turkish Stream on the Greek economy will be rather limited in macroeconomic terms.
In other words, Russian-Greek gas cooperation might have an impact on the political and geostrategic relations of the two players (and on that of other countries), but it will surely not have a direct structural impact on the Greek economy.
With the recent resurgence of Jarvan appearing in the jungle, players are beginning to realize the usefulness that Jarvan can bring to his team. As it stands in leagues such as the NA & EU LCS, you're seeing Jarvan mixed in with champions that provide big portions of damage and AoE crowd control. When a team picks up Jarvan you're likely to see an Orianna or Lulu also picked up and thus expect to see Jarvan's ult used to group up as many individuals from the enemy team as possible.
However, those are some of the things you take note with Jarvan as a jungle. When you push him into another lane such as mid, the way you play him changes from a utility style champion to a more assassin focused one.
Now you're probably asking yourself why you'd pick a Jarvan for the assassin role over many other more popular champions such as Zed, Kha'Zix or Rengar who also aren't exclusive to going mid, and there really isn't much difference between the champions. Jarvan is much more similar to Rengar in the sense that he's looking to burst a champion down almost immediately, and doesn't have an innate escape to get himself out of harm's way once he dives in. This can be a pretty big disadvantage because it means if you fail your job, you're probably going to go down shortly after jumping in. However, the strength in Jarvan mid comes with his presence and strength as a mid laner.
Strengths of Jarvan Mid
The advantage of putting an assassin like Zed in the mid lane is the fact that he has decent wave clear and is a resourceless champion, meaning you're able to trade every time your opponent does. Although Jarvan uses mana to trade, his Q can be used to whittle down your opposing mid laners health multiple times before you actually run out of mana. Jarvan's strength in mid comes from the fact that his trade range is 770, and the ability's damage doesn't have a travel time from beginning to end, meaning the damage comes out quickly and is hard to dodge. What makes him even better is that his gap closer is 830 range.
After a couple of times poking with your Q, and maybe even getting in an auto attack or two to proc your passive, you're usually able to spend some mana on an E + Q combo to dish out further damage and place yourself right on top of the opposing mid laner. If you've already hit two Q's beforehand and successfully land the E+Q combo on your opponent, he's likely not going to stand there and trade back and thus is forced to back away from further taking auto attack damage against you. This is ultimately how Jarvan establishes lane control, and once you get that control, it's extremely easy to hold it due to the large range that you're able to travel with an E+Q combo. If you play your cards correctly and the minion wave isn't sitting close enough to his tower, you'll likely be able to zone away the opponent from getting any CS as they won't want to get in range of another E+Q combo.
Now for whatever reason, if you happen to fall behind early due to using your combo to gap close only to find the jungler waiting and set up for you, all is not lost. As said previously, Jarvan's Q is a great way to get some free trades against the opposing midlaner due to its high range, thus landing it and moving away before giving your opposing midlaner a chance to react to the trade is highly possible.
You still play mostly the same way as if you were ahead, however just be a little more hesitant when attempting to kill your opposing mid laner. Jarvan's lane relies highly on control but if you do get behind and pushed to your turret he has an easy time clearing waves and getting last hits under his own turret.
What should I build?
The final thing I should mention is item choices. Since you'll be playing Jarvan like an assassin, going for heavy amounts of damage is not only recommended but rather required. Any advantage you get in mid lane from items allows you to further propel yourself ahead of the opposing mid laner, and items like Brutalizer and Tiamat/Ravenous Hydra are extremely strong choices as your first little damage item pickups. Having the Tiamat active go along with your gap close and passive allows for a larger amount of burst to be displayed which makes instantly taking down your target a possibility later against champions that are also focusing on building damage over defense.
After you pick those items up, things such as Last Whisper and Hexdrinker should be considered based on the enemy's purchases or team composition. If they have a lot of magic damage, you're going to want that extra magic shield on you to allow you to live a little longer while in the middle of the enemy team. Likewise, if they're starting to build a lot of armor, getting further % armor pen to go along with your Q's penetration is a great way to nullify the purchases they're making to soften your blows against them. Getting some tenacity via Merc treads is also recommended as you'll want to actually be able to auto attack an enemy you're on and are likely going to be a heavy recipient to crowd control if you dive onto their back lines.
Overall, I usually end up building four damage items, and then getting a defensive item such as Randuin's Omen or Guardian Angel in order to make sure that the job I do gets done.
Concluding Thoughts
As it stands currently, Jarvan mid isn't seen all too much. However, I definitely believe that he has a lot of potential currently against a lot of the top picks you see in mid lane. The only matchup that I've had a bad time against was Kayle, and as of late it seems she's transitioning more into the top lane over mid. She's also currently a high priority ban which further makes her a rarer occurrence to be spotted against you.
I'd also be slightly hesitant on picking him against champions that can kite very well and have a lot of shields and absorbs such as Lulu, as your kill potential on this kind of champions is a lot lower than most others. Overall, if you're facing champions with low lane mobility like Twisted Fate, Kassadin (Pre-Level 6), and even those with some mobility like LeBlanc and Fizz, you should have an easy time trading and getting a kill advantage in your lane.
Just be weary that the more pressure you place on your opponent, the more likely you are to have a jungler come and visit your lane. I hope there are others out there that pick up Jarvan mid, as he's a ton of fun to play and quite viable in the lane as well.
0 Sapulpa police chief upset about letter from Tulsa sheriff's office
TULSA COUNTY, Okla. - Tensions have risen between two area law enforcement agencies.
The Sapulpa Police Department said it started when the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office sent a letter to Sapulpa Police Chief Rick Rumsey after the death of Captain Trey Pritchard.
In the letter, Sheriff Stanley Glanz extended “sincere sympathy” to the SPD in the death of Pritchard, but the letter mistakenly had the name of Jonathan Grafton, the man who allegedly shot and killed Pritchard, in place of the officer's name.
Thursday morning the sheriff's office told FOX23 the mistakes in the letter were made by the secretary who typed it.
FOX23's Lynn Casey reached out to both sides.

Rumsey then replied to Glanz's letter, saying he has never read such a “disrespectful and misstated document.” Rumsey says he was also insulted by the absence of the TCSO Honor Guard at Pritchard's funeral, which was widely attended by officers from across the state.

The police chief's letter goes on to say TCSO refused to assist with a shooting that took place during the fallen Sapulpa officer's funeral, forcing Sapulpa officers to leave the memorial service.
According to TCSO, deputies did assist Sapulpa Police with the murder investigation on the day of Pritchard's funeral. They would not confirm or deny that someone declined to take over.
The office confirmed a TCSO Honor Guard was not present at the funeral. The office cited staffing problems as the cause. Some Honor Guard members were on medical leave at the time.

Rumsey closes his letter by saying he has “never before witnessed such a break in our law enforcement family.”

Bloggers in China have reacted with outrage to news of an assault on six Chinese students in France's wine-producing Bordeaux region.
Two people were arrested after the drunken attack, in which one student was seriously injured when a glass bottle hit her face, police say.
French Interior Minister Manuel Valls condemned the "xenophobic" attack.
The attack was widely criticised on China's most popular social networking service, Weibo.
One blogger said France's reputation was "damaged" while another said Chinese people should avoid visiting the country.
The students were in France for a year to study oenology. Three people, all of them visibly drunk, were involved in the attack in the village of Hostens, in the Landes region near Bordeaux.
According to French newspaper Sud Ouest, a struggle began when the attackers tried to enter the residence where the students were staying on Friday night.
The attackers had reportedly been drinking outside on a bench during the evening. One witness told the paper, "They could have picked on anyone", but racist insults were reportedly heard during the struggle.
Correspondents say there is resentment among some people in the Bordeaux region at Chinese investors who have been buying up local vineyards.

Actor Michael Jace was convicted of second-degree murder in the killing of his wife. Lolita Lopez reports for the NBC4 News at 5 p.m. on May 31, 2016. (Published Tuesday, May 31, 2016)
A jury has convicted "The Shield" actor Michael Jace of second-degree murder in the 2014 shooting death of his wife in front of the couple's two young sons in Los Angeles.
A jury of six women and six men deliberated about two hours before finding Jace, 53, guilty in the killing of of April Jace on May 19, 2014, prosecutors said. Jace was also convicted on a special allegation charge that he used a firearm.
The actor, who portrayed a police officer in "The Shield," was upset his wife wanted a divorce and was obsessed with the belief that she was seeing someone else, prosecutors told jurors in opening statements.
For Savoy Brown, the son of April Jace from a previous marriage, the verdict brings some closure.
Closing Arguments Begin in Michael Jace Murder Trial
Closing arguments are underway in the trial of Michael Jace, the former "Shield" actor facing a first-degree murder charge in the shooting death of his wife. Lolita Lopez reports for the NBC4 News at 6 p.m. on Friday May 27, 2016. (Published Friday, May 27, 2016)
"Finally it's less of a burden," he told reporters outside the courtroom. "It feels really empty because that's my mom. It's the person who literally brings you into the world and she's no longer there."
Jace waited in their home in the 5400 block of Brynhurst Avenue and when April came home, around 8 p.m., he shot her once in the back, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.
Jace shot her two more times in the legs in front of their sons, who were 8 and 5 at the time.
Jace then called 911 about 8:30 p.m. and told the operator he shot his wife, according to evidence presented at trial. Her body was found inside the couple's home along with their two children, who were unharmed.
Jace, in custody since his arrest, is expected to be sentenced on June 10. He faces 40 years to life in state prison.
Jace's lawyers acknowledged he killed his wife in the couple's home, but argued he should be convicted of voluntary manslaughter because it wasn't a premeditated act.
Closing Arguments Begin in 'Shield' Actor Trial
Closing arguments are underway in the trial of Michael Jace, the former "Shield" actor facing a first-degree murder charge in the shooting death of his wife. Lolita Lopez reports for the NBC4 News at Noon on Friday May 27, 2016. (Published Friday, May 27, 2016)
Jace, who had small roles in films such as "Boogie Nights," ''Forrest Gump" and the television show "Southland," told detectives he didn't intend to kill his wife and only wanted to inflict pain. He had had been out of work for years and said financial struggles put a strain on the couple's marriage.
"I was just angry," Michael Jace told investigators, according to a transcript released Thursday. "All I intended to do was shoot her in the leg. And then I shot her in the leg and that was it."
He waited for police after calling 911 and gave a lengthy interview to detectives in which he told them he planned to shoot her in the leg with her father's revolver.
April Jace, who earlier that day had told her husband she wanted a divorce, was killed moments after returning to their home after a youth baseball game. Text messages presented during the trial show Michael Jace had told his wife he had left their home, but instead was waiting with the loaded handgun.
He told detectives he planned to kill himself, but couldn't follow through. He also said he shot his wife the first time after she lunged at him.
Jace's now 10-year-old son testified that he heard his father tell his mother, "'If you like running, then run to heaven.'"
Jace's attorney Jamon Hicks said in opening statements that the case boiled down to the actor's mindset at the time of the killing, and whether it was premeditated.
"This case is not about how it was done. We acknowledge it. We accept responsibility," Hicks said. "This case is about why it was done."
In opening statements, Deputy District Attorney Tannaz Mokayef portrayed Jace as a calculating killer.

Physicist: The existence of Santa Claus is an established fact, beyond debate. I, like most people of my generation, have verified his existence experimentally by means of the “Cookie test”.
The idea that millions of people, the world over, could leave cookies and milk out in the evening, and have them replaced by presents in the morning, without a “Jolly Agent” implies a conspiracy on a frankly Orwellian scale. That “theory” can be dismissed out of hand. Occam's razor alone shows that this is essentially an open and shut case.
NORAD (originally “CONAD”) has publicly tracked Santa's sleigh since 1955. According to A. Grawert, Esq. of Anonymous Law Firm LLP, although the consent of NORAD isn't proof, it does provide a legal basis for his existence, as established in the landmark 1937 case “The People of the State of New York v. Kringle” (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1937).
There is however a paranoid sub-culture of conspiracy theorists that quietly advocate the non-existence of Santa Claus (“asantists”). So, for the rest of us, what follows are a look at some of the surprises of Cheer-based Gift-Delivery physics.
There are approximately 2 billion children in the world. Assuming that there are 2 children per household and that the naughty and nice lists are the same length, then that leaves approximately 750 million households for St. Nick to visit. Before the 24th, Santa's Elves make toys and solve the Traveling Salesman Problem to plot the delivery route (Holiday magic and quantum computers are some of the only known methods for solving NP problems). For a random arrangement of N points contained in a reasonably shaped, finite area, A, you can estimate the length of the optimal solution. The length, L, is approximately , and the average distance between houses is .
Plugging in the non-Antarctic land area of the Earth (A=136,000,000 km2) and the number of Nice-list homes (N=1,500,000) yields L=200 million km and d=0.3 km. Assuming that Santa covers the full distance in 24 hours, and spends half the time flying and half the time gifting and eating, he'd have an average speed of around 17,000,000 kph (or about mach 14,000), which is far less than the speed of light, and is totally doable. He'd have to experience an acceleration somewhere in the ballpark of 30 billion g's, on and off, for 12 hours, but again, that's doable.
Even using so-called “conventional science” a human being can survive as much as 15 g's when suspended in a fluid. The highest acceleration survived by a human (a human named Col. John Stapp) is 46 g's, and he was blind for barely a day. But, keep in mind that rather than being a grouchy young human, Santa is in fact a jolly old elf.
It could be that what we think of as a “bowl full of jelly” may very well be an “elfin g-suit” that Santa uses to overcome the stresses of the journey. The only way to say for sure is to ask him. But, I've found empirically that almost every Santa you'll meet is, in fact, an asantist impostor.
Traveling with an average speed of 17 million kph means that the back of Santa's sleigh is in a hard vacuum. More than that, the heat energy generated by Santa's trip totals about 2 x 1015 tons of TNT equivalent, or about 40,000 metric tons of anti-matter (and 40,000 matching tons of ordinary matter). “Conventional” physicists would say that the surface of the Earth would be completely vaporized by this joyous and welcome yearly Yule Tide. What they don't take into account is jingle-Bell's theorem of quantum christmas, and a generous helping of X-mas miracles!
It would take about 5,000,000 Santa's (or about 1022 tons of TNT) to completely destroy (disassemble) the Earth. 2 x 1015 tons of TNT would just throw the top half mile or so into space. Happy holidays!
Update: Some concerned readers pointed out that the “# of naughty = # of nice” estimate may involve more optimism than is entirely warranted.
Which raises the question: given that Santa exists, and so does life on Earth, how many nice children can there be? I bet a 1°C increase in the world temperature could be small enough to go unnoticed. So (using the same estimates to back solve), if Santa's break-neck course only released enough energy to cook the Earth by 1°C, then there can be no more than around 4,000 nice-households in the world.
It would seem that we can safely say that 99.9997% of children should have watched out, they shouldn't have cried, they shouldn't have pouted, and we can derive why.
The John Hughes pick has been slammed pretty universally ever since it occurred during the Browns' 2012 draft. Hughes was even the subject of some pretty negative and difficult questioning by Kevin Kiley during his late (he overslept) appearance on their show this morning. Now the other sports talk station, ESPN Cleveland, has dug up some info that could shed some light on why they Brown made their pick and felt lucky to get Hughes. Will Burge has the report.
A league source tells ESPN Cleveland that Hughes would have been selected before the end of the 3rdround if the Browns had not selected him. The source said that Hughes had been fielding calls from multiple teams indicating they would select him with their third round pick. The Browns just pulled the trigger first… It seems as though Heckert had a right to be concerned. The source also said the New Orleans Saints, who owned the #89 pick in the draft, were going to take Hughes if he was there. The Saints ended up selecting Regina defensive lineman Akiem Hicks, who is almost the exact same size as Hughes.
Maybe this explains why Tom Heckert was so dismissive of questions surrounding the pick and how much of a “reach” it might have been. It is certainly a compelling report, and if accurate just goes to show how much difference there can be between draft experts in the media and the front offices of NFL clubs who must make the picks.

The violent uprising in Syria has produced some predictable and sorry results. Aside from the numbers of people dying prematurely as a result of the fighting, there are tens of thousands of Syrian civilians, consisting mostly women and children, both inside and outside of Syria who are suffering from the war. This suffering does not choose sides, both opponents and supporters of the Asad government have become victims. Their sympathies matter not as much as the amount of help they need, no matter whose side they're on.
In the refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, Syrians who have been driven from their homes by the fighting are not only near starvation, but are suffering from the cold weather with little help from warm clothing, kerosene for heaters, or any other comforts. The international agencies are overwhelmed and are without enough money to feed and clothe them.
Inside Syria, commerce has come to a standstill. Farmers have no money for planting seeds, and even so, there are no markets for the food they could produce even if given the money to plant and to harvest. Trying to send produce to market, provided they have something to sell, is a suicide mission, as it's much too dangerous to travel the roads.
My wife, who is of Syrian origin, and whose family are farmers, has learned that her siblings give whatever heating oil they can find to their mother so she can find some warmth. Most Syrian civilians do what they can to help their neighbors and their families who are in need, but it's more than a matter of money. There simply is not enough bread and heating oil to go around, leaving a large part of the country wanting for the necessities of life.
The United States government has imposed sanctions on Syria, and, like most sanctions placed on someone perceived to be an enemy of the United States, only the population suffers, not the leaders who have displeased our government. What is unconscionable is the punishment of a people who have had no beef with the United States.
And conceding that the Asad government is a dictatorship, the rebels that President Obama and Secretary Clinton are supporting are, with some exceptions, allied with Al Qaeda. Our government's grand pronouncement that we have withdrawn recognition of one of the groups–the Al Nusra Front–because they are radical jihadists is nothing more than hot air. Despite this “non-recognition,” these jihadists as well as other jihadist groups are still fighting alongside the non-jihadists and the suffering of the civilian population continues.
At least, the Asad government insures equal rights for women, and does not interfere with the religious preference of Sryians. The same cannot be said for the groups who are trying to overthrow the Asad government, as Syria would regress to the 13th century with a jihadist overthrow. The Muslim Brotherhood, one of the jihadist groups seeking overthrow voices a slogan, “Alawites to the tomb, and Christians to Beirut.” Alawites are an offshoot of the Shiite sect of Islam, and are more progressive than either the Sunnis or the Shiites.
As recently as two or three years ago, the people of Syria admired the United States. A great many Syrians, like other Middle Easterners, have voted with their feet by trying to emigrate to this country. I'm not sure that this is still the case, given the extreme suffering US policy has inflicted upon them. Although it may not be widely known that our government is both arming and funding the rebels and the jihadists through Qatar and Saudi Arabia, it is no secret over there. We have also sent troops to Turkey to man the missile batteries we have sent to Turkey.
Destroying the Asad government is a way for the United States to attempt to weaken Iran, but in the process our government is destroying the lives of countless numbers of Syrians who had, at one time, been friendly to us.
Not only has Syria never sent out any terrorists from Syria to damage the US, the Asad government a few years ago actually uncovered more than one secret Al Qaeda plots to damage American interests in the Middle East. Asad turned over the information to the US government, which was then able to prevent the plots from coming to fruition. Our government's actions against Syria today bring forth a statement Gore Vidal once made, that, “no good deed goes unpunished.”
The United States government can bring an end to the suffering of Syrian civilians by ending its interference, first in Syria, then overall, throughout the Middle East, which not only costs us both too many lives and too much money but creates more enemies for this country.

The Eastern Front in the First World War commands far less attention than the Western, even though it extended further, involved more soldiers and probably resulted in more losses. It saw four empires destroyed: Russia, Austria-Hungary, Germany and Turkey. Russia lost at least as many men as any other combatant, yet its contribution has often been neglected, no doubt because Russia has often been considered apart from Europe, especially after the Revolution of 1917. The Allies welcomed the fall of the autocratic tsar – ‘Bloody Nicholas' as he was known – and greeted the arrival of democracy in the shape of the Provisional Government under Alexander Kerensky. But the seizure of power by Lenin and the Bolsheviks caused widespread alarm, as the Soviets withdrew from the Great War and the country became cut off from the rest of Europe in both practice and in thought.
For Lenin and his comrades the Great War had been an imperialist venture and was, therefore, to be forgotten in the new communist dawn. Lenin had urged Russian troops to fraternise with their enemies before he took power. With a new history unfolding, the whole episode of imperialist conflict was to be denounced and then confined to oblivion. There would be no commemoration.
Yet, in recent years, the possibility is opening up of a commemoration more fitting to the military sacrifice. Russian and western historians are collaborating in an ambitious project of about 20 volumes on ‘Russia's Great War and Revolution'. In the first of them, Vera Tolz writes of a shift from 2010 onwards, which makes the First World War the determining moment for modern Russia, not the Revolution. Tolz and her colleagues are likely to reveal much that is new.
During the conflict, in 1916, the Russian Society of Soldiers Who Fell in the War announced a competition to produce appropriate monuments, but in 1918 Lenin signed a decree for the destruction of statues ‘raised in honour of the tsars and their servants' in favour of new ones of ‘great people in the sphere of revolutionary and social activity'.
In the Soviet Union itself, somewhat surprisingly, any memory of the Eastern Front was kept alive largely by one of the principal pillars of the establishment, the Red Army, which, during the 1930s, studied the strategy and tactics of the conflict between the Russian and German empires from 1914 to 1918. After the Nazi invasion of 1941, this previous encounter, however imperialist, became a key element in the patriotic propaganda of the armed forces.
Until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, though, memories of Russia's role in the conflict could be found mostly abroad. Already during the Great War, memorials of various kinds, some modest, some more elaborate, were erected in East Prussia and cared for by local people. In Warsaw, Prague and Belgrade, even in an Orthodox cemetery in Berlin, the sacrifices of Russian soldiers were recorded in stone. In France, where detachments of the tsarist army fought, Russian sections were set up in the cemeteries at Soissons, Verdun and elsewhere. In the US, after much wrangling between the Veterans Society and the Orthodox Church, a monument was dedicated at Seattle in 1936 to ‘the memory of 1,700,000 soldiers of the Czar who died during the World War'. Services were often held on Armistice Day, with US veterans in attendance. Such gestures did not encourage the preservation of memory back in the Soviet Union.
Following the demise of the Soviet Union, the situation began to change. After a considerable amount of grassroots activity, including the erection of crosses on the site of the former Moscow City Cemetery by supporters of tsarism among others, it was reopened in 2004 as a ‘Memorial Park Complex for the Heroes of World War One'. The deputy mayor observed that through this restoration ‘we solve historical, political and social problems'. With a change in government policy already apparent from 2010, President Putin approved a law in 2012 that added August 1st, the day of Russia's entry into the conflict, to the official list of military holidays. Then, in 2013, he announced a competition for the design of a memorial, as well as other tributes to those who died for the Fatherland in the Great War. Duly, on August 1st, 2014, he inaugurated a monument to heroes unjustly forgotten during what journalists called the reign of the ‘wise and great tsar' Nicholas II, asserting that he was the last leader to come to power legally before Putin.
Near St Petersburg, at the palace of Tsarskoe Selo, Nicholas II intended to create a pantheon of patriotic heroes. When hostilities began it became necessary to open a hospital there instead. Now, it is the site of a museum that features some 2,000 items in an exhibition entitled ‘Russia in the Great War', including documents, weapons, medals and uniforms as well as an old Ford car used by members of the general staff. Video displays follow the arrival and course of the war, from telegrams exchanged by Nicholas and Kaiser Wilhelm to footage of the Eastern Front. One of the aims of the museum is to destroy what is seen as the myth of Russian backwardness: Sergei Naryshkin, chairman of the Russian Historical Society, claims that, at the outbreak of hostilities, Russian development was faster than anywhere else on earth and could have led to world leadership by the mid-20th century.
This revival of interest in Russia's role in the Great War has arisen not only because of the anniversary but also from Putin's desire to foster Russian patriotism. Naryshkin dutifully observed: ‘In 1914 Russia, true to its alliance commitments, defended Serbia; now fraternal Ukraine needs our help.' Having given their lives in the Great War that followed, the fallen were now being asked to make a contribution to resolving the difficulties of more recent times.

We might think that most of the carbon emission come from the industrial sector and livestock, but a new study suggests that the real environmental problem is represented by the things we buy. In order to understand what is really driving the impact on our planet we have to look past the obvious primary factors and realize whose needs those things are servicing. Keeping this in mind, researchers arrived to the conclusion that household consumers are (by far) the biggest accountable for this crisis.
We often look at charts that only take into account nation-focused analyses of environmental impact. So, it would be much better if we would start to take responsibilities and not blaming individual countries for the state of the planet. "If you look at China's per capita consumption-based (environmental) footprint, it is small" researcher Diana Ivanova from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology said. "They produce a lot of products but they export them. It's different if you put the responsibility for those impacts on the consumer, as opposed to the producer".
During the study, published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology, the Norwegian researchers analyzed the environmental impact of consumers across 43 countries and five rest-of-the-world regions. They measured the 'secondary impacts' (the environmental impact of our culture of constantly producing and consuming goods) and they could see that consumers resulted to be responsible for more than 60% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, and up to 80% of global water use.
"We all like to put the blame on someone else, the government, or businesses" said Ivanova. "But between 60–80 per cent of the impacts on the planet come from household consumption. If we change our consumption habits, this would have a drastic effect on our environmental footprint as well". The researchers were also able to find a very specific and quite self-evident pattern: the richer a country is, the more its inhabitants consume, and the greater each person's impact on the planet is. Food in particular plays a very essential role in this process. Rich nations, in particular, eat more meat and consume large amounts of dairy products and processed food, which have a huge impact on land and water resources.
In this analysis, the US is the worst performer when it comes to per capita greenhouse gas emissions, with a carbon footprint of 18.6 tonnes CO2 equivalent. Luxembourg is second with 18.5 tonnes, followed by Australia with 17.7 tonnes. On the contrary, China's per capita carbon footprint is just 1.8 tonnes CO2 and the global average is 3.4 tonnes. Researchers hope that this clearer picture of how consumer behavior contributes to environmental impact will push each of us to make positive changes in our personal approach to consumption, reaching a more sustainable level.
"Households have a relatively large degree of control over their consumption, but they often lack accurate and actionable information on how to improve their own environmental performance" said Ivanova. "Any activity where we have a choice of buying a product or using a service, the service will have much less impact".

PHOENIX (AP) — Democratic Arizona lawmakers who want to amend the state's civil rights laws to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity and veteran status appealed Monday to Republicans' pro-business core to support the effort.
Democratic leaders said at a Capitol news conference that the state's lack of protection is hurting its national reputation among businesses.
“We have a governor and a Republican-controlled Legislature that define themselves as being pro-business, so I challenge them to walk the talk,” said Rep. Rebecca Rios, the House minority leader. “Supporting LGBTQ workplace equality is good for business and Arizona workers should be judged by one thing — their ability to get the job done.”
Rios and state Sen. Katie Hobbs have support from religious leaders and gay-rights groups. Another prominent backer is Arizona-based tech firm GoDaddy, one of the state's largest employers.
Kate VanHorn, the company's vice president of diversity and inclusion, said GoDaddy has a strong non-discrimination policy but is at a competitive disadvantage with other firms across the nation because Arizona lacks protections for all workers.
“Employees want to know they are protected both within and without the workplace,” VanHorn said.
Current Arizona law prohibits discrimination in employment, housing or public accommodations because of race, religion, sex or national origin. The law does not cover sexual orientation, gender identify or veteran status.
Democrats have introduced Senate Bill 1320 and House Bill 2364 to add those categories to state civil rights laws.
Efforts to push similar legislation since 2008 have gone nowhere in the Republican-controlled legislature.
Hobbs, minority leader in the Senate, said Democrats' efforts to garner Republican support has run up against the Center for Arizona Policy, a social conservative group led by Cathi Herrod that is a powerful force at the Legislature.
“I think that most people are cowering to Cathi Herrod and not willing to do anything to upset her on this bill,” Hobbs said.
Herrod said it's easy to blame her for everything that happens at the Capitol, but the facts are that Republican lawmakers don't support the proposals. She said the proposals limit the rights of individuals and private business owners.
“The First Amendment guarantees all individuals the right to live and work according to their beliefs,” Herrod said. “These proposals do not protect that guarantee.”
Republican Gov. Doug Ducey has said he's against discrimination “in all its forms” but does not plan to push the Legislature to adopt stronger anti-discrimination laws.
“I'm not in the habit of telling the Legislature and other elected officials what they should be doing,” Ducey said.

Since President Trump took office, military posturing and bellicosity between the United States and North Korea has escalated. In recent weeks, it has grown to include reciprocal threats of the use of nuclear weapons.
North Korean officials warned in mid-April that "a thermonuclear war may break out at any moment." Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work described two U.S. ballistic missile tests as "a signal … that we are prepared to use nuclear weapons in defense of our country if necessary." The election of the liberal Moon Jae-in as president of South Korea may cool the rhetoric on both sides, but the recent missile tests of North Korea have complicated that possibility, and there is no certainty that Mr. Trump will seize the opportunity in any case.
Loose talk about the use of nuclear weapons is justification for alarm, especially in a time of heightened tensions. Reports have surfaced that the Trump administration is considering a pre-emptive strike against North Korea's nuclear weapons facilities or a "decapitation" strategy aimed at the leadership of the regime, possibly using nuclear weapons. Such an attack would not likely succeed and could well prompt a response from North Korea, which is believed to have the capacity of striking South Korea, Japan and U.S. forces on the Korean demilitarized zone with 10-kiloton atomic weapons sufficient to destroy a city. A miscalculation or accident could result in a catastrophe, as well. In 1995, the United States and Norway launched a research rocket off the latter country's northwest coast. Russia's early warning system read it initially as a nuclear attack. Russia's emergency nuclear decision process was aborted only after radar indicated that the rocket was headed out to sea. Could we expect North Korea's mercurial leaders to behave in a calm fashion in similar circumstances?
Given the increasingly volatile geopolitical landscape, one might ask why the United States continues to keep many of its roughly 1,500 deployed strategic nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert, a status that allows for their launch within a matter of minutes. One might question why the United States insists on maintaining the right to use nuclear weapons first in a conflict, a policy that effectively encourages other nations to pursue nuclear weapons as a deterrent to a U.S. attack. Perhaps most of all, one might ask why we continue to give the president sole authority to order a nuclear first strike.
Taking into account Mr. Trump's statements about nuclear weapons, his impulsive behavior, and his self-professed unpredictability, a disaster is conceivable. Mr. Trump reportedly once questioned an aide about nuclear weapons, asking, "If we have them, why can't we use them?" Following his election, Mr. Trump tweeted "The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses on nukes." When asked in an interview about that position and its implications, he said, "Let it be an arms race."
Steps must be taken now to reduce the danger of the use of nuclear weapons. Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Rep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, have introduced legislation in the Senate and the House of Representatives that would tie the president's power to launch a nuclear first strike to a prior congressional authorization.
Among the co-sponsors of the bill is Maryland's Sen. Chris Van Hollen. At a recent press conference announcing the delivery of nearly a half million petition signatures to Congress in support of this legislation, Senator Van Hollen said: "Once one nuclear weapon is fired off, there's a real risk that you go down the road to a total nuclear Armageddon. … The need for this [legislation] has been highlighted by a lot of the reckless remarks made by the current president, and if ever there was a moment when the United States Congress should act on this, it's now."
Senator Van Hollen is right. This legislation would ensure that this president, and future presidents, cannot make the decision to initiate the use of nuclear weapons in a matter of minutes. It may be unlikely that Mr. Trump or any president would actually take such a step. But why should the country take the chance? Why not remove all doubt when the consequences are so considerable and the outcome potentially so dire?

On the rare occasions when this site discusses football, and in particular if we mention the three-year-old Championship club known as “Rangers”, we get complaints on two grounds: one, that football has nothing to do with politics, and two, that we risk alienating supporters of the club who also back independence, of which there are unquestionably a significant number.
The second complaint is one we've dealt with in detail here. But the first one is more important. Because whether you're talking about the original club which died in 2012 and was put into liquidation or the new one currently challenging for promotion to the top division for the first time, “Rangers” is a totem of the Unionist establishment in Scotland, and the way it's treated by the media tells us at least as much about that establishment and that media as any amount of political journalism.
Today the Herald newspaper group sacked Sunday Herald columnist Angela Haggerty – who's also the editor of Common Space – after just eight articles.
Haggerty, a Catholic of Irish descent who's been targeted for years by hundreds if not thousands of abusive and bigoted “Rangers” fans – including one who was imprisoned for six months for threatening her – had tweeted support for a fellow Herald columnist, sports reporter Graham Spiers after the paper published an apology to the club over a column he wrote on 30 December.
The column had included the allegation that a current (unnamed) “Rangers” director was fond of the sectarian song “The Billy Boys”, which rejoices in the lyrics “We're up to our knees in Fenian blood”, and is sometimes sung by a tiny unrepresentative minority of the club's support, as seen here at the Scottish League Cup semi-final in February 2015. If you listen really closely you may be able to pick them out.
Haggerty had specifically been commenting on a post by the Rangers Supporters Trust, a belligerent fan group with significant financial resources which had expressed its glee at the Herald's response to what the RST called “lies” in Spiers' column – though to the best of anyone's knowledge the RST was not present at the meeting between Spiers and the unnamed director.
Spiers subsequently published a statement disassociating himself from the apology, saying that “My opinion – as expressed in my column – was based on a truthful account of my meeting with a Rangers director”, and was backed up by former Herald colleague Robbie Dinwoodie, who noted a claim by another belligerent “Rangers” fan group that the apology had been secured via threats to withdraw advertising revenue.
According to Haggerty, “representatives of the Rangers board” threatened to reinstate legal action against the Herald over the Spiers column unless she was sacked for daring to express support for Spiers on her personal Twitter account. Showing the great journalistic integrity for which he's fast becoming famed, the editor-in-chief of the Herald group, Magnus Llewellin, immediately caved to their demands.
The group alleging the advertising blackmail threat describes itself as “DEFENDING OUR TRADITIONS” and “our people, our culture, our way of life”, concluding on the sectarian exhortation “No Surrender!”
Its Twitter page leaves little doubt as to precisely which people, culture and traditions it's talking about – the same ones referenced in “The Billy Boys”, and those upheld by the people who regularly abuse and threaten Angela Haggerty with violence, rape and murder, while also constantly demanding her sacking and threatening boycotts of newspapers employing her.
(Scottish journalists stoutly ignore such campaigns, despite thousands of signatures, focusing instead on two or three nationalist loonies boycotting Tunnock's Teacakes.)
The bigotry, open politicisation and bullying of the “Vanguard Bears”, done in the guise of support for “Rangers” and tacitly tolerated by the club (which allows their banners to be displayed at Ibrox and has never to our knowledge condemned their activities), are the traditions of the Unionist, Protestant, militarist, Loyalist establishment. For the Herald to bow so cravenly to their threats tells us about a lot more than football.
“Rangers” – which stridently insists it's a continuation of the old club, which carried out a strict “No Catholics” signing policy for over 80 years – is the last big institution of those traditions. In flexing its muscle against Angela Haggerty it demonstrates its continued determination to impose its values on wider Scottish society and to silence entirely legitimate criticism and comment with a sledgehammer.
While politics ought to have no place in sport, it's the height of naivety to pretend that there aren't those determined to use the latter to political ends. Freedom will always be under attack from thugs and bullies, and Wings Over Scotland supports Angela Haggerty (with whom we disagree on very many things) unreservedly. The Herald and its editor-in-chief are a cowardly disgrace to journalism and decency.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan doesn't get it. Turkey's strongman is still fighting the Deep State
He doesn't understand that the crowd filling Gezi Park in the scruffy center of Istanbul is the most precious creation of Turkey's boom – an ambitious, creative, new generation. Erdoğan doesn't see the beauty in this kaleidoscope of mini-groups – Turkish and Kurdish, Marxist and Kemalist, Armenian and Islamist – all demanding that he listen to the public, rather than bulldoze Istanbul in his image.
Instead he sees in the Gezi Park protests the work of plotters and foreign bankers, the opposition Republican People's Party – even a mysterious international “interest lobby.”
Erdoğan is trapped in Turkish history. His battle against the clandestine networks of Kemalist generals – the moniker of the adherents to the secular legacy of the Turkish republic's founder Mustafa Kemal – and their plainclothes allies, has been so long and so bitter it has left him unable to see anything else.
Erdoğan is angry. He won three democratic elections with an increased majority and believes – not incorrectly – he has made life better for the Turkish poor and made Turkey look more like them, less secular and more conservative.
Erdoğan doesn't get it because he is still fighting his last battle – the secretive civil war within the Turkish elite. He sees shadowy forces trying to unseat him among the twentysomethings of Gezi Park because, until recently, there really were forces out to get him. They were trying to topple his party, the Justice and Development Party (AKP).
Erdoğan's enemies were evocatively called the “Deep State” – or the state within the state that kept Turkish democracy under military tutelage for generations. It was a shifting network of generals, bureaucrats and criminals who once acted as the guardians of secularism – but actually propped up the Western-oriented elites of Turkey's coastal cities and the bureaucracy. Less a shadow government and more an evolving political mafia, these forces kept on preventing outsiders from coming to power democratically. To prevent outsiders like Erdoğan from seizing the state machinery, Turkey suffered four military coups – in 1960, 1971, 1980 and 1997. This effectively denied the poor a voice in politics – until Erdoğan won election.
The entrenched establishment did not give up easily. The AKP's consolidation evolved into a “winner takes all” war in the elite. The Kemalist establishment – the tight-knit military, judiciary and oligarchic elites – tried everything possible to stop Erdoğan. He was briefly jailed for his Islamist beliefs in 1999. They attempted to ban the AKP as recently as 2008. Military coup plots seemed continual. Generals threatened to intervene. Then there were sensational murders (allegedly orchestrated by factions inside the security forces) to sow chaos with the aim of ousting Erdoğan. There was relentless, scurrilous propaganda funded by these shadowy groups to defame him – accusing him, amongst other things, of being a secret Jew.
This tactical war against Erdoğan rattled and embittered him – and he fought back to attain his goal of total victory. As recently as 2011 – while the world was transfixed by the Arab Spring – AKP leaders moved to smash the military elite, unraveling a coup plot. There were mass arrests – the numbers are huge. The plotters' trials have now sprawled to take in 530 defendants and 8,000 pages of indictments – much, but not all, fabricated.
The result is more than 15 percent of Turkish admirals and generals are now in the dock.
Yet, just as Erdoğan seemed to have finally defeated the “Deep State,” these protestors have appeared across Turkey attacking his leadership and calling for his removal. He must have felt blind-sided by the spontaneous demonstrations because the last time there were similar mass protests in Turkey, back in 2007, they were organized by the military in alliance with the opposition Republican People's Party. Those protests brought hundreds of thousands out onto the streets in an effort to block Erdoğan from winning the election. Gigantic crowds in Ankara and Izmir numbered more than 350,000 Turkish flag-waving secularists.
Erdoğan smells conspiracy because, until 2011, Turkish politics has been nothing but conspiracy.
These current protests also clearly stunned him since the plans to redevelop Istanbul's Taksim Square, erect a gigantic airport and gargantuan third bridge over the Bosphorus, were part of the AKP election mandate in its recent big win. There was never a secret, Erdoğan's men claim, that voting for the AKP in the 2009 mayoral election and the 2011 general elections meant rebuilding Istanbul.
This is one key reason why Erdoğan sees the protestors as undemocratic, elitist losers, spreading chaos to undermine him.
Erdoğan no doubt thinks he has behaved toward the protestors like a perfect democrat. He does not see the police actions as brutal or coarse – rather he compares them to the old security tactics of Turkey's military past.
Never before has the Turkish state abandoned the Taksim area like this – allowing an un-policed carnival to run its course for more than a week. Never before have the Turkish police apologized. Rather, Erdoğan thinks back to the Taksim protests of 1977, when almost 500,000 converged on the square. The police killed more than 30 people – running them down and wildly firing live rounds into the crowds.
Erdoğan doesn't get it because he doesn't listen. Like Russian President Vladimir Putin, his repressive paranoia has increasingly muzzled the media.
Newspaper columnists whom Erdoğan resents have been sacked, while Turkish TV has been pressured, through government contracts and other cash matters, into broadcasting more or less what he wants to hear. This became obvious during the protests – documentaries on penguins were broadcast instead of live-feeds from Taksim Square. A score of national papers ran identical headlines.
Nor does Erdoğan have anyone left to listen to. Advisers who might offer criticism or adversarial views have been pushed aside – and a court of sycophants enthroned. Even leading AKP members now worry about incurring Erdoğan's wrath. As a result, he is cut off from reliable information. One leaked U.S. cable revealed: “Erdoğan reads minimally, mainly the Islamist-leaning press […] instead he relies on his charisma, instincts and the filtering of advisors who pull conspiracy theories off the Web or who are lost in neo-Ottoman fantasies.”
Erdoğan, lashing out at Gezi Park, keeps insisting that Turkey is “exactly where we were in 2007” – when the army posted a memorandum online hinting it might stage a coup.
Erdoğan can't grasp that the “Deep State” has gone. For this new generation in Gezi Park, Erdoğan's battles against the old elites are irrelevant, and his efforts to reframe these protests as part of that struggle is misguided or even deluded.
For them, Erdoğan is no longer the victim – he is the state.

ANALYSIS/OPINION:
Would you put a sign outside your house saying, “Doors unlocked,” or “We're not home”?
An underreported study released a year ago by the Crime Prevention Research Center (CPRC), the organization led by America's leading gun policy expert John Lott, found that 92 percent of mass shootings since 2009 have taken place in designated gun-free zones.
Or, as CPRC puts it, “Since 2009, only 8 percent of mass public shootings have occurred where civilians are allowed to defend themselves.”
“Gun-free” zones are purported to forestall gun violence, but in practice they attract deranged gunmen like porch lights attract moths. Why? Because deranged gunmen are crazy, not stupid. An identified gun-free zone literally advertises the ideal environment for committing mass murder.
Mass shootings are committed by mentally ill people to achieve a form of immortality, or by political zealots to terrorize the public. They know the more they kill, the more publicity they'll get. They also know the only way they will be stopped is by a good guy with a gun, so they choose to attack in places where they know nobody else will be armed.
Most mass shootings don't end until the police arrive. Killers typically have several minutes to slaughter as many victims as they can without fear of interference.
At least one mass murderer explained in his “manifesto” that he took armed resistance into account when choosing his target. According to CPRC, California killer Eliot Rodger, who murdered six University of California-Santa Barbara students in 2014, wrote, “I figured this would be the perfect day to attack Isla Vista, but after watching YouTube videos of previous Deltopia parties, I saw that there were way too many cops walking around on such an event. It would be impossible to kill enough of my enemies before being dispatched by those damnable cops.”
Then there's Canadian killer Justin Bourque, who murdered three Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers in his attempt to start a revolution in New Brunswick in 2014. According to CPRC, “On his Facebook page, Bourque posted comics poking fun at how gun-free zones make these crimes possible.”
CPRC also notes that the 2012 Aurora, Colo., “Batman” gunman, James Holmes, drove past seven more-nearby theaters playing the movie to launch his attack at the one theater identified as a “gun-free zone.”
Holmes was able to murder 12 people and wound another 70 before he walked out of the theater and was arrested in the parking lot.
In contrast, Colorado Springs New Life Church gunman Matthew Murray was shot by an armed volunteer security guard after killing just two people in a crowded church service in 2007.
Many mass shootings have been ended quickly, with reduced loss of life, by people with concealed carry permits who acted before police could reach the scene. CPRC points to incidents at malls in Portland, Ore., and Salt Lake City, the Appalachian Law School in Virginia, and shootings in Pearl, Miss., and Edinboro, Pa.
The best thing school administrators can do to protect their charges is to take those gun-free zone signs down, and start allowing faculty members and staff, vigorously trained in gun safety, to carry concealed weapons. The possibility of confronting an armed gym teacher or secretary — who knows who might be carrying? — would dissuade many a would-be mass murderer.
It's time to stop the slogans and the feel-good symbolism. We are blessed to live in a free society, but we'll remain one only as long as the good guys have guns.

Shock. Confusion. Despair. These are only a few words Shawn Whittaker used to describe what he felt after his experience at a local Starbucks this Monday morning.
When Shawn stopped in to get a cappuccino on his way to work, the name written on his beverage was the last thing on his mind. But what he got was an unthinkable assault on his daily routine that left him reeling for minutes after.

“They spelled it S-E-A-N,” Shawn said. “S-E-A-N.”
Left reading incorrect letter after incorrect letter, the 32-year-old accountant was given no choice but to pick up the pieces of his shattered morning pick-me-up. In a world where there is already so much pain, the barista had unceremoniously handed him a drink marked with a different way to spell “Shawn.”
“People need to realize their actions have consequences,” Shawn added. “If I made him a coffee and the name on it sounded right but looked a little wrong, how would he feel?”

Shawn, however, vowed to stand tall in the face of such a grave typo, and to prove it, he's coming back to Starbucks tomorrow to send an important message.
“I would never wish this kind of morning on anyone,” he said. “So I'll loudly call him out on it if it happens again.”
President Donald Trump's administration refused to release visitor logs from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida that would provide the identities of those who have visited the president while he has stayed there.
In July the Department of Justice was ordered by a federal court to finish reviewing Mar-a-Lago visitor records and make them available to the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a liberal nonprofit group that fights for government transparency, according to the New York Times.

On Friday the Justice Department had only "released a State Department list of just 22 names — all of them members of the delegation of the Japanese prime minister — who visited the club in February for a meeting with President Trump," the Times reported.
The defiant decision is the latest example of the Trump administration's lack of transparency, and only stirs more questions regarding Trump's private business that he can still take out money from. It also raises further scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest, and those who have privately spent time with him, and why the president would feel it necessary to hide it from the public.
CREW along with the National Security Archive and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University sued the Department of Homeland Security in April in order to receive visitor logs, from his Florida resort, as well as Trump Tower in New York City and the White House, the Times reported.
CREW requested only to receive visitor logs for those who had specifically met with the president.
The Times elaborated on the lawsuit:
Federal law exempts the White House from the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, which requires public disclosure of government documents. But CREW and its partners argued that because the presidential visitor records are typically maintained by the Secret Service — which is part of the Department of Homeland Security — they should not be exempt from public release.
Judge Katherine Polk Failla, of Federal District Court in Manhattan, ordered the president's administration to hand over "records of presidential visitors at Mar-a-Lago" by September, the Times reported.

Instead, the Justice Department insisted "that presidential schedule information is not subject to FOIA," Chad A. Readler, acting assistant attorney general, wrote in a letter to CREW, according to the Times.
CREW addressed the decision in a statement, and pledged to continue fighting for visitor logs in court.
"The government does not believe that they need to release any further Mar-a-Lago visitor records. We vehemently disagree. The government seriously misrepresented their intentions to both us and the court. This was spitting in the eye of transparency. We will be fighting this in court.

While Trump has also not released his tax returns, a bill recently passed the California State Assembly that, if signed into law, would require all presidential candidates to release their tax returns in order to get their name on the voting ballot.
Edward Snowden has been holed up in a Moscow airport for nearly a month, but now one campaign on the crowdfunding website Indiegogo aims to help the NSA whistleblower make his way out.
The campaign, aptly named "Fly Edward Snowden Fly," was started by Christian Honey, an Oxford University neuroscientist who hopes to raise money for Snowden's travel and legal costs, should he go to Venezuela, where he was offered asylum.
See also: 10 Hysterical Political Parodies on Twitter
The campaign site includes links to a variety of articles, all justifying the end goal of raising $200,000 by outlining limited flight options due to no-fly zones across Europe.
Based on this article, Honey concludes that if Snowden were to opt for Venezuela, he would have to take a private jet. Avoiding Canada, Norway, and even Florida will be costly — the jet will have to fly from Moscow to Caracas without stopping to refuel.
Honey states that any funds left over after covering travel expenses will be used toward financing "asylum applications, legal advice, [and] defense." He also specifies that a bank account will be set up on Snowden's behalf.
The account will apparently be managed by the Rothera and Company LLT in London, which also manages WikiLeaks' fund. Honey even provides a link to WikiLeaks' funding page and the accountants' page.
Honey also includes a YouTube video detailing his mission statement, seen below, and provides a list of others who support Snowden's cause, such as Oliver Stone and Steve Wozniak.
But with only 10 more days of crowdfunding to go and a total of $321 donated as of now, Honey's goal has a long way to go.
Take a look at the video above and let us know what you think of this campaign in the comments.

I'm pretty vocal about my love for Finnish doom-death quartet Hooded Menace. My review of their last full-length was complimentary as Hell, and their two-song vinyl-only EP from last year ranked high on my Best of 2014 list. Given that they're horror-drenched riff-worshippers who theme their songs after the Blind Dead movies, I don't really understand how you can NOT adore this band.
So it was with no small amount of excitement that I received a promo e-mail today announcing that the Menace will be dropping a new album this October. Titled Darkness Drips Forth (fuck yes), the record will contain four horror-drenched epics, and has a wicked cover by Justin Bartlett (known for his work on albums by Dragged Into Sunlight). Fans of Mortician, Electric Wizard, and Malachi should all get ready to download this sonic bloodbath in a couple of months.
Darkness Drips Forth shuffles into the world via Relapse on October 30th, so you can blast it the next day while scaring the shit out of trick-or-treaters. Pre-order it here and watch the album trailer below.

The first major cache of documents released by WikiLeaks, five years ago today, concerned the American prosecution of the war in Afghanistan. The so-called Afghan War Diary was a compendium of nearly 100,000 documents produced mostly by American military and intelligence personnel. In a piece for The Nation the following month, Jeremy Scahill wrote about how the US national-security establishment quickly mobilized to squash any serious debate about what the files contained. Five months later, when WikiLeaks uploaded thousands upon thousands of American diplomatic cables, that process would be duplicated. Ad Policy
There was a brief moment when it seemed the contents of the WikiLeaks documents would spark an inquiry into what they say about the war and the way the United States is conducting it. “However illegally these documents came to light, they raise serious questions about the reality of America's policy toward Pakistan and Afghanistan,” said Senator John Kerry, chair of the powerful Foreign Relations Committee, on the day the documents were revealed. “Those policies are at a critical stage, and these documents may very well underscore the stakes and make the calibrations needed to get the policy right more urgent.” But two days later the official meme about Wikileaks was in full swing: “I think it's important not to overhype or get excessively excited about the meaning of those documents,” Kerry said at a hearing on Afghanistan. But what if what Daniel Ellsberg says about the leaker being a heroic whistleblower is true? What if, like Ellsberg with the Pentagon Papers, Manning really was motivated by conscience to leak documents he believed the American people and the world deserved to see?

Making your way in the world today takes everything you've got.
Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot.
Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go
Where everybody knows your name,
and they're always glad you came.
You wanna be where you can see,
our troubles are all the same
You wanna be where everybody knows
Your name.
You wanna go where people know,
people are all the same,
You wanna go where everybody knows
your name.
You wanna go where people know,
people are all the same,
You wanna go where everybody knows
your name.
[Full Lyrics from Season 1]
Making your way in the world today
Takes everything you've got;
Taking a break from all your worries
Sure would help a lot.
Wouldn't you like to get away?
All those night when you've got no lights,
The check is in the mail;
And your little angel
Hung the cat up by it's tail;
And your third fiance didn't show;
Sometimes you want to go
Where everybody knows your name,
And they're always glad you came;
You want to be where you can see,
Our troubles are all the same;
You want to be where everybody knows your name.
Roll out of bed, Mr. Coffee's dead;
The morning's looking bright;
And your shrink ran off to Europe,
And didn't even write;
And your husband wants to be a girl;
Be glad there's one place in the world
Where everybody knows your name,
And they're always glad you came;
You want to go where people know,
People are all the same;
You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Where everybody knows your name,
And they're always glad you came;
Where everybody knows your name,
And they're always glad you came...
Update, 11:00 a.m.: Sources tell us the guitarist touring in Knight's place is Brandon Ellis (Cannabis Corpse, Arsis). Still no word on whether or not he's replacing Knight permanently or is just filling-in for this tour. Original story follows below.
Multiple MetalSucks readers who have seen The Black Dahlia Murder on their current tour of Europe have alerted us to the fact that the band is performing without their lead guitarist, Ryan Knight. Fan filmed video and photos confirm this to be the case — even with the face out of focus, it's clear from his stage movements that whomever is touring with the band right now is not Knight.
Knight is, however, present in this video of the band performing in Ohio last month:
So what's going on? Is Knight out of the band, or just sitting out the current trek for some reason?
In January of 2012, the band toured Europe without then-bassist Ryan “Bart” Williams; that April, they confirmed that Williams was leaving the group and being replaced by Max Lavelle, the bassist who had done that tour. Hopefully that's not the case here — Knight is an incredible musician and it would be really sad to see him split.
Representatives for Metal Blade Records, TBDM's label, declined to comment. We'll let you know more as soon as we do.

Author and illustrator Maurice Sendak, whose classic children's book Where the Wild Things Are become a perennial and award-winning favorite for generations of children, died Tuesday. He was 83.
Sendak appeared on Fresh Air with Terry Gross several times over the years. In 1989, he told Terry Gross that he didn't ever write with children in mind — but that somehow what he wrote turned out to be for children nonetheless.

Over the course of his career, his children's books received numerous awards, including the 1964 Caldecott Medal for Where the Wild Things Are. Playwright Tony Kushner later called Sendak "one of the most important, if not the most important, writers and artists to ever work in children's literature. In fact, he's a significant writer and artist in literature. Period."
Sendak was born in Brooklyn to Polish immigrants. He often described himself as having "no childhood" because much of his extended family died in the Holocaust. His parents kept the information from him, but he picked up bits of information about his missing relatives from his older siblings.
"Do parents sit down and tell their kids everything? I don't know. I don't know," he told Gross in a 2003 conversation. "I've convinced myself — I hope I'm right — that children despair of you if you don't tell them the truth."

Over the years, Sendak corresponded through letters with many of his readers. He called the relationship with them "intensely private."
"I have been with them in their bedroom, for a good part of their childhood," he said. "They have written to me. They trust me in a way, I daresay, possibly more than they trust their parents. I'm not going to bull- - - - them. I'm just not. And if they don't like what they hear, that's tough bananas."
Sendak said he never wanted children of his own. He lived for decades with his longtime partner, Eugene Glynn, who died in 2007. Sendak wrote his most recent book Bumble-ardy, while taking care of Glynn.
"When I did Bumble-ardy, I was so intensely aware of death," he told Gross in 2011. "Eugene, my friend and partner, was dying here in the house when I did Bumble-ardy. I did Bumble-ardy to save myself. I did not want to die with him. I wanted to live, as any human being does. But there's no question that the book was affected by what was going on here in the house. Bumble-ardy was a combination of the deepest pain and the wondrous feeling of coming into my own. And it took a long time. It took a very long time."
Interview Highlights From 2003
On how his parents reminded him endlessly of his own good fortune after the Holocaust
"If I came up late for dinner, I'd hear about Leo and Benjamin and the other children who were my age who could never come home for supper and were good to their mothers but now they were dead, and I was lucky. ... I hated [the people who died in the Holocaust] for dying because all they brought was violent scenes in the house between my mother and father and her pulling hair out of her head, my father diving onto the bed, and it's vivid memories."
You know who my gods are, who I believe in fervently? Herman Melville, Emily Dickinson — she's probably the top — Mozart, Shakespeare, Keats. These are wonderful gods who have gotten me through the narrow straits of life.
On faith
"I am not a religious person, nor do I have any regrets. The war took care of that for me. You know, I was brought up strictly kosher, but I — it made no sense to me. It made no sense to me what was happening. So nothing of it means anything to me. Nothing. Except these few little trivial things that are related to being Jewish. ... You know who my gods are, who I believe in fervently? Herman Melville, Emily Dickinson — she's probably the top — Mozart, Shakespeare, Keats. These are wonderful gods who have gotten me through the narrow straits of life."
On depression and therapy
"I couldn't hold myself together till I left the nest and I got uptown. And everyone said, 'Oh, you're so talented and you're going to get a book and you're' — and, of course, nothing happened as soon as I wanted it to. And then I did get a job. I worked at FAO Schwarz in the window; I did window displays ... and I painted things and stuff, and then I keeled over. I just really ran out of steam and I was too frightened. I just lost it. And a very good friend of mine then paid for my first session. He said, 'You have to help yourself.' And I went and I stayed for 10 years. ... I know there are supposedly happy people in this world. I never believed it, but I take it for granted. God knows, they're all on television."

Interview Highlights From 2011
On his current writing
"I feel like I'm working for myself at this point. If it's publishable, fine. If not, it makes not too much difference. Because I claim that this time is for me and me alone. I'm 83 years old.
"I'm writing a poem right now about a nose. I've always wanted to write a poem about a nose. But it's a ludicrous subject. That's why, when I was younger, I was afraid of [writing] something that didn't make a lot of sense. But now I'm not. I have nothing to worry about. It doesn't matter."
I have nothing now but praise for my life. I'm not unhappy. I cry a lot because I miss people. They die and I can't stop them. They leave me and I love them more. ... What I dread is the isolation. ... There are so many beautiful things in the world which I will have to leave when I die, but I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.
On wishing he had children, sort of
"I would infinitely prefer a daughter. If I had a son, I would leave him at the A&P or some other big advertising place where somebody who needs a kid would find him and he would be all right. ... A daughter would be drawn to me. A daughter would want to help me. Girls are infinitely more complicated than boys, and women more than men. And there's no doubt about that. We just don't like to think about it. Certainly the men don't like to think about it. I have lived my whole life with a dream daughter."
On not discussing therapy sessions with his late partner, a psychoanalyst
"It just seemed like, why? It just seemed inauthentic and incorrect to burden him with that. My therapy went on forever. My being gay was something of not great interest to me. The person I lived with — we lived together for all of those years, so we made trips to our favorite places in Europe, so that we could read our favorite books, so that we could listen to music.
"I couldn't deal with 9/11 the other day. I couldn't bear it. ... That evening of 9/11, they conducted Mahler's 2nd Symphony. ... And I sat there and cried like a baby listening to the music."
On being gay
"Finding out that I was gay when I was older was a shock and a disappointment. ... I did not want to be gay. It meant a whole different thing to me — which is really hard to recover now because that's many years ago. I always objected to it because there is a part of me that is solid Brooklyn and solid conventional, and I know that. I can't escape that. It's my genetic makeup. It's who I am."
On his life
"I have nothing now but praise for my life. I'm not unhappy. I cry a lot because I miss people. They die and I can't stop them. They leave me and I love them more. ... What I dread is the isolation. ... There are so many beautiful things in the world which I will have to leave when I die, but I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready."
The Florida-LSU game, which was postponed from Oct. 8 and rescheduled Nov. 19, was discussed widely in the national media for its importance to the SEC division races. While the result could ultimately decide which teams get to go to Atlanta, ESPN's Football Power Index shows that the Gators and Tigers themselves have slim chances of winning a conference championship.
Per @ESPNStatsInfo: LSU has nation's toughest remaining schedule. Is No. 8 in FPI. Has 4 pct chance to win out, win SEC pic.twitter.com/oizgQe8gw9 — David Ching (@ESPNChing) October 17, 2016
LSU has the toughest remaining schedule according to the ESPN metric, which gives the Tigers only a 4 percent chance of winning out and the same chance of winning the SEC. Interim coach Ed Orgeron has a difficult schedule ahead of him (Ole Miss, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida and Texas A&M) as he tries to earn the full-time job.
While the above graphic shows Florida having a 0 percent chance of winning out, the actual website shows 0.4 percent (to quote “Dumb and Dumber,” there is a chance). UF's remaining schedule is considered the seventh-most difficult, and includes games against Georgia, Arkansas, LSU and FSU all away from The Swamp. With that in mind, it might not have been wise for Florida cornerback Quincy Wilson to start trolling Tennessee over a one-game advantage in the SEC East standings.
They are beaten to death or have throats slit as traumatised animals watch
And most of the cats and dogs being slaughtered are still wearing collars
Found thousands of animals still being taken in tiny cages and killed there
The Yulin 'meat' festival is where thousands of dogs and cat are eaten
Thousands of stolen pets are being slaughtered for a Chinese 'dog meat festival' which local authorities said was shut down last year, MailOnline has learned.
The local government in Yulin, central China, said they banned the decades-old local tradition after two million furious campaigners in China called for an end to the bloody practice.
But an undercover investigation has found as many as 10,000 helpless animals - many of them still wearing collars having been stolen away from loving homes - are being brought to the city ahead of the festival on June 22.
Many animals die from shock, starvation and dehydration on the journey. The traumatised ones who do survive are beaten to death or their throats slit in street markets and illegal slaughterhouses, animal rights campaigners told MailOnline.

Business: With over a month to go before the festival traditionally begins, an HSI investigation found hundreds of newly-slaughtered dogs in the city on the market ready to be sold
Shocking: HSI's expert Peter Li was so saddened by what he saw that he decided to rescue two dogs and two cats - one of whom (pictured) was wearing a pink collar
Mistreated: After agreeing to sell the cat to Peter Li, the slaughterhouse worker hooked it by its neck (pictured) to place it in a wire cage for him
No way out: And some of the cats (pictured) suffer such horrendous injuries on their journeys to Yulin from all over China, they can barely stand once taken out of the tiny wire cages
Inhumane: The investigation carried out by Humane Society International (HSI) found cats and dogs are still being brought to the city in wire cages which are so small some animals (pictured) die on the journey
Trapped: Once they arrive in Yulin, the dogs (pictured) are beaten to death before their meat is sold at the annual festival held on June's summer solstice
Humane Society International (HSI) launched an investigation after it suspected thousands of cats and dogs are still being inhumanely killed there in their thousands.
Despite assurances the festival had been banned, HSI's Peter Li discovered hundreds of newly- slaughtered dogs impaled on spikes and cats crammed so tightly into tiny wire cages 'they could not breathe'.
Some could barely stand in their squalid pens because they suffered broken bones and severe wounds from the horrendous journey.
He found that local slaughterhouse workers were instructed to only kill animals under the cover of darkness and restaurants were told to remove the words 'dog meat' from their menus in an attempt to cover up the festival's existence.
'Mass dog slaughter is still going on at Yulin despite the local authorities trying to give the impression that it is ended' Mr Li told MailOnline.
'The Yulin government has declared the "festival" will not happen, but this is mere semantics and thousands of dogs will still die for their meat whether it's called a festival or not.'
He was alarmed at the dangerously unhygienic conditions in which the animals were being killed and described the smell at a slaughterhouse just outside Dongkou - where the 'end of slaughter process' takes place - as 'offensive'.
Cruel: An investigation fround one of China's bloodiest 'meat festivals' - where thousands of stolen cats and dogs are slaughtered - will still go ahead in the city of Yulin (pictured) even though the local government 'banned' it
Brutal: While in Yulin last week, the HSI investigation discovered hundreds of slaughtered dogs impaled on spikes and cats crammed so tightly into tiny wire cages 'they could not breathe' (pictured)
Chilling: HSI told MailOnline the dogs' throats are cut open while they are still alive. Many of the dogs and cats on sale are thought to be domestic pets snatched off the streets
'The place was full of blood, internal organs of the dogs and cats, blow torched carcasses, and freshly slaughtered dogs hanging on hooks' Mr Li added.
'We saw two wire cages filled with cats waiting to be slaughtered the next day. They were suffering from long journeys, food deprivation, mental trauma, and illnesses. Some of them wore collars. '
It is legal to eat dogs in China and the country has no law protecting the welfare of pets but its Ministry of Agriculture has strict rules which require cats and dogs to have 'health certificates' before they are transported.
The mass-transport of animals over long distances increases the risk of rabies and threatens the health and safety of the people who eat them.

Guangxi province historically has the highest number of rabies death in China and Yulin - based in its south-west - recorded 338 deaths from rabies between 2002 and 2006 alone, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare.
Mr Li was so overcome with sadness at the sight of the suffering animals in potentially-disease-ridden slaughterhouses that he rescued two dogs and two cats from the painful deaths that awaited them.
'It was heartbreaking when I approached their filthy enclosure, they came up to me hopefully and one frantically followed my fingers with his nose,' he said.
'Like so many of the others, he [the dog] had probably been someone's household pet who was stolen away from his family for this meat trade.
'Another small dog who was always close by this first dog was so quiet as if he was broken spirited, knowing what fate could befall him... Their faces were just so unforgettable.'
'Their eyes.... I knew I couldn't help all these poor animals, but I had to try to change the life of these two fellows.'
'I just told the slaughterhouse worker that I wanted to take these two dogs out of this place of misery, and he accepted... If I'd asked for them all I would have come away empty handed.'

Cruel end: And inside the unhygienic slaughterhouses, hundreds of bemused dogs await a brutal and painful death

Posing as a local merchant, investigator Mr Li was about to walk away with the rescued dogs when he noticed an emaciated cat clinging on to the side of its enclosure.
He added: 'She was in such a poor state. Filthy with wild, wide eyes... Her eyes were heart-wrenching, she was clearly terrified. And the pink collar still around her neck was proof that she used to have a loving home.
'She must have been utterly bewildered. She too had a companion who shadowed her, sticking close to each other for protection I guess.
She was in such a poor state. Filthy with wild, wide eyes... Her eyes were heart-wrenching, she was clearly terrified. And the pink collar still around her neck was proof that she used to have a loving home
'They're coming with me too,' he told the slaughterhouse worker, trying not to reveal his emotions in case he discovered why Li was really there.
The 'Yulin Four' are now recovering from their horrendous injuries and mental trauma at a shelter in China, but thousands of others will soon be cut up while still alive - and their meat sold at the markets in Yulin.
China's dog meat trade is neither limited to the summer solstice nor the Yulin markets, with as many as 20 million dogs being killed for consumption in the country every year.
But the Chinese public - particularly younger generations - has turned against the trade and many protests have been held in recent weeks which forced some slaughterhouses to close down their operations.
Peter added that Yulin's authorities are 'very nervous' and have issued warnings to meat sellers to be ready for the protesters from all over the world to descend on the city as the festival's date approaches.
But he claims the dog meat trade is on the decline and at this time of year - when the trade is at its busiest - he only saw two open stores in the infamous Dongkou Market, where seven stores were open last year.
He worryingly predicts many more stores may open nearer the summer solstice, as meat sellers and butchers descend on the city to make money.
Chinese legends say eating dog meat dispels evil ghosts and disease and can even boost men's sexual performance, according to the South China Morning Post.
The tradition is not unique to Yulin. Other cities in the Zhejiang, Guangxi, and Guangdong provinces - the booming industrial town of Dongguan among them - are also known to be avid consumers of dog meat.
MailOnline has contacted Yulin's local government for comment but they have yet to reply.

It has been conceived as one of the continent's most ambitious urban planning projects: a city of gleaming high-rise towers, arching pedestrian walkways, green spaces, fountains and an effective public transport system. The reimagined Kigali will be decentralised, with satellite towns, business, leisure and shopping districts, as well as a wetlands conservation area.
Twenty years after Rwandan capital was decimated by 100 days of killing, its population of 1.22 million is now expected to triple by 2040. The development plan has won international awards, but detractors argue that at best the vision is beautifully unrealistic, and at worst a work of fantasy that fails to take into account the demographic and economic challenges facing the east African country.
"Who are these buildings for, tourists, the creme de la creme of society?" asks one of the city's intellectuals, who requests not to be named. "Fine, but we ask: where are normal people going to sleep tonight?"
In Kigali's "one-stop centre" for construction, on the ninth floor of the glass-and-steel Grand Pension Plaza, architects' impressions of the future cover the walls. From here it is possible to see half a dozen building projects already under way. Liliane Mupende, the director of urban planning and construction, takes pains to point them out, noting that some are financed by Rwandan investors and others by foreigners.

While the flashy promotional videos don't dwell on where Kigali's mainly low-earning residents will live, possible solutions for affordable housing are quietly on show in the office. "Creating affordable housing is one of our greatest challenges," admits Mupende.
By demolishing informal housing - an estimated 70% of all dwellings in the capital - and creating more high-density areas, the city is "getting itself organised so future generations don't face what we are facing now", she says. Rent-to-own schemes are being considered and the government will enforce regulations that set quotas of affordable building for any purchased land.
Despite empty patches of land, and half-filled new office blocks in which many find space too expensive to rent, Mupende insists the scheme is realistic and workable. "We are trying to establish how we can best use our limited resources to provide for future generations," she says. "It is a long-term plan. Yes, it is bold, but you have to be bold to achieve anything of note. When you dive into a pool, you don't aim for very close to the side, [but] try and get as far as you can go and then see where you end up."
Supporters say the plans, designed by Oz Architects and developed by Surbana, an urban planning consortium based in Singapore, fit with President Paul Kagame's ambition to drive Rwanda's economy forwards. In 2012 Rwanda jumped to 52nd on the World Bank's "ease of doing business" rankings, from 158th in 2005, after Kagame set up a special unit to analyse and crack its ratings system.
That ambition has a darker side too: Kagame has been accused of locking up street hawkers and beggars to keep Kigali's streets clean. When the New York Times alleged that street children had been rounded up and placed in a detention centre on the island of Iwawa on the remote Lake Kivu, the government responded by saying Iwawa was "a vocational training centre, and it has not only taught the youth life-changing skills but also helped them get off drugs". It said students could be seen "singing, dancing, chanting and showing off their new hard-earned skills" at graduation ceremonies.
As part of the development, many businesses in the boisterous downtown shopping district have been boarded up, and nearby shopkeepers know they are next. "Development is good but to change the situation of a country is not a small thing, we have to go step by step – but this is very, very quick," says Celestin Pierre Munyendamutsa, 32, behind the counter of his small kiosk that sells paper and ink cartridges. "For me, that isn't easy, it means we have to go and find somewhere else to do business."
Another shopkeeper, who did not want to give his name, said he paid around 400,000 francs (£355) a month in rent, but in the new glittering mall next door he would have to pay 1m francs (around £880). "That's not good business," he says. Asked where he will go when the time comes, he gives a bark of a laugh. "What do you want me to do? I will go home to sleep."

Guillaume Sardin, a French architect and co-founder of the George Pericles thinktank, who works in the city, says the Kigali masterplan is a smart piece of branding. "It is a very clever way of putting yourself on the map, of saying: 'Yes you may remember us for one thing, but we can also be something else.' The plans are beautiful, but the problem is the implementation – there is a gap between the perception and the reality. But the positive news is the city is listening."
A new middle class is emerging, which includes members of the diaspora such as Matthew Rugamba, who started his own House of Tayo fashion brand after studying in the US. "I was fed up of seeing the pity in people's eyes when I told them I was Rwandan," he says. "So I decided to create something, so I could change perceptions."
Building of new homes has started in Kigali suburbs that are little more than villages perched on the edge of red-dirt roads. In Kinyinya, about a 20-minute taxi moto ride from the centre, a new apartment block with glass sliding doors leading out on to balconies is nearly finished. Here a two-bed apartment will cost in the region of £80,000 – in the 25th poorest country in the world, where 45% of the population live in poverty.
The block is moments away from a vibrant little town centre where music blares out of laptop speakers and people haggle over fresh produce and admire the new trainers for sale on a show stall. Elias Dusable, 31, a taxi moto driver who rents a small house with no running water for about 25,000 francs (£22) a month, says he is relaxed about the new homes. "If my country is developing and beautiful then I have no problem with that," he says. "These are homes for rich people, but their riches came from God. So maybe one day I will be that rich too."
Not too long ago, a graphic designer on Twitter imagined what a white iPhone 8 would look like, after seeing that parts leaks failed to show a white iPhone 8 color. While those 3D renders looked gorgeous, I did say at the time that a white iPhone 8 would be a lot uglier than black versions because of cutout at the top of the display. There's no way to make it disappear if the surrounding are is painted white. The black version, on the other hand, will merge with the black of the OLED screen quite well.
A new report from earlier this week has stated that Apple won't make any white iPhone 8 versions, and we sincerely hope the rumor is accurate. In fact, this is exactly what we asked for when we wrote about how Apple could salvage its potentially hideous iPhone 8 display design.
Japanese-language blog Macotakara wrote at length about the iPhone 8 in a post the other day, making various claims about the phone. The blog said the iPhone 8 will see significant delays and said there's no Touch ID sensor in the power button or on the back side of the phone. It also added that Apple is indeed bringing advanced 3D facial recognition to the iPhone.
As for the colors, the site said the front-facing frame won't be painted white. It also noted that there's a high possibility that there won't be too many iPhone 8 colors to choose from. Is is possible that Apple would launch the iPhone 8 in only one color? Apple has increased the number of color options for the iPhone in recent years. What might prevent it from painting the rear shell of the handset in some of the “traditional” iPhone colors, like the ones available on the iPhone 7?
The rear shell on the iPhone 8 will be made of glass, and we all know that Apple encountered production issues with the white iPhone 4 model, which launched after a huge delay. But that was all the way back in 2011. The smartphone manufacturing business has evolved since then, so it's unlikely that Apple still has to deal with painting glass in colors other than black. Just look at Samsung's flagship phones, which all feature glass backs in a variety of colors.
Samsung adopted a glass sandwich design for the Galaxy S family starting with the Galaxy S6 in 2014. A rear glass panel is required on these phones, to enable wireless charging. Yet Samsung was able to paint that glass rear shell in a variety of colors for all its flagship devices released since 2014.
Whatever colors Apple has in store for the iPhone 8 this year, let's hope white isn't one of them.
Every year brings a new batch of data regarding the progression and likely effects of climate change, and the results are almost always worse than previous models had predicted. In fact, they're frankly terrifying: rapid and accelerating deterioration of the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets that will yield massive sea-level rise and submerge coastal cities; paralyzing drought on continental interiors that will lead to Dust Bowl–style famine; and incredibly powerful floods and storms that happen more frequently — five times as often now, in fact, as in the 1970s.
Most of the worst predicted outcomes will occur down the road. In the meantime, though, the people making these predictions — climate scientists — are dealing with a heavy psychological toll, as a piece in Esquire by John H. Richardson points out. They are living, as Richardson puts it, a “surreal existence.”
One psychologist who works with climate scientists told Richardson they suffer from “pre-traumatic stress,” the overwhelming sense of anger, panic, and “obsessive-intrusive thoughts” that results when your work every day is to chart a planetary future that looks increasingly apocalyptic. Some climatologists merely report depression and feelings of hopelessness. Others, resigned to our shared fate, have written what amount to survival guides for a sort of Mad Max dystopian future where civilization has broken down under the pressures of resource scarcity and habitat erosion.
This kind of doom and gloom is not shared across the board, but nearly all climate scientists harbor serious doubts about the industrialized (and industrializing) world's willingness to meet the challenges we face, which of course compounds their trauma. And perhaps the biggest indicator of that unwillingness is the constant attacks climate scientists endure at the hands of climate-change deniers — attacks that leave their own psychological bruises.
Michael Mann of Penn State is perhaps the best-known (and, in some circles, most reviled) American climate scientist for his work on the “hockey-stick graph.” After that report, as Esquire notes, he “was denounced in Congress, got death threats, was accused of fraud, received white powder in the mail,” and was told he and his family deserved to be “shot, quartered, and fed to the pigs,” while “a British journalist suggested the electric chair.” A Jim Inhofe–led senate committee threatened him with federal prosecution.
The article is chock full of stories like this: Gavin Schmidt of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies admits he lapsed into “an episode of serious depression” after he was one of thousands of scientists to be hacked shortly before a climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009, while Camille Parmesan of the University of Texas announced she was suffering “professional depression” after the 2009 summit ultimately failed and Texas governor Rick Perry removed the sections on sea-level rise from a report she authored about the future of Galveston Bay.
While there's a lot to lament about their current situation, researchers have discovered one solution to the climate-change blues: Parmesan and quite a few others have moved from the U.S. to Europe.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he hopes the constitutionality of his executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries doesn't have to come down to the Supreme Court.
“We're gonna take it through the system,” Trump told reporters during a listening session with county sheriffs in the Roosevelt Room. “It's very important for the country. Regardless of me or whoever succeeds at a later date.”

It's unclear what the president meant by the latter statement, which could be interpreted as a concession that his administration may not win its case or a nod to the sedate judicial process.
Trump signed the controversial executive order on Jan. 27. It immediately sparked mass protests at airports around the country, faced legal challenges and was panned for its poorly executed rollout.
U.S. District Court Judge James Robart issued a ruling Friday that effectively halted Trump's order. Robart has since been a target of the White House's ire, including shots from the president blasting the “so-called judge” and his ruling in a flurry of tweets.
Trump argued Tuesday that the U.S. has to have security. “If you remember, ISIS said, ‘We are going to infiltrate the United States and other countries through the migration,'” Trump told reporters. “And then we're not allowed to be tough on the people coming in? Explain that one.”
The president defaulted to his stock position of “we'll see what happens,” but he highlighted the legal challenge as “a big court case.” He contended, however, that his administration is “well represented,” adding, again, that “we're gonna see what happens.”
“It could” go to the Supreme Court, Trump said. “I mean, we'll see. Hopefully it doesn't have to. It's common sense. You know some things are law, and I'm all in favor of that. And some things are common sense. This is common sense.”
The court is currently divided, with justices tying 4-4 on many rulings. The president recently nominated conservative Judge Neil Gorsuch to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. If confirmed, the court would revert back to its conservative tilt.
The dream houses. The dream wedding. The dream kitchen. The dream vacations.
All too often pursuing these dreams is a total nightmare.
Why? Because the typical options available for getting the money you need to make these dreams a reality aren't that great. If you own a home you can pursue a home equity line of credit (HELOC), but that process often takes weeks and comes with a ton of paperwork – and there's no guarantee you'll actually get the loan. Alternatively, you can take money out of your investment account, but you may have to pay taxes on the withdrawal (not to mention shrinking your nest egg!).

Edinson Cavani saw his scintillating bicycle kick scratched off against Barcelona. But which do you think is the best (n)ever?
Barcelona defeated Napoli 5-0 in the pre-season Joan Gamper Trophy at Camp Nou on Monday, Cesc Fábregas opening the scoring and Leo Messi knocking in a 15-minute second-half hat-trick. But it could all have been so different for the Italians.
After just 10 minutes Marek Hamsik nodded across goal and Edinson Cavani sent a thunderous overhead kick past José Manuel Pinto in the Barcelona goal, rattling in the effort off the underside of the bar. The celebrations were short-lived however – Hamsik had been flagged offside in the build-up.
The Uruguayan's effort joins the ranks of the very best goals-that-never-were. Kevin Keegan's similarly acrobatic effort for Southampton against Manchester United in 1981 was ruled out by the referee, as was Cristiano Ronaldo's sensational effort for Portugal against Spain last year (blame Nani for that one).
Then there are the goals that the officials failed to spot – Gonzalo Bazan's screamer for Independiente Rivadavia that bounced back off the stanchion and, of course, Clive Allen's thumping free-kick for Crystal Palace in 1980 (as recreated by Baddiel and Skinner) – and the ones you wished were given: George Best flicking the ball away from Gordon Banks in 1971 and Peter Schmeichel's last-minute overhead kick. And then there's the whole sub-section of great near misses.
Does Cavani top the list? And which ones have we missed?
Raiders safety Charles Woodson will conclude his 18-year career on Sunday. The nine-time Pro Bowler -- the only person in NFL history to record at least 50 interceptions and 20 sacks in a career -- has agreed to share thoughts during his final week. Following is the first installment, submitted Monday night.
The alarm was set for 6 a.m., but like most mornings I was awake before it went off. My first thought wasn't football. It was the drive. It's 40 minutes from my house in Danville to the training complex in Alameda, and since I'm not too fond of driving any type of distance, 40 minutes feels long to me.
I like to listen to the news on my way to work. That's where I catch up on current affairs or make phone calls if I need to. I listen to CNN or MSNBC a lot, so I know what's going on around the world. There are so many things happening, as far as the terrorist attacks and whatnot, I want to keep myself aware. You're in a bubble a lot of times in the NFL, so you're kind of removed from everything that's happening in the real world, like, the shootings in Chicago. The story that stuck with me this morning was Tamir Rice, the young boy who pulled out a plastic toy gun and ended up being shot to death by the police, and how the grand jury didn't indict the officers. That was a big one for me today.
I wanted to make it business as usual when I arrived at the facility. It was important to go through my everyday routine and keep things the same because I still have work to do. My NFL portrait is not finished yet, and it won't be until this last game is over. But it was on my mind. It crossed my mind every moment I was out there. It was like, everything I do now -- going to meetings, special-teams period, getting in the hot tub, getting in the cold tub, maybe the steam room -- this'll be the last week that I do it. This week when I heat and steam on my shoulder and knee and groin, I'll be thinking about how this would be the last week I will do it.
While I'm sitting there, a part of me is experiencing -- let me see if I can find the word -- it's a little bit of apprehension because I'm 39 years old and I've been playing some type of organized football since I was 6, and I know this is going to be my last week doing it. But at the same time there's a part of me that's happy because I was able to do it my way and leave the game the way I wanted to leave it.
The funny thing about it is, I don't know that I can actually explain what it was that led me to say it's time to retire.

I woke up the morning of the Detroit game and, almost immediately, I was like, This is it. Why? What hit me in that moment? I guess I felt like if somebody would've called and said, "C-Wood, the weather's so bad around the city, nobody can get anywhere, and the game's actually been canceled," I would've been all right with it. I've never felt that way about being in a game before. Never in my life on game day did I feel like I would be cool with it if the game wasn't played. To feel like that on a Sunday, I knew it was time. It just hit me out of the blue.
When I was a young player, I used to always say to myself that I would see retirement coming, that I would know exactly when I'm going to do it. Back then, I always said it was going to be during training camp because I hated training camp and the two-a-day practices. But training camp is so easy now, I knew it wouldn't hit me then.
I had a lot of people reach out to me when I made my announcement, but the moments that meant the most to me came inside the facility. When I first called owner Mark Davis and informed him that this was going to be my last year, he kind of chuckled like, "No way, man." It was almost like, "I'm not letting you retire. You're playing too well, and you've got to come back next year." That meant a lot to me, for the owner to want me to come back, being that I'm 39. Then talking to general manager Reggie McKenzie, and him saying how he felt about me as a player, just telling me that I played the game the right way and it was a joy to watch me play, that meant a lot. He said how when I was a free agent the first time and he was in Green Bay, he had to have me; then when he arrived in Oakland, he felt he had to have me again. And then coach Jack Del Rio, who told me, "Charles, I feel like you're doing it the right way."
Somebody asked me today what's the difference between my last college game and this being my last NFL game. The one difference is that there is nothing after this game. There isn't another level to the game I can go to as a player. There's finality with this game that hasn't been a part of any other game I've ever been in. We were out there running today, doing our conditioning, and Derek Carr was like, "Wood, these are going to be your last tempos." He was right about one thing -- this will be my last time running tempos as an NFL player.
I was trying not to think about it, but it's there. Each day there's going to be something that I'm doing for the last time. Bittersweet. That's probably the best way to describe it.

October 2012′s Top 10 Commercial Apps [App name (September position)]
The woman went to the Sparkasse bank in Neuss, North Rhine-Westphalia, last Wednesday to make a transfer, but an employee would not let her enter, reported the Neuss-Grevenbroicher Zeitung.
The 20-year-old woman said the bank employee stood in her way, blocking her from entering and asked her to leave.
She offered to remove the veil from her face in order to identify herself, but this apparently did not resolve the situation and it escalated into a loud confrontation.
The woman said the employee pushed her, leaving a mark on her body because she was carrying heavy shopping bags.
By the time police arrived, the woman had already left, but she later filed a complaint alleging bodily harm.
A spokesperson for Sparkasse Neuss denied the woman's version of events and said that the employee had simply tried to explain that the niqab - which covers the face and head, except for the eyes - violated the bank's ban on masks.
"It is incredibly important to us that this does not become a matter of religion, but of security," said Sparkasse Neuss spokesman Stephan Meiser.
A sign near the bank's entrance shows a crossed out motorcycle helmet to explain their no-mask policy, and it was this sign that the employee was trying to explain, the spokesman said.
The woman's offer to remove her veil in a private room and show her ID in the presence of a female employee was not an option for the bank, the spokesman said, because of security concerns. He explained that this would present a risk to the employee if she had a weapon.
But a spokesman of Stadtsparkasse Düsseldorf told the Neuss-Grevenbroicher Zeitung that the bank allows women wearing religious coverings to be identified by a female employee in a separate room.
“If we assumed all customers had criminal intentions, we wouldn't give out any more money,” said Stadtsparkasse Düsseldorf spokesman Gerd Meyer.
The woman's husband, who was born in Germany to a Turkish family, said the couple has made an appointment with a psychologist because of the incident.
Remember how the Freedom From Religion Foundation asked the Kountze Independent School District to stop letting cheerleaders hold run-through banners at football games with Bible verses on them?
Now, the Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott is getting involved. Yesterday, he sent a letter (PDF) to Kountze ISD Superintendent Kevin Weldon “offering assistance” to them:
I write to offer my assistance and to provide advice about a menacing and misleading letter you recently received from an organization called the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF). That organization has a long history of attempting to bully school districts into adopting restrictive religious speech policies that go well beyond what is required by the United States Constitution. Consistent with that history, the letter you received incorrectly claims that allowing Kountze High School cheerleaders to display banners decorated with Bible verses at football games amounts to a “serious and flagrant violation of the First Amendment.” That exaggerated claim is not supported by the Constitution. Instead, it is based solely on FFRF's distorted, anti-religion view of the First Amendment, a view that is unsupported by court precedent and has recently been rejected by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. … Think about it: Can a school district or the Freedom From Religion Foundation stop a student from making the sign of the cross before taking a test, or stop football players from pointing toward heaven after scoring a touchdown or kneeling to pray for an injured teammate? Of course not. Just like the cheerleaders' banners, such public displays of religion are voluntary expressions of the students' beliefs and are not attributable to the school district. … The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently vindicated these legal principles—and rejected FFRF's restrictive view of the First Amendment — in a case involving Medina Valley ISD in Castroville, Texas. In May 2011, a group called Americans United for Separation of Church and State filed a lawsuit against Medina Valley in an attempt to prevent student speakers from praying as part of their speech at their graduation ceremony. My office supported the school district by arguing that the First Amendment does not require public schools to interfere with students' right to freely express their religious beliefs. A unanimous panel of three federal appeals judges ruled in favor of the school district and permitted Medina Valley High School seniors to pray at their graduation ceremony…
That last bit is an absolute distortion of the facts.
In that particular case, the Appeals Court initially voted in favor of the school district. But after Americans United filed an amended complaint a few months later — with additional details they had discovered — the two sides resolved their differences through a settlement agreement. (AU explains how this all went down in far more detail here.)
Hardly a unanimous victory in favor of religion.
I'm amazed that the Attorney General wants to get involved in a case that has been settled time and time again. FFRF wins these cases all the time because they're right on the issues and the judges know it.
You can't endorse religion as representatives of your public school. Your principal can't lead the staff in prayer at a faculty meeting. The administration can't begin a graduation ceremony with a Christian prayer. And cheerleaders can't promote the Bible at a football game.
Individually, they can do whatever they want. When they're competing/performing as part of a public school athletic team, they can't.
But Greg Abbott is ready to file a brief on behalf of the school district… because promoting faith is more important to him than upholding the law.

***Update***: Well, shit, this comment on Facebook, on a post about this story, is just frightening:
For introverts, New Englanders, and other taciturn types, opening up to new people, or even our oldest friends, can be a challenge. But people with a genetic disorder called Williams syndrome have no problem opening up—that is the problem. The disorder, which affects one in 10,000 people, or roughly 30,000 Americans, inspires a feeling of kinship and closeness with everyone they encounter. They might hug strangers at the grocery store, tell checkout clerks they love them, and invite everyone in the parking lot over for a slumber party.
It's terrifying for their parents, who fear the risk of exploitation that comes with unconditional love and indiscriminate trust. But people with Williams syndrome radiate joy. When one young man with Williams attempted to describe his condition, he was momentarily at a loss for words. "It's…" he said thoughtfully, then smiled broadly. "It's like a party!"
He wasn't entirely wrong. Williams is sometimes called "cocktail party syndrome" because of its tendency to make people extremely outgoing and irrepressibly friendly.
In the mid-1990s, when scientists identified the 26 missing genes that cause Williams, some researchers hoped it would lead to a better understanding of the genetic roots of human behavior—especially attachment and bonding. In 2009, a team of researchers discovered that one gene in particular might help explain why people with Williams seem to love and trust everyone they meet. The gene, called GTF2I, plays a part in regulating the brain's production of oxytocin, a hormone involved in intimate moments from parent-child bonding to romantic encounters. It's been called both the "love hormone" and the "trust hormone."
One of the hormone's effects is to relax the amygdala, the brain's fear center. Essentially, oxytocin allows the amygdala to let its guard down so we can develop the feeling of closeness to others that is essential to attachment. Ordinarily, oxytocin is released by the pituitary gland in controlled, strategically timed doses—for example, when a new mother nurses her baby. But for people missing a copy of the GTF2I gene, the trickle becomes a flood. And the floodgates are open all the time.
This can indeed make life like a party. The openness, empathy, and selflessness it engenders can also make life with Williams seem like a more enlightened way of being. Either way, the experience seems like something the rest of us could benefit from trying—at least for a little while.
As it turns out, there's another way to open the oxytocin flood gates, short of removing the GTF2I gene: Taking MDMA has a similar effect on the brain. It's how the drug, best known for being the key ingredient in ecstasy and Molly, fosters feelings of connection and intimacy that earned it the label of "empathogen," and made it a popular tool in the 1970s couples counseling, helping partners drop their defenses and communicate freely.
MDMA also increases production of the antidepressant hormone serotonin, which helps explain the drug's mood-boosting effects and its ability to heighten feelings of awareness and alertness. But serotonin doesn't seem to explain the feeling of universal kinship that many recreational ecstasy users have described. Evidence in favor of oxytocin's role comes from lab rats: given a dose of MDMA, they behave in unusually friendly ways, such as "lying next to each other and cuddling," according to Discover magazine. When they're given an oxytocin blocker along with the MDMA, however, the cuddling stops.
Likewise, Williams researchers who removed the mouse equivalent of the GTF2I gene raised mice who were similarly cuddly and lacking in social inhibitions. Instead of scurrying into corners to avoid detection by predators, as mice normally do, these mice sauntered out into the open as if looking for a party. When a new mouse was introduced into their cage, they greeted the new guy much more eagerly than unmodified mice did.
For people with Williams syndrome, the ability to bond quickly with strangers is part benefit and part handicap, since they typically can't turn this tendency off, even when they encounter strangers the rest of us would deem a threat. They also struggle with the concept that different types of relationships entail different levels of intimacy. They treat everyone, from the bus driver to their grandmother, with the same intense and unconditional love. This makes them exceptionally vulnerable to being abused or taken advantage of.
Of course, MDMA's ability to produce instant attachment is part of its appeal for recreational users. The difference is that, unlike in Williams syndrome, its effects wear off in a matter of hours, and the ability to discriminate in whom to befriend returns. But while it lasts, it can be a powerful way to deepen personal bonds and forge new ones. And as researchers are learning, that can be an especially valuable tool in psychotherapy, where trust and openness are the keys to successful treatment for a variety of psychological disorders.
Although MDMA was made illegal in the US in 1985, after gaining a reputation as a party drug, it has reemerged recently in clinical trials for a variety of conditions, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder. Recent studies have shown that people suffering from severe PTSD whose symptoms hadn't improved with other treatments found significant relief from MDMA in combination with psychotherapy. Late last year, the US Food and Drug Administration gave the green light to phase-three trials for MDMA as a PTSD treatment: the final stage before drug approval, which could happen as early as 2021 if the trials succeed.
Researchers think the drug helps PTSD patients partly because it mimics one of the effects of Williams syndrome: It makes the amygdala less sensitive to threatening facial expressions. Fleeting, unintended expressions of anger or disapproval from a therapist often trigger a strong amygdala reaction in people with PTSD. When patients took MDMA, however, their fearful reactions diminished and they responded more strongly to positive facial expressions—as people with Williams also do. Being able to trust and open up to a therapist seemed to be what made the difference for PTSD patients who'd gotten no relief from previous treatments.
"What MDMA therapy does is it provides a chance for effective psychotherapy, and that allows a patient to come to terms with trauma," said Ben Sessa, a British psychiatrist who advocates for MDMA as a treatment aid. "Of course, many, if not almost all, psychiatric disorders have some degree of trauma at their core, whether it's depression, anxiety disorder, OCD, and especially addictions. I think it could be applied a lot more widely than just PTSD."
Sessa is currently involved with a study to test whether MDMA can help treat people with alcoholism, operating on the principle that trauma underlies addiction. But he believes the drug could also be helpful for the general population.
"At the moment, most of the research is based around clinical tools for people with psychiatric disorders," he said. "But there's a school of thought that says that healthy people can use these drugs to explore their own psyche and to gain greater understanding of self and connectivity with others."
Williams syndrome, with its hallmark gregariousness, is often called the opposite of autism. So it's perhaps no surprise that researchers also believe MDMA could help people on the autism spectrum overcome their social anxiety. Although treatments for social anxiety already exist for the general population, they rarely work well for people with autism. But people on the autism spectrum who'd taken ecstasy recreationally told researchers that it had helped them connect socially in ways they hadn't been able to before. Of more than a hundred autistic people surveyed, 72 percent said that recreational ecstasy use made them more comfortable in social settings and 77 percent said the drug made it easier to talk to people, while 78 percent reported "feeling at ease in my own body."
In 2014, the FDA approved the first-ever trial for MDMA, combined with therapy, for social anxiety in autism. Researchers with the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), which is conducting the trial, presented findings in April suggesting the treatment had yielded significant improvements—and that its effects had lasted long after the sessions ended.
Similarly long-lasting effects were reported by participants in the PTSD study, also sponsored by MAPS, which found that after three psychotherapy sessions in combination with MDMA, 83 percent of participants no longer met the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis. Those effects lasted during follow-up assessments over the course of several years.
"The best thing about this potential treatment, in my view, is the fact that it only needs to be done a few times," said MAPS spokesman Brad Burge. "Why is that? We're not addressing symptoms: We're addressing the underlying root cause of PTSD—the trauma at its core."
By elevating oxytocin levels, MDMA helps with more than just cementing the patient-therapist bond, Burge said. People under the influence of MDMA are also better able to direct their increased compassion inward.
"Often a hallmark of PTSD is a lot of self-blame," he said. "People blame themselves for having had this experience or for having had such a difficult reaction to it. One of the goals of psychotherapy is to help relieve some of that guilt, so people can look at what happened to them not as something that happened because they're a bad person, but because bad things happen to everyone."
MDMA has its limitations, like all drugs. It's an amphetamine, so it increases heart rate and blood pressure, although only about as much as vigorous exercise. Still, Burge says, anyone with a history of serious heart, liver, or kidney disease shouldn't take it. And he warns that while MDMA can be helpful in a clinical setting, taking ecstasy or Molly at a club is dangerous, since the dosage and chemical composition aren't controlled.
And of course, like Williams syndrome, MDMA makes people vulnerable, which can be good or bad, depending on the situation.
"MDMA has the ability to make you more open and compassionate and trusting. That's a great idea if you're dealing with PTSD in a therapeutic setting," Burge said. "It's not a great idea if you're not genuinely in a safe place. You don't want to trust the wrong people."

Re: The Death of my 2012 klr For anyone who doesnt know that is a picture of a grenaded balancer chain. I made regular adjustments but noticed they were getting less and less effictive. I just didn't worry too much about it because the bike was only 18 months old so what could go wrong? Well there it is. If you look close you will see the small sprocket in the center that the chain rides on is completly devoid of teeth. Also the bolt that holds the chain guide on has been ripped out with a piece of the engine case still attached. Part of the balancer chain got stuck in the cam chain and destroyed that as well. After this happened I sulked for 3 days and then bought a clean used klr off of craigs list. I had that bike for about two months when I threw my chain on the freeway. The tow truck driver then launched that bike off the side of the truck into the middle of rush hour traffic. I just bought a clean 2006 klr and fortunately the doo and tortion spring are already installed.
The world's attention has rightly been riveted on negotiations aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear program. If and when that deal is made final, America and the other major powers that worked on it — China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany — should turn their attention to South Asia, a troubled region with growing nuclear risks of its own.
Pakistan, with the world's fastest-growing nuclear arsenal, is unquestionably the biggest concern, one reinforced by several recent developments. Last week, Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, announced that he had approved a new deal to purchase eight diesel-electric submarines from China, which could be equipped with nuclear missiles, for an estimated $5 billion. Last month, Pakistan test-fired a ballistic missile that appears capable of carrying a nuclear warhead to any part of India. And a senior adviser, Khalid Ahmed Kidwai, reaffirmed Pakistan's determination to continue developing short-range tactical nuclear weapons whose only purpose is use on the battlefield in a war against India.
These investments reflect the Pakistani Army's continuing obsession with India as the enemy, a rationale that allows the generals to maintain maximum power over the government and demand maximum national resources. Pakistan now has an arsenal of as many as 120 nuclear weapons and is expected to triple that in a decade. An increase of that size makes no sense, especially since India's nuclear arsenal, estimated at about 110 weapons, is growing more slowly.
The two countries have a troubled history, having fought four wars since independence in 1947, and deep animosities persist. Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India has made it clear that Pakistan can expect retaliation if Islamic militants carry out a terrorist attack in India, as happened with the 2008 bombing in Mumbai. But the latest major conflict was in 1999, and since then India, a vibrant democracy, has focused on becoming a regional economic and political power.
Castro Valley resident Denise Slader prior to attacking Muslims praying in California park (Facebook)
The California woman who became a Facebook celebrity after she was filmed attacking and throwing coffee on a group of Muslims praying in a park now claims she is the victim of harassment and wants a judge to put an end to it, reports the Contra Costa Times.
Fifty-year-old Castro Valley resident Denise Slader entered a plea of not guilty on Thursday on misdemeanor hate crime and battery charges, stemming from the incident that occurred on Dec. 5 of last year.
Slader was filmed berating the praying Muslims before throwing her coffee at them as a park ranger intervened. Video taken of the incident was placed on Facebook before going viral and entered into evidence against the woman.
Appearing in court, the longtime California Department of Corrections employee complained to the judge that she was being harassed by the man who shot the video — Rasheed Albeshaeri — and his supporters.
Defense attorney Jerry Lipkin asked the judge to order Albeshaeri and his friends to stop contacting Slader — a charge that was dismissed by Alameda County deputy district attorney Tim Wellman.
According to Wellman, Slader has only received one anonymous letter and there is no evidence it came from Albeshaeri.
“To conclude it's coming from the victim is pure and rampant speculation,” Wellman said.
In a phone interview, Albeshaeri said he hasn't contacted Slader, and he doesn't know of anyone who has.
“If someone harassed or threatened her like she claims, I'm against that,” Albeshaeri said. “I don't support that.”
Despite a request from the prosecutor to set Slader's bail at $10,000 bail, Judge Andrew Steckler released the woman on her own recognizance and ordered her to not contact Albeshaeri and to stay away from Chabot Regional Park where the incident occurred.
Her trial has been set for April 4.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) said on Wednesday that Democrats have been "hyper-confused" on economic issues for years.
Harold Ford, Jr., an MSNBC contributor and former Democratic congressman, asked Murphy on "Morning Joe" about the Democrats' future economic message going into the 2018 midterm elections.
"I think we have to challenge ourselves," Murphy said. " I think we've been hyper-confused over the course of the past five years. Some of the time we are talking about economic growth. Some of the time we are talking about economic fairness."
Murphy added that he does not know whether Democrats have won the economic fairness question, but he believes they "desperately care" about economic growth in wages, hours, and jobs.
"Everything Democrats talk about when it comes to the economy has to be about more, higher wages, right? More college education to get them a better job, lower taxes for the folks that they are targeting," Murphy said. "I just think we've gotta be hyper-focused on this question of wage growth and job growth."
He said that Democrats should not be scared of talking about an economic message just because Republicans have been advocating for the same policy.
"We get there through a different way. We get there through building the bottom up. They get there through trickle-down," Murphy said.
More Footage Leaks Of CNN's ‘Staged' Muslim Anti-Terror Protest [VIDEO]
Amber Athey
Early this week, CNN was accused of staging a Muslim-led anti-terror protest after the London terror attacks. Now, more footage has dropped that shows what happened on the scene before the CNN shot was taken.
A Youtube video taken by Claire Jordan shows her milling around the scene and “protest” prior to CNN lining up the protesters for their on-air shot. (VIDEO: CNN Responds To Claims They Staged A Muslim Anti-Terror Protest)
There is a group of people in the area, both Muslim and non-Muslim, and some of them can be seen handing out bouquets of flowers and posters.
Jordan, narrating the video, observes, “you see more press than anyone else.”
Jordan then crosses the street and shows the Muslim women who were featured on the CNN broadcast. They are located on the opposite side of the street and “they're taking selfies, none of them have got flowers.”
“I was there just before,” she explains, “and you see, again, this is the group of women and the little boy–they're just getting their posters now.”
The Muslim women then gather their posters and cross the street to set up for the CNN shot that was used in the broadcast.

Mark Mayerson rips apart the new book CREATORS: FROM CHAUCER AND DURER TO PICASSO AND DISNEY by British historian and journalist Paul Johnson. According to Mark, the book is riddled with errors about the animated art form, such as:
Winsor McCay is misspelled. Max Fleischer is erroneously credited for Felix the Cat. The Three Little Pigs was released in 1933, not 1932. Alice in Wonderland was released in 1951, not 1957. Carl Stalling was a composer, not an animator. It's Carl Eduarde, not Edwards. It's Grim, not Jim, Natwick. It's Tytla, not Tytler. It's Ted Sears, not Wears.
What's particularly disgusting about Johnson's text is not only the factual inaccuracies, but that he may have deliberately falsified history to promote his personal agendas. For example, his description of how the Disney strike happened is a complete fabrication, but it makes sense that he would write something like that after reading this Wikipedia article about Johnson, that says, “In his Enemies of Society (1977), following a series of articles in the British press, he vehemently attacked the trade union movement for what he saw as its violence and intolerance, terming them as ‘red fascists.' He also at this time started to inveigh against liberal and left-wing causes.”

Several gun lobbyists say they're watching the Judiciary Committee's markup meeting. NRA campaign in high gear
The National Rifle Association and its allies are kicking their lobbying forces into high gear as the Senate heads toward a vote that could remake key pieces of the country's gun laws.
The gun lobby is taking its fight to Capitol Hill — stepping up meetings with old friends and trying to make inroads with a handful of swing Democrats in the Senate.
Story Continued Below
They're also blanketing the airwaves, winding up their grass-roots machines, taking to social media and even, in the NRA's case — sponsoring a NASCAR race at the Texas Motor Speedway and putting up new TV ads targeting black voters.
( Also on POLITICO: Schumer ends talks with Coburn on guns)
Their goal: thwart any move by the Senate to pass gun control legislation, with a special focus on universal background checks — an idea that has picked up steam.
Several gun lobbyists said they are watching the Judiciary Committee's markup meeting Thursday but expect the real fight to take place on the Senate floor — where they feel better positioned to make changes to the bill through the amendments process.
Lobbyists described the panel's efforts, led in large part by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), as “perfunctory” and a “foregone conclusion.”
( Also on POLITICO: How White House quieted gun groups)
The NRA — the behemoth in the industry — has also been meeting with GOP leaders, pushing them to consider amendments on issues like school safety and armed guards at schools and strengthening the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
Lobbyists have also focused attention on a trio of Democratic senators — Mark Warner of Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania — because the gun lobby is unsure of how they'll ultimately vote if something comes to the floor.
The pressure campaign extends beyond the NRA to groups, including the National Shooting Sports Foundation and Gun Owners of America.
They are facing off against gun control proponents that have come out swinging in their best-funded effort in recent history. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Mayors Against Illegal Guns and the super PAC founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, herself a victim of gun violence, are moving aggressively to blunt the gun lobby's offensive.
Giffords's super PAC, Americans for Responsible Solutions, launched a cable TV ad campaign Tuesday in Arizona and Iowa targeting Senate Judiciary Committee members Chuck Grassley and Jeff Flake and Sens. Tom Harkin and John McCain. The effort comes after the $3.5 million Independence USA PAC, a super PAC started by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, dumped into an Illinois special election to fund an ad blitz against a pro-gun candidate.
A new, faster version of Wi-Fi was officially rubber-stamped Wednesday.
The latest Wi-Fi technology, called "802.11ac," offers speeds of up to 1.3 Gigabits per second. That's fast enough to transfer an entire high-definition movie to a tablet in under 4 minutes, share photo albums with friends in a matter of seconds or stream three HD videos at the same time. It's more than double the top speed of the previous standard, known as 802.11n.
Those speeds are theoretical maximums -- very few people have anything close to 1 Gigabit speeds from their home broadband connection. Average speeds are less than 1% of that. But the faster speeds mean the new Wi-Fi standard will offer a much bigger pipeline for all those videos, songs and games that a growing number of people are streaming on multiple devices simultaneously.
The Wi-Fi Alliance, a global organization that ensures the interoperability of Wi-Fi technologies, began certifying so-called "ac" devices Wednesday. It kicked off the certification program by signing off on 19 routers, access points, microchips and smartphones. The shortlist of certified devices includes the Samsung Galaxy S4, Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and routers from Cisco (CSCO) and Netgear (NTGR).

Shipments of ac Wi-Fi devices began last year, but they remain very hard to find. The Wi-Fi Alliance believes that the start of its ac certification program will get the ball rolling quickly.
"Usually, our certification programs serve as one of the contributing factors to widespread market adoption," said Kelly Davis-Felner, the Wi-Fi Alliance's director of program management. "But already, this feels like a much more accelerated adoption than in years past."
A recent ABI Research forecast predicts that 40% of smartphones will support the newer version of Wi-Fi this year. By next year, the Wi-Fi Alliance expects ac devices to make up the majority of the Wi-Fi market. Even Apple (AAPL), typically a late adopter with new technologies, has announced that its future products will feature ac Wi-Fi connectivity.
The new Wi-Fi standard comes at a crucial time: The average number of Wi-Fi devices in U.S. households has doubled since 2008, with each home averaging four devices connected to the Wi-Fi network during peak usage times.

As the number of demands on the network grow, the need for more Wi-Fi capacity grows along with it. Also, as a growing number of consumers and businesses install Wi-Fi networks, interference is becoming a concern.
The new standard aims to solve those problems. It allows more devices to simultaneously connect to a network without a degradation in performance. It also features lower latency times for streaming music and gaming, where network hiccups and delays can ruin a user's experience. And the latest Wi-Fi standard helps deliver streaming videos more reliably, even when the network is being used by other devices.
As an added bonus, 802.11ac requires devices to have support for two bands of airwaves, which will help to reduce interference. And it requires less power consumption from smartphones, tablets and PCs when they're transmitting data.
Wireless carriers are keeping a very close eye on the new Wi-Fi standard. Cell phone companies are increasingly looking to deploy Wi-Fi hotspots to offload traffic from their congested networks. The new standard offers speeds that are on-par with 4G.
"The ratification of the 802.11ac standard will significantly improve the usefulness of Wi-Fi to carriers," said Mike McCormack, analyst at Nomura Equity Research.
Carriers have begun testing out technology that automatically switches users from 3G and 4G networks to Wi-Fi. As the number of "ac" mobile devices grow, McCormack said consumers may all soon be connecting to Wi-Fi networks without even knowing it.
JOHN SUTTON has signed a two-year deal with St Johnstone after knocking back the chance to stay at Motherwell.
The 31-year-old striker had been offered an extended contract with the Fir Park side after helping Ian Baraclough's side beat relegation.
But the former Raith Rovers, Millwall, Dundee, St Mirren, Wycombe and Hearts frontman has decided he wants to move on again after agreeing terms with Tommy Wright's Perth Saints.
He said: "I'm really happy. The club did really well last year so hopefully I can be part of something good going forward. St Johnstone are a really good team so I'm looking forward to being part of that.
"The manager seemed very keen from the outset to bring me in. There were a couple of other teams that were interested, but I was keen to come here."
Sutton scored 13 times last season, including a penalty in the second leg of the 6-1 aggregate win over Rangers in the play-off final which secured Well's 30-year run in the top flight.
He first signed for the Steelmen back in 2008 and scored 43 goals in 125 games before moving to Hearts in the summer of 2011.
He returned to the Lanarkshire outfit in 2013 and scored a further 35 goals in 84 appearances in a fruitful two-year spell.
Well boss Baraclough said: "We are obviously disappointed to lose John after making him the best offer we could.
"However, he has opted to move to St Johnstone and we will now move on and progress with the other targets we have for the striking position.
"On behalf of everyone at Fir Park, I would like to thank John for his fantastic effort over the five seasons he's been here and wish him all the very best with his future career."
Allen Treaster being arrested. Screencaps via WKMG News
In Florida's Polk County, the sheriff's department arrested 16 people this weekend in a giant To Catch a Predator–style sting. Those arrested include Walt Disney World employees Zachary Spencer and Allen Treaster and Universal Studios employee Matthew "Cody" Myers.
On Monday, Polk County's colorful sheriff, Grady Judd, talked to the press at great length about the weekend operation, called Operation Cyber Child III. He painted a vivid picture of the suspects' monstrous deeds. But there are weird holes in Judd's story, and one of the local TV news stations has been watching him and pressuring him for details he seems hesitant to divulge.
During a lengthy, legally unnecessary press conference after the announcement of the arrests, Judd delivered a long sermon in which he reassured the people of Central Florida that he would double his efforts to protect their children. While his resolve is astonishing, and the cause is noble, the speech was unclear at times as Judd meandered and took unnecessary detours while painting this batch of molesters as an eccentric, and weirdly talkative, a bunch of perverts.
When describing Allen Treaster's crimes, which include traveling to Georgia to have sex with a 15-year-old, he seemed eager to create a sense that Treaster was growing more dangerous. He explained that Treaster "told our detectives that his real goal—his fantasy—was to have sex with a 14-year-old boy. Because you see, he had already had sex with a 15-year-old boy. So he was working down to younger children. We see this person as very dangerous."
It's unclear why someone who had just been arrested for lewd conduct with a minor would detail an elaborate fantasy about steadily more heinous crimes that hadn't happened yet.
A teacher who was arrested in the operation was vilified for loving Ukraine. "He has been to Ukraine, and he loves Ukraine. He says he loves Ukraine like we love the United States. So why does he love Ukraine? That's under investigation. I'll tell you what we love: We love to arrest sexual predators."
Judd's account of the arrest of another suspect, Jacob Bickle, took an oddly melodramatic turn, as though he were trying to make Bickle sympathetic. "Once he was arrested he went from wanting to have sex with children, and arriving to have sex with children, to begging us to shoot him. Well, when we wouldn't do what he asked, upon arriving at county jail he begged the transport deputy not to leave him there. 'Please don't leave me here. Would you at least give me a hug before you let me off at jail?'"
It also strikes me as weird that some phase of the arrests of all of these men was documented on video, another totally unnecessary bit of theatrical flourish. Each was shot from the same angle, in cuffs, facing the camera, trembling, the images always amber-toned, with a similar (or maybe identical) entryway behind them. It reminds me of the media circuses the cops in Mexico manufacture whenever they make a huge drug bust.
The Disney World connection is what attracted my attention to this story, and other than emphasizing how scary it is that these men were near children, Judd doesn't make it sound like they're using their place of employment specifically to access victims. Instead he accidentally attracted my attention to the sheer weirdness of his operation, and to the fact that I'm not the only one who has noticed.
Noah Pransky, investigative reporter for the local CBS affiliate WTSP, also has some questions for Judd. He and his team have been issuing public-record requests for some time and having no luck. It seems that WTSP wants to make sure these stings aren't entrapment, which, as you probably know, means inducing someone to commit a crime they weren't otherwise going to commit.
Judd preemptively ensured the attendees that it wasn't entrapment, saying, "The reason this is not just the Florida sheriff's top priority, but my top priority, is because every one of these people would have engaged very young children in sex this weekend but for our great detectives that work hard to keep that from happening."
I approached WTSP for more information about their investigation, and they politely declined to comment.
A person who is willing, but not actively seeking, to have sex with a minor certainly isn't someone I would want to have a beer with, but the law says cops aren't supposed to approach them when they're minding their own business and get them to try. The distinction between pedophiles and active molesters is worth making, and we're only recently starting to acknowledge it.
Apart from entrapment, WTSP also seems concerned about the size of the operation and the sheer expense of it all. Judd seems to be using a lot of resources in order to turn himself into the Eliot Ness of child molesters, and he's being cagey about the investment of time and money involved.
Even if Judd is covering something up, there's no way it's anything as heinous as molesting kids. And it might turn out that he's just a deranged sheriff with a pet cause, who loves being in the spotlight. He wouldn't be the only one.

Edmonton teenager Shamit Shome took another stop up the pro soccer ranks Friday, chosen by the Montreal Impact in the second round (41st overall) at the MLS SuperDraft.
MLS bought the 19-year-old midfielder from FC Edmonton of the NASL and made him one-half of its inaugural Generation Adidas Canada class, signing the youth international to a contract that won't count against the Impact's salary cap.
Montreal liked Shome's poise and experience at such a young age. A cool head, Shome is good at connecting teammates on the pitch.

“He's good on the ball, comfortable in possession … And he has professional experience,” said Impact technical director Adam Braz. “I think that's a big plus — understanding what it takes at the pro level.”
Shome, a nominee for Canadian under-20 player of the year, saw plenty of action for the Eddies in 2016. He logged 1,729 minutes in 29 appearances in all competitions and captained the national under-20 team.
Braz said he did not expect Shome to be around by the time his second-round pick came round.
The two other Canadian teams did not bite. Toronto passed on both Shome and fellow Canadian Generation Adidas youngster Adonijah Reid, trading its two second-round picks to Chicago for allocation money. Vancouver used its second-round pick on a New Zealand defender.
Shome celebrated getting drafted and going to a Canadian club. But he also talked of his ties to FC Edmonton whose academy and coach Colin Miller helped develop him.
“It's definitely bittersweet (leaving) but there's a time where you have to take that jump and take that risk. Me and my family just thought this could be the right time,” he said.
Language should not be a barrier in Montreal. Shome says his French is “not bad.”
“I need to work on it a bit more but simple French isn't that bad.”
Montreal chose Nick DePuy in the first round (19th overall). The UC Santa Barbara forward was hard to miss as he appeared backstage with a technician having to pause to raise his camera tripod.
“You're much taller than everybody else,” said the flustered cameraman.
At six foot five and 200 pounds, DePuy cuts an imposing figure.
“I think it's just positive to have a different type of profile that in different situations can be effective,” Braz said of adding a target-man. “It doesn't mean that he's going to step in tomorrow. He's going to grow and give the coach an option at different moments. We liked what we saw, we liked our interview with him so we're happy to add him to the team.”
DePuy, who scored 31 goals in college, is more than just a tall drink of water. He has worked hard on his technique.
“I'm tall but I'm also good with my feet,” he said. “I'm quick and I can jump really high .. I'm big in the box, Balls in the air, I'm going to fight (for) and I'm going to get it.”
DePuy likes to watch forwards like Manchester United's Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Everton's Romelu Lukaku.
The 22-year-old DePuy, born in California and raised in Denver, was ecstatic to hear his name called out by Montreal.
“It was a great feeling. All of my dreams came true right when I heard those words. I had a great meeting with the Impact and I connected with all the coaches … Hopefully I can help bring a championship to Montreal.”
Growing up, there were no French classes at DePuy's school. “Only Spanish and Latin.”

The idea that people can be subliminally influenced is ancient—historical evidence suggests that in the fifth century B.C., Greek thinkers attempted to employ subtle yet persuasive language to sneakily influence people. In the mid-20th century the idea famously captured popular attention, but science has only recently begun to parse the actual effects of subliminal messages.
1943: Subliminal messages were occasionally embedded in radio, film and television programs. In an animated short featuring Daffy Duck in 1943, for example, the words “BUY BONDS” appear briefly on screen. Nobody knew whether these messages would influence people, but they figured it couldn't hurt to try.
1957: James Vicary, a market researcher, claimed that by flashing the words “Eat Popcorn” and “Drink Coca-Cola” during a movie for a fraction of a second, he significantly increased the sale of these snacks. Five years later he admitted he had faked the study. By that time, however, the public had grown concerned—and advertisers and government agencies intrigued—about the manipulative power of these messages.
Late 1960s–1980s: Scientific studies throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s tended to discredit the claims that subliminal messages could subtly influence behavior. One study, for instance, showed that flashing the words “Hershey's Chocolate” on a series of slides during a lecture did not influence whether students purchased Hershey's products during a 10-day period.
1990s: Although many studies continued to discredit the claim that subliminal messages carried any psychological weight, other research started to uncover subtle effects. In one such study from 1992, participants viewed images of a person engaged in a normal daily activity. After each image, researchers quickly flashed a photograph: half the viewers saw positive, uplifting content, and half saw negative content. Those who saw negative messages reported thinking of the photographed person in a more damaging light.
Early 2000s: Research continued to show that subliminal messages do influence our perceptions; the effect is just subtler than we thought.
2006: Studies have shown subliminal messages may work in advertising after all, in certain situations. For example, a 2006 study found that participants flashed an image of a brand-name drink, in this case Lipton Ice Tea, were more likely to choose that brand to quench their thirst. This association only held up, however, if participants were already thirsty. (Another provocative study showed that embedding images related to thirst in an episode of The Simpsons actually made people thirstier.)
2007: Subliminal messages may also enhance academic performance. In a 2007 study, researchers flashed students hidden words related or unrelated to intelligence, such as “talent” and “grass,” respectively, before a practice exam. Those who saw the intelligence words performed better on a midterm one to four days later.
2010–2015: Imaging studies have shown that our brain responds to subliminal messages in measurable ways. Activity levels change in the amygdala, which processes emotions, the insula (involved in conscious awareness), the hippocampus (involved in processing memories) and the visual cortex.
As state officials across the U.S. grapple with how to prevent mass killings like the ones at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and near the University of California, Santa Barbara, some are turning to a gun seizure law pioneered in Connecticut 15 years ago.
Connecticut's law allows judges to order guns temporarily seized after police present evidence that a person is a danger to themselves or others. A court hearing must be held within 14 days to determine whether to return the guns or authorize the state to hold them for up to a year.
The 1999 law, the first of its kind in the U.S., was in response to the 1998 killings of four managers at the Connecticut Lottery headquarters by a disgruntled employee with a history of psychiatric problems.
Indiana is the only other state that has such a law, passed in 2005 after an Indianapolis police officer was shot to death by a mentally ill man. California and New Jersey lawmakers are now considering similar statutes, both proposed in the wake of the killings of six people — three stabbed to death and three fatally shot— and wounding of 13 others near the University of California, Santa Barbara, by a mentally ill man who had posted threatening videos on YouTube.
Michael Lawlor, Connecticut's undersecretary for criminal justice planning and policy, believes the state's gun seizure law could have prevented the killings of 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012, if police had been made aware that gunman Adam Lanza had mental health problems and access to his mother's legally owned guns.
"That's the kind of situation where you see the red flags and the warning signs are there, you do something about it," Lawlor said. "In many shootings around the country, after the fact it's clear that the warning signs were there."
Gun rights advocates oppose gun seizure laws, saying they allow police to take people's firearms based only on allegations and before the gun owners can present their side of the story to a judge. They say they're concerned the laws violate constitutional rights.
"The government taking things away from people is never a good thing," said Rich Burgess, president of the gun rights group Connecticut Carry. "They come take your stuff and give you 14 days for a hearing. Would anybody else be OK if they just came and took your car and gave you 14 days for a hearing?"
Rachel Baird, a Connecticut lawyer who has represented many gun owners, said one of the biggest problems with the state's law is that police are abusing it. She said she has had eight clients whose guns were seized by police who obtained the required warrants after taking possession of the guns.
"It's stretched and abused, and since it's firearms, the courts go along with it," Baird said of the law.
But backers of such laws say they can prevent shootings by getting guns out of the hands of mentally disturbed people.
"You want to make sure that when people are in crisis ... there is a way to prevent them to get access to firearms," said Josh Horwitz, executive director of the nonprofit Education Fund to Stop Gun Violence in Washington, D.C.
President Barack Obama tried to tighten gun regulations after the Newtown massacre, but proposals to expand background checks for gun purchasers failed to get enough votes to pass in the Senate in the face of strong opposition from the influential National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups. Some states such as Connecticut have tightened gun restrictions since Newtown, but others have expanded the right to openly carry firearms in public places.
Connecticut authorities report a large increase in the use of gun seizure warrants involving people deemed dangerous by police over the past several years. Officials aren't exactly sure what caused the increase but believe it's related to numerous highly publicized mass shootings in recent years.
Police statewide filed an estimated 183 executed gun seizure warrants with court clerks last year, more than twice the number filed in 2010, according to Connecticut Judicial Branch data. Last year's total also was nearly nine times higher than the annual average in the first five years of the gun seizure law.
Connecticut police have seized more than 2,000 guns using the warrants, according to the most recent estimate by state officials, in 2009.
Police in South Windsor, about 12 miles northeast of Hartford, say the law was invaluable last year when they seized several guns from the home of a man accused of spray-painting graffiti referencing mass shootings in Newtown and Colorado on the outside of the town's high school.
"With all that we see in the news day after day, particular after Newtown, I think departments are more aware of what authority they have ... and they're using the tool (gun seizure warrants) more frequently than in the past," said South Windsor Police Chief Matthew Reed. "We always look at it from the other side. What if we don't seize the guns?"

Seventy-nine-year-old Abha Sharma perks up the moment you step into her room and asks after her two grandchildren. Have Shweta and Aveek come back? On hearing an answer in the negative, she sinks into her armchair and falls silent.
Omkar Sharma, 53, his wife Veena, 48, and their two children, Shweta, 14, and Aveek, 12, left home along with a hired driver for the Chardham Yatra pilgrimage to Uttarakhand's shrines of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamnotri on June 12. On the morning of the 14th, Omkar spoke with his elderly mother in Noida, a suburb of Delhi. That was the last anybody heard of the family. They were on their way to Kedarnath, but its more than three weeks and there has been no trace of them.
“I have come back few days ago from Uttarakhand after spending two weeks there in search of my elder brother,” says Gyanendra Sharma, Omkar's younger brother and second of Abha's three sons. “My brother Vijay will visit Badrinath in a day to resume the search,” he confides.
“I know this is a hope against hope but what can we do? Unless and until we get some trace of my elder brother and his family I will keep on searching,” he continues.
The Sharma family is not the only one to have lost loved ones in what is one of the worst ever natural calamities in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand. There are many others. Newspapers are full of stories of missing family members. The English daily The Times of India has recently profiled a family in Delhi that has lost 29 of its members.
The tragedy in the north Indian state occurred during peak season, when religious Hindus from all across India and abroad crowd the four pilgrim centers from May to November.
“I along with five of my friends were on the way to Badrinath when the rain started on June 14. The downpour became so heavy that the houses and lodges located near the river banks started crumbling and in no time I saw many people getting washed away. I lost four members
of my team and it was just a sheer luck that I managed to cling to an upper branch of a tree and survived the devastation,” says Pankaj Sharan, a survivor who was rescued three days after the tragedy by an army team.
Ashutosh Mishra, a journalist with the news agency ANI, was one of the first reporters to reach Badrinath after the tragedy struck the mountainous state. Speaking to The Diplomat, he recounts “a very horrifying experience to see the scale of tragedy. I saw a father trying to quench the thirst of his young son by squeezing the wet blanket but the boy collapsed after a while.”
“Seeing the suffering, dead bodies and inexplicable tragedies I started shuddering while interviewing the survivors, sometimes my mike will drop off from my hand,” recalls Mishra, who spent more than two weeks covering the event.
Mishra believes that “no fewer than 15,000 people perished in three days of devastation.”
But Deven Verma, a Delhi based tour operator who had a miraculous escape says that “not less than 40,000 people lost their lives because more than 100,000 people journey through Badrinath to Kedarnath every day during the peak season.”
The state government recently announced that 5,700 people missing after last month's devastating floods will now be presumed dead. But it is not clear exactly how many lives have really been lost in the worst-ever Himalayan tragedy in India.
News magazine Tehelka, citing data provided by the state government, says that around 100,000 vehicles visit the pilgrimage centers three times each year. Since 2005-2006, the number of registered taxis and jeeps in the state has jumped tenfold. And since 2010, the state has built an additional 4,500 km of road, and has nearly tripled its total road length in the past decade.
Born this way?
Yesterday's AT blog post about the Iowa Governors Conference on LGBTQ youth saddened me. Children in middle school learning about hormone treatments and how to sew fake testicles into clothing? The left has a long history of trying to erase or at a minimum blur the lines of what distinguishes men from women, claiming there are no differences between the genders. So it's confusing why gender identity now dominates the media. If gender is irrelevant, oppressive, and unnecessary, why are there over fifty choices with which to identify it?
I was born and remain a female. As a child, I did not play with dolls, preferring trucks in the mud. I abhorred anything girlie-girl, thought dodgeball ruled, played and fought with the boys. It was easier for me to relate to boys than girls, and I fit in better. In middle school, I was the first female to take wood shop – not because I wanted to prove anything, but because I was more interested in woodworking than I was in home economics. But there was never any confusion as to who I was. It never occurred to me to consider that nature had erred and trapped a boy in a girl's body; I loved and still love being a girl. I'm thankful I was born female, but I am more thankful that I didn't have overreacting liberals for parents and teachers. The moment I started exhibiting less than female traits, they would have rushed me off to the gender reassignment camp. We needn't accept narrow definitions as to what it means to be male or female. We are born the right way, with the right body, soul, and mind intended for each of us. Fusing those three elements and achieving the proper balance within the constructs of being true to oneself and one's societal expectations are part of life – something we should embrace and celebrate, not reject and challenge. I remember a conversation I had with an ardent feminist some time ago. She said the feminist plan was to convert as many people into homosexuality as possible and sexually confuse the rest, the logic being that homosexuals are less aggressive, less hostile, and more tolerant. Once we rid the world of male aggression via sexual confusion, a kinder, gentler world would emerge. At the time, I discounted her ramblings as typical angry feminist rhetoric, but the more I see where we are going with creating so much gender confusion, the more I wonder. What these people are doing to children is not only shameful, but criminal. Children and more specifically young adults experience emotional and physical changes that come with being an adolescent and growing into adulthood; they don't need adults compounding those difficulties. They should be planting the seeds of health, happiness and prosperity, not seeds of destruction.
With Manchester United struggling for goals, could Andreas Pereira provide the inspiration they desperately need?
By Jamie Martin

Manchester United have drawn four games in a row in all competitions, struggling to find creativity in the attacking third that is a necessity to break down compact defenses. They have not scored in three matches and there is no indication that the drought will soon come to an end. It is clear that inspiration is needed and there is an intriguing 19 year old in United's ranks.
Could attacking midfielder Andreas Pereira be the man to solve United's goal scoring problems?
Pereira, of Belgian and Brazilian descent, has risen through the youth teams at Manchester United to involve himself in Louis van Gaal's plans and is looking to secure a future of first team action at Old Trafford. Though he is many times restricted to a bench role, Pereira could find himself earning more opportunities with summer signing Memphis Depay struggling for form and fitness. It is the perfect time for the youngster to make a crack at the United starting eleven, and it would make sense for Van Gaal to take a chance as the club's struggle for goals continues.
In the few chances he's had, Pereira has impressed against lower league opposition. The former PSV Eindhoven youth player scored a free kick against Ipswich Town and put in a quality shift against Middlesbrough in the Capital One Cup. His pace, passing ability, and determination make him an impressive attacking threat that offers something different to Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini. Though he may not be a prolific goalscorer, Pereira has shown that he has the capabilities to make important passes in the final third. United have been lacking exactly that, and he could be the man to provide the crucial final pass that leads to a goal.
Van Gaal has seemed to favor 22 year old winger Jesse Lingard over Pereira, but with United having a wealth of outside midfielders, there are other positions that have the potential to spark the Red Devils to victory. Ander Herrera, typically a Center Midfielder, has been pushed higher up the pitch to occupy the Number 10 position. Though he has scored many important goals for the club, Herrera may lack the pace to consistently perform in his current role and could be better suited to his traditional midfield position. Ander Herrera is a very important player for United but a change of formation or pushing the Spaniard back could allow for players like Pereira to become more consistently involved.
Manchester United need results now, and trying something different may produce the form the club so desperately needs to appease its supporters. A change of formation or personnel could aid Louis van Gaal in returning United to winning ways. Andreas Pereira has earned his chance and possesses the quality to end the goal drought at Old Trafford. He has shown his abilities in his first few appearances in a United shirt and should be given the chance to continue.
Pereira is a star in the making and the time to foster his talent is now.

ENFPs are Inspirational! They are some of the most enjoyable people to be around. However, here are some ENFP struggles.
Good Read: INTJ Struggles
Lack of Follow Through ENFPs are idea generators, often full of crazy notions and plans and even schemes. Be careful though, for they can often get caught up in the excitement of the moment and not follow through on the plans. Notorious for enjoying the “newness” of an idea, they forget to complete the task or project!
Disinterest in Maintenance Tasks The ENFP does not like routine or repetitive maintenance tasks like taking out the garbage, filling out forms, and ironing the shirts. These things do not captivate the bubbly ENFP. These tasks become a drag while the ENFP craves a little excitement and creativity. Daily maintenance tasks like grocery shopping or cleaning are left to the wayside while more captivating pursuits are explored.
Not Good with Detail The ENFP is always ready to write their novel and show the world how creative they are, but there is a tiny problem with the finer details. Punctuation counts! Be aware of ENFPs who don't prove their work.
Inconsistent ENFPs like to try new things so they can come across as very inconsistent. One minute they are fascinated by learning a new language and the next minute they are researching rocks in Iceland. It can be hard for family members to understand that ENFPs like to explore and they can come across as scattered or inconsistent.
Frequently Suffer from Burnout ENFPs are scanners, always on the alert for things in their environment that may interest them. They frequently suffer from muscle tension and can work themselves into a frenzy over things thereby leading to emotional and even physical burnout. Slow down ENFPs!
Poor Skills at Applying Judgement is not the forte of the ENFP type. They are by instinct intuitive types that do not do well when applying judgment to perception. All that enthusiasm and energy for life does not transfer well into making judgements. The smallest of actions can be detected by the perceptive ENFP and grossly misinterpreted.
Fear of Criticism This is a tough one for the ENFP, they dislike being criticized. While on the surface, they may seem all cool and confident, deep down they really do not like to be given negative feedback. They are often said to be “sensitive” or “thin-skinned”. The ENFP really needs to work on boosting their ability to fend off unflattering comments or careless words spoken by others.
Can be Manipulative Given what great speakers ENFPs are, they are also quite good at steering conversations to their liking! Their persuasion skills are strong and they know just how to maneuver a conversation to get what they want. Watch out for the ENFP, they may surprise you and get what they want right from under your nose!
Bored with Reality Ok, so everyone gets a little bored sometimes. The free-spirited ENFP takes this a step further and gets bored of everything. Old relationships are abandoned for new ones, jobs are changed and it keeps going. Now you can see how they crave excitement. Day-to-day life can become tiresome and the ENFP inevitably gets bored. It is wise for the ENFP to pick a path and stick to it.
Emotional Happy, sad, angry, elated, depressed, and happy again. All in one day. Whew! It can be tiring for those around the ENFP who is fluttering from one emotion to the next and taking their loved ones on a roller coaster of emotions. Time-out. ENFPs need to slow down and enjoy the moment.
Dislike being Controlled The free-spirited ENFP does not like being controlled or labeled. They are independent free spirits who like to take risks and do things as they feel compelled to. ENFPs dislike routine and control. Do not try to control your ENFP partner, they will very strongly oppose any attempts to confine them.
Can be too Intense While the ENFP exudes energy and spontaneity, they are sometimes accused of being too intense by other types who are interested in enjoying the moment and taking things slow. ENFPs are best paired with other types who enjoy a little excitement and intensity. The imagination and expression of the ENFP can be overwhelming for other quieter personality types.
Trouble in School or a Lack of Concentration ENFPs are typically very bright and with a great aptitude for many types of scholastic endeavors. However, they do not like to concentrate for too long at a time so they may find more detailed studying too confining and lack the concentration to complete the tasks at hand.
Scattered The ENFP can come across as unconventional and scattered due to their many pursuits and hobbies and projects and interest in all things new. It is good for the ENFP to try to focus while staying on path and learn to enjoy the satisfaction of completing a task.
CLEVELAND - More remains were discovered yesterday at the Cleveland home of a convicted rapist, raising to 10 the number of bodies that have been found there, authorities said.
Four more bodies and a skull were found at the home, where the remains of six women were removed last week, police Chief Michael McGrath said.
Anthony Sowell, 50, who lives in the home, is in jail and was charged yesterday with five counts of aggravated murder.
“It appears that this man had an insatiable appetite that he had to fill,'' McGrath said.
He said the additional bodies were found buried in the backyard of the home. The skull was found in a bucket in the basement.
Authorities do not know whether the skull belongs to an 11th victim, police spokesman Lieutenant Thomas Stacho said.
The search was to continue today, with Fire Department crews planning to search in the walls of the home, McGrath said.
Last week, investigators said they had found one body in a shallow grave in the backyard. The rest were inside the house - one in the basement, two in the third-floor living room, and two in an upstairs crawl space.
Police discovered the first six bodies Thursday and Friday after a woman reported being raped at Sowell's home.
Sowell also was charged yesterday with rape, felonious assault, and kidnapping related to her complaint. Sowell is to be arraigned today, Stacho said.
The Cuyahoga County coroner is attempting to identify the first group of bodies through DNA and dental records. All six victims were black. Five were strangled.
The bodies could have been there anywhere from weeks to months to years, said Powell Caesar, a spokesman for the coroner.
Yesterday, detectives brought in dogs and digging equipment to scour the home and backyard, looking for evidence to connect Sowell to the bodies, Stacho said.
Police turned up nothing in a search of a quarter-mile swath of abandoned, boarded-up homes near Sowell's residence, which sits in a crowded inner-city neighborhood of mostly older houses.
They planned to scour another quarter-mile area yesterday, McGrath said. He said Sowell did not have a car would have had to take a city bus to travel.
A crowd of about a hundred people milled about and chatted near the home last evening.

TAMPA, Fla. -- New York Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius will miss Opening Day and likely won't return to the team's lineup until sometime in May, at the earliest, because of a strained shoulder muscle, general manager Brian Cashman said Tuesday.
Gregorius will go two weeks without any baseball activity before trying to build up shoulder strength with a throwing program.
"They are shooting for probably six weeks total," Cashman said. "That's a guesstimate, so don't hold me to it."
The Yankees plan to look internally for a replacement to Gregorius, but again ruled out top prospect Gleyber Torres, who has yet to play above A-ball. The Yankees could go with 5-foot-7 utility man Ronald Torreyes, who spent the entire 2016 season with the major league club.
Tyler Wade, a 22-year-old who was slated for Triple A, is an option, though the Yankees want to evaluate if he is too raw or not.
The Yankees also have veterans: Pete Kozma, a slick fielder, but a weak hitter; and former Mets player Ruben Tejada. Second baseman Starlin Castro may play some shortstop at the end of camp, but that is more in case he is needed due to an emergency during the regular season.
Gregorius had left his Netherlands team at the World Baseball Classic with the injury. It is the second WBC in which the Yankees have lost a player. Mark Teixeira hurt his wrist in 2013.

Yankees manager Joe Girardi said that Gregorius hurt the shoulder on a double play, while playing second base. Gregorius grew up playing the position, but has been a shortstop as a professional.
"Those are some concerns you have when players go to WBC," Girardi said. "You always worry about the injury thing. I know it is important for the game, but he is really important to our team."
Cashman refused to criticize the WBC, adding injuries are always a part of the game.
"The best organizations deal with this," he said. "And hopefully we'll deal with this well."
On Tuesday, a second MRI confirmed that Gregorius has a hematoma of the subscapularis muscle in his right shoulder, both Girardi and Cashman said.
Gregorius, 27, batted .348 with one home run and eight RBIs for the Netherlands. He hit .276 with 20 home runs and 70 RBIs last season. The 20 homers more than doubled his career high in a single season.
"It is not what I wanted to hear," Gregorius said.
He added he would want to play in the WBC again, if asked.
"We saw the strides he took last year offensively, and defensively what he did -- that's a big loss," Girardi said.
SAGINAW, MI -- With 140 fewer violent crimes compared to 2013, Saginaw's violent crime problem shrank slightly in 2014, though the city remains near the top of the country's most violent cities.
Saginaw is fourth on the list for the rate of violent crime per capita, based on the FBI's definition of violent crime that includes murder and non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.
Saginaw ranks behind Detroit, Memphis and Flint on the list of most violent cities, and dropped one place, from third place in 2013 to fourth place in 2014.

Saginaw Mayor Dennis Browning acknowledged that the city has a crime problem, but said he's happy to see it on the decline. He said there is much more to Saginaw than the crime stats.
"There are so many good things," he said. "Good students graduate every year. If people want to dwell on the negative, of course it's there.
"Sure, we got a problem. If we keep emphasizing this crime, it's going to be in people's minds. It should be there, but it should be in the back of their minds. Because violent crime affects so few directly, though it affects all of us indirectly, and it's isolated to such a small group."
In 2014, Saginaw with 50,030 people reported 845 violent crimes, 11 murders and non-negligent manslaughters, 74 rapes, 124 robberies, and 640 aggravated assaults.
The total number of violent crimes reported represents a decade low for Saginaw.
In 2013, Saginaw, with a population of 50,580, recorded 985 violent crimes, including 29 murders and non-negligent manslaughters, 64 rapes, 129 robberies and 763 aggravated assaults. The FBI said 1,211 violent crimes occurred in 2012 within the 51,267 population of Saginaw.
The FBI cautions the public against ranking the data, stating "Readers should take into consideration relevant factors in addition to an area's crime statistics when making any valid comparisons of crime among different locales."
The ranking includes cities with 50,000 or more. Saginaw's population is listed as 50,030.
A look ahead
Special Lt. David Kaiser of the Michigan State Police said troopers working in the cities are used to seeing tragedy.
"You're seeing the shootings, the homicides, the death," he said. "You're seeing the results of violence day in and day out."
Kaiser said when comparing January 2014 to August 2014 to the same period one year later, in 2015, rapes are down 14.8 percent, robberies are down 12.3 percent, and aggravated assaults are down 3.7 percent, contributing to a total drop of violent crime by more than 6 percent, Kaiser said. He did not have full details on what is included in that definition of violent crime.
Saginaw has recorded seven homicides in 2015 through Sept. 29. Flint has had 46 homicides in 2015 and Detroit recorded 221, according to department statistics.
Mayor Browning said he would like to see the declining violent crime trend continue.
He listed law enforcement, neighborhood associations and members of Saginaw's faith-based community as important players in Saginaw's fight against violent crime.
He believes more jobs for Saginaw residents could help by giving people an "opportunity to make good choices instead of bad choices," adding that much of Saginaw's violent crime involves drugs and/or gangs.
"The more we can get the young people educated and get them good-paying jobs, I think it's going to continue going down," he said, adding, "it's not just one thing."
Kaiser noted that state police continue to work side-by-side with Saginaw Police Department detectives in the same building, allowing them to work well on investigations. He said demolition of blight in Saginaw and police community outreach have contributed to the reduction.
While there is more work to be done, the officials agree, there are some successes to celebrate, Kaiser said.
"One of the best things I've seen, driving around a neighborhood at dusk and seeing a kid playing ball in the street and not afraid," he said. "That's huge. That didn't take place a couple years ago."

The former chief economist of the European Central Bank, Jürgen Stark, has levelled strong criticism at the bank and revealed why he decided to resign from his post last year.
According to information obtained by SPIEGEL, Stark wrote a farewell letter to the bank's 1,600-strong staff in which he accused his former colleagues in the Governing Council of having taken decisions "that stretched the mandate of the ECB to extremes."
Stark said he saw a risk that the bank was increasingly "operating under fiscal domination" because of its purchases of government bonds. He said it was "an illusion to believe that monetary policy can solve major structural and fiscal problems in the euro zone."
He also warned that history had shown that whenever a central bank subordinated itself to the needs of fiscal policy, it had to make concessions when it came to its true task of keeping the value of money stable.
'Lack of Understanding'
Stark, 63, announced his resignation in September. At the time, he said he was quitting for personal reasons, but experts suspected that the true reason was his opposition to the ECB's crisis management policy.
Stark is regarded as a monetary policy hawk and, like former Bundesbank President Axel Weber, who quit earlier last year, had been strictly against the ECB helping to ail euro-zone nations by purchasing their government bonds on a large scale.
In an interview in December, Stark had said this was no solution -- even "if 90 percent of self-proclaimed experts see that differently." He had said people who held up the US Federal Reserve's bond-purchasing strategy as a "shining example" were only showing a "lack of understanding for the institutional framework in Europe."
Stark has been succeeded by Belgian economist Peter Praet.

A long, long time ago—like eight or nine years—Democrats had a rare opportunity that comes along once a generation in politics: They could do something. After winning the House, the Senate, and the White House, the party set out reforming the American healthcare system, which was notoriously complicated, inefficient, and cruel. After months of heated debate and compromise between liberals who wanted government-provided health insurance and moderates who wanted something less drastic, the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, became law.
The ACA expanded Medicaid to a larger number of people and incentivized those too wealthy to qualify for Medicaid to purchase insurance by way of a set of penalties and subsidies. It failed to satisfy left-wing members of Congress like Bernie Sanders, who wanted "Medicaid for all"; Republicans uniformly opposed it from the beginning; it pissed off enough voters that Democrats immediately lost control of the House; it narrowly avoided being dismantled by the Supreme Court; the website it created was a clusterfuck; some of its state insurance marketplaces have been struggling; experts still debate its economic impact. It was an enormously complicated piece of legislation, in other words, that fell short in many respects—and yet it did succeed in giving millions of people health insurance, mostly through Medicaid.
With Donald Trump and the Republicans sweeping the 2016 elections, they have a similar chance to do something big, namely turn their long-held promise of repealing and replacing the ACA into concrete action. The most significant move of the repeal effort came Monday, when House Republicans, led by Speaker Paul Ryan, released a bill that officially outlined an ACA replacement. Like the ACA, the new bill—called the American Health Care Act, or AHCA—is an attempt at doing a whole lot of things at once. It gets rid of most of the ACA's unpopular features, halts the Medicaid expansion (after 2019), and lets insurers charge old people more than they currently can, among other things. It also appears to be an attempt to craft something that can pass the Senate through "reconciliation," a process that requires 50 votes rather than 60 and is intended to be used for measures relating to revenue.
It has the support of some Republican leaders, including President Donald Trump, but everyone else seems to hate it with a passion. Here's an incomplete guide to the who and why:
Democrats
Obviously, everyone on the left opposes a bill that strips away benefits and protections from people. The ACA was uniformly denounced by Republicans, so Democrats have been doing the same thing to its proposed replacement. Even those who criticized the ACA as being insufficiently socialist don't want to see it struck down.
Planned Parenthood
The ACHA would also defund Planned Parenthood for a year, so naturally the women's healthcare organization is against it.
Conservative Think Tanks
But the really bad sign for the bill is that conservatives have problems with the ACHA, too, albeit for opposite reasons than Democrats. The bill would keep the government involved in healthcare to an unacceptable extent, say groups like the Heritage Foundation and the Club for Growth. "Obamacare Lite" is the moniker that appears to be sticking to the ACHA. That's not a compliment.
The Koch Brothers
In that roster of conservative groups opposed to the ACHA are those backed by the anti-regulation, anti-tax Koch brothers, who have no problem throwing around the apocalyptic rhetoric of the Tea Party. From USA Today:
At a Capitol Hill rally Tuesday attended by about 200 Koch-aligned activists, Americans for Prosperity President Tim Phillips warned that Republicans "will have the shortest-lived majority in the modern era" [if] they don't toss the law on "the ash heap of history."
Conservative Intellectuals
Right-wing healthcare wonks hate the ACA for a host of reasons, but they appear to hate the AHCA almost as much:
"House Republican leaders sent a signal loud and clear: liberalism has already won," wrote Philip Klein, a conservative who has written extensively on healthcare for the Washington Examiner .
. "If Republicans manage to pass this, they will richly deserve it when voters blame them for the resulting havoc it will wreak in the individual market," predicted Megan McArdle in Bloomberg.
"The GOP's real problem, in terms of passing legislation, isn't that the party can't agree on specifics, or that legislators need to bargain their way toward a compromise that gives everyone something they want," wrote Jacob Sullum in libertarian Reason . "It's that they don't agree on, or in some cases even have, basic goals when it comes to health policy."
. "It's that they don't agree on, or in some cases even have, basic goals when it comes to health policy." Finally, a National Review editorial bent over backward to praise the bill, but concluded, "The bill is a disappointment. And it is not too late to get a second opinion."
Ann Coulter
Breitbart News
Two versions of the homepage of what is normally a very Trump-friendly media outlet:
Old People
Even before any bill was introduced to the public, AARP, the senior advocacy group with an enormous amount of political power, was gearing up to fight any Republican plan that would allow insurers to jack up rates on older people. The AHCA allows insurers to jack up rates on older people, so predictably AARP has come out against it. It even produced an ad against the "age tax" contained in the AHCA:
Senate Republicans
Meanwhile, several Republican senators have problems with the bill, too. Rand Paul and Mike Lee, both antigovernment conservatives, oppose it on the same grounds as the Freedom Caucus. Ted Cruz hasn't made up his mind about it. And Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican moderate, has voiced concerns about any ACA replacement that doesn't leave the Medicaid expansion in place or that defunds Planned Parenthood.
At Least One Republican Governor
"Illinois won't do very well under the changes they're recommending" is how Illinois governor Bruce Rauner put his vague criticism of the ACHA. A lot of Republican governors in states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA (like Illinois did) have been nervous about a repeal that ends that expansion.
Hospitals
The American Hospital Association released a letter to congressional leaders Tuesday opposing the bill, presumably because fewer insured people means less revenue for hospitals.
Doctors
The American College of Physicians wrote a similar letter to Congress on Tuesday, highlighting a host of concerns about sweeping changes to Medicaid and coverage requirements. UPDATE: The American Medical Association, the country's largest doctors group, announced its own opposition on Wednesday.
Conservative Republicans in the House
Adding insult to insult, even Ryan's fellow House Republicans aren't united around the bill. After a meeting Tuesday evening, the Freedom Caucus—a group of hardline conservatives in the House—was reportedly very unhappy with the ACHA, saying that the Speaker would need Democratic votes to get the bill through the House. That's not going to happen.
Paul Ryan?
The ACHA plan is so hated that there's speculation that somebody as allegedly clever as Ryan would never have introduced it seriously. At the bare minimum, wouldn't he have at least consulted with the conservative groups that are tearing into the bill? Or try to get the fickle Freedom Caucus in line? Is Ryan really that dumb? Yeah, he's dumb LIKE A FOX, according to one theory:
"Ryan couldn't possibly be this inept," wrote Scott Lemieux in the Week. He didn't get his allies on board for a simple reason: He doesn't actually want any major repeal plan to pass."
Soooooo, uh, the way this theory goes is that Ryan wants to be seen making a serious attempt to repeal the ACA, but the ACA is popular enough with voters—and potential replacements are so unpopular—that making changes to the healthcare system would wreck Republicans' electoral chances. Better to do nothing loudly, then, and make sure you're reelected.
If this is what the GOP's effort to do something big looks like, getting rid of the ACA is going to be even harder than it was to set up.

Editor's Note- In this article Olivier Garret, CEO of The Casey Report shows us the massive extent of the bailout compared to every major Government expenditure from the Revolutionary War and the Louisiana Purchase to the Iraq War in inflation adjusted terms and the results are pretty scary. Based on the magnitude of the bailout expenditures it appears Hyperinflation is already baked into the cake. You thought WWII and Iraq were expensive? You “ain't seen nothin' yet. The current bailout is larger than all the major government expenditures since the revolutionary war combined.And lest you think that is because the bailout is comparing inflated dollars against more valuable (and thus smaller numbers) it isn't. This article uses all inflation adjusted numbers!In three months, Paulson and Bernanke spent more than twice the cost of all of WWII. Iraq? Vietnam? A drop in the bucket.
The Real Cost of the 2008 Bailout- Hyperinflation
By Olivier Garret, CEO,
The Casey Report

It took the statisticians of the National Bureau of Economic Research almost a year to confirm what the rest of us already knew, that the US registered a significant decline in economic activity, thus officially entering a period of recession.
While I am pleased that the members of NBER take their duties seriously, thereby ensuring that they don't leap to any hasty conclusions, I only wish that similar moderation could be displayed by their colleagues at the Fed and the Treasury.
Unfortunately, the facts prove otherwise. Three months before the recession was officially declared, Paulson and Bernanke have embarked on the largest bailout program ever conceived with the blessing of a lame-duck president and a complicit Congress – a program which so far will cost taxpayers $8.5 trillion. This staggering sum encompasses: loans backed by worthless assets ($2.3T), equity investments in bankrupt companies with negative net worth ($3.0T), and guarantees on crumbling derivatives and other hollow collateral ($3.2T).
Back in September I was stunned that Paulson was able to make his case and win the support of Congress for a $700 billion bailout package (more than the total war spending in Iraq to date).
How could Americans (or more accurately, their representatives) agree to give such a broad mandate with so few checks and balances? Have we become completely numb?
While I realize that many of our compatriots have been running large credit card balances and interest-only mortgages with little thought as to how they would repay their debt, one would expect a little more restraint when dealing with the financial future of the largest economy in the world.
Operating under the assumption that our largest financial institutions are “too big to fail”, in the span of a few weeks we went from pledging to spend $1 trillion to $3 trillion – a commitment which then grew to $5 trillion before ballooning to a staggering $8.5 trillion.
At the rate we are going, we will be dealing with double digits – in trillions- before the end of the year.
And while all off that money is not yet spent, make no mistake – these are real commitments with serious liabilities attached to them.
I have heard the argument that an equity infusion is not the same as spending money. While I would agree that in an arms-length transaction this might actually be the case, our government is definitely paying a large premium. What is the real value of Citicorp or AIG? Since they are quasi-bankrupt (and would be totally bankrupt without massive injections from the Fed), a reasonable businessperson might pay a token price for their equity and the assumption of their enormous liabilities. Before doing so however, a buyer would have to see some significant value in buying these entities as a continuing business. In most cases, a buyer would not want to assume the company's liabilities but would prefer to buy selective unencumbered assets in a bankruptcy proceeding. Any money our government pays above what a reasonable person would pay in an arms-length transaction is real spending and should more accurately be called a grant.
While defenders of the too-big-to-fail policies argue that providing guarantees is not the same as granting money, the reality is that these guarantees are necessary to prevent the collapse of financial institutions currently lacking the necessary collateral to meet their loan covenants. Should their loans be called, we could actually find out the real value of their assets. The fact is that in-spite of Paulson's and Bernanke's efforts, deleveraging is already happening. Although at a slower pace, one asset class after another is being adjusted down towards its intrinsic value, which is usually not much. Make no mistake; many of these guarantees will eventually be called in by lenders. In due time, unless our government is able to inflates its way out of this bottomless pit, it will have to honor most of these guarantees.
So how does $8.5 trillion dollars compare with the cost of some of the major conflicts and programs initiated by the US government since its inception? To try and grasp the enormity of this figure, let's look at some other financial commitments undertaken by our government in the past:
As illustrated above, you can see that in today's dollars, we have already committed to spending levels that surpass the cumulative cost of all of the major wars and government initiatives since the American Revolution.
Recently, the Congressional Research Service estimated the cost of all of the major wars our country has fought in 2008 dollars. The chart above shows that the entire cost of WWII over four to five years was less than half the current pledges made by Paulson and Bernanke in the last three months!
In spite of years of conflict, the Vietnam and the Iraq wars have each cost less than the bailout package that was approved by Congress in two weeks. The Civil War that devastated our country had a total price tag (for both the Union and Confederacy) of $60.4 billion, while the Revolutionary War was fought for a mere $1.8 billion.
In its fifty or so years of existence, NASA has only managed to spend $885 billion – a figure which got us to the moon and beyond.
The New Deal had a price tag of only $500 billion. The Marshall Plan that enabled the reconstruction of Europe following WWII for $13 billion, comes out to approximately $125 billion in 2008 dollars. The cost of fixing the S&L crisis was $235 billion.
The best deal ever for a government program was the Louisiana Purchase, a deal with the French that gave us 23% of the surface of today's US for only $15 million ($284 million in today's dollars). Why couldn't Paulson and Bernanke display the financial acumen of a Thomas Jefferson?
How will our country repay its debts? The current bailout represents 62% of our GDP. Our current deficit of almost $11 trillion may exceed our GDP next year.
Recently the Treasury has been able to place new debt; investors have liquidated equities and bonds and sought refuge in the relative safety of the dollar and government bonds.
As we move forward however, our government will need to attract trillions of dollars annually to fund its programs and commitments. The foreigners who have financed our irresponsible spending for many years will no longer be able to afford it, let alone finance more of our reckless behavior.
As a matter of fact, several countries have already announced their own bailout packages to prop up their domestic economy. And, unlike during WWII, when Americans invested their savings to support the war effort and fund our government's deficit, our citizens are in debt themselves with no savings left to invest.
In the near future, the Fed will have no choice but to turn on the printing presses and start operating them around the clock to create the money that can't be raised in the capital market.
These actions will lead to a significant debasement of the dollar and a major appreciation of gold and all commodities (real assets).
Once this inflationary cycle starts, foreigners will realize that their investments in T-bills are depreciating rapidly. There will be a massive exodus that will put more pressure on the dollar and on interest rates. Our weakened US economy will be faced with the rising cost of capital and a painful period of stagflation. Trillions of dollars will have been wasted. Our government will have mortgaged America and the ensuing debt will have to be paid by future generations.
Hyperinflation is not a very bright picture, to be sure, but the Casey Research team strongly believes that there are opportunities in every crisis.

The deceased were identified as Kaushik Puneesh Sharma, 40, his wife Srilatha, 36, daughter Sriraksha, 11 and son Kaustub, 9, residing in a duplex house in the Vakeel Garden City.

Sriraksha was studying in Class IV and Kaustub in Class III in a private school. Kaushik runs a finance and real estate business in the city.
He killed his family by injecting poison into them before taking his own life, the deputy superintendent of police (Ramanagaram) Ramachandrappa said.
The incident came to light on Friday around 12 noon, when Sharma's niece Sumega Reddy came to the house. Sharma had reportedly called her around 12 midnight and asked her to come his house by 10.30 am as he needed to hand over a bag containing some valuables.
She reached the house and tried to her uncle but there was no response. When she peeped into the house through a window, she found the children and her aunt lying in the bedroom. She informed the Talaghattapur police who reached the spot and entered the house by breaking open the door.
The police found two letters in the house with one asking for his relatives to be contacted for distribution of his property after his death.
In another letter, he said he was being harassed by a person called Reddy from the Andhra Pradesh police. He mentioned a CCS Hyderabad as well. The police suspects that CCS reference is to the Central Crime Station (CCS), a detective department of the Hyderabad police.
Superintendent of police for the Ramanagaram district, Anupam Agarwal, said the death notes found at the home did not clearly mention any policeman's name. The SP claimed that the note did not say Sharma was harassed by the police.
“We have registered a case of murder against Sharma for the death of his wife and children.
We have also registered a case of abetment to suicide since he has mentioned Andhra Pradesh policemen. We are investigating the case to know the role of AP policemen, if any, in this case,” Agarwal said.
Meanwhile, the CCS police in Hyderabad said they had registered a case against a private bank for allegedly cheating a person by the name Kaushik.

The CCS said they would need to verify the case to know if the complainant was the same Kaushik who committed suicide. A deputy commissioner of police (CCS, Hyderabad) G Pala Raju clarified there was no case registered against Kaushik with the CCS, Hyderabad.
It's as if Mr. Trump's media attacks have combined with the heightened attention on the perils of fake news to create one big fat advertisement for the value of basic journalism.
“The fake news business is going to be great for journalism in the long run,” Mr. Carter told me Friday, referring to Mr. Trump as “the Fake Newser in Chief.” “Proper news organizations should thrive under this.”
To do so, though, journalism is going to have to find its inner Taylor Swift.
In case you can't remember all the way back to 2015, Ms. Swift, the pop megastar, stood up to Apple after it tried to give away her songs — and those of her fellow musicians — for free, sans royalties, as part of a promotion for its new streaming service. “We don't ask you for free iPhones,” she wrote in an open letter to the company.
The music industry might seem like an odd place for people in the hard news game to turn. But, like the news industry, it had spent the better part of this century preparing its obituary as the web made it easy for people to listen to so much music without paying for it.
Then it happened upon the streaming subscription business. People started paying again, even for vinyl, and there's new talk of a corner turned, as The Financial Times recently reported.
Now, think of the readers as Apple in the showdown with Ms. Swift. In many cases, they've been getting news for free that other people pay for through subscriptions. That is because newspapers for so long gave it all away for nothing, only to face dire economic consequences when players like Facebook and Google showed up to gobble up the online advertising market. That put the onus back onto selling subscriptions.
As the country and the world head into this confusing new era, news organizations are in a position to make a newly urgent pitch: Buying a subscription is tantamount to supporting the pillars of democracy. It's about maintaining the sort of reporting that debunks fake news, holds power accountable and keeps the nation on course in its own imperfect way.

Sepp Blatter insists he has done nothing illegal and will remain as FIFA president
Sepp Blatter says he will remain as FIFA president until February
Sepp Blatter has said he will remain as president of FIFA until February, reiterating that "he has done nothing illegal or improper" after criminal proceedings were opened against him by the Swiss Attorney General.
Speaking at a meeting of staff at FIFA's headquarters in Zurich, Blatter told them he would not answer any more questions on the criminal proceedings that were brought against him last Friday.
Blatter is suspected of criminal mismanagement or misappropriation over a TV rights deal he signed with former Caribbean football chief Jack Warner in 2005.
He is also suspected of "a disloyal payment" of £1.35m to UEFA president Michel Platini in 2011. Blatter also insisted on Monday that this payment was legitimate.
A statement from Blatter's lawyer said: "President Blatter spoke to FIFA staff today and informed the staff that he was cooperating with the authorities, reiterated that he had done nothing illegal or improper, and stated that he would remain as president of FIFA.
Blatter has been questioned by Swiss investigators
"On the Platini matter, president Blatter on Friday shared with the Swiss authorities the fact that Mr Platini had a valuable employment relationship with FIFA serving as an advisor to the president, beginning in 1998.
"He explained to the prosecutors that the payments were valid compensation and nothing more, and were properly accounted for within FIFA, including the withholding of social security contributions.
"Because of the continuing investigation President Blatter will answer no further questions at this time."
The FIFA president, 79, returned to work on Monday having been interrogated by Swiss investigators in recent days.
Both Blatter and Platini, who has also insisted the payment had been above board and declared to the Swiss authorities, are being investigated by FIFA's ethics committee following the opening of the proceedings against the FIFA president.
Blatter is due to hand over power in February when an emergency election is held, triggered and announced by the president himself after days of arrests of senior officials back in May, just four days after he was re-elected for a fifth term in power.
Christopher Lowen Agee
In 1960 Patrolman John Mindermann, a rookie officer in the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), was assigned to San Francisco's Polk Gulch neighborhood. On his first night out, he stumbled upon the Cable Car Village, a gay bar. Speaking with me years later, he recounted this discovery and his feelings of confusion and vulnerability:
I stopped as I go [sic] inside the front door. And I'm shocked because I see nothing but men down the bar, and in the back. . . there's, I guess, a small dance floor, because I never quite got back that way. And I see men dancing with each other. . . . [Laughing] I've never seen anything like this! . . . Could this be a—in the parlance of SFPD, could this be a fruit joint? . . . And everything stops when they see me. Everybody's apprehensive. They've never seen this guy before, you know. . . . And I go, I better not do anything because there's so many of them, and there's just me, and I have no radio. . . . So I back out and I go about my diligent business.
As Mindermann's recollections of bewilderment illustrate, postwar law enforcement leaders rarely prepared patrol officers for the day-to-day policing of gay and lesbian people. Instead, departments expected their patrol officers to use their discretion. Officers could enforce formal legal codes over gay and lesbian bars. Often they extorted money from these establishments. These police demands for payoffs sparked resistance from gay bar owners and set the stage for a wider campaign for professionalized policing and liberal sexual standards in San Francisco.
Police like Patrolman Mindermann entered the post-World War II period with vast discretionary powers over San Francisco's LGBT residents. Unexpectedly, the politics of redevelopment opened an opportunity for gay-bar owners to challenge that discretion. During the 1950s, urban reformers began viewing police extortion as an obstacle to federal redevelopment grants, and they therefore launched a movement against police corruption. Gay-bar owners achieved a civic voice by placing themselves at the forefront of that professionalization campaign. Ultimately, these gay-bar owners used the politics of discretion to forge a new enduring liberal coalition and ideology.
After World War II, the nation's urban police leaders occasionally ordered bar raids and neighborhood sweeps, but they seldom directed policing during the long stretches in between those high-profile police actions. In most cities, the day-to-day policing of gay and lesbian bars fell to beat officers. For most of the 1950s, police in California could not prosecute a bar for simply allowing gays and lesbians to congregate. But if patrol officers wished to express antigay animus or regulate a bar's visibility, they could choose from a variety of harassment tactics. For instance, officers could use subjective noise ordinances or arrest patrons with vague status-based codes, such as “vagrancy.” Often, police officers preferred tactics that limited their physical contact with gay and lesbian people. One approach that required minimal intimacy was to demand payoffs–known as “payola”–from a bar's owner.
Payola had played a central role in urban American governance since the nineteenth century. Urban political machines commonly appointed cronies to plum positions within city agencies like the police department and then expected those appointees to fill machine coffers with extortion payments. Police officers permitted discrete gambling dens, prostitution houses, abortion clinics, and homosexual bars to operate in exchange for payoffs, and the officers themselves profited by pocketing a small fraction of the payola.
This corrupt arrangement encountered a new challenge, however, in 1949 when the federal government began offering cities funds for large-scale redevelopment. In order to receive these grants, city officials simply had to conduct studies illustrating that an area was “blighted” and present a competent plan for redevelopment. Downtown business leaders stood to make fortunes off of the subsidized razing and rebuilding of the urban core, but they often found that machine cronies lacked the expertise and motivation to craft grant applications. As a result, postwar downtown elites began looking for reformers who would professionalize city government.
In San Francisco, downtown elites backed George Christopher, a clean-government reformer, in the city's 1955 mayoral election. Christopher positioned himself as a candidate for the people—rather than a lackey for elite business interests­­­­­—by insisting that his professionalization agenda would defend the interests of male heterosexual breadwinners and their families. In the San Francisco News-Call Bulletin, Christopher charged that machine officials condoning an “open town” of “vice” establishments only “care about…the fast buck. They don't care where they get it—whether it's from your daughter or the kid next door.” Christopher tied together downtown development, government professionalization, and traditional family values into a single agenda and thereby won the 1955 election by the largest margin of victory in San Francisco history.
Although Christopher championed “family values,” his dedication to clean-government reform opened an opportunity for gay and lesbian owners of bars. In 1960 Christopher had finally staffed his government's top-tier positions with reformers and downtown business leaders assumed that this efficient government was ready to support urban development projects. A group of gay-bar owners realized that Christopher's elite support hinged on his ability to root out corruption. They revealed to the mayor that beat officers were demanding payoffs from the city's downtown gay drinking establishments and threatened to go public with this information. With his reputation and coalition at stake, Christopher worked with gay-bar owners to entrap corrupt officers. In fewer than four months, a grand jury indicted three sergeants, two patrolmen, and one state liquor agent. The rank-and-file police named the payola scandal gayola.
Although Christopher helped free the city's gay and lesbian bars from organized police extortion, the clean-government alliance between Christopher and the gay and lesbian bar owners proved short-lived. The mayor remained committed to a heterosexual standard of citizenship, and after the gayola trials, he ordered raids against the city's gay and lesbian drinking establishments. Within a year, law enforcement shuttered all of the bars involved in the gayola trials.
However, the trials planted the seeds for a second, more resilient reform coalition. San Francisco's downtown redevelopment was attracting thousands of young white-collar workers into the city. These professionals desired clean government as a path to downtown growth, but they often arrived in the city childless and relatively uninterested in traditional family values. Instead, the young migrants hoped clean governance would produce a profitable and culturally diverse San Francisco.
The gay prosecution witnesses in the gayola trials presented themselves as potential partners in that project, and San Francisco's young white-collar workers received the message. During the trials one young liberal journalist for the San Francisco Chronicle expressed little concern over the reported harassment of gay and lesbian people, but he ribbed a “husky [and] solemn-faced” sergeant for using his discretion to stifle gay commerce. When the officer testified that he had forbidden a gay-bar performance that was “one of the lewdest I believe I've ever seen,” the reporter quipped that the officer “‘Censored' Gay Bars” and questioned why “he alone decided when the shows got too rough for the customers.”
The debates over police discretion thus allowed young downtown professionals and middle-class gays and lesbians to form a new “cosmopolitan liberal” coalition based on professionalized governance, downtown development, and broadened sexual standards. By the end of the 1960s, local candidates like Joseph Alioto and Dianne Feinstein were using these principles to win elections to City Hall.
This cosmopolitan liberal politics initially made San Francisco unique, but by the end of the Sixties and into the next decade, gay and lesbian activists used the politics of police professionalization to build bridges with white-collar workers in Los Angeles, Seattle, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Sexuality scholars emphasizing sociocultural politics have often pointed to the broadening mores of the sexual revolution when explaining gay and lesbian coalition building in the second half of the twentieth century. Meanwhile, historians examining the development of the “straight state” have largely narrated the professionalization of the government as a process of increasing coerciveness. The gayola story integrates and amends the sociocultural and state development approaches. In cities like San Francisco, gay and lesbian owners of bars exploited the politics of police professionalization to both enter the civic sphere and claim rights as citizens.

Watch Kai McKenzie-Lyle score on his Guyana Debut!
The Bees keeper, who was making debut for the Golden Jaguars, went up for a free-kick in the 119th minute and looped home a header to drag his side back into the game.
You watch Kai's debut goal below:
&amp;amp;lt;/body&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/html&amp;amp;gt;
Speaking from Guyana this afternoon, McKenzie-Lyle said: "When I first ran up for the free kick I noticed I was maybe a foot taller than all of the other players.
"The guy who took the free-kick told me he would aim for me and I said I would get my head on it. I did that and it went over the keeper and bounced in!
"It took a couple of seconds to realise I had scored but my immediate thought was I had to spin back and get back in goal to start again and look for the equaliser."
Former Bee and now Guyana captain Sam Cox tried to help the ball home on the line but McKenzie-Lyle is adamant the goal is his.
"I think they have given it to me but he is still trying to claim it!" he laughed.
McKenzie-Lyle is part of Ross Eames' Development Team and has made just one senior appearance for Barnet. But playing in the tropical conditions of Suriname proved something of a challenge.
"It started off with a thunderstorm in the first half and I was wondering before the game if it would be called off or not," he explained. "But I was told it happens all the time in this part of the world.
"It's really humid out here and there has not been much rain but when it does rain, it rains a lot and the first half started like that."
He continued: "The first half was quite difficult with the conditions. Caribbean football is very different to English or European football and the referee was quite lenient so that was a factor. We grew into the game I thought I did OK in the end."
Next up for the Golden Jaguars is a home game against Jamaica in Leonara. A win would put Guyana level on points with Suriname in Group 1 with the prize a place at the 2017 Caribbean Cup and Gold Cup.
"It is a big game for us and it should be even more of a test than the last game because they are a strong side," said McKenzie-Lyle. "But we have got them at home so anything could happen.
Goalkeeper Kai McKenzie-Lyle made headlines on Saturday, as his Barnet teammates travelled back from Doncaster Rovers, by scoring in Guyana's 3-2 loss to Suriname.
Russia, Ukraine Distance Themselves From News Of A Cease-Fire Deal
Enlarge this image toggle caption Mykhailo Markiv/AP Mykhailo Markiv/AP
The morning started on a hopeful note: The office of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said that in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the two had agreed on a "permanent cease-fire."
But that was short-lived. As the state-funded Russia Today reports, the Russians quickly pointed out that they had reached no such agreement, because "Russia is not party to Ukraine conflict."
That, the Kyiv Post reports, was followed by a partial walk-back from Ukraine. The Post explains:
"In a revised statement, Poroshenko's press service said that such an agreement was reached over the phone. The original statement indicated a 'permanent' ceasefire agreement was reached for Ukraine's east, but made no details available. Later the word 'permanent' was removed. "Poroshenko spoke to Putin on the phone on Sept. 3, according to a statement on the president's website. 'As a result of this conversation, an agreement was reached on a permanent ceasefire in Donbas. An agreement was reached about mutual vision of steps that will promote peace,' the press statement said."
The Russian news agency RIA Novosti reports that a rebel leader in eastern Ukraine also rejected news of a cease-fire.
"This is some sort of game by Kiev," an aide to Andrei Purgin, the self-proclaimed prime minister of the Donetsk People's Republic, told the news service. "This was completely unexpected. This decision was made without us."
As Reuters reads the confusing tea leaves, the "statements appeared to indicate a degree of progress that could influence European Union leaders as they consider introducing new sanctions against Russia as early as Friday."
Reuters adds:
"In a contradictory signal, Moscow simultaneously announced plans for huge military exercises this month by the strategic rocket forces responsible for its long-range nuclear weapons. It said the maneuvers in south-central Russia would involve 4,000 troops and extensive use of air power. "The timing was clearly calculated to throw down a challenge to NATO and the United States, hours before President Barack Obama was due to deliver a speech on the crisis in Russia's neighbor Estonia."
Meanwhile, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk issued some tough words against Russia.
"Russia is a terrorist state, it is an aggressor state and will bear responsibility under international law," Yatsenyuk said, according to Reuters.
Russia has always denied that it is taking direct action in Ukraine. The U.S., NATO and Ukraine have said more than 1,000 Russian troops are directly involved in the fight.
Update at 12:09 p.m. ET. France Suspends Delivery Of Warship:
Saying that Russia's actions in Ukraine harm "the foundations of security in Europe," the office of French President Francois Hollande said it was suspending the delivery of a warship to Russia.
The Associated Press reports that the decision comes after Hollande "convened a special defense panel" and "comes a day before the start of a NATO summit and after months of pressure from France to suspend the sale amid tensions between Russia and Ukraine."
As the debate over the Federal Communications Commission's proposal to change net neutrality rules heats up, internet service providers have taken to the fight by buying advertisements through advocacy group Broadband for America (BFA).
Gizmodo reported BFA is running advertisements on Google Ads so its website appears as a sponsored result when users search for topics involving net neutrality. The ad appears with the title, “Support Net Neutrality — Promote Broadband Innovation” and links to a page on BFA's site dealing with net neutrality.
Read: FCC Net Neutrality News: A Bot Is Flooding Commission's Website With Anti-Net Neutrality Comments
The landing page of the advertisement contains a number of talking points that oppose net neutrality in its current form, which has classified the internet as a public utility under Title II of the Communications Act. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai introduced his plan to undo those protections, which has received the support of a number of major telecom companies.
“ ‘Title II' is not net neutrality,” one bullet point on the site says before explaining that net neutrality is not controversial but that classifying internet service providers as common carriers under “1930s-era utility regulations” is. It also suggests the regulations “deter investment in networks and put internet jobs at risk.”
“If Silicon Valley used these rules, Apple would still be stuck in the garage and Google would just be the wrong way to spell a really big number,” the site argues.
What is not clear on the site is who is funding its message. BFA counts among its members AT&T, Charter, Comcast, the Telecommunications Industry Association and the Internet and Television Association (ITA) — formerly known as the National Cable and Telecommunications Association.
The trade organizations that back BFA are also composed of major wired and wireless internet providers and have dumped considerable resources into BFA. ITA gave more than $10 million to BFA between 2010 and 2014; a 2012 donation of $2 million accounted for more than half of BFA's $3.5 million budget that year.

In 2014, during the original debate over whether the FCC should reclassify the internet as a public utility, BFA was criticized by a number of small companies that it counted among its members for essentially tricking them into joining an anti-net neutrality organization. Other companies listed by BFA as members said they had never heard of the group.
The advertisements from BFA are the latest effort by organizations that support undoing current net neutrality protections to push their voice to the forefront of the debate.
Earlier this week, the FCC reported it was hit by a DDoS, or distributed denial-of-service, attack that took its commenting system offline. That flood of traffic came just after John Oliver encouraged viewers of his HBO show "Last Week Tonight" to leave comments on the FCC site encouraging the agency to keep current net neutrality protections.
Once the commenting system was once again online and accessible, it appeared an automated bot was leaving thousands of comments advocating for the reversal of Title II protections. The bot used names and addresses of people that appeared to be sourced from real estate websites.
Shiite militia again defeated by ISIS in town of Bashir in northern Iraq 5815 Views By Rudaw

ERBIL, Kurdistan Region - With large reinforcements brought in from Najaf and Karbala, the Iraqi Shiite militia known as Hashd al-Shaabi once again failed to recapture the Islamic State (ISIS) held town of Bashir in southern Kirkuk, and the forces withdrew to their starting position.
"Backed by Allah, at the nearest juncture we will declare control of Bashir and we insist we will carry out Friday prayers inside the village," Ali Karim, a Shiite official, told Rudaw.
He said he would not explain upcoming plans for the recapture of the town from ISIS "because they are military matters."
To recapture Bashir the Hashd al-Shaabi has so far launched nine assaults, with 83 militiamen killed and 198 others wounded.
In the latest confrontations with ISIS, more than 100 Hashd al-Shaabi militants were killed and wounded in an offensive on Bashir on April 11, according to a local official.
On Saturday, the militia asked for more troops for another offensive to recapture Bashir.
The militia's Abbas division has called on its 11 branches in Iraq's central and southern provinces to send another 1,500 fighters to participate in the first phase of the Bashir offensive.
The sound of ISIS Friday prayers coming out from the minaret of the Bashir mosques could easily be heard at the Taza sub-district where Hashd al-Shaabi militants are based.
Meanwhile, a Peshmerga official said the Hashd al-Shaabi will not be able to liberate Bashir alone and at the end they must return to the Peshmerga.
"If they think they can do everything they want alone, let them do it and we wish them all the best. But in their previous trials, they did not manage to fulfill their missions successfully," said Brig. Gen. Araz Abdulqadir, a Peshmerga commander.
“They must return to and coordinate with the Peshmerga and we will support them," he said.
Bashir, 20 kilometers south of Kirkuk city, is a predominant Shiite town that fell to ISIS last year. Since then, despite many attempts the Hashdi al-Shaabi has been unable to liberate it from the clutches of ISIS.
Before the town fell to ISIS last year, 1,800 families were living there.
Although we tend to take cold wine and beer for granted today, the history of refrigeration indicates that cold beverages were once a luxury in warm climates.
In Rome of the first century CE, cold wine and iced beverages were all the rage. The Stoic philosopher Seneca spoke with disdain when he noted the current fad of dropping lumps of snow in one's cup, complaining that "nothing is cold enough for some people--hot dishes and snow drinks." Large imported fish and oysters served on a bed of snow and ice that was brought from Italian mountaintops such as Sicily's Mt. Etna, were a staple of swanky households at the time. But you had to prepare well ahead of time in order to serve ice to guests in the ancient world. The Roman bureaucrat Pliny the Younger was incensed that a gentleman whom he invited to dinner never showed up. He wrote him a letter to let him know that he would be charged for the pricey snow that had been ordered just for him.
In a world without electric refrigerators, ancient Mediterranean civilizations largely depended on salting, drying, pickling, and smoking in order to preserve their foods. In the Greco-Roman context, ice and snow were less a preservative for foodstuffs than a means to make drinks cooler. There is evidence for ancient ice pits dug into the ground for the purpose of retaining ice, and Greeks and Romans certainly used cellars in their houses to store cool beverages like wine. Ancient Chinese and Mesopotamian ice pits and ice houses were the first built for this purpose. Persian ice houses are distinctly conical in shape, made of mud bricks, could be up to 20 meters high, and had deep pits in them that held ice. It is said that after Alexander the Great conquered the city of Aornus during his Indian campaign in 327/6 BCE, he had 30 ice pits dug out and then covered with oak to seal them.
In fact, the imperial penchant for cold beverages led to a number of innovations; one of the emperor Nero's great contributions to humanity was not his musical abilities or acting, rather it was that he learned to boil water and snow in order to clear it of microbes (although Romans were unaware of what these were). He then packed the water in a jar before chilling it. This practice distilled the water and made for a refreshing beverage after being iced. A number of Roman writers note Nero's penchant for the drink, and the biographer Suetonius says that as Nero awaited his death at his villa outside Rome, he took some cold water out of one of his special tanks and noted, "haec est...Neronis decocta": "This is the distilled water of Nero."
The shape of ceramic vessels from the ancient world also indicates how much Greeks and Romans enjoyed a cold beverage. The original wine cooler was in fact called a psykter (ψυκτήρ), and was a mushroom shaped vase. The odd shape of the psykter allowed it to float within a much larger krater of cold water or snow, or be stood up on its own. When bobbing around inside of this larger krater, the turning of the scenes painted on the outside must have been amusing to surrounding dinner guests, producing a comic strip progression of sorts.
The love of cold beverages continued on into the medieval and early modern periods, with ice houses being used regularly throughout western Europe. Architectural historian Tim Buxbaum has a fascinating book on the history of such ice houses, and notes that they were often an elite structure attached to castles, palaces, monasteries, and abbeys. They could also supply a healthy revenue. As Buxbaum states, snow became "a monopoly that produces a revenue to the Pope" and the Spanish crown taxed snow in Mexico from the 16th to the 19th century (Ibid, 5). Into the 18th and 19th century, the use of ice houses increased. They were used not only for supplying ice, but also for preserving foods.
Although sweet wine was the beverage that those in the ancient Mediterranean preferred served cold, it was beer that became a popular cold beverage in early America. As I will be writing about in the coming weeks, there is a rich history of beer caves in the US. This is particularly true in areas of the American Midwest like Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa, places where Belgian and German brewers often immigrated to and began to brew beer. One of the best parts of the brewery tour at the Miller Brewery plant in Milwaukee is that it ends in the late 19th century beer caves. Similarly, Iowa City, where I now live, is now beginning to uncover and map their own history of brewing and beer caves.
Although we often overlook it, the temperatures of food and drinks could serve as indicators of wealth and luxury before the late 19th century. Mechanical refrigeration was actually a response to the needs of brewers, since the process of brewing and fermentation required natural cooling of the fermenting beer. That is often why the best beer came from cold, northern European climates, but even then, it could often not be brewed year round. Milwaukeans had prime access to ice from the lake water, which may have helped the success of brewing in the city.
For hundreds of years, brewers in Europe and the U.S. used ice caves to keep their beer cool, but in 1873, Carl von Linde, who worked for the Spaten brewery in Munich, devised a system of mechanically producing ice. The Oxford Companion to Beer (OUP 2011) remarks that a result, cold lager beers became accessible to the people by the late 19th century, and began to eclipse the "warm-fermented" ales that were previously popular. Advances in mechanical refrigeration facilitated new types of beers, but also made cold drinks accessible to the public in a novel way. Now cold water, wine, beer and other drinks could be imbibed by the masses rather than simply served on the tables of the Roman elite.

Congressman Brad Sherman of California's 27th congressional district told the House in a speech on Thurs evening that several fellow Congressional representatives have said they were threatened with the prospect 'Martial Law' should they vote in opposition to the $700 billion bailout.
Congressman Sherman's revelation comes after multiple claims that this threat was being ramped up to aid the now $850 billion bail out through the House this past Friday.

According to numerous Congressional testimonies, the stark panic atmosphere which has gripped both Congress and the US media was intentionally created in order to 'fast-track' a financial bailout bill. Several members of Congress were told before Monday's vote that martial law might be instigated in America if the legislation failed.

During his speaking time on Thurs, Congressman Sherman stated explicitly, "Many of us were told in private conversations, that if we didn't pass this bill on Monday, the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be Martial Law in America if we voted no(to the bail out bill)."
Earlier this week, Congressman Michael C. Burgess from the 26th District of Texas, went public on Monday stating live on Infowars nationwide radio broadcast, that House speaker Nancy Pelosi had declared House Rule 136A, effectively putting the House under "Martial Law" rules, a dictatorial measure only activated during times of national emergency.
Analysts and Congressmen alike have equated these threats to "fearmongering" and described as a form of "economic terrorism" carried out by powerful banking interests in order to secure the record $850 billion payout to the banks by the American people.

Physical Martial law may be invoked by the President of the United States in case of any deemed "state of emergency". Martial Law has not been put into practice since Lincoln, where several Congressmen were arrested or put under house arrest. In 1878, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids military involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval. However, both the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and USNORTHCOM has increased its direct involvement with US civilian administration. Additionally, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007, and President Bush's recent PD51 may possibly rescind previous limits by suspending Government as well as other Constitutional guarantees such as habeas corpus.

As weather conditions continued to deteriorate late Friday night and into Saturday, Environment Canada issued a special weather statement regarding freezing drizzle for much of the central regions of the province. The advisory extended north of Red Deer, south of Claresholm, east of Brooks and included the City of Calgary.
The special weather statement from Environment Canada was focusing on all surfaces; city streets, highways, sidewalks as well as parking lots.
According to Environment Canada, “freezing drizzle can produce thin, hard-to-detect layers of ice.”
The statement further explained, “freezing drizzle advisories are issued when drizzle falling in sub-zero temperatures is expected to freeze on contact, and over time create icy surfaces.”
The snow began early Friday morning, creating problems throughout the day for many Calgarians ahead of the long weekend.

Throughout the day Friday, road conditions in Calgary were not significantly compromised because of the snow, mainly because the road surfaces were still warm. However, highways were icy for much of the day contributing to a number of serious collisions.

In total, Calgary received four centimetres of snow Friday and less than one millimeter of rain.
As the precipitation continued overnight while the temperature dropped below freezing in many areas, the risk of freezing drizzle increased as expected.
As of 11:30 p.m. Friday, 511 Alberta was reporting icy conditions in and around the Calgary area, especially west and north of the city.

Google Glass has been touted for its ability to help users send hands-free texts and empower everyone from physicians to cyclers. Could it also help the image of China's urban pari-police, known for their strong-arm tactics with protesters and street vendors?
When Google Glass went on sale in China earlier this year —thanks to some enterprising folks on Taobao—Jiang Yifan, a chengguan in the city of Changzhou in southern Jiangsu province, was among those snapping them up.
The reason? He hopes it might help him avoid on-the-job incidents such as one over the weekend in Cangnan county, Zhejiang province where state media reported that protesters clashed with chengguan after an onlooker continued to photograph on-duty officers despite requests that the individual stop, prompting a crowd to form. Online, rumors that a chengguan had beaten the photographer to death further fueled anger, although the circumstances of what actually happened are unclear.
Unverified photos purportedly taken in Cangnan and posted on social media showed hundreds of people mobbing a van in which bloodied officers had taken refuge. Five officers were surrounded, and state media reported that two sustained life-threatening wounds.
The events were the latest in a series of violent incidents involving chengguan, including one high-profile case last year in which a watermelon seller was killed in a brawl in Hunan province. Several officers received prison sentences in that case.
Chengguan like Mr. Jiang are charged with keeping China's streets clean and orderly. But the number of violent situations they've been involved in has prompted plenty of introspection, as well as concern by nonprofit Human Rights Watch and others about limited checks on their power. Accordingly, Chinese cities have tried a number of tactics to try to improve chengguan-resident relations—apparently including hiring attractive female chengguan.
Mr. Jiang paid 13,500 yuan ($2,166) for the Google glasses earlier this month on Taobao. He said his own geekiness, as well as a desire for greater professionalism, played a role in his purchase. “I admire the characters in “Iron Man” and “Dragon Ball” who own the most advanced technologies,” he said in an interview with China Real Time.
In a Monday editorial, the state-run Global Times urged the government to address the frequency of chengguan conflicts. The paper cited poor training as an underlying cause for many incidents. “Most chengguan are as grassroots as other ordinary people…They take the heaviest burden of urban management, but they are treated with prejudice and bias,” the paper said.
Mr. Jiang's bosses hope their plucky comrade's choice of tech accessory might help forestall such events in the future. “It can help prevent some city residents from making unfounded accusations,” the Changzhou chengguan department wrote on its verified Weibo account on Monday. “Law enforcement needs to be open and transparent.”

Earlier this month, social game developer Zynga shut down Mafia Wars, the mobile reboot of the original web game that soft-launched back in April. In a call today with GamesBeat, CEO Frank Gibeau says that the reason was because it wasn't meeting performance expectations. On the other hand, the publisher is continuing its commitment to the mobile action strategy title Dawn of Titans, which despite great player reviews is still somewhat middling in the Apple App Store and Google Play charts.
“One of the benefits of the mobile business is that if you put a game out like of Dawn of Titans that's high quality, that has intellectual property that's really interesting and compelling but it doesn't quite find an audience or it doesn't quite have a feature set that really sparks to create an audience — in mobile you can take the time to keep innovating on the game, to keep building on the game until you get it to a place where it does find that audience and it does pop,” said Gibeau.
Zynga's strategy changed to creating “forever franchises,” a term that Gibeau coined to refer to long-term games that the studio continues to support and build out such as Zynga Poker and Words with Friends. Live services is also a big priority, such as in its racing title CSR2, which saw a 14 percent increase in revenue and 18 percent increase in bookings in Q2. The success of CSR2 is due in part to its social events and partnerships with the cinematic debut of the popular movie The Fate of the Furious and luxury brand Lamborghini.
Gibeau says that they're at a place now where they feel that they're talking to players about what features they want from Dawn of Titans and there's room for improvement. Moving forward, Zynga will add upgrades and in-game social events such as Alliance vs. Alliance PVP gameplay.
“We wish we were farther along, but we remain committed to the [Dawn of Titans] franchise,” said Gibeau, “and if you look at the performance that CSR2 is having — and that's from [developer] NaturalMotion as well — we know that it's possible to make a hit product there. It's just going to take us some more time and some more learning in order to get us there, so we're going to stick with it and continue to focus on turning it into a long-term franchise.”
Mafia Wars, which is a reboot of the 2010 web title, died after three months in soft launch. Gibeau said that it missed too many of the goals that the studio set, such as how many players it would attract, and it would have taken too many resources to get the new title to a place where it would be successful. Instead, Zynga opted to shift around its team to focus more on existing games.
“You know, long story short, we looked at [Mafia Wars] and we said, you know what, for that amount of time, for that amount of money, we could redeploy the talent on the team and redeploy those dollars against existing franchises that we have already in the portfolio and we would see more growth as a result,” said Gibeau.
Dawn of Titans spent about two years in soft launch and released worldwide last year. It's grossed about $21 million so far and it's also about to launch in China through a partnership with publisher NetEase. The Chinese games market is huge and expected to grow to $35 billion by 2021. It's clear that Zynga is choosing to prioritize what could eventually grow to be an enduring franchise over something that isn't necessarily a sure bet.

In this 2009 file photo, a sign outside the Comcast Center in Philadelphia is shown. Under net neutrality rules adopted in 2010 by the Federal Communications Commission, wired broadband providers such as Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Verizon were barred from prioritizing some types of Internet traffic over others. (Matt Rourke/AP)
A federal appeals court Tuesday struck down a far-reaching government effort to protect competition on the Web, allowing Internet providers to sell faster download speeds to the highest corporate bidder — even if access to other Web sites slows to a crawl.
Ultimately, the ruling may limit consumer choices on the Internet, critics warned. Deep-pocketed, entrenched companies such as Google, Netflix and Facebook could buy better access to American businesses and homes, while new or less affluent rivals could see their content load more slowly.
The decision is “alarming for all Internet users,” said Harvey Anderson, senior vice president of legal affairs for Mozilla, the nonprofit organization that created the Firefox Web browser. “Essential protections for user choice and online innovation are gone.”
Consumer advocates warned that if control of the Internet were to become concentrated in the hands of a few giant Internet providers, such as Time Warner Cable or Verizon, those firms could become gatekeepers of political speech and other content online.
“We've had a number of examples of how money is equated with speech. And money drives the political system,” said Gene Kimmelman, the director of the Internet Freedom and Human Rights Project at the New America Foundation. “This decision opens the door now for the companies that control the money on the Internet to drive what Web sites, what news and information is available at what price and to whom.”
The ruling by the three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit took aim at the “net neutrality” rule that had required broadband companies to treat all Internet content equally.
When it was approved three years ago by the Federal Communications Commission, the regulation prompted a firestorm of protest from Republican lawmakers and from high-speed Internet providers, which said they needed more flexibility with their business models.
Those companies argued that consumers could ultimately benefit from lower monthly bills if Web firms were willing to pick up some cost of delivering the Internet to homes and businesses.
“It's ironic that the big winner coming out of the court's decision could end up being one person who wasn't a litigant — the consumer,” said Michael K. Powell, president of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association and a former FCC chairman. “By rejecting part of the FCC's rule . . . the court removed a major barrier to the continued evolution of diverse business models.”
Analysts say the net-neutrality rule was thrown out largely because of a technicality. In the court's 63-page opinion, the judges said the FCC overstepped its authority when it passed the regulation. The court said that the agency has the power to regulate utilities such as telephone service but that because the FCC categorized the Internet as an information service, its authority to pass rules for the Web is more limited.
FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, who was sworn in late last year, said in a statement that he is considering “all available options, including those for appeal.”
He noted that the court did not completely strip the FCC's overall authority to regulate broadband providers. “I am committed to maintaining our networks as engines for economic growth, test beds for innovative services and products, and channels for all forms of speech protected by the First Amendment,” Wheeler said.
But some consumer advocates question whether Wheeler will be inclined to launch a major effort to reinstate net-neutrality rules. They note that before coming to the FCC, Wheeler had been the head of major lobbying organizations for the cable and wireless industries.
Wheeler recently has indicated some support for allowing wireless firms such as AT&T Wireless and T-Mobile to offer priority service to Web companies for a fee. Under the FCC's net-neutrality rule, broadband companies could not speed up traffic for preferred Web sites. But more flexibility was given to wireless carriers, which were banned only from blocking Web sites outright.
AT&T announced last week that it will begin sponsored data plans that would allow a company such as Twitter to pick up consumers' data costs when they use its social network. Such arrangements could spur more use by Twitter's customers but may also make it harder for small start-ups that want to compete with Twitter to get discovered.
Verizon, which provides both wireless services and high-speed Internet to homes through its Fios fiber-optic network, had sued the FCC to overturn the net-neutrality rule. The company has told the court that it wants to explore similar arrangements as the one announced by AT&T.
But in a statement, the firm said it will not substantially change the experience of its Internet service customers.
“One thing is for sure: Today's decision will not change consumers' ability to access and use the Internet as they do now,” said Randal Milch, Verizon's executive vice president of public policy.
Democratic lawmakers and regulators called on Wheeler to fight the court decision. Sen. Edward J. Markey (Mass.) vowed to introduce legislation that would protect net-neutrality rules at the FCC.

A federal program pays for little-used, sometimes empty commercial flights to leave small towns in Maryland Virginia every day. News4's Scott MacFarlane reports. (Published Monday, Nov. 16, 2015)
Why Federal Funds Pay for Empty Flights Out of Maryland, Virginia
More than $3.5 million in taxpayer money has been spent this year subsidizing little-used, sometimes empty commercial flights out of two local airports, according to a review by the News4 I-Team.
Those flights, from Hagerstown Regional Airport in Hagerstown, Maryland and Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport in Weyers Cave, Virginia are part of a controversial federal program called Essential Air Service.
The program, which costs $246 million nationwide each year and supports several dozen airports in small cities, is under increasing scrutiny amid tight federal budgets. The I-Team's review found some of the local flights depart without passengers or nearly empty loads.
Federal regulations require the planes to be flown, with or without passengers.
Essential Air Service supporter, including federal regulators and the air carriers who fly the routes, champion Essential Air Service as a link between remote cities and the nation's aviation system.
The program is overseen by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Federal regulations require several daily flights be flown under the program. Taxpayer watchdog groups say the flights have limited popularity and require subsidies from federal taxpayers.
The I-Team's review of federal records show an average of two to three passengers takes each of the daily flights from Hagerstown, which head to either Dulles International Airport or Pittsburgh International Airport. Taxpayer money offsets the cost of the flights. The I-Team found each passenger's ticket required a $560 subsidy from taxpayers in 2015.
At the Shenandoah airport, $128 in taxpayer subsidies are needed for each passenger who flies on one of the airport's regular Essential Air Service flights to Dulles.
Taxpayers for Common Sense vice president Steve Ellis said the program is a poor use of federal funding, because of its low passenger loads.
"All of these small towns think it's part of their identity," he said. "[They think] there wouldn't be as much of a town if they didn't have their own airport."
"These flights are little used, but they have passionate backers," Ellis said.
I-Team cameras filmed an empty flight departing Hagerstown for Pittsburgh on a Thursday afternoon in September. They also captured video of an empty flight arriving at the airport the same afternoon.
Essential Air Services flights also are offered in Beckley, West Virginia; Prescott, Arizona; Joplin, Missouri and Altoona, Pennsylvania, and in a total of 160 U.S. cities across the country.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Transportation said the Essential Air Service is a vital program for small cities.
"This program ensures that eligible rural and small communities are connected to major hub airports, giving a variety of stakeholders access to and from these communities, from which other economic and social benefits can be realized," he said.
A spokesman for Sun Air, which operates the Essential Air Service flights from Hagerstown said small communities are entitled to access to the larger American aviation system. The carrier's flights feature low-ticket prices and 98 percent reliability, he said.
The I-Team tracked down a passenger who used the Hagerstown to Dulles flight as part of his regular business travel to Denver. Mark Kamensek of Frederick County said he capitalized on the free airport parking and short security lines at Hagerstown.
"This is something that really is keeping small towns in America afloat," he said. "It's a great service to us."
Future senator Tom Cotton speaks at a candidate forum in North Little Rock, Ark., Tuesday, April 22, 2014. Back then, the Arkansas Republican could only dream of causing the ruckus he caused in Washington on Monday by authoring an open letter to Iran's leaders, co-signed by 46 GOP senators.

On Monday, I wrote that an Obama-signed executive agreement on Iran would very likely outlast his administration. Regardless of the agreement's legal status, it would be politically costly for any successor to Obama to renege on any actual deal, assuming that it's (a) successfully negotiated; and (b) adhered to by Iran as closely as the 2013 interim agreement.
So in the 24 hours since, the political kerfuffle over Sen. Tom Cotton's letter escalated quickly. I mean, Biden killed a guy with a trident put out a pretty nasty statement averring, “In 36 years in the United States Senate, I cannot recall another instance in which Senators wrote directly to advise another country — much less a longtime foreign adversary — that the President does not have the constitutional authority to reach a meaningful understanding with them.” President Obama didn't go that far, but he did pick up on the “Star Trek VI”-like oddball coalition of hard-liners.
Cotton (R-Ark.) fired back Tuesday morning, blasting Biden's foreign policy record and demanding that the administration put any agreement with Iran up for Senate approval. What's interesting, however, is that Cotton's MSNBC hit didn't bring up Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif's open response to Cotton's letter, which rocketed around Twitter on Monday night:
I don't agree with all of Zarif's response, but he did bring up two pretty compelling reasons why the deal might stick despite opposition that I did not address in my previous post:
[Zarif] emphasized that if the current negotiation with P5+1 result in a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, it will not be a bilateral agreement between Iran and the US, but rather one that will be concluded with the participation of five other countries, including all permanent members of the Security Council, and will also be endorsed by a Security Council resolution. Zarif expressed the hope that his comments “may enrich the knowledge of the authors to recognize that according to international law, Congress may not modify the terms of the agreement at any time as they claim, and if Congress adopts any measure to impede its implementation, it will have committed a material breach of US obligations.
This is an important point that often gets lost in the partisan rancor. The Iran negotiations are not a bilateral arrangement between Iran and the United States, but a P5+1 negotiation with Iran. If a deal is reached, it's a deal that has the support of all the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council plus Germany.
Now I doubt that Tom Cotton et al would weep much if, in undermining an executive agreement, they would tick off, say, Russia or China. But our NATO allies in Europe are another question entirely. Does the next president want one of his/her first actions to be revoking a deal negotiated in part by America's closest allies? Methinks not.
Zarif brought up another reason why he thinks GOP senators are bluffing:
The Foreign Minister also informed the authors that majority of US international agreements in recent decades are in fact what the signatories describe as “mere executive agreements” and not treaties ratified by the Senate. He reminded them that “their letter in fact undermines the credibility of thousands of such mere executive agreements that have been or will be entered into by the US with various other governments.
I'm less convinced that this would act as a deterrent to Republican members of Congress, who do have some legitimate gripes with this administration when it comes to executive power. But it would act as a deterrent for the next president, and that's the actor that really matters in Iran's calculations. The next president is going to ink a lot of executive agreements, as well, and would not want the credibility of this legal instrument in general to be sabotaged.
Zarif's response reinforces my conclusion from Monday: This open letter will have minimal impact on the Iran negotiations, and any executive agreement signed by Obama will likely outlive his administration. And it's that unacknowledged fact that so enrages Republican senators.
Following up on part one of this two part article, here is what the All-Decade team of the 2010's currently looks like on the other side of the ball, based on which players have accomplished the most during the current decade.
Quick comment: If you missed part one, note that I'm choosing to do things my own way, rather than follow the Hall of Fame Selection Committee's traditional format of selecting a first and second-team. Instead, I'll be filling out a 53-man roster, the composition of which is similar to how a modern-day NFL roster is assembled.
Roster Breakdown- Offense (26 total)
Quarterbacks (3); Running Backs (3); Fullback (1); Wide Receiver (6); Tight Ends (3); Offensive Lineman (10)
Roster Breakdown- Defense/Special Teams (27 total)
Defensive Lineman (7) — Defensive Ends (3), Defensive Tackles (4); Linebackers (7) — Outside Linebackers (4), Inside Linebackers (3); Defensive Backs (8) — Cornerbacks (4), Safeties (4); Kicker (1); Punter (1); Kick Returner (1); Punt Returner (1); Special Teamer (1)
Starting Defensive Ends
J.J. Watt, Houston
Cameron Wake, Miami
Fitting that we start with Watt considering he has been the most dominant player of the decade. Need proof? Despite lining up occasionally at defensive tackle, Watt has accumulated the most sacks in the NFL (76) since he entered the league in 2011. Makes sense why he's got three Defensive Player of the Year awards (2012, 2014, 2015) to show for it as well. Even more impressive, though, is that Watt has the single highest Approximate Value (also known as AV; explained here) of all players since '11. Regardless of whether the Texans star returns to his old form following back surgery, Watt has already assured his place in Canton.
Alongside Watt is the underrated Cameron Wake, who has quietly appeared in five Pro Bowls since 2010. That's more than any other defensive end this decade, including Watt. And speaking of Watt, did you know that Wake also has the same sack total (76) as the league's most dominant defensive player this decade? I'm certainly not arguing that the former undrafted free agent is better, but Wake's consistent excellence–he's tallied at least 8.5 sacks in every full season he's played in this decade–earns him a spot on the All-2010's squad.
Reserve
Julius Peppers, Chicago/Green Bay
One of the NFL's elite defensive stars from last decade surprisingly find his way onto this year's All-Decade team as well. With each passing year, the thirty-six year-old Peppers continues to add to his Hall of Fame-caliber resume. In addition to not missing a game this decade, the former Panthers legend has tallied at least seven sacks in all but one of his fifteen seasons. Fun fact, he also has five interceptions this decade too, which is practically unheard of for an edge rusher.
Starting Defensive Tackle: Ndamukong Suh, Detroit/Miami
Among an unbelievably deep crop of deserving defensive tackles, Suh has been the most dominant of the bunch since 2010. A consistent force since entering the league, the former Nebraska star has registered the highest approximate value (84) among defensive tackles this decade, and his 47 sacks are the second most. He also was recognized as a first team All-Pro three times during his tenure with the Lions, although he has yet to reach those same heights in Miami.
Reserves
Haloti Ngata, Baltimore/Detroit
Geno Atkins, Cincinnati
Aaron Donald, St. Louis/Los Angeles
Initially I planned on only selecting three defensive tackles in total. But I included four because, as mentioned, there were too many worthy players to choose from, particularly when compared to a relatively thin group of All-Decade-caliber defensive ends. I mean, some of the DT's I left off this roster–Vince Wilfork, Gerald McCoy, Justin Smith, Kyle Williams–have been perennial Pro Bowlers.
These three reserves earn the nod, though, because they have been slightly more dominant than those four. Ngata was the anchor of Baltimore's terrific defense before he was shipped to Detroit to replace the departed Suh. In all, his approximate value this decade ranks second among all defensive tackles. As for Atkins, his 52 sacks pace the bunch, while his five Pro Bowl appearances are tied for the most this decade, along with Gerald McCoy and Kyle Williams (see what I mean about the quality of defensive tackles?).
And with regard to Donald, who only has been in the league for three years, his outstanding play since entering the league was too great for me to ignore. He may be rather unheralded, considering he plays for a mediocre Rams team, but with two consecutive All-Pro selections, he is now arguably the top defensive player in football. After all, his approximate value on a per-year basis is second only to Watt among all defensive players.
Starting Outside Linebackers
Von Miller, Denver
Clay Matthews, Green Bay
Miller has undoubtedly been the best outside linebacker of the decade. After all, he leads all players at his position in the following categories: First team All-Pro appearances (with three), sacks (on a per-year basis), and approximate value (by a mile). I suppose it helps that he essentially led Denver to a Super Bowl title as well, taking home MVP honors along the way.
As for Matthews, he absolutely deserves a spot on the All-Decade team for being one of the NFL's premier playmakers. Aside from his impressive sack totals–he's got 62.5 this decade, and that's despite a recent move to inside linebacker–Matthews also has the most interceptions among players at his position since 2010.
Reserves
DeMarcus Ware, Dallas/Denver
Terrell Suggs, Baltimore
However, choosing Matthews over DeMarcus Ware was difficult because they have both made the same amount of Pro Bowl and All-Pro teams this decade. Not only that, but Ware has the most sacks of all outside linebackers since 2010–even more than Von Miller (well, he's got him beat by only 0.5 of a sack). I ultimately went with Matthews, though, because he has the higher approximate value. Short story long, both guys are still eminently deserving of a starting spot.
Meanwhile, Suggs did more than enough early in the 2010's to secure his spot as well. His best days may be behind him, but the Ball So Hard University alum was a force for most of the decade, as evidenced by when he received Defensive Player of the Year in 2011.
Starting Inside Linebackers
Luke Kuechly, Carolina
NaVorro Bowman, San Francisco
Headlining the inside linebacking corps is Kuechly. Since entering the league in 2012, the former Boston College product has arguably been the league's most dynamic defensive player: In addition to his average of 144 tackles per season, Kuechly also has nine career sacks and a remarkable twelve interceptions. He's also the only inside linebacker this decade to win Defensive Player of the Year.
Aside Kuechly is Bowman, and his inclusion shouldn't surprise anyone. He has suffered through two injury-plagued seasons in recent years, including when he missed all of the 2014 season after suffering a devastating leg injury in the previous year's NFC Championship game. But when Bowman's been healthy (2011-2013, 2015), he's been a first team All-Pro every season. Somehow, he's even got more All-Pro selections than Pro Bowl appearances! Just goes to show how quietly outstanding the former third round pick has been.
Reserves
Bobby Wagner, Seattle
Bowman's former teammate, Patrick Willis, seemed destined to be a part of the All-2010's team as well, until he called it a career after the 2014 season. But that's only part of the reason why I gave Wagner the slight edge over Willis. Given all the attention received by the Legion of Boom, people don't seem to realize that Wagner is on an inside track to the Hall of Fame. The 26-year-old has piled up just as many tackles as Kuechly since they both entered the league in 2012. Plus, in addition to his two first team All-Pro selections, he also has nearly the same approximate value as Kuechly (67 compared to 66 for Wagner). In short, don't sleep on Wagner's greatness.
Starting Cornerbacks
Richard Sherman, Seattle
Patrick Peterson, Arizona
Arguably the cornerstone of Seattle's stretch of dominance this decade, Sherman has the most interceptions (30) of any player since he entered the league in 2011. He also has posted five consecutive seasons with an approximate value of over 10; and in two of those seasons in particular–2012 and 2013–he finished in the top three of that category among all players in the NFL. Meanwhile, his NFC West counterpart has been just as good. Peterson has made the Pro Bowl in each of his six seasons, intercepted 20 passes, and has an approximate value over that same time frame which ranks second only to Sherman among cornerbacks.
Reserves
Darrelle Revis, New York/Tampa Bay/New England
Aqib Talib, Tampa Bay/New England/Denver
Revis certainly has a case to be a starter, given that he's made five Pro Bowls and three All-Pro teams. Yet as explained above, both Sherman and Peterson are highly accomplished this decade as well. Revis still makes this team with ease, but he slides in as a reserve due to a couple of lackluster seasons (the likes of which probably will continue). In contrast, Talib continues to get better as he matures. He's coming off a season in which he was named an All-Pro for the first time. Fitting that Talib was finally recognized as one of the game's elite corners, seeing as he has the second most interceptions this decade after Sherman.
Starting Safeties
Earl Thomas, Seattle
Eric Berry, Kansas City
Thomas and Berry earn starting spots because they are the only two safeties this decade to each appear in five Pro Bowls and be selected to three first team All-Pro squads. Thomas also leads his position group with 23 interceptions and a total approximate value of 73. Without a doubt, Thomas is this generation's Ed Reed. As for Berry, he's been almost as good when healthy, as his approximate value on a per-year basis is second only to Thomas'.
Reserves
Eric Weddle, San Diego/Baltimore
Charles Woodson, Green Bay/Oakland
Either of these names ring a bell? Weddle continues to impress even into his early thirties, as he earned his fourth Pro Bowl appearance this decade this past year with the Ravens. As for Woodson, the All-2000's honoree had another terrific run from 2010 until he called it a career after the 2015 season. Not only did the former Heisman winner lead the league in interceptions during the 2011 season, but he remarkably made the Pro Bowl in his final season–at age 39–after a five pick campaign.
Special Teams
Kicker: Justin Tucker, Baltimore
The most accurate kicker in NFL history gets the nod over the second most accurate kicker in NFL history, Dallas' Dan Bailey.
Punter: Johnny Hekker, St. Louis/Los Angeles
Maybe it's because he punts more often than everyone else (seeing as he plays for the Rams). But no punter this decade has been more of a weapon than Hekker. Last year, for instance, he downed thirteen more punts inside than 20 than anyone else in football.
Kick Returner: Cordarrelle Patterson, Minnesota
In three out of Patterson's four seasons, he has led the NFL in both kickoff return touchdowns and yards per return. Case closed.
Punt Returner: Devin Hester, Chicago/Atlanta
Can't exclude the GOAT for returns from this roster, though, right?
Special Teamer: Matthew Slater, New England
Slater's been named to the Pro Bowl as a special teamer six times, yet 2016 marked his first selection as a first team All-Pro. What took so long?
Here is the final roster:

DC Entertainment has released a first look at the Robin costume set to be featured on the forthcoming Titans live-action series from executive producers Greg Berlanti, Akiva Goldsman and Sarah Schechter.
You can check it out below.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales actor Brenton Thwaites stars as Dick Grayson, who steps forward in the series to lead a new, young team of heroes including Starfire, Raven, and Beast Boy, drawn from all corners of the DC Universe.
“Dick Grayson is one of the most important and iconic heroes in the DC universe, and it wasn't easy to find him but we have,” DC Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns said. “Brenton has the emotional depth, heart, danger and physical presence of Batman's former protege and the Titans' future leader. We're extremely lucky he's chosen to bring his talents to this project and this character.”
Grayson is one of Batman's most popular iterations of Robin. Bruce Wayne took the boy in after Grayson's parents were murdered. The pair worked together in Gotham City to clean up the streets, but the sidekick grew tired of living in Batman's shadow. Grayson dropped his title as Robin after years in the suit and took up the name Nightwing to strike out on his own.
The assumption up to now has been that Thwaites would play Nightwing; it is unclear whether the Robin costume means that he will be principally Robin in the series, or just in flashback. In The New Teen Titans, the 1980s series upon which the series is largely based, Dick started out as Robin but became Nightwing shortly after.
The Robin super suit was designed by costume designer Laura Jean Shannon, whose credits include Black Lightning, Iron Man and The Jungle Book, among others.

MADISON – Wisconsin men's basketball coach Greg Gard covets versatile players and has shown an affinity for three-guard lineups.
UW is adding a versatile guard, from one of the state's top high school programs.
Trevor Anderson, who helped Stevens Point High School win WIAA Division 1 titles in 2015 and '16, announced Wednesday he is transferring from UW-Green Bay to Wisconsin.
Anderson, who played in 20 games as a freshman last season before a back injury ended his season, must sit out the 2017-'18 season but will have three seasons of eligibility.
“Looking back on my first year at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, I had the opportunity to meet many wonderful and impactful people,” Anderson wrote on Twitter. “Although my freshman year ended prematurely due to injury, I would not consider it a failure.
“When the season closed, I did a lot of self reflection; evaluating all aspects of my life from school, sports and personal happiness.
“Growing up in Wisconsin, it was always my personal dream to play for the Badgers. With that in mind, I have decided to transfer to the University of Wisconsin-Madison for the 2017-'18 season.”
Anderson, 6 foot 2 and 180 pounds, averaged 9.8 points and 2.9 rebounds per game as a freshman for UW-Green Bay. He started all 20 games in which he played. He shot 37.6% from three-point range (35 of 93) and 80.4% from the free-throw line (45 of 56).
“This was an extremely difficult decision,” he wrote. “I want to thank Coach (Linc) Darner for all he has done for me in the two and a half years since he started recruiting me. I have nothing but love towards him and the coaching staff.
“To my teammates, I consider myself blessed to have played along side you this past year. Never underestimate the gratitude I have towards all of you.”
As a senior at Stevens Point, Anderson was named Mr. Basketball by the Wisconsin Basketball Coaches Association and the player of the year by The Associated Press.

He averaged 24.6 points and 4.4 assists per game that season and shot 55% from three-point range (66 of 120).
Then-coach Bo Ryan recruited Anderson but did not offer a scholarship. Anderson committed to UW-Green Bay before the start of his senior year.
He had offers from Drake, Lehigh and Toledo at the time but was also being evaluated by UW, Butler, Wichita State, Xavier and Indiana.
The Stevens Point teams that won state titles in 2015 and '16 featured Anderson and brothers Sam and Joey Hauser.
Sam Hauser will be a sophomore at Marquette next season. Joey Hauser will be a senior at Stevens Point.
Both UW and Marquette are recruiting Joey Hauser, a versatile 6-foot-8 forward.
UW, which has two scholarships available for 2017-'18, expects to have at least four scholarship guards next season.
D'Mitrik Trice will be a sophomore, Brevin Pritzl will be a redshirt sophomore, and Brad Davison and Kobe King will be freshmen.
Jordan Hill, who would have been a redshirt senior, decided to transfer and plans to enroll at Seattle as a graduate transfer.
Walt McGrory, a 6-2 guard from Edina, Minn., announced earlier this week he is joining UW as a walk-on next season. McGrory had scholarship offers from Furman, Brown, Drake, Maine and South Dakota State.
UW has looked at adding a graduate transfer for next season.
Casey Benson (Oregon) decided to stay close to home and play at Grand Canyon in Phoenix.
Lexus Williams, who plans to transfer from Valparaiso after graduating later this spring, is another target.
As important as your religious beliefs may be to you, they don't necessarily make you happier, a new study in the American Sociological Review finds. What does make you more satisfied with your life, the study finds, is having friends at your congregation and a strong religious identity.
"Those are the people who give you the sense of belonging," said lead study author Chaeyoon Lim, of the Department of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Lim conducted the study with Robert Putnam, author of "Bowling Alone" and "American Grace."
Many other studies have argued that the happiness gleaned from being religious is about spirituality and theology - for example, your belief in a higher power and your engagement in the rituals of your tradition. But in this study, factors such as prayer, holding religious services at home, and strength of faith do not appear to be related to life satisfaction.
Lim and Putnam looked at a nationally representative sample of almost 2,000 people in the United States. The majority of the participants in the study were Protestant and Catholic; Jews, Muslims and other non-Christians were a smaller portion.
They conducted interviews with the same participants twice: Once in 2006 and once in 2007. Those who gained friends in their congregations during the course of the year also reported a greater sense of life satisfaction. This was also true for those who said they were attending their place of worship more in 2007.
But people who go to a place of worship and have few close friends there are not any happier than people who never go to services, the study authors found.
Religious identity is also important, Lim said. People who say that religion is a very important part of self identity tend to be happier. And that also goes back to the friendship issue: It's not simply the presence of friendship, but also the fact that you share this sense of religious identity with this particular social network, that makes you more satisfied with life, Lim said.
Friendship in congregation also appears to make people volunteer more, even outside of the religious setting, and donate more often to both religious and nonreligious causes, Lim and Putnam found.
Still, it is worth examining in the future why this study did not find the same link between happiness and spirituality that others did, the authors say. This may have to do with how different aspects of religion are measured. For example, those who reported that they "feel God's love" seemed to have more life satisfaction than those who did not, but this did not apply for similar questions about belief in God. Also, it is impossible to draw conclusions about whether "feeling God's love" causes happiness or vice versa.
Could other networks of people have the same effect on happiness? The authors say that if this is possible, it's hard to think of a non-religious context with a similar strength of identity, intensity of participation in ritual, and great scale and scope of the people in it.
The Japanese theatrical release of Godzilla Resurgence (known as Shin Gojira in Japan) is just around the corner, and Toho Studios is ramping up efforts to promote the latest film in their venerable giant monster series with a full-scale reproduction of Godzilla's footprint.
The footprint - which measures 27.9 meters (91.5 feet) in length and 22 meters (77.2 feet) in width - will be on display from June 18 until July 10, 2016, as part of the "Ishikari Beach Sand Park 2016" event held at Asobichi Ishikari, a beach and swimming area located in Ishikari City, Hokkaido, Japan.
Godzilla Resurgence is directed by Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi. The film stomps into theaters in Japan on July 29, 2016.

Dragon Commander is a real time strategy game with a turn-based campaign map and third-person aerial combat from the makers of Divine Divinity. Somehow, that makes a lot more sense in practice than it does on paper. I've been playing some unfinished early code.
The dragon's the least of it, really. While it's almost staggering under the weight of ‘wouldn't it be great if?' sub-games and features, at its heart Larian's Divine Divinity fantasy battle spin-off plays like a love letter to the giants of real-time strategy. The campaign map of Total War, the battles of Total Annihilation, the air of silliness of Command & Conquer, the theme of Warcraft… It's not that it's shameless, really: it's just picking and choosing what worked, what people loved, and putting it all together in a slightly strange, rather full-on but highly entertaining and tactical combination that winds up feeling like nothing else. The game seems to be having a whale of a time, and it's infectious with it – while its humour might incline towards the ‘wacky' end of the gag spectrum, it's not grating as are the similarly fantasy-lampooning Majesty/Ardania games.
But while the broad political satire (e.g. elves are pro-medicinal drugs, but the Catholic-analogue undead consider it sinful – so will you legalise or outlaw it? One faction may withdraw their support based on your decision) of the between-battle state management is a bit of a giggle, what's really standing out to me so far is the intensity of the battles. Sure, you can transform from floating camera into a bloody great dragon, but this is only ever an accompaniment to management of a wide variety of units across large maps with maxi-zoom, doing the rock, paper, scissors thing with a campaign-persistent expanding tech tree, fighting wars of attrition where each side has a sizeable finite number of reinforcements to call upon.
It's proper strategy, like mama used to make – brutal push and pull, steadily advancing a front line amidst massed death and explosion. Commanding and conquering, yes, but the knowledge that, at some point, your reinforcements will run out, prevents cartoonish squandering. Build points are seized by proximity, even in the midst of pitched battle, so there's a lot of suddenly dropping a turret or a war factory straight into the middle of things to sustain your push, or suddenly finding that the enemy's managed to build a mortar right next to all your best stuff. Like Supreme Commander, there's no sitting back and waiting for anything to happen here – it's all go, all the time, and my jaw aches something rotten from pulling a Clint Eastwood expression all the while.
Throw the dragon in there and it's even more intense. While becoming a big flying lad who can breathe fire and – hooray! – use a jetpack for added speed is a power trip, you're disconcertingly vulnerable on two fronts when you don't the scales. For one, you're relatively easy prey for any anti-air units, so you'll spend as much time desperately evading those guys as you do visiting hell upon landlubbers. For a second, you can't build anything while you're in lizard mode, so if you don't have enough guys on the ground to support you, or they've been wiped out in a surprise attack or tactical error, you're a sitting duck. Well, a highly manoeuvrable, deadly, flying duck the size of a bus, but the effect's basically the same.
Thus, there's a constant tension between trying to sow as much destruction as possible in Smaug mode and spending time in build'n'bash view to ensure you've got the army you need to win the day. You do have limited control of your troops while dragonised, but it's not much more than select all/go kill that. Which, frankly, is absolutely brilliant when a fight's going your way – it's very much “to me, my army!” as you soar/jet forth with an almighty collective of steam punk mechs, tanks and zeppelins following and spraying death all around. More regularly, I found myself doggedly trying to stay dragoned up because fireballing dozens of enemies is a straight-up good time, only to suddenly realise that I had no mates left and the enemy was just about to seize my last base.
Win or lose a battle, the sensation of space and speed when wearing dragon pants is fantastic. It's a great looking game, finding itself a colourful middleground between cartoon and photo-real then giving the player freedom to pan or soar across its sizeable maps with as much freedom as the relentless assaults allow. There is the option to auto-resolve battles, by sending out a favoured general to do the work for you, but as well as the heightened risk of failure – and with it the loss of or failure to seize a territory – basically you're missing out on a ton of high-velocity fun. It's not just that you get to be a dragon: you get to be a dragon and the boss of a huge magical, mechanical army.
Army and dragon alike have a raft of upgrades to be pursued between battles, spending winnings and earnings from held territories on new unit types, new dragon abilities and – in what feels a little like features creeping too far – cards that offer one-time buffs or handicaps. There's a lot to get your head around: you will do so, but early forays will feel somewhat overwhelming.
In such quiet (or at least online-focused) times for RTS, I appreciate the attempt to do everything, ever while retaining a solid build'n'bash core, and especially that it's firmly avoided becoming simply That Game Where You Play As A Dragon, but it is a bit full on. Especially as it's so perfunctory about how to do important stuff like order units while in dragon mode (F2 to select all, Q to make 'em move or attack, since you ask) but spends forever and a day bombarding you with comedy Scottish dwarf dialogue. The looking back to the strategy classics of yesteryear goes too far in terms of the traditionally irritating and excessive unit barks, too. Calm down, just calm down. I know you wrote a funny, but there's no need to make people hear it 5000 times an hour.
Again, to some degree I think this reflects a a clear Joie de vivre in the game, and certainly no kow-towing to the dark forces of focus grouping, so I can forgive it a certain muddledness, especially as once the myriad tricks of the fantasy kingdom trade are learned the scatty tutorial ceases to be an issue. I am finding myself skipping through most of the dialogue and turning off unit sounds, however. Dragon Commander's a bit like an over-friendly dog that jumps up at you, headbutts you in the crotch, licks you on the eye and then farts in helpless excitement when you come home. While it can be exasperating, its loveable nature and repertoire of charming tricks absolutely wins the day. I'm really looking forward to trying out the more expansive finished product later this year.
Dragon Commander should be released in early August.
The government's MyDemocracy.ca survey/consultation/questionnaire launched yesterday to a steady stream of criticism as the initiative does not follow the typical consultative approach. Rather than asking direct questions about public electoral preferences, there are a series of questions on “values, preferences, and priorities” that are supposedly designed to discern user preferences. The questions focus on representation, parties, and voting rules (there are several questions on electronic voting that ask if there is support even if the systems are less secure).
The initiative is being run by Vox Pop Labs and the site's privacy policy advises that the Privacy Act and PIPEDA apply. However, dig into the policy and you learn that users that do not provide detailed demographic information – including age, gender, education, household income, profession, language, interest in politics, and postal code – will not have their responses considered as part of the study. The specific provision states:
You do not need to provide your name to use MyDemocracy.ca. However, you will be asked to complete a profile about yourself. You may be asked to provide us with your gender, year of birth, level of education, household income, and other demographic information. The purpose for collecting this information is for Vox Pop Labs to ensure that the overall results of the study are representative of the Canadian population. While answering the profile questions is optional, not answering these questions will result in your input not being included as part of the overall results of the study. [emphasis added]
The demographic information may or may not be personally identifiable. For Canadians in large communities, it may be difficult to identify a particular person. For those from smaller communities, the combination of postal code, profession, education, gender, age, language, and possible identification with certain groups could be enough to identify a specific person. Regardless, it is inappropriate for a government-backed consultation to require Canadians to provide detailed demographic information in order for their opinions to actually count.
Update 12/8/16: The government has updated the privacy policy by dropping the language indicating that not answering personal information would result in the input not being included. The new policy states:
You do not need to provide your name to use MyDemocracy.ca. However, you will be asked to complete a profile about yourself. You may be asked to provide us with your gender, year of birth, level of education, household income, and other demographic information. The purpose for collecting this information is for Vox Pop Labs to ensure that the overall results of the study are representative of the Canadian population by weighting the data against population data such as the census. While answering the profile questions is optional, not answering these questions will result in your input not being included as part of the weighted results of the study. Aggregate statistics for all responses will still be included in the final report.
Without a doubt, one has the right to burn a flag as long as it is their own private property. But this does not mean that it isn't rather foolish to do so.
Donald Trump recently tweeted suggesting that nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag; and if they do, they should perhaps lose their citizenship or serve a year in jail. Imprisoning people for burning cloth is rather authoritarian, and I would in no way, shape, or form ever support this. Because I am an anarcho-capitalist, I have no desire to use the Constitution to justify whether flag burning is right or wrong. If someone obtained the flag by way of voluntary exchange, it is their private property. Therefore, they have every right to do whatever it is that they want, including setting it on fire, as long as the flag burning does not infringe upon the rights of other individuals. Whether the State law says it is “legal” or “illegal” is completely irrelevant, considering that we all know that the law is not synonymous with individual rights.
I wouldn't be surprise if Donald Trump said this just to troll the public, being as he's magnificent at that. But it did bring about an interesting conversation regarding flag burning. The discussion as to whether or not someone has a “right” to do it is rather silly in my honest opinion, however. Of course, it is their right to do so; but just because it is their right does not mean that it isn't diametrically opposed to advancing their cause.
Value is subjective. What a flag represents to one, may not be what it represents to others. Some individuals see the flag and think of love and unity, some makes think of tyranny. Some individuals may think that the flag represents coexistence and freedom, while others may think that it represents division and slavery. It is thus not simply the symbolic representation of the government. It is completely dependent on the individual in question. While it may physically be just a piece of cloth, what it represents can be much more; and you do know that it generally represents something to someone. So even if one has the right to, burning it may not be the brightest of ideas.
But there are two main reasons as to why I feel as if it is a bit stupid to go around burning the flag of the “United States of America.” For starters, I don't go around setting cloths on fire just to do it. In fact, I don't think I've ever randomly set cloth on fire. So it'd be a huge performative contradiction for me to set a flag on fire, while saying it that it's not a big deal. Clearly, it means something and I'd be trying to send message, otherwise setting it ablaze would serve no purpose.
I oppose the State with every fiber of my being. I openly want it to be completely abolished, and this is not an idea that many people adopt – otherwise we'd have a free society.
There is the process to spreading the ideas of liberty: Education, and evolution. This is the main reason I would not go out of my way to burn a flag. That accomplishes nothing other than riling up the same people that I want to adopt the libertarian philosophy. This is due to the fact that the flag has heavy emotional ties to some individuals, and to them, it represents something much more than government. People love to tie actions to representatives of a philosophy or ideology, and purposely putting what I advocate in a negative light is not advancing what I advocate. This does not mean that there will not be things that I'll do that will inevitably offend others; I'm not suggesting walking on eggshells. But as mentioned earlier, you have to go out of your way to burn cloths and it is something most do not do in their everyday lives. It is easily avoidable. I look at flag burning in the same light as snorting cocaine: You have the right to do it, but that doesn't mean that it's the smart thing to do. And in the case of flag burning, it can very well setback your cause.
Some people are pearl clutching at the idea of loss of “citizenship.” Losing citizenship doesn't personally bother me, considering that I feel as if individuals should be able to opt out of citizenship without having to physically move; this is a form of secession. Imprisoning people for burning private property and not violating the rights of others, however, is unacceptable.
I'll be the first to admit that this was bonehead statement from Donald Trump. But having the right to do something does not mean it isn't strategically stupid.

Bailey Junior Kurariki, the country's youngest convicted killer, is back behind bars charged with assaulting a woman.
Kurariki was arrested in South Auckland yesterday on a charge of assaulting Janie Martin, believed to be his girlfriend.
He appeared today in the Manukau District Court and was remanded in custody to appear again on May 6.
No plea was entered and no application for bail or suppression of his name was lodged.
Kurariki waved to someone in the public gallery as he entered and left court.
Kurariki was 12 when he was involved in the killing of pizza delivery man Michael Choy in 2001.
He was jailed for seven years for Mr Choy's manslaughter and released last May, four months before his sentence ended.
He was back in court this month on three charges of breaching his parole conditions.

The New York Times reports that corporate lobbyists are renewing a push for a “one time” deal that allows them to bring foreign profits back into the U.S. at a low tax rate:
Under the proposal, known as a repatriation holiday, the federal income tax owed on such profits returned to the United States would fall to 5.25 percent for one year, from 35 percent. In the short term, the measure could generate tens of billions in tax revenues as companies transfer money that would otherwise remain abroad, and it could help ease the huge budget deficit. Corporations and their lobbyists say the tax break could resuscitate the gasping recovery by inducing multinational corporations to inject $1 trillion or more into the economy, and they promoted the proposal as “the next stimulus” at a conference last Wednesday in Washington.
This is ridiculous: I know that “stimulus” is the excuse du jour for everything, but companies don't expand and hire more people because their corporate treasuries are flush. They expand and hire more people when they think demand for their goods and services is strong. Besides, corporate treasuries are already flush with cash that isn't being used to expand operations. So why would this make any difference?
Kudos, then, to reporter David Kocieniewski, who points this out in the very next paragraph:
But that's not how it worked last time. Congress and the Bush administration offered companies a similar tax incentive, in 2005, in hopes of spurring domestic hiring and investment, and 800 took advantage. Though the tax break lured them into bringing $312 billion back to the United States, 92 percent of that money was returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks, according to a study by the nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research. Indeed, 60 percent of the benefits went to just 15 of the largest United States multinational companies — many of which laid off domestic workers, closed plants and shifted even more of their profits and resources abroad in hopes of cashing in on the next repatriation holiday.
That money didn't go toward corporate expansion last time and it won't go toward corporate expansion this time. It will just fill up corporate treasuries and get distributed to shareholders, who are disproportionately well off and unlikely to use the money for increased consumption. The whole thing is just a scam.
America's corporate tax code needs an overhaul. The way we treat overseas income might need an overhaul too — though doing it properly would require some new regulations that corporations might not like so much. But without that overhaul, yet another tax holiday does nothing except to make the rich richer. It won't do a thing to get the economy moving again.
It's a blisteringly cold day in New York and I arrive at the corner of Lexington and 64th Street in need of thawing out. JoJo is a snug little restaurant inside a two-storey salmon pink house. Inside, there's a tiny bar at the foot of the stairs leading up to the main dining area. The barman is pouring an enticing-looking glass of red wine. “I'm meeting Jagdish Bhagwati,” I say, shivering. “Could you possibly send a glass of whatever that is to our table? “This one is for Mr Bhagwati,” the barman beams. “Two glasses coming right up.”
It's not only the cold that makes me want something to take the edge off. Bhagwati, brilliant, argumentative and occasionally vituperative, has a reputation for skewering his enemies. One of the most outstanding economists of his generation never to have won the Nobel Prize, his failure to be recognised for his work on international trade has become something of a cause célèbre.
One fellow academic told me he used to avoid the great professor on the day the economics prize was announced because Bhagwati was inevitably in a frosty mood as yet another prize-less year went by. The Nobel committee's oversight is so well known that it has even made it on to The Simpsons, an episode of which features Bhagwati receiving the coveted prize. (Krusty the Clown gets the Nobel peace award.)
More recently, Bhagwati, 79, has gained notoriety for a bitter intellectual feud with Amartya Sen. Like Bhagwati, Sen is an Indian-born, Cambridge-educated economist now in the US (where Sen is professor of economics and philosophy at Harvard). Unlike Bhagwati, Sen is a Nobel recipient. In a long-running argument, Bhagwati accused Sen of prioritising redistribution in poor countries such as India. Bhagwati argued that only by generating sufficient growth to begin with would there be enough wealth to spread around. “Sen puts the cart before the horse; and the cart is a dilapidated jalopy!” he wrote last year in Mint magazine. Sen, he said, paid lip-service to the idea of growth “much like an anti-Semite would claim that Jews are among his best friends!”
The argument has since spilled out of the ivory tower and into the blood and dust of the Indian election, the world's largest democratic exercise, which reaches its climax in May. Sen is seen as lining up behind the incumbent Congress administration, which has pursued policies that broadly favour the poor but has allowed growth to slide. Bhagwati supports the controversial candidacy of a fellow Gujarati, Narendra Modi, who fronts the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) and promises to get the economy revving again.
I find Bhagwati upstairs, squished behind a corner table by the window. He's smartly dressed in a dark suit with a turquoise tie and greets me warmly in a crackly, slightly high-pitched voice that combines traces of his Indian, English and American experiences. He has lived in America on and off for 50 years and is now professor of economics, law and international affairs at Columbia University. He has a daughter with his wife, Padma Desai, a fellow academic.
We've exchanged emails before but never met. In person, he is warm and disarmingly solicitous. His speech is punctuated by constant chuckling, usually at his own jokes. Certainly, there are occasional sideswipes at fellow academics. But he turns out to be great company. For a man of ideas, he has a passion for stories about people. He is forever conjuring personages from years gone by, many from his Cambridge days, and has an almost Dickensian ability to populate the room with ghosts from firesides past.
Not long after I sit down, he launches into a joke that somehow involves VKRV Rao (a temperamental Indian economist known as “alphabet Rao”), a 6ft-tall UN director and several Sri Lankans. The punchline is: “No, but I represent their aspirations,” which leaves me slightly baffled but has Bhagwati falling about in stitches. Before I can figure it out, he's on to a story about the great Cambridge economist Joan Robinson. “She was a socialist and as tough as nails. Give her a samurai sword and she'd cut your balls off,” he says, guffawing at the memory of her formidable character.
…
A waitress brings our wine, Three Saints Cabernet from Santa Barbara. It is blackcurranty and exactly what I needed. She serves us elongated bread rolls. “Missiles,” says Bhagwati.
I ask about growing up in India. “My earliest memory, actually, is of being woken up in 1942 when I was about eight, because my brother was . . . you would think of him as a revolutionary.” One of the seven Bhagwati siblings, Prafullachandra (known as PN, who is now in his nineties) had been blowing up goods trains in protest at British rule, though he went on to become chief justice of India. He had come home bloodied one night after being beaten by the authorities.
“They had a warrant out for him. There was this commotion in the house and the police were saying they wanted to take me as a hostage together with my brother.”
Bhagwati was born and brought up in Mumbai, though the family was Gujarati. His father became a Supreme Court judge but they were not wealthy, he says. Did they have servants? “Only one.” It was, he says, a puritanical upbringing. If he asked for money to buy samosas, his father would say no. A tailor would come once a year to make the seven children Indian pyjamas. “We would have two sets, one to be washed and one to be worn. And that was it.” Their only indulgence was the local bookstore, where there was an open account. “Education was the great priority.”
At school, young Jagdish came top in Sanskrit. “I wanted to be a Sanskritist, actually. I fell in love with it. But my father said, ‘You come from a poor family, that's not an option.' ” He was nudged towards economics and, eventually, a degree at St John's College, Cambridge.
The waitress comes to take our order. Bhagwati wants tuna tartare followed by organic chicken with olives, ginger and coriander. As I hesitate over my choice, Bhagwati tells me, incredulously, that “once I brought somebody [here] and he ordered a cheeseburger!” The waitress chimes in chirpily: “Sometimes you just need to have a burger, so we want to satisfy that.” “They just lack taste,” Bhagwati says with a snort. I decide on charred octopus with warm potato salad, followed by roasted hake. The first glass of wine has gone down so well I ask for another. Bhagwati sticks at one glass.
His father, he says, taught him tolerance. “It was a very traditional Gujarati family. No eggs, no fish, nothing. Pure vegetarian.” But when 18-year-old Jagdish was about to board the boat for England, his father took him aside and said: “We are vegetarian. That's what I and your mother believe in. But it's your own choice. So when you get into the boat and go to England it's up to you whether to be a vegetarian or not.” At Cambridge, Bhagwati went straight to beef. It is a lesson he will always remember. “Never force anything down anybody's throat. While I may occasionally fault people like my friend Amartya Sen,” he adds with deft understatement, “I don't unleash my sword that much.”
He can be pretty cruel, I venture. In his recent book Why Growth Matters, written with fellow Columbia economist Arvind Panagariya, didn't he accuse George Soros and Joseph Stiglitz of practising “Jurassic Park economics” for their questioning of pro-market orthodoxies? “I can be tough. That's true,” he concedes, adding that he is addicted to the “British witticisms” he picked up in the rough-and-tumble intellectual atmosphere of 1950s Cambridge. “When I think of something like ‘Jurassic Park economics', I can't resist it.”
…
The starters arrive. Bhagwati attacks the tuna, which he pronounces excellent, and I try the octopus, cooked to perfection. Of his feud with Sen, he says, “All I've said about him is that he missed the bus on the 1991 reforms.” He's referring to Indian economic liberalisation, which began in 1991, overseen by Manmohan Singh [then the finance minister, now prime minister] and which let loose much faster growth. “I asked him to produce a single piece of evidence that he was in favour. But he couldn't. Because he was not in favour.”
We turn to Singh's disappointing second term. The prime minister also studied at Cambridge – the pair first met there in 1955 – and has remained Bhagwati's friend. “Sonia is basically running things,” he says, referring to Sonia Gandhi, the dynastic head of the Congress party. Singh, he says, is generous and humane. “Where he's gone wrong is that he's allowed it to affect his policy. There needs to be some toughness. And I think he's basically a soft person.”
What about Modi, I ask? Does he have the requisite steel? Until recently, Gujarat's chief minister was considered unelectable as prime minister because of his alleged failure to intervene during riots in which more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. “When 2002 happened, I like everybody else was shocked,” Bhagwati says of that tragedy. But he cites a Supreme Court-monitored inquiry (in 2012) which exonerated Modi. “When people say Modi is authoritarian, that I don't believe. It sounds like he's a fascist of some kind. But if people don't exercise authority, nothing gets done. You need someone who is providing a vision of somewhere where you can go.” On one occasion he spent five hours with Modi. “I was so overwhelmed by him.”
Does he think Modi will win? Indian elections are notoriously tricky to predict. “Of course, it's like cricket. You never know what might happen. But if he doesn't come into power, I am not optimistic about India.” I ask if he thinks the country can get back on track after several mediocre years. Once there was an idea, now mostly forgotten, that the “tortoise” India could eventually overtake the “hare” – China. “That's an exaggeration, I think,” he says. A crucial difference between the two countries is the type of corruption they have. India's is classic “rent-seeking”, where people jostle to grab a cut of existing wealth. “The Chinese have what I call profit-sharing corruption”: the Communist party puts a straw into the milkshake so “they have an interest in having the milkshake grow larger”.
Fear of being accused of corruption has brought India's decision-making to a standstill, a debilitating logjam that Bhagwati hopes Modi can clear. The government, he says, has also spent too much money, much of it on what Bhagwati considers ineffective subsidies. This has forced the central bank to raise interest rates, choking off growth. “That takes us into Amartya Sen territory because he is in favour of more spending,” Bhagwati says, unable to resist a little dig.
…
The main course arrives. My hake has subtle Asian flavours. “I always admire fusion food,” he says. “Because the only fusion food I can think of [making] is chow mein with sauerkraut.” This exchange reminds me of something Bhagwati's wife Padma is reported to have said at his 70th birthday party. Knowing him to be fond of gourmet food, she tried to ease him into the culinary arts, first by getting him to prepare the morning coffee. Bhagwati, more familiar with the lecture theatre than the kitchen, asked: “Darling, how do I know the water is boiling?” Padma replied: “Darling, when it looks like champagne.”
I ask if he is worried about a drift towards Hindu nationalism. Some commentators in India sense a rising tide of intolerance. Modi's BJP stresses Hindu cultural identity. “That part bothers me. I don't know how to make up my mind on that,” he says, exhibiting doubt for the first time. But, he says, moderation will prevail: “Because that is more likely to be the case than extremism. Intolerance doesn't work in democratic countries like ours. And we will remain democratic. That I am convinced of.”
I turn briefly to free trade, of which he has been a life-long advocate. International trade has helped many poor countries escape poverty but, I ask, would he agree that it has also led to a stagnation of wages in richer nations? No, Bhagwati says. That's a Marxist theory. He thinks that labour-saving technology, not trade, has been driving down wages. Trade actually helps those with lower incomes by pushing down the cost of imported goods.
For dessert, Bhagwati chooses chocolate cake and then a cappuccino. I content myself with a black coffee. Finally, I broach the subject of the Nobel Prize. Does it still rankle? “Rankle is too strong a word. You get naturally worked up a bit on the day of the bloody thing, or the night before. But even that's gone now. Because there's no point. No one has any clue as to what goes on over there,” he says with a nod in the direction, I assume, of Sweden. Is it too late for him to win? “Who knows? It's a lottery ticket. It's like making babies. When you give up on it, you get one,” he says, hopefully. “My friend Leo Hurwicz got it at 91, Tom Schelling got it at 85. So, you never know.”
The waitress looks at his barely touched dessert. “Are we not enjoying our chocolate cake?” she asks. “No, I am. It's just that I enjoy talking even more than eating,” he shoots back.
It would be great, even now, to receive the Nobel, he continues. “There's nothing on international trade on which I've not written with some success. I shouldn't be saying it myself but a lot of other people say it.” Then he wonders whether he's been done down by his penchant for witticisms and his sharp, literary-inspired attacks. “I should”, he says, summoning one last chuckle, “probably get one for literature instead.”

Next guest: Sen / From Mr Abul Qasem
A refreshingly bibulous Lunch / From Mr Christopher Robbins
For years, archaeologists studying Viking remnants and artifacts in Britain had assumed that certain stone structures were bathhouses, or a kind of primitive sauna. But a husband-and-wife team has now thrown this thinking into question by suggesting that they weren't bathhouses at all — that they were brewhouses where the Vikings made their beer.
Archaeologists know that Vikings loved their ale; the Sagas contain a slew of references. And in the 10th century, Haakon Haroldson, the first Christian king of Norway, decreed that Yule be celebrated on Christmas day and that "every farmstead should brew two meals of malt into ale." In fact, brewing ale was so important that there were fines for non-compliance; failure to brew beer for three years in a row could result in the forfeiture of a farm.

It's also known that the Vikings used malt to make their ale, and that it was stored in huge vats close to the drinking hall.
But as archaeologists Merryn and Graham Dineley recently pointed out, archaeologists have conveniently ignored where the Vikings actually brewed it. Since huge ale vats are not easily moved, the ale must have been mashed and fermented close to the ale store.

That's where the supposed "bath houses" come in — and that's where, according to the Dineleys, the beer was brewed. And they'd be the team to know. Merryn is an archaeologist specializing in exploring ancient ale-making, and Graham is a craft brewer specializing in making ancient ales.
The Dineleys recently examined a stone-built installation at Cubbie Roo's Castle, on the island of Wyre, Orkney — a Viking stronghold of the 12th century AD. The Dineleys theorize that the structure would have made for an excellent mash oven, with the cauldron sitting above the fire. And in fact, they say it's the best example of a Viking brew house in Britain. They room is well equipped with substantial drains, it has a stone shelf for the storage vats, and a drain beneath.
Moreover, it's located right beside the drinking hall.
The Dineleys made their research known at the Experimental Archaeology Conference, and you can check out their poster here (pdf).

H/t Zythophile.
He is charged with accessing and uploading child-abuse material after he published, on a video-sharing site, a video of a man swinging a baby around like a rag doll. He faces a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment for each of the two charges.
Illingworth's lawyer, Michael Byrne, QC, has worked on some of the biggest criminal cases recently, including as the defence lawyer in the manslaughter case against former Bundaberg surgeon Jayant Patel. He says he will argue that the video is not child-abuse material but "a training film for a Russian circus family". Illingworth published the three-minute clip on Liveleak after obtaining it from YouTube, but had no involvement in the creation of the video, which has been published widely across the internet and shown on Australian and US TV news shows.
The clip can still be found online and has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. Australians who simply view the video can be charged with child-abuse offences and face a maximum of 10 years in prison. Byrne said it was unusual for a case such as this to involve silks but he did not believe it was excessive "when he's facing charges of this sort".
He said he was "surprised they [police] charged in the first place", as the video was "certainly not your run-of-the-mill child pornography". "Our argument is that this is certainly not what the legislation was aimed at. It was aimed at the sexual abuse of children," he said. "This seems to be a training film for a Russian circus family."
At the committal hearing the magistrate will decide whether there is enough evidence for a jury to convict Illingworth at a trial. It is understood the defence will present other examples of Russian circus family clips, showing, for instance, the practice of strapping weights to the ankles and wrists of toddlers to make them stronger.
If the magistrate does not agree with Byrne's assertion that the clip is not child abuse, the case will most likely be fought in the District Court. Illingworth said today he had already spent $12,300 on legal fees trying to clear his name and had been admitted to hospital four times due to the stress of the case. He said he had not been on medication before but was now taking valium and blood-pressure medication.
Asked why he hired a high-profile silk, he said Byrne's name "carries a bit of weight" and "when you've got something like this facing you, you've got to have the best". A conviction against Illingworth would widen the definition of what constitutes child-abuse material, and would have an impact on all Australian web users, Byrne said.
The comments echoed similar statements earlier this year by Illingworth's solicitor, Chelsea Emery of Ryan and Bosccher Lawyers, who said that, if the case went ahead, every Australian who surfs the net could be vulnerable to police prosecution. "Who made the decision to prosecute a man with child-abuse-related charges for sharing a file he did not create, of images not filmed in Australia, taken from a foreign website?" Emery asked. Queensland Police's brief of evidence centres on a witness statement from Susan Cadzow, specialist pediatrician at Royal Brisbane Children's Hospital.
The footage, viewed by Cadzow, shows an adult male vigorously swinging a baby by the arms but, at the end of the clip, the baby is shown laughing and smiling. Cadzow thought it represented child abuse. "The child's demeanour at the end of the video would seemingly suggest that no significant injury has occurred. However, it does not exclude the presence of a [hidden] injury," Cadzow said in her statement.
RCWU activists protesting against union busting by Bashneft in Orenburg, Russia. The banner on the left lists the names of the executives at the company who happen to have the same initials as the STK (Labour Council), a company controlled 'union', which the company wants to negotiate with while getting rid of the RCWU, the union that represents the majority of the workers.
IndustriALL launches an international solidarity campaign in support of Russian Chemical Workers Union (RCWU) under attack at Bashneft in Russia.
Two union locals at Bashneft, an oil company in Russia, are under attack from the management. The administration strives to undermine Russian Chemical Workers Union (RCWU), IndustriALL Global Union affiliate, and replace it with a company-controlled Labour Council.
The company is refusing to renegotiate collective agreements with RCWU locals, creating its own Labour Council instead.
Soon after reorganization in October 2012 when the companies Bashkirnefteproduct in Ufa and Orenburgnefteproduct in Orenburg became part of the parent company Bashneft, the management refused to renegotiate the CBA with the RCWU locals and challenged their right to collective bargaining.
The administration refuses to recognize union locals and claims that the CBA will be negotiated with a Labour Council, created by the company itself.
Furthermore, the company forces union members at Bashkirnefteproduct and Orenburgnefteproduct to leave the union, threatening them with dismissal. Since October 2012, hundreds of workers left RCWU under strong pressure from the management.
RCWU held public actions and launched a national solidarity campaign (In Russian) http://www.trud.org/3/11000.html with the help of the Federation of the Independent Trade Unions of Russia.
IndustriALL joins RCWU in an effort to stop union-busting at Bashneft, one of the largest Russian oil companies employing over 8,000 workers.
IndustriALL general secretary Jyrki Raina sent a letter to the Bashneft top managers, urging them to withdraw from anti-union tactics and engage in good-faith negotiations with the union.
You can TAKE ACTION too and send a letter to the president of the Board of Directors of Bashneft and the company president.
Astronauts May Need More Intense Workouts
In November 2008, NASA delivered an Advanced Resistance Exercise Device (ARED) to ISS that now offers astronauts greater capability to exercise at higher workloads and intensity.
by Staff Writers
Muncie IN (SPX) Apr 03, 2009
A new study in the The Journal of Applied Physiology, suggests that astronauts need to modify their workouts to avoid extensive muscle loss during missions onboard the International Space Station (ISS).
The latest NASA-sponsored research from Ball State University's Human Performance Laboratory (HPL) suggests that changes are needed to optimize the inflight exercise regimen for astronauts to improve their muscle performance while in space for extended stays.
Average stays on the ISS run about six months, and preservation of crewmember health in zero-gravity environments is paramount for safety and mission success. Since exercise is the primary course of action to protect the cardiovascular system, bone, and skeletal muscles, astronauts need to find the optimal exercises to stay fit.
The findings of the Ball State study were based in part on muscle biopsies taken from the astronauts, the first time this procedure has been allowed on crewmembers who have completed long-flight missions, according to Scott Trappe, HPL director.
Working with NASA, Marquette University's biological sciences department, Wyle Integrated Science and Engineering Group in Houston, and the Medical College of Wisconsin, Trappe found that even while the crewmembers exercised, they still lost an average of 15 percent muscle mass and 20 to 30 percent loss of muscle performance.
"By clinical standards, this is a massive loss," Trappe said. "This approaches what we see in aging populations in comparisons of a 20-year-old versus an 80-year-old. This poses risks to the crewmembers and could have a dramatic impact on locomotion and overall health, which would impact a variety of crewmembers' activities including future goals of planetary exploration."
Trappe and the HPL team have been conducting NASA-funded, ground-based bed rest studies of long duration - between 60 and 90 days - parallel to their ISS research.
Trappe said, "From our bed rest studies, we found that when high-intensity resistance and aerobic exercise are balanced correctly, this is an effective prescription that is quite therapeutic in protecting skeletal muscles in a simulated microgravity environment. The next step is to apply what we have learned from the ISS experience and implement the next generation of exercise prescription programs into the space environment. Intensity wins, hands down."
In November 2008, NASA delivered an Advanced Resistance Exercise Device (ARED) to ISS that now offers astronauts greater capability to exercise at higher workloads and intensity.
In addition to new equipment, the astronaut trainers have provided new exercise prescriptions customized for each crewmember during ARED use.
Studies are underway at NASA to further develop and validate resistance exercise prescriptions designed to improve astronaut performance and health, as well as mitigate risk, according to Judith Hayes, NASA deputy chief, human adaptation and countermeasures division based at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
Tsinghua University Requires Students to Learn How to Swim
For the prestigious Tsinghua University, dubbed as the Harvard of the East, every student who want to graduate from the university should possess a key skill: swimming.
The university announced on Monday, to mixed response, that all of their students should know how to swim before they graduate, describing swimming as a "key survival skill." Beginning in September, students have to demonstrate that they can swim at least 50 meters using any stroke. If they fail the initial test, they will take another one after they have learned to the skill.

"The exercise was made compulsory for all students because it also improves physical fitness," said Qiu Yong, president of Tsinghua University.
It first made swimming a requirement in 1919 but was removed due to the lack of swimming pools in Beijing.
The announcement sparked a debate on Chinese social media, with some questioning the fairness of the rules. Why should swimming be prioritised when there is a drought in China today? How about those people who grew up in inland cities without rivers or seas to swim in?
Liu Bo, director of the university's physical education department, emphasized that it is now high time for the university to revive the rule.

Relatives of al Qaida founder Osama Bin Laden are among the four people who died when a private jet crash-landed at a car auction site in Hampshire.
The Saudi-registered Phenom 300 jet was attempting to land at Blackbushe Airport when it crashed on to dozens of cars and burst into flames on Friday afternoon.
Saudi ambassador to the UK, Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf Al Saud, offered his condolences to the large and wealthy Bin Laden family, who own a major construction company in Saudi Arabia.
The statement, translated by the BBC, said: "His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf Al Saud ... has paid his condolences to the family and relatives of Mohammed bin Laden at Blackbushe Airport in Britain for the great loss they have suffered as a result of the crash of the plane that was carrying the family."
A further statement said the embassy would work with the British authorities to ensure a quick repatriation of the bodies for burial.
Sources told the Press Association the jet had flown in from Milan, Italy.
Acting Chief Inspector Olga Venner, of Hampshire Police, said: "We can confirm that there were four people on board, including the pilot.
"Sadly there were no survivors. No-one on the ground has been injured and we would urge anyone with any information, including pictures or videos, to contact 101."
She said police had launched a joint investigation with the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB).
An airport spokesman said: "Blackbushe Airport confirmed that a Phenom 300 jet with four persons on board crashed near the end of the runway around 3.09pm while attempting to make a landing.
"The scene was attended by Blackbushe Fire and Rescue within minutes, followed by Hampshire fire, police and ambulance units."
In the aftermath of the crash, a dark plume of black smoke could be seen twisting into the sky, while an orange-red ball of fire raged below.
The fire appeared to be in the middle of a car park, with vehicles lined up for inspection at the auction site based at the airport.
Debris from the jet could be seen strewn among the dozens of severely damaged cars.
Robert Belcher, a local aviation enthusiast, said he was driving home when he saw a plume of black smoke coming from the site.
He said: "I was passing the airport on my way home and there was a big column of smoke in the air.
"The fire service had closed the road behind me.
"I could see the plume of smoke waving from about five miles away and was hoping it was just a car fire rather than an aircraft accident."
Mr Belcher said he was "shocked" when he discovered that a jet had crashed.
He added: "Apparently the aircraft was landing and just didn't stop.
"At the end of the runway there is a car park because the airport is used for car auctions and it's gone into there.
"I assumed it was cars on fire in the auction yard.
"Local people have said that it was this aircraft which is registered in Saudi Arabia.
"It's been a regular visitor to the airport for a few months.
"The aircraft would hold six people, it's a small jet."
A group of people, believed to be the family of the victims, were escorted to the site by police officers.
The scorched remains of the jet could be seen lying beside charred hulks of cars in the middle of the auction storage area.
A resident who did not want to be named said he saw the plane come down while he was repairing his chimney.
"I was on the roof and I heard the jet and thought I would watch it land," he said.
"I saw it going past, then it was about 20 feet off the ground and I thought, it's not got enough runway to land here. It was too high as it was coming in to land and didn't touch the runway.
"The next thing I heard was the crash sirens and a big plume of smoke going up.
"It was a really big plume of smoke and I could hear cars exploding over at the market."
Do you know the operator precedence rules in the programming languages that you use? Given an expression like this one in Java:
x/6+5&8>>2-4!=8
Can you say how it will be parsed? (Never mind that the semantics may be meaningless; the parser doesn't care about semantics.) Generally, programming environments give very little help in improving readability of expressions; the expression will be displayed exactly as above. You do get bracket-match highlighting if you have brackets (and some would argue that you should always bracket expressions for extra clarity). But maybe the display of expressions can be further improved in other ways.
Designers tend to use whitespace for grouping items — for example, grouping related columns in tables. And in fact, a lot of programmers do tend to omit the whitespace around high precedence (tightly bound) operators while putting it in around lower precedence operators. You are much more likely to see this:
dist * Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y)
Than this equally spaced version:
dist * Math . sqrt (x * x + y * y)
Or this devilishy spaced version:
dist*Math . sqrt(x * x+y * y)
If the rule that most people follow is simply to have whitespace inversely proportional to the precedence of the operator, surely we could automate this in a programming editor.
Dynamically varying whitespace
Consider this expression, without spaces:
Using the parse tree of this expression, we can assign smaller whitespace to operators nearer the leaves (higher precedence operators which bind more tightly) than operators nearer the root (lower precedence operators):
It is now more obvious at a glance how the expression should be read, compared to the unspaced original. Not only is the display clearer, but if the editor takes charge of putting the whitespace in expressions, the user can save keystrokes by never having to insert spaces in expressions in the first place. They can enter the unspaced version above, and the editor displays it as the second version automatically.
Choosing the amount of space
One design question is whether the width of whitespace is solely determined by absolute operator precedence — i.e. plus always has the same amount of whitespace around it — or whether it is determined by the relative precedence of the operator in the chosen expression. In the absolute case, the complete expression “2 * 3” will be spaced differently to “2 + 3”, which to me seems odd. In the dynamic case, you get spacing readjustment: if you take “2+3” and add “*4” on the end, the + will get more space added to reflect that its dynamic precedence has changed. That is:
Becomes:
While re-spacing as you edit is visually disturbing, I think this is the right thing to do — the addition of *4 has changed the semantics of the existing expression (it is not “(2+3)*4” but rather “2+(3*4)”) so respacing it to reflect the altered semantics seems correct.
Longer expressions
There is a limit to how long an expression this technique can make readable — our earlier terrible expression:
Becomes a bit better when space is varied:
But I think in that case, there's only so much that spacing can do — you really should add some brackets.
Summary
I've discussed a way that programming editors could be smarter about whitespace when displaying expressions: dynamically varying the whitespace around operators based on their relative precedence in the expression. This is likely to be included in a new editor we're currently working on for our Greenfoot system. I note that this scheme does vary the width of spaces in your editor, which may upset some users. But while fixed-width spacing is useful for aligning the left-hand edges of lines of code, I'm less convinced that it matters within the line of code.
Addendum: a colleague points me to this work which mentions a similar system for mathematical equations (page 6). It's interesting that this idea has been implemented in mathematics but not yet caught on in programming.

Buried inside the budget deal brokered by Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid: a payout to the millionaire widow of the late Democratic senator Frank Lautenberg.
The Daily Caller obtained a copy of the draft legislation agreed to by the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate.
The agreement would re-open the government and raise the debt limit.
It also authorizes this expenditure: “Notwithstanding any other provision of this joint resolution, there is appropriated for payment to Bonnie Englebardt Lautenberg, widow of Frank R. Lautenberg, late a Senator from New Jersey, $174,000.”
The 89-year-old New Jersey Democrat died this summer.
USA Today reported last month that the proposed one-time payment to Bonnie Englebardt is equivalent to a full year's salary for a senator. It's a long tradition of Congress to make such expenditures to widows.
But is this expenditure necessary? The paper reported that not only was Lautenberg's networth $56.8 million last year, his widow was unaware of the expenditure.
“I just learned about this recently in the news,” Lautenberg said. “I don't want to comment on it until I make some decisions about how to handle this. I didn't even know I was getting this money.”
Unlike the taxpayer-funded stipend for his rich widow, Lautenberg's vast fortune was earned in the private sector. Before entering politics, the late senator spent many years running the payroll management colossus Automatic Data Processing, where he started as a salesman and ended up as CEO.

I received an email from a Department of Corrections social worker about four years ago. She had a message for me from my older brother Michael. He wanted contact with his family after fifteen years in a prison psychiatric treatment facility, to which he had been sentenced after trying unsuccessfully to murder my mother, father, and younger brother in an arson attempt at our home in suburban Tidewater, Virginia.
In February 1992, in the early morning dark, Michael had dismantled the house's smoke detectors, poured gas around the garage and through the downstairs hallway, and thrown matches into the black puddles, igniting wood, drywall, and carpet. He then rode off on my mother's cobwebbed, blue Sears bicycle. He had once been a handsome, fit, quick-witted boy, but by then he was a bloated, ashtray-smelling, deranged, yellow-toothed twenty-five-year-old. A couple of hours after setting the fire, he rode back home. My mother, dressed in a nightgown and jacket, was crying and shivering in the cold as the firemen extinguished the last embers in the smoldering garage and the police collected evidence. He asked her what was for breakfast. Could they maybe go to Denny's?
When the cops wanted to put handcuffs on him—loose, for comfort, just one of those procedures the manual insists upon, Michael—my brother figured that would be okay. He sat in the back of the police car, smiling as blue and red light sprinted around the neighborhood, flashing across the sleep-softened faces of our neighbors. He laughed. He'd really done it this time.
My brother is a paranoid schizophrenic. He used to spend much of his time reading and writing in his King James Bible, in which he found coded messages and directions about his own life. Religious delusion, across cultures and belief systems, is a common form that auditory and visual hallucinations take in cases of acute paranoid schizophrenia. This is because the schizophrenic seeks salvation from his suffering the way a person drowning seeks a gulp of air. Religion is a road map most available for this mission—a set system of archetypes, story lines, and metaphors aimed at deepest human meaning, hope in bottomless despair, and orientation within one's own mind and experience. As the anthropologist Clifford Geertz once wrote, “Man cannot live in a world he does not understand.” When we lose touch with so-called reality, we don't disappear into a void of meaninglessness; we reconstitute fact, experience, belief, and feeling into an alternate reality. We leave the socially acceptable level of delusion we all live in as citizens of the modern, information-glutted, wisdom-and-knowledge-starved world and enter a mental house of mirrors. We go “mad.”
In mental illness, faith and spirituality can be elixirs for suffering, but they can also be unhealthy and even dangerous obsessions, especially when those in the throes of psychosis refuse to believe they are ill, as do about fifty percent of schizophrenics. And sometimes these obsessions spill over into uncontrolled dementia and, as in my brother's case, violence.
He used to pray loudly in pizza parlors, or at the food court in the mall, while the Christmas shoppers walked quickly by. He felt an otherworldly power roiling through his bones and blood and skin. Clouds had messages. A drop in temperature could carry hidden meaning. He believed there were demons in our house, under his bed, which he once tearfully told my mother about, sending her heartbeat into the red zone. He was convinced that my father, who was dying of cancer, almost dead, was a mystical and nefarious presence. The night he set the fire, he needed to burn out the evil—all very simple, really, the furthest thing from “random” violence. In his mind it was a necessary and even unavoidable act of destruction. Given his circumstances—evil in the house, unbearable oppression from mysterious forces, the buzzing and eye-twitching need to survive this pain—what choice did he have?
I was 21 in 1992, at college forty miles away from our home the night of the incident. I am the only one in my family to finish college, a scholarship and fellowship kid, and it was very important to my parents that I succeed, that I become a person with opportunities in his life rather than dead ends. They did what they could to protect me from my brother, and I owe them more than I can pay. Though I have always been quite academically average outside of the humanities, I was a shining star to them. I later graduated with a degree in English and journalism. I then went on to get two graduate degrees. I have written five books, all autobiographical and documentary, all driven by my layman's interest in “abnormal” psychology and social psychology, in how we—as individuals, as a society, as cultures and sub-cultures—construct and perceive notions of “truth.” My first book—the darkest, the saddest—is a story about my brother, an experiment in biography, memoir, and journalism. I haven't read it since going through the publisher's galleys in 2000.
The less-selfish half of me has always wanted to help my brother, or at least help people understand his illness, its effects on sufferers, on families, on society. In the journalism and criticism I was honing—guided especially by books like Michael Herr's Dispatches and James Agee's Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, by the essays of George Orwell and James Baldwin—I thought that maybe a high level of prose craft could wield some power on behalf of consciousness-raising, activism, and progress. But, to be honest, the selfish half of me wanted him, by the time of the fire, disappeared, even dead; or I wanted him to have never existed. The level of stress he caused in my family felt like someone had set a grenade on our kitchen table and then asked us, my family, to carry on with life as usual.
When Michael was gone, incarcerated in a psych ward after the fire, which itself followed dozens of smaller violent and strange episodes, I felt myself rising toward light and air. I could work, study. I could have friends, lovers, could get married, have a family. Time in my life began to flow perhaps more like time in your life. I could calm down. I could read a book. I could think. I could be less depressed.
Very few problems nowadays strike me as big compared to the problem of severe mental illness in my family, in my childhood home, which went on for more than a decade, each year a little, or a lot, worse than the prior. My parents essentially had a part-time job trying to get help for my brother—new meds with toxic side effects, a treatment center that insurance would only pay for with the correct paperwork, and that only for thirty days. Then there was their need to prove, over and over, that he was in fact a danger to himself and others.
“Has he hurt anyone?” asked the voice on the other end of the line.
“Technically, no,” said my mother, “but…”
“If there hasn't been an incident,” continued the voice, “and there is no police report…,” etc.
My parents came from humble beginnings and little means, and they had ingrained in them the working-class value of ultimately trusting and deferring to any and all hierarchical authority—medical, legal, psychiatric—even if that authority was faceless, bureaucratic, harried, and barely competent. But one thing I learned during nine years of university education was that most experts only know what they're talking about half the time, and that our most advanced forms of knowledge are highly provisional, often shown to be naïve just days or years or decades after they seemed like breakthroughs.
The social worker wrote in the email that my brother was lonely, isolated—as, anyway, I imagined every prisoner was, as I knew every sufferer of his disease is, especially at his level of severity, because they are stuck in darkness, pain, and slippery realities. He was also “rarely any better” and often confrontational and uncooperative. My brother is a worst-case scenario. There are many like him in our prisons and on the streets—by some estimates I've seen, up to 300,000 in the US, but I'm going to unscientifically tell you that those estimates are way too low and it is probably more like double that. If you live in a city, you see several people suffering from severe mental illness every day you pass by a congregation of the homeless (they would be quickly rounded up in the suburbs), and as politicians (large percentages of whom live in gated communities in those suburbs) continue to destroy what is left of the social safety net, this will only increase. “Community support”—a popular phrase in mental health care—can be a euphemism for abandonment for both the sufferer and his or her loved ones. Laws regarding treatment, driven by upside-down fiscal concerns, are passed by people with no visceral connection to the problem. Let them be faced with the choice of housing a dangerously ill loved one or putting him on the street to starve, commit crimes out of desperation, or become a victim of mind-altering violence and abuse. What would you choose? Let them stand with a phone to their head, crying for an hour while on hold, listening to Muzak with one ear and the desperate prayers of a child with the other.
My brother has, I think, erased any guilt he may have felt for his prior deeds, or rather his crimes have been subsumed under his ongoing hallucinations and delusions, his anger and self- and world-loathing. His imprisonment is undoubtedly seen by him as part of a deep religious conspiracy, as everything was. The social worker informed me he had almost killed himself (he attempted suicide when I was a teenager and again when I was in my early twenties, so I wasn't shocked) by drinking enough water, gallons and gallons and gallons, to cleanse himself of his medications, which he hates because of the side effects, and which he is forced by law to take as part of an “involuntary psychiatric commitment” every 180 days because he will not take them otherwise. The social worker and her team keep my brother from the dangers of the larger prison—potential rape, violent attacks, various types and levels of enslavement, and illegal trade—by going through the rigmarole of paperwork every six months to make sure he is medicated and in the psychiatric unit where he belongs. He drinks the water, you could say, as a search for God beneath the tranquilizing chemicals. God—his notion of God—is his only hope. By chugging the water, he rids himself of electrolytes and vitamins and minerals to the point of seizure. So he ends up in the infirmary, handcuffed and, I imagine, raging once his strength is back. I remember that rage, how impossible he was to be near, how dangerous one minute, how sad and pathetic and tearful the next.
I told the social worker I could not speak to him, nor could my mother, who is in her 60s now, living a peaceful life after many years of a damn difficult one. Call me cold, but our problem—his problem, but ours by extension—is intractable. I wish I could offer some kind of easy prescription here—something to do with politics and policy, with therapeutic philosophies or biochemical treatment protocols. But the mystery of mental anguish, of the mind on the outs with itself, of a version of hell made manifest in a suburban living room, is the one thing in my life that has brought me to the point where my only option seemed to be to pray.
To reengage my brother would be suicidal. What choice do I have? The past comes flooding back. I cut him loose to survive.
JOLIET, Ill. (CBS) — The Roman Catholic bishop in Joliet is allowing an accused predator priest to return to limited ministry, and advocates for priest sex abuse victims are livid over the decision.
As WBBM Newsradio's Bernie Tafoya reports, the Rev. F. Lee Ryan was removed a couple of years ago from his ministry at St. Edmund Parish in Watseka and St. Joseph Mission in Crescent City, both in downstate Iroquois County.

Allegations have been deemed credible that he had sexually abused a boy in the 1970s, starting when the boy was 14.
Now, Joliet Bishop Daniel Conlon is allowing Ryan to minister to homebound Roman Catholics.
The bishop says Rome has decided that at the time Ryan allegedly molested a teen, what he did was not considered a serious crime by the Church according to Church law at the time. For that reason, Conlon ruled, Ryan could not be moved from ministry altogether.
The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests says Church law at the time actually said a 14-year-old was at an age of consent.
“This is a shocking and dangerous move by Bishop Conlon,” said a statement from SNAP, which pointed out that Conlon is in charge of children's safety for all of America's bishops as head of the U.S. Catholic bishops' committee on sexual abuse.
“What part of ‘one strike and you're out' do Catholic officials not understand?” the SNAP statement read.
Ryan's alleged victim, now 52 and living out of state, was shocked at the decision to keep Ryan in ministry when he learned of it last week.
“I was actually in disbelief. I just couldn't believe that they would (reinstate Ryan),” said the victim, who asked that his identity be kept private.
He said Ryan established a relationship with him while he was a student at Providence Catholic High School in New Lenox.
The man said Ryan would pull him out of class to smoke in a confession room and that he would sometimes drink beer with Ryan at his apartment in the evenings.
When the man told Ryan he thought he was gay, Ryan began taking him on walks through Hammel Woods forest preserve in Shorewood.
They eventually spent weekends together at an Indiana motel, he said. Ryan asked the man to call him Lee so no one would know he was a priest, the man said.
One night when the man was 16, Ryan confronted him while he was in a car parked outside a Joliet bar with another teen his age.
“(Ryan) was very angry,” the man said. “He said, ‘Aren't God and me enough for you?'”
A few years later, the man moved out of state. He went through years of therapy. After he was laid off from a job about 20 years later, he told his mother about the abuse.
His mother told a friend who worked for then-Bishop J. Peter Sartain, who has since moved on to a post as Archbishop of Seattle. An investigation began, and the man's allegation of abuse was substantiated by the diocese.
The man is still in therapy — paid for by the diocese, he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude oil futures hit a six-month high on Monday as output disruptions were expected to cut into a long-standing glut in the market, while stocks rose sharply, boosted by basic materials and energy shares.

The benchmark U.S. Treasury yield rose after matching a one-month low hit Friday and the dollar ticked lower, caught between a weaker yen and a stronger euro.
Supply disruptions in Nigeria, Canada and Venezuela have most likely pushed oil production below consumption levels this month for the first time in at least two years. That means the world has started eating into the huge stockpile of oil that has knocked as much as 70 percent off crude prices between 2014 and early 2016.
The energy sector led Wall Street higher following a third-consecutive week of declines on the S&P 500.
“Oil is the catalyst but the move today wouldn't have been this big if stocks had not been this weak lately,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis.
He said the move in oil and other commodities “is creating a sense that there's a shot this rally could get some legs… and people hate to miss out.”
The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 175.39 points, or 1 percent, to 17,710.71, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 20.05 points, or 0.98 percent, to 2,066.66 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 57.78 points, or 1.22 percent, to 4,775.46.
Apple (AAPL.O), up 3.7 percent at $93.88 after Warren Buffett disclosed a near-$1 billion stakes, also gave U.S. stocks a boost.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 share index .FTEU3 closed down less than 0.1 percent. Volume was constrained in Europe with some bourses, including the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, closed for a holiday.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS rose 0.67 percent.
Oil prices rose sharply, partly after Goldman Sachs said disruption to supply had seen the market flip into deficit and U.S. crude CLc1 could trade as high as $50 per barrel in the second half of 2016.
Brent crude LCOc1 hit $49.47 per barrel, its highest since early November. The international benchmark, which has risen nearly 80 percent from lows touched in January, last traded at $49.05, up 2.6 percent on the day.
U.S. crude CLc1 was up 3.6 percent at $47.87.
YEN, TREASURIES LOWER
The yen JPY= fell 0.30 percent to 108.93 per dollar and the euro EUR= rose 0.11 percent to $1.1317. The greenback was marginally lower against a basket of major currencies .DXY, having touched a three-week high on Friday.
U.S. Treasury yields rose as prices fell despite a weaker-than-expected reading in the New York Fed manufacturing survey, as traders focused on the gains in the oil market.
“A lot of the overnight data has been kind of weak and people have just roundly ignored it,” said Aaron Kohli, interest rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.
“Everyone was just focusing on crude this morning.”
The U.S. 10-year note US10YT=RR fell 14/32 in price to yield 1.7516 percent, compared with 1.7050 late on Friday.
Irish yields IE10YT=TWEB touched the lowest in more than a month after Moody's Investor Services raised Ireland's credit rating to A3 from Baa1. It maintained a positive outlook on Ireland, which entered a three-year international bailout in 2011.
“The upgrade by Moody's expands the range of potential buyers of Irish bonds. Some investors, particularly in Asia, require a minimum ‘A' grade from all of the three big agencies,” Cantor Fitzgerald strategist Ryan McGrath said.
South Africa's rand ZAR= hit a two-month low against the dollar and government bonds ZAR186= weakened sharply after a newspaper report, denied by the government, that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan faces arrest.

The report raised concerns of a repeat of the run on the rand and bonds in December after President Jacob Zuma changed finance ministers twice in a week.
Copper CMCU3 rose 0.4 percent to $4,645 per tonne, having hit a near three-month low on Friday.
Spot gold XAU= was little changed at $1,274.36 an ounce.
A doctored TIME cover of South Korea's former President Roh Moo-hyun displayed erroneously by commercial broadcaster SBS has created a storm of controversy in the republic.
The image shown in a May 17 broadcast was of TIME's March 2003 Asian edition, which originally ran the cover line “Hello, Mr Roh,” with the words altered to “Go to Hell, Mr Roh.” It also described the former leader, who died in 2009, as “South Korea's new corpse.”
The fake cover was displayed alongside other, genuine TIME covers featuring leaders in Asia, including the May 15 edition featuring newly-elected President Moon Jae-in.
The doctored image reportedly came from Ilbe, a libertarian-leaning site sometimes called a South Korean version of messageboard 4chan. Local media reported that SBS has been duped a number of times before by the site, which is infamous in the country for circulating right-wing memes.

SBS has been widely criticized for the error, including by Moon's office. Roh's family has reportedly threatened to sue the network.
The South Korean network made a formal apology for the error the following day, saying it had not properly evaluated the images used.

In the free for all 21st, it all sounds terrific -- free markets, free trade and free commerce. But really, it's lies, traderous lies and statistics.
The "d" in trader is deliberate. This is about the sleight of hand billed as free trade.
We're constantly told it's a win-win. In 2000, when China was admitted to the World Trade Organization, for example, a former president said that exports to China already supported hundreds of thousands of American jobs, and this figure would grow substantially with the new access to Chinese markets that the WTO agreement would create. Politicians also promised the U.S. would benefit from exports to the rapidly growing consumer market in China.
The opposite, however, has occurred: China has exploited the U.S. consumer market while U.S. companies have been restricted to selling to China bulk goods such as grains, scrap, and chemicals, some intermediate products such as semiconductors and some durable products such as aircraft.
The China trade promises were snaked oil.
The Economic Policy Institute released a study Wednesday revealing what happened to American jobs since China was admitted to the WTO. Between 2001 and 2007, 2.3 million workers lost their jobs or were displaced because of trade deficits with China.
Annual earnings for all U.S. workers without a college degree are $1,400 lower because of competition with China's low-wage workers and because China now accounts for such a huge percent of all of our imports. Displaced American workers, who did find new jobs, lost an average of $8,146 a year in earnings each. That is $156 less each week to use to feed the kids, to pay the mortgage, to meet the car payments.
Coincidentally, on the very same day EPI released its report, talks in Geneva, Switzerland to open global markets even further collapsed as China and India refused to allow free trade when it came to their own agricultural products. Both countries wanted to impose or raise tariffs on imported agricultural goods to protect their indigenous farmers.
Remember, it is for the most part, bulk goods, such as agricultural products, that the U.S. is exporting to China. A sticking point in the negotiations, for example, was soybeans. U.S. trade representative Susan C. Schwab had agreed that China could increase tariffs on soybeans in 8 of every 10 years, and still China walked away from the Geneva talks.
So here is the question: how can this relationship possibly be called free trade when China wanted to impose tariffs on our soybeans in 8 of 10 years, when it is manipulating its currency, when it is subsidizing its manufacturing, when it is failing to enforce even the most basic environmental and labor regulations?
That is snake oil.
We need fair trade. And so do Chinese workers and families, who are being abused by this so-called free trade system that benefits only CEOs and major shareholders of global corporations.
What do Americans workers and families get out of so-called free trade? A report, "The Toxic Truth: Unfair Trade Kills" issued recently by the United Steelworkers details the gross destruction, including a four-year-old who died after swallowing a lead pendant that was attached to his shoe imported from China; two Philadelphia carpenters killed when their van crashed while they were traveling home from work on defective tires manufactured in China, and 81 patients from across the country poisoned by contaminated heparin, a blood thinner imported from China.
In addition, the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission recalled 30 million toys made in China last year because they were doused with dangerous leaded paint; Chinese-made pet food sickened and killed untold numbers of American cats and dogs because it contained tainted wheat protein; officials pulled off the market poisonous Chinese toothpaste; children were sickened by Aqua Dots toy kits made in China with a substitute chemical that turned into the "date rape" drug when swallowed, and the U.S. blocked import of Chinese fish containing banned antibiotics.
That's just the consumer viewpoint. The EPI study dispelled the myth that a good education is insurance against job displacement. EPI found that 31 percent of the jobs lost since China entered the WTO were among workers with college degrees and more than half -- 55.6 percent -- of the displaced were in the top half of American wage earners. The China trade deficits have contributed to the loss of 200,000 scientist and engineer jobs within this nation's manufacturing base, a 10.7 percent drop.
This is what free trade has given the U.S. Poisonous products. Lost jobs. Lower earning power.
It's not just us though. Think about this: One effect of free trade is polluted air wafting all the way across the Pacific Ocean to the shores of California, a state that enforces environmental standards higher than the national ones. Twenty-five percent of the pollutants in the Los Angeles basin come from China. That's tragic for Californians who try so hard.
That's also tragic for the Chinese people who live with befouled air every day. (Well, except during the brief period of the Olympic Games when the country is attempting to impress the world. After that, the cars, trucks and industrial pollution will return full force.) More than half of the rivers in China are too polluted to serve as a source of drinking water -- often because of untreated pollution pouring into them from factories.
An investigative report issued earlier this month by the National Labor Committee describes conditions in the Kai Da Toy factory in Shenzhen, China where the Sesame Street's Kid K'Nex Ernie construction toys are made. In violation of local and national laws, the factory's employees are forced to work 13 to 15 hours a day, 7 days a week without health care. After deductions for room and board, they are paid 28 cents an hour, far below the requisite minimum wage. The 600 workers include 100 16-year-olds, and earlier this year, included numerous children who "disappeared" after an investigation by a Chinese newspaper.
NLC inquiries have repeatedly uncovered violations of Chinese labor law. Chinese firms don't have to pay U.S. minimum wage. But they need to follow their own rules and not make virtual slaves of their country's own adolescents.
Adult American factory workers trying to support families cannot compete with Chinese teenagers living four to a dormitory room on the factory site without any health or other benefits, working sweatshop hours, seven days a week.
What kind of "free trade" system is this? Those Chinese adolescents aren't free. The American factory workers who have lost their jobs have forfeited financial freedom.
Still, the Kai Da factory will make big money. And the American corporations selling the Ernie construction toys will make big profits. Free trade works just fine for them.
If so-called free trade is ever to be replaced with fair trade, workers and families in China and America and every other trading country must demand it. Fair trade means that at the very least, labor and environmental regulations must be respected and enforced, so that people are not enslaved and the environment destroyed in the name of global corporate profit.
Really, at some point, when politicians claim these free trade deals are a win-win, and the actual result is 16-year-old Chinese youngsters working 16 hour days and American workers idled while their youngsters play with toxic imported toys, aren't the lies traitorous?
The Ariane 5 ES launcher photographed on 14 February 2010 during transfer from the Final Assembly Building (BAF) to the Launch Zone (ZL-3), at the Ariane Launch Complex no. 3 (ELA-3) of the Guiana Space Centre, Europe's spaceport.
This story was updated Feb. 16 at 10:25 a.m. EST.
The European Space Agency is once again counting down to launch a huge cargo ship toward the International Space Station today (Feb.16) after a one-day delay that may force NASA to push back its own flight of the shuttle Discovery next week.
The robotic spacecraft called the Automated Transfer Vehicle 2 — at more than 22 tons (about 20,000 kilograms), the heaviest European spacecraft ever built — is scheduled to blast off from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana, at 4:50 p.m. EST (2150 GMT).
An Ariane 5 rocket will boost the spacecraft into orbit. The mission was delayed from yesterday due to "a measurement anomaly" in the rocket's super-chilled liquid oxygen propellant tank, ESA officials said.
The ATV-2 space freighter carries the name of Johannes Kepler, after the German astronomer and mathematician who lived in the 16th and 17th centuries. ESA plans to fly at least five ATV cargo ships to support the International Space Station.

Space station traffic jam
If the ATV Johannes Kepler launches today, NASA will have to delay its own flight of the space shuttle Discovery by one day because of traffic concerns at the space station, NASA officials said.
Discovery was slated to launch toward the International Space Station on Feb. 24 – one day after the Johannes Kepler was scheduled to arrive at the orbiting laboratory. NASA opted to delay the launch of Discovery until Feb. 25, to give the Johannes Kepler time to launch, U.S. space agency officials said.
But if the European cargo ship does not launch today, it would have to stand down until Friday, Feb. 18, before making its next launch attempt. If that situation arises, NASA would stick to Discovery's original Feb. 24 launch date.
Top NASA mission managers plan to make final decision on Discovery's launch date at the end of this week.
Automated Transfer Vehicles are ESA's contribution to delivering equipment and supplies to astronauts living on the International Space Station. The first of the fleet, the ATV-1 Jules Verne, flew to the space station in 2008.
Today's launch also marks the 200th flight for the European-built Ariane rocket family, which is overseen by launch service provider Arianespace.
Europe's heaviest spaceship
The Johannes Kepler is packed with 7.1 tons of supplies. The average ATV load is about 6 tons, but modifications to the Ariane 5 rocket allow the extra weight, ESA officials said.
The cargo packed inside the Johannes Kepler includes 3,527 pounds (1,600 kg) of equipment and other dry supplies, 1,873 pounds (850 kg) of rocket propellant for the station's thrusters and 220 pounds (100 kg) of oxygen for the station's crew.
Arianespace officials have said the total weight of the Johannes Kepler and its 7.1 tons of cargo adds up to about 44,202 pounds (20,050 kg).
ESA's unmanned cargo ships are disposable craft designed to fly themselves once they reach orbit. The Johannes Kepler, for example, was scheduled to dock itself to a port on the end of the space station's Russian-built Zvezda module on Thursday, Feb. 24.
Astronauts living aboard the International Space Station have an abort button, which they can use to postpone the Johannes Kepler's approach if it veers off course. If an abort occurs, the craft will move out to a safe distance and then await approval to make another attempt, ESA officials have said.
Backdropped by the blackness of space, the European Space Agency's (ESA) "Jules Verne" Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) begins its relative separation from the International Space Station. The ATV undocked on Sept. 5, 2008 and was placed in a parking orbit for three weeks, before deorbiting on Sept. 29 and burning up in the Earth's atmosphere. (Image: © NASA)
Space station's robot fleet
ATV spacecraft form part of the international fleet of robotic cargo ships to keep space station crews stocked up.
Japan's second robotic craft – known as the H-2A Transfer Vehicle, or Konoutori (Japanese for "White Stork") – arrived at the space station on Jan. 27. Russia followed suit with its unmanned Progress 41 spacecraft, which launched on Jan. 28 and arrived two days later.
NASA plans to rely on its Russian, European and Japanese partners to deliver cargo to the space station once it retires its space shuttle fleet later this year.
The U.S. space agency currently plans three more shuttle flights by July before retiring its three shuttles – Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour – after 30 years of service.
You can watch the launch of the ATV-2 Johannes Kepler live via this European Space Agency link, or by visiting launch service provider Arianespace. You can follow SPACE.com Managing Editor Tariq Malik on Twitter @tariqjmalik.
Police bust Yuen Long marijuana farm
Police have smashed a marijuana operation in the Yuen Long district and seized cannabis plants and buds estimated to be worth HK$11 million (US$1.41 million).
The raid came two weeks after police received a tip-off that some people were growing marijuana in a remote village house in Tong Yan San Tsuen, news website hk01.com reports.
Officers from the Narcotics Bureau arrested a 43-year-old unemployed man, surnamed Cheung, and a 72-year-old woman, surnamed Lam.
Both are locals and tenants of the house.
A total of 580 cannabis plants and 1.1 kilograms of cannabis buds were confiscated from a 2,000-square-foot farm secretly located inside the house.
According to officials, the farm was equipped with air exhausters, sunlamps, air-conditioners, humidity controllers and carbon-dioxide makers to facilitate plant growth.
Officials said the farm has been operating for about three months and providing one-stop services that included production and packaging.
Some of its products have been sold on the market, according to Sing Tao Daily.
Investigations are continuing and more arrests are expected.
According to the Dangerous Drug Ordinance, any person who cultivates cannabis or opium poppy is liable to a fine of HK$100,000 and imprisonment for 15 years upon conviction.

Ever since I discovered socca, I've been smitten with the rich and soft texture created by combining water with chickpea flour. And when I found out that you can also make chickpea fries out of the batter, I had to try it out. These fries are not only delicious, but are also very simple: they only contain chickpea flour, water, oil, salt and pepper. These components are all whisked together to form a slurry, heated then cooled to create a sliceable texture which is then deep fried or pan fried in a little oil. The texture on the outside becomes light and crispy, while the inside remains soft, rich and airy—sort of souffle like. Here I've paired it with some roasted garlic aioli which is the perfect compliment to this addictive, amazing and sort-of-healthy appetizer or side dish.
Print CHICKPEA PANISSE WITH ROASTED GARLIC AIOLI Author olivesfordinner.com Yield 2 servings Ingredients for the aioli 1 whole head of garlic
3 TB olive oil
1/4 cup Vegenaise
1 tsp apple cider vinegar for the fries 1 cup chickpea flour
2 cups cold water
1 TB olive oil
salt and pepper vegetable oil, for frying
chopped parsley, for serving Instructions Preheat your oven to 350. Slice off the very top of the garlic, keeping the rest of the garlic intact. Place the head of garlic, exposed side down, into a small glass pyrex dish. Drizzle with olive oil and cover the top tightly with tin foil. Place into the oven to bake for 45 minutes. While your garlic is roasting, combine all of the fries ingredients into a bowl and whisk until smooth. Place two tablespoons of oil into a large skillet over medium high heat. Once the oil is very hot, slowly pour the batter into it. Once it starts to slightly bubble after a minute or two, take a whisk and stir it continuously and vigorously until thickened, about 7 minutes. Remove it from the heat and transfer the thickened batter into a glass container greased with a little oil. Place into the refrigerator to cool and set. After 45 minutes, pull your garlic out of the oven. Flip it over, and spoon some of the oil that's collected in the bottom of the glass dish over the top. Replace the foil and bake for an additional 30-45 minutes, until golden brown and bubbly. Allow the garlic to cool completely, then separate and squeeze the roasted garlic into a bowl. Add in the rest of the aioli ingredients, then drizzle the leftover olive oil into it. Whisk until well combined. By now, your chickpea batter should be firm enough to slice. Slice it into whatever shape you want and set aside. If deep frying, place plenty of vegetable oil into a small saucepan. Heat it over medium-high heat for about 7 minutes. Insert a wooden spoon into the pot, touching the bottom of the pot with it. If bubbles form around the spoon immediately, you are ready to fry. Place a few of the fries into the hot oil (no more than six), ensuring that they do not stick together. Fry for a few minutes until golden brown. Transfer to a paper towel to drain, then sprinkle with salt. Repeat with the rest of the batter. If pan-frying, place a couple of tablespoons of oil into a saute pan over medium-high heat. Fry the pieces for a few minutes on each side until golden brown. Sprinkle with salt while piping hot. Serve immediately with the roasted garlic aioli and chopped fresh parsley.
5 Simple-Yet-Powerful Tools for Defeating Resistance
Hello and welcome to Happenchance! If you'd like to keep up with this site, you should subscribe to email updates. They're convenient, sexy, and always spam-free.
You can put out a fire by dousing it with water, dirt, foam, ammonium phosphate, or other specialized concoctions. However, one extinguishing agent won't work for all fires. You can throw water on a grease fire, but this will cause flaming grease to spread (think napalm). Spray sodium bicarbonate on a gas fire and it will continue to burn.
Resistance, like fire, manifests in diverse ways. But unlike the different classes of fires, no one has yet classified the different classes of Resistance. Procrastination is a form of Resistance, but so is the rewriting of the same sentence twenty seven times.
Left unchecked, Resistance will spread, consuming much and leaving nothing but the burned-out frame of abandoned dreams. Use the wrong approach to defeating it, and the Resistance may spread.
For these reasons, it's good to have a wide variety of Resistance-defeating tools at your disposal; what works for one manifestation of Resistance may not work for another.
[BTW: If you're not familiar with the concept of capital R Resistance, check out my review of The War of Art. There you'll find a additional strategy for defeating Resistance.]
Tools for Defeating Resistance
1. Keep a time log. For me, this is a nearly fool-proof strategy for overcoming Resistance. Like a monetary budget, a time log makes you hyper-cognizant of each minute you spend during work time.
My time logs are pretty simple. In a blank page in my notebook, I note the date then make two columns: one for start and finish time, and one for what I'm working on. I note any time interval greater than 5 minutes.
When used in conjunction with the Pomodoro Technique, a time log is one of the post powerful anti-Resistance tool I've encountered. The Pav wrote a great article about time logs a few years ago.
2. Do 5 Minutes. The thought of tackling a massive project all at once can result in paralysis. If you're having a hard time starting, just sit down and do five minutes. After that, you can go back to your favorite procrastinatory activity. A big project is hard, but five minutes is easy. Do five minutes, take a break, then repeat.
Frequently you'll find that five minutes is the tiny push you needed to create positive inertia, earn a small win, and take the first step to changing your behavior.
3. Lower your Standards (a little). This might sound bad, but in fact it works quite well. Allow yourself to do work that isn't up to your usual Olympian standards. Allow yourself to screw up, to fail. In most cases, the work won't be as bad as you imagine it will be, and if it is, you can always improve it before you ship.
When you'll settle for nothing less than world-class work, you're setting yourself up for world-class pain. You're also giving Resistance an easy way to turn a simple project into a quagmire.
4. Limit Your Time. Productivity geeks love cite Parkinson's Law, and I'm no exception: Work expands to the time allotted to it. If you know you only have one hour to do your work, you're going to have a much harder time making excuses and trying to weasel your way out of this work.
When I give myself a leisurely amount of time to work on my writing, for example, I usually fill an afternoon doing what should take an hour or two. But if I limit the drafting to, say, three tomatoes (1 tomato = 25 minutes hyper-focused work), I can usually finish it up in four tomatoes.
I'm currently recording an EP. In the past, I've allowed recording projects to take up months and months and ended up with substandard results. This time, I gave the boys and myself a deadline of just over a month to finish tracking. So far, we're far ahead of schedule. I'll write more about this later.
Why do you think deadlines are so blisteringly effective?
5. Work in the mornings. This may not be for everybody, but for me I love starting work when I'm fresh from a good night's sleep. I'm not sure why this is effective; perhaps the inner critic hasn't had a chance to wake up. Maybe stress levels are lower and it's easier to achieve flow.
Maybe each even that occurs throughout is a barnacle that attaches itself to the hull of a ship. The more barnacles you have, the more resistance you'll encounter, and the longer you'll take to reach your destination. Sometimes the barnacles begin to fall away in the wee hours.
Finally…
I hope that these tools will help you win a few battles, but remember that Resistance is a relentless foe. As long as you're doing something worth doing, you're going to encounter Resistance. To paraphrase Steven Pressfield, the author of The War of Art , “the war of art is ceaseless, a conflict where victory is measured in inches.”
You can procrastinate, whine, and complain, or you can get to your desk, stop overthinking, and do the freaking work.
The choice is yours.

Alvaro Morata: Played down talk linking him with move to the Premier League
Morata is keen to make his name at the Spanish giants and learn from the world class players that he currently shares a dressing room with.
Reports in the British media have suggested that Arsenal and Tottenham were lining up loan moves for Morata in the January transfer window.
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger rejected the rumours and now Morata has distanced himself from the transfer speculation, insisting he is focusing on being a success at the Bernabeu.
"I only think about succeeding at Real Madrid," he told AS.
"Every day I work hard to earn myself a place in the team, but I know that I have had the support of [coach Carlo] Ancelotti since the first day that he came here.
"To Jose Mourinho I owe a great deal for promoting me up to the first team and I will always have a special feeling towards him. He is an incredible coach."
Spanish daily Marca suggests that senior figures at Real Madrid have told them that Morata will not leave on loan in the winter transfer window and Morata only has eyes on following his idol Raul.
"Raul [Gonzalez] has always been a hero to me," Morata continued. "He is considered to be the best player in the history of Real Madrid and Spanish football.
"Cristiano [Ronaldo] is also a great player, out of this world, the complete player, the best. [Karim] Benzema is impressive also and I can learn a lot from him.
"Also, [Gareth] Bale is now showing what he can do and is one of the best players in the world and he was a great signing."
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration just released an alarming report to consumers today to NOT feed certain Evanger's pet food products to their pets:
“The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is advising pet owners and caretakers not to feed their pets certain lots of Evanger's canned Hunk of Beef or Against the Grain Grain Free Pulled Beef with Gravy canned dog food after unopened cans from both brands were found to contain pentobarbital, a barbiturate.”
The agency continued, that in no uncertain terms, must a drug used to euthanize animals be in pet food:
“Pentobarbital is a drug that is used in animal euthanasia. It should not be in pet food and its presence as detected by the FDA in these products renders them adulterated.”
Furthermore, the agency could not assure the public that other Evanger's or Against The Grain products did not also contain pentobarbital laced beef, adding:
“The FDA was unable to determine from available records whether any other Evanger's or Against the Grain products made with beef contain any of the beef that went into the recalled products.”
FDA also found “numerous significant violations” at both Evanger's canning facilities in their Wheeling and Markham Illinois locations in two inspection reports that beggar belief:
“Additionally, the agency concluded an inspection of the manufacturing facilities on February 14, 2017, and noted numerous significant concerns with conditions found at both the Wheeling, IL and Markham, IL plants.”
The two FDA inspection reports reveal frankly shocking conditions at two of Evanger's canning facilities. At the Evanger's Wheeling, Illinois canning facility FDA inspectors observed alarming conditions, including:
Condensation dripping into opened cans of pet food,
Floors throughout the plant that are pitted, cracked, where food is exposed including open cans of pet food,
Peeling paint, mold on walls in areas where food is exposed,
Live fly-like insects,
Open sewers,
They lack operating refrigerated storage facilities where meats are held during thawing, storage, and processing,
Raw meat stored at ambient temperatures inside and outside their facility,
Open cans of beef were held at ambient temperatures for hours during processing.
At the second Evanger's canning facility, called Nutripack, in Markham, Illinois FDA inspectors also observed numerous revolting conditions, including:
Condensate dripping throughout their facility,
Condensate dripping directly above open cans of pet food,
Frozen raw meat prepared on insanitary, bare, paint peeling and unprotected concrete floors,
Employees cutting raw chicken on untreated wooden lumber,
Birds resting in rafters, flying through the warehouse, and feeding on spilled pet food,
Floors throughout their facility are pitted, cracked, and otherwise damaged in areas where food is exposed including where pet food is processed on wooden pallets on the damaged floor.
FDA inspectors concluded that conditions at both plants deemed the previously recalled Evanger's canned beef dog food and Against the Grain canned beef dog food products were adulterated under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, section 402 because they both contained pentobarbital, a barbiturate used to euthanize animals. Adding, that both pet foods were deemed adulterated because they had been “prepared, packed and held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.”
Furthermore, FDA revealed that Evanger's has been lying to consumers about their products being made only using “human-grade USDA inspected meats“, when in fact, the FDA found that their products are made using USDA inedible meat, not fit for human consumption:
“the FDA reviewed a bill of lading from Evanger's supplier of “Inedible Hand Deboned Beef – For Pet Food Use Only. Not Fit For Human Consumption” and determined that the supplier's facility does not have a grant of inspection from the United States Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service. The meat products from this supplier do not bear the USDA inspection mark and would not be considered human grade.”
It is also important to note that the FDA made a point of remarking that their investigation is ongoing and this press release was put out as a preliminary report so as to caution to consumers who may still have this dangerous product in their homes.
The investigation will continue including a complete examination of the suppliers of beef to Evanger's and Against the Grain to determine a possible cause for the presence of pentobarbital. However, the FDA did mention that “testing by USDA-FSIS of Evanger's Hunk of Beef confirmed that the meat used in the product was bovine (beef),” ending speculation that the source of pentobarbital could have been the result of euthanized cats, dogs and or horses.
FDA has also asked us privately to help them locate consumers that may have had a problem with an Evanger's pet food product and to please report it to them immediately. Consumers can find out how to do so by reading the FDA guide on reporting a problem pet food or go directly to the FDA's Food Safety Reporting Portal or by calling an FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in your area.

So the match starts (Forest Colony), and I run my Gauss-totting Dragon to the top of a hill, and start spotting for LRMâ€™s on our team. I zoom in, and though I canâ€™t fully target them from afar, I know an atlas upper torso when I see one, way in the distance. Angling my shot, I fire my Gauss, impacting just beside his skull-Head. Arm damage, crap. Lining up again, I heard the distinct whistle/shreak/scream of LRMâ€™s, and given my position, I can guess where theyâ€™re headed.
Wheeling my â€™Mech around I sprint behind some cover and power down. I take a few LRM hits, but itâ€™s entirely armour damage and nothing is the worse for wear. I run up and poke my head up in the trees again, spotting that same Atlas (sure enough, I had hit his arm). Taking more careful aim, this time I do hit his head â€“ and follow up with some lasers.
Sure enough, the pilot knows what Iâ€™m doing, and takes refuge behind an outcropping of rock. Meanwhile, our teams are going at it in the centre of the map. I see a K2 with dual Large Lasers, quad Medium Lasers, and a pair of Machine guns circling behind a Hunchback, who is desperately turning to turn and face him. His nine Medium Lasers scorching some of the side of the K2, but mostly missing, I decide to add to his fate, and fire a Gauss shot into his right torso, followed by two medium laser burns. Since the K2 had already had this same plan in mind, a dull â€˜thudâ€™ reaches my ears as his right torso explodes. The K2 should have him now, so I move on.
Other than that fight, things arenâ€™t going so well. Our Jenner pilot accidentally crashes into another Atlas, knocking himself to the ground. The Atlas pilot, unimpressed, proceeds to Alpha Strike into the Jenner, killing him.
Close-in is a bad place for a Light pilot to make a mistake.
Our Hunchback 4SP gets a wicked dual SRM-6 blast knocks one of the legs off an enemy Commando whoâ€™d managed to get into a bad turn. I fire a blast at him, taking an arm clean off in a delicious explosion. The Commando is finished by the lasers on the 4SP, who then takes an AC-10/Medium Laser/SRM alpha from a Dragon (the 4SP does not survive).
The friendly K2 is gone, and it occurs to me now that things are quite perilous. Itâ€™s down to me in my Dragon against another Dragon, and that damaged Hunchback that I see run behind a hill. I turn to face the Dragon as the immediate threat, when I realise all that shaking isnâ€™t my Dragon.
Itâ€™s that Atlas.
This is pretty much a worst-case visual scenario.
Heâ€™s right up next to me, and as he fires I managed to fall backward off the hill Iâ€™m standing on. Iâ€™m panicking, as this is pretty much the worst case scenario. I toggle my target to the Atlas, and note that at the very least, that K2 really gave as good as he got. The Atlas has low armour to his centre torso, left arm (thanks to me) and right leg. His head is doing very poor, with virtually no armour. As I fall I valiantly attempt to headshot him with my Gauss rifle, yet again hitting his left arm as I add my lasers, which hit his centre torso.
I run behind a hill as I take some laser damage to the back, but nothing severe. I juke back around the corner, with the CLINK of a Gauss shell loading, and pot-shot into the Atlas. I hit his arm, again, and my lasers hit his arm as well â€“ an explosion rips out of him as his arm sails through the air. Itâ€™s not a lethal injury, but Iâ€™ll use what I can get.
As I fade back into the hills, the Atlas pilot manages an amazing turning shot where his AC-20 slams into the very front end of my gauss rifle, causing it damage, followed up by an SRM hit to it, my centre torso, and my left torso. His remaining lasers (those not lost to the arm) manage to hit my left leg and centre torso. Though I am now in cover, that exchange went worse than Iâ€™d hoped. I attempt to go around the hill, but as I come around the corner, there he is, aimed right at me. My Gauss destroys his LRM/SRMâ€™d left torso (really?) as I discover to my chagrin that this Atlas is not using an XL engine. In recompense, I lose my Gauss rifle and more right torso health. My medium lasers firing, I notice his entire centre torso is nearly black â€“ all that damage I did to the arm and torso has been adding inward, and heâ€™s ready to collapse. Time seems to slow as our weapons charge â€“ his arm-mounted large laser nears readiness, his AC-20 seems to whisper to me that it is about to fire. I feel, rather than see, his AC-20 round pass within centimetres of my head, the contrail behind it momentarily obscuring my view. I blindly fire into his core, at this point just lashing out, as an azure Large Laser beam sails through where my right arm was â€“ and then an explosion. The Atlas, cored, falls backward.
It seems all that combat had drastically overheated him, and his last â€˜overrideâ€™ cost him. I wanted to feel cheated, but watching his own ammo rock his â€™Mech apart I canâ€™t help but shout for joy.
And then, way off to my right, I see the Hunchback trying to encircle me, or at least capture my base. Our â€™Mechs look like theyâ€™re straight out of a demolition derby â€“ his with no right torso to speak of, a nearly destroyed right leg, and severe damage everywhere else. Me with one arm, two medium lasers and severe structural damage. So of course I charge around the hill straight at him.
At this point he is in my base capture zone, but we both know this is ending in a kill. I swing around the corner and fire at his leg, hoping to cripple him so I can fire from behind. His twin medium lasers attempt to finish the job on my centre torso, so I twist and turn to take fire on my less-damage left torso. My second blast of lasers collapses his leg, and throws his aim off. As I attempt to go behind him, my cockpit flashes WARNING: CRITICAL DAMAGE in an attempt to get me to retreat, make a better attack.
Of course I donâ€™t listen, and of course heâ€™s in the same situation. As my centre is now near black in health I know Iâ€™m likely done for, and a twin blast of lasers hits me, I assume Iâ€™m done for.
At this point, Iâ€™m just being stubborn.
I flick my crosshairs over him as I take that hit, and the jostling moves my lasers right over his cockpit. Destroying it.
VICTORY flashes across my screen as my near-dead Dragon watches the Hunchback fall lazily backwards.
A cry of â€˜What? No!â€™ rings in my ears as I slowly stand up, lift up my arms, and shout:
â€œOWNED!â€

This video frame grab provided by Alex Sheen of becauseisaidiwould.com shows Matthew Cordle. (Photo11: AP) Story Highlights Matthew Cordle could face a charge of aggravated vehicular homicide
Cordle admits being drunk when he crashed into a jeep on an Ohio interstate
The driver of the jeep, Vincent Canzani, was killed
An Ohio man whose YouTube confession drew more than 1.2 million views was indicted Monday on a felony charge of aggravated vehicular homicide and plans to plead guilty Tuesday, his lawyer said
Matthew Cordle, 22, admitted in the video posted Friday that he was drunk and driving the wrong way on I-670 near Columbus when he crashed into a jeep, killing its driver.
Franklin County prosecutor Ron O'Brien said Matthew Cordle's blood-alcohol level was 0.19% after the crash in June — more than twice the level at which a driver is presumed too drunk to drive.
Cordle's lawyer, George Breitmayer, said his client is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday. For technical reasons, Cordle must plead not guilty. Shortly thereafter, Breitmayer said, Cordle will change his plea to guilty.
Cordle's confession video went viral shortly after it was posted.
"My name is Matthew Cordle, and on June 22, 2013, I hit and killed Vincent Canzani," Cordle says. "This video will act as my confession. When I get charged, I will plead guilty and take full responsibility for everything I've done to Vincent and his family. ... I won't dishonor Vincent's memory by lying about what happened."
Cordle says in the video that after the crash, he spoke with "some high-powered attorneys" who told him that it might be possible to get his blood test thrown out. He said they told him "about similar cases where the drivers got off."
"All I would have to do is lie," he said. "I won't go down that path."
The grand jury also indicted Cordle on one misdemeanor count of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The charges could carry a prison sentence of up to 8½ years, O'Brien said.
O'Brien, in an email to USA TODAY, said his office will be seeking the maximum sentence due to the seriousness of the crime. Still, he said he was impressed by the video.
"When I viewed the video the first time -- and I would say every time since -- I found it to be a very compelling video that seemed to sincerely express genuine remorse," O'Brien said.
On the recording, Cordle says he "can't bring Mr. Canzani back. I can't erase what I've done," but "I beg you, and I say the word beg specifically, I'm begging you, please don't drink and drive."
Breitmayer said Cordle made the video against legal advice — proof that he did not post it to get a lighter sentence.
"He's the most remorseful client I've ever seen," Breitmayer said. He declined to suggest what sentence Cordle deserves.
"I think he should get strong consideration for his acceptance of responsibility," the lawyer said. "I won't say he doesn't deserve to do some time (in jail) because he does."

What bothers me the most is when someone spends a great deal of energy insisting that it is incredibly inappropriate to be called transgender, and they turn around and spit the label at others like it is a slur. If it is wrong for a person to be called transgender when they are transsexual, it should not be okay for that same person to throw the term at others who also identify as transsexual. When making the distinction between the two terms, I can see a variety of issues of personal experience, such as social transition, legal transition, medical transition, binary or non-binary identity, and so forth that some people may want to reference. But instead I keep hearing a bunch of litmus tests that don't properly address those distinctions.
Whenever I come upon part of the transgender vs transsexual arguments and fighting, I have an incredibly hard time. I think of myself as a post-transition transsexual woman, but I have no objection to being called transgender. Indeed all my friends when I came out used the term transgender, and practically every lay person I've ever heard use the term was only referring to people with a binary gender identity who have medically transitioned or seeks to (characteristics frequently attributed to transsexuals). I honestly have great trouble simply figuring out what the difference is.
The Litmus Test List
(Both personally overheard and collected from friends)
You're not a real transsexual woman if you haven't had vaginoplasty (the more generous version allows for women who haven't had vaginoplasty so long as they never give up on pursuing it)
You're not a real transsexual woman if you don't pass as a cis woman 100% of the time
You're not a real transsexual woman if you transitioned after 45 (or 35, or 25, or 18 depending on who you ask)
You're not a real transsexual woman if you ascribe to feminist gender deconstruction theory
You're not a real transsexual woman if you buy clothes in the men's department
You're not a real transsexual woman if mainstream transphobes wouldn't respect your gender if they somehow found out everything about your body and medical history
You're not a real transsexual woman if you didn't know - with certainty - from birth
You're not a real transsexual woman if you don't have a GI/GID diagnosis or can't afford the process to get one
You're not a real transsexual woman if you don't fit your therapist's definition of a "real" woman (no exceptions even if the only therapist in your area is incredibly sexist)
You're not a real transsexual woman if you are caught without makeup on

You're not a real transsexual woman if you ever pee standing up
You're not a real transsexual woman if you play sports (no exceptions for being on the women's rugby team, but maybe for softball)
Looking at this list all together, it is clear that no one can meet all these requirements and several are contradictory. Even many cis women would fail to meet these standards, which are ultimately based on what a "real" woman would do (One of my moms fails almost a dozen of these, not counting the trans specific ones of course).
Whether you see transsexualism as a birth defect or an extension of natural diversity, it stands to reason that if there is something non-transsexuals regularly do, then there will be some transsexuals who do it as well. There are cis women who get turned on by their lingerie, wear men's clothing because it's more comfortable, fuck with strap ons, sing odes to their cocks, have facial or body hair, and do practically everything on this list. Why wouldn't there be at least an occasional transsexual woman who does some of the same?
Honestly, when I was first coming out and my trans world consisted of less than a dozen people, "transsexual" was the word used by those telling me that I should go back into the closet if I didn't have an identical experience as they did. "Transgender" was the word used by those who offered me support as I was figuring things out regardless of what decisions I were to make. Of course I felt more solidarity with the transgender crowd.
However, as I started researching surgeons, puzzling over the legalities of surgeon letters and birth certificates, and struggling with doctors and insurance claims adjusters who had no clue how my body worked, I began to notice that the folks without those experiences were making very different decisions than I would.
I want gender neutral bathrooms for my friends, but I will use the women's room every time, meanwhile some activists in their zeal for gender neutral bathrooms would fight for policy that would allow employers to require all trans people to use an isolated gender neutral facility. And while I truly am grateful that passport rules have been changed, there is a selfish part of me is grumpy that I went through such incredible effort to update my passport and one year later it doesn't matter anymore (of course I'm not so selfish to complain and fight against such expansion of rights).
Alternatively, I've known other activists who would fight for policies allowing anyone to ask for ID before letting you in a public bathroom. I've heard people advocate requiring medical/legal documentation or even surgery before one can be covered under anti-discrimination law, with apparent lack of awareness for how it would affect those without money or the undocumented population. While I wouldn't personally be hurt by such policies, thoughts for my friends, my family, and even just plain social justice demand that I challenge them.
These are differences in experiences that are very important to identify and name and support those who push back against the erasure that happens when we are all lumped together under an umbrella. But as our umbrella splinters into sub-groups, it's important we recognize that we're not all using the same language to mean the same thing.
I've heard the exact same concept discussed in terms of genderqueer vs trans, transvestite vs transgender vs transsexual, binary vs non-binary, and so on. Ultimately, such words are only placeholders for our intended meaning and don't necessarily match up with the intended meanings of others.
They are also treated as mutually exclusive options when that really isn't the truth. While plenty of cissexual people deconstruct their experience of gender within binary expectations, engaging in such a thought exercise does not inoculate one against having a brain sex that does not match their assigned sex. As a result, there are plenty of people who are both transsexual and genderqueer. For another example, I know a good dozen or so trans men who love to wear panties and a corset in the privacy of their own bedroom (or a good dungeon), thus showing a perfect example of being transsexual and a transvestite at the same time.
I worry that as some of these debates are happening, the words are becoming more important than their meanings. And I worry that in the struggle for group autonomy, other concepts like individual identity and complexity are being trampled. I grew up with the mantra "Girls can do anything boys can do, don't let gender hold you back," and now I'm twisting it into "Trans women can do anything cis women can do." And no one can tell me that being a butch woman, finding creative solutions to my dysphoria during sex, or breaking any other rules makes me any less of a real transsexual.
8th episode of the third season of The Twilight Zone
"It's a Good Life" is episode 73 of the American television series The Twilight Zone. It is based on the 1953 short story "It's a Good Life" by Jerome Bixby and is considered by some, such as Time and TV Guide, to be one of the best episodes of the series. It originally aired on November 3, 1961.
Opening narration [ edit ]
“ Tonight's story on The Twilight Zone is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction. This, as you may recognize, is a map of the United States, and there's a little town there called Peaksville. On a given morning not too long ago, the rest of the world disappeared and Peaksville was left all alone. Its inhabitants were never sure whether the world was destroyed and only Peaksville left untouched or whether the village had somehow been taken away. They were, on the other hand, sure of one thing: the cause. A monster had arrived in the village. Just by using his mind, he took away the automobiles, the electricity, the machines—because they displeased him—and he moved an entire community back into the dark ages—just by using his mind. Now I'd like to introduce you to some of the people in Peaksville, Ohio. This is Mr. Fremont. It's in his farmhouse that the monster resides. This is Mrs. Fremont. And this is Aunt Amy, who probably had more control over the monster in the beginning than almost anyone. But one day she forgot. She began to sing aloud. Now, the monster doesn't like singing, so his mind snapped at her, turned her into the smiling, vacant thing you're looking at now. She sings no more. And you'll note that the people in Peaksville, Ohio has to smile. They have to think happy thoughts and say happy things because, once displeased, the monster can wish them into a cornfield or change them into a grotesque, walking horror. This particular monster can read minds, you see. He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion. Oh yes, I did forget something, didn't I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster. This is the monster. His name is Anthony Fremont. He's six years old, with a cute little-boy face and blue, guileless eyes. But when those eyes look at you, you'd better start thinking happy thoughts, because the mind behind them is absolutely in charge. This is the Twilight Zone. ”
Plot summary [ edit ]
Six-year-old Anthony Fremont has godlike mental powers, including mind-reading. He has isolated his town of Peaksville, Ohio from the rest of the universe. The people must thus grow their own food, and supplies of common household items, such as bar soap, have been dwindling. He has blocked television signals and caused cars not to work. He creates horrible creatures, such as three-headed gophers, which he then kills. He also turns the livestock into monsters, which he also kills. He also kills pets. Everybody is under his rule, even his parents. The people live in fear of him, constantly telling him how everything he does is "good," since he banishes anyone thinking unhappy thoughts to be buried in Peakesville's abandoned cornfield. Even the children are scared of him, after Anthony sent a boy and girl into the cornfield. Never having experienced any form of discipline, Anthony does not even understand that his actions are wrong, and is confused when his father tells him that the neighbors are reluctant to let their children play with him after he sent several of his playmates to the cornfield.
One night each week, Anthony gives the townsfolk one hour of television, which he creates and projects onto the family TV set. The adults gather around in the Fremonts' living room, squirming uncomfortably as Anthony shows them a vision of screaming dinosaurs, engaged in a gory battle. Unable to voice their real feelings, they tell Anthony that it was far better than what used to be on TV.
After the program is over, the adults celebrate Dan Hollis' birthday. He gets two presents from his wife: a bottle of brandy – which is one of only five bottles of whiskey left in the village – and a Perry Como record. Dan is eager to listen to the record, but he's reminded by everyone that Anthony does not like singing and he must listen to it at home. Getting drunk from the brandy, he starts complaining about the miserable state of the town, not listening to the record, and no one singing "Happy Birthday" to him. Anthony at first ignores him after telling him to be quiet. Dan eventually snaps with repressed rage surfacing and confronts the child, calling him a monster and a murderer. While Anthony's anger grows, Dan yells for someone to attack Anthony from behind and end his reign of terror. Aunt Amy (who isn't able to sing any more because of Anthony) tentatively reaches for a fireplace poker, but no one has the courage to act. Declaring Dan to be "a very bad man," Anthony transforms Dan into a jack-in-the-box, causing his wife to break down. The adults are horrified at what Anthony has done, and his father asks him to wish it into the cornfield, which he does.
Anthony causes snow to begin falling outside, because Aunt Amy complained about the day's heat earlier. The snow will kill off at least half the crops and the town will face starvation. Anthony's father starts to rebuke Anthony about this, but his wife and the other adults look on with worried smiles on their faces. The father then smiles and tells Anthony in a terrified voice, "...But it's good you're making it snow. A real good thing. And tomorrow... tomorrow's gonna be a... real good day!"
Closing narration [ edit ]
“ No comment here, no comment at all. We only wanted to introduce you to one of our very special citizens, little Anthony Fremont, age 6, who lives in a village called Peaksville, in a place that used to be Ohio. And, if by some strange chance, you should run across him, you had best think only good thoughts. Anything less than that is handled at your own risk, because if you do meet Anthony, you can be sure of one thing: you have entered The Twilight Zone. ”

Reception and legacy [ edit ]
Time named this the third-best Twilight Zone episode, behind "Time Enough at Last" and "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street".[1]
Rod Serling's map background intro which is seen at the beginning of this episode, was recycled and edited with a sound-alike voiceover artist to place him within the library preshow introduction for The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror attractions at Disney theme parks.[2] The library room also contains other numerous episode artifacts from The Twilight Zone TV series such as Serling's name engraved on a shelf, books titled with all the episode names from the series, and a broken pair of glasses from "Time Enough At Last," among many other things.
In 1997 TV Guide ranked the episode number 31 on its 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time list.[3]
The opening narration of this episode is sampled in "Threatened" by Michael Jackson in his 2001 album, Invincible.
Remake [ edit ]
In a 1974 interview with Marvel Comics, Rod Serling said "I'm on my third draft of a feature film based on Jerome Bixby's short story, 'It's a Good Life'. We did it originally on Twilight Zone but now we're doing a full-length version. Alan Landsburg, who produced Chariots of the Gods, is producing it. It's in the fantasy-horror genre."[4] This was one of Serling's last interviews before his death in 1975.
Twilight Zone: The Movie "It's a Good Life" segment is a remake of the original episode directed by Joe Dante
Pop Culture [ edit ]
This episode was also remade as a parody in The Simpsons episode "Treehouse of Horror II" in 1991.
The episode "Johnny Real Good" from Johnny Bravo is also based in this episode. Johnny has to babysit a boy named Timmy, who also has supernatural powers and sends Johnny several times to a nearby cornfield for "thinking bad thoughts".
The episode was referenced in an episode of American Dad!, "I Can't Stan You", where Stan listened in on his neighbors private conversations. Anyone who was heard criticizing him had their house seized by the CIA and was summarily banished to the Cornfield Motel.[5]
The episode inspired the opening episode of the fourth season of Black Mirror, "USS Callister" which is split between a Star Trek-like online game and the company developing the game.
The episode was referenced in Season 2, Episode 12 of “The Drew Carey Show” in which Drew enters his house and calls out for his parents. When they don't reply, he says “I must have wished them to the cornfield.”
Sequel [ edit ]
In the 2002 revival series, a sequel to this episode was broadcast, titled "It's Still a Good Life". In the episode, Anthony is a middle-aged man who now has a daughter Audrey who has inherited his powers.[6] Bill Mumy and Cloris Leachman reprised their roles from the original episode.[7] Anthony Fremont's daughter, Audrey, is played by actor Bill Mumy's real-life daughter Liliana Mumy.[7][8]
A commercial for Me-TV airing on that channel in 2015 features an adult Bill Mumy as adult Anthony intercut with scenes from the original episode, apparently interacting as the adult Anthony uses his powers to beam Me-TV to little Anthony's set. In early 2017, the network used clips from this episode in promos for the show's late-night reruns.

YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio - The Mahoning Coroner has not yet released details of how 14-year old Teddy Foltz died.
At a funeral service on Saturday, family and friends say they don't recognize the mother who police say is refusing to cooperate with the investigation into her son's death.
Friends who knew 32-year-old Shain Widdersheim say she changed after she began dating Zaryl Bush.
Bush is accused in the murder and rape of her son.
"I've spent time with her kids before she met him and that was her world, her children. That's what she led everybody to believe. That her kids were everything to her, and then I guess this man comes in and that's it," said Mollie Kloss.
Teddy's dad has set up the Teddy Foltz-Tedesco fund for prevention of child abuse. Contributions can be made at the PNC Bank on West Liberty Street in Hubbard.
A mother is facing jail time in Florida after ignoring a court order that requires her four-year-old son to be circumcised. Heather Hironimus shares custody with the boy's father, Dennis Nebus, and both parents initially agreed upon circumcision in a 2012 parenting plan. But she has since changed her mind, saying their son is scared of the procedure and doesn't consent.
Hironimus and her son have been staying at an undisclosed domestic violence shelter since February to avoid the order, but when she missed the Tuesday deadline, Judge Jeffrey Dana Gillen signed a warrant for her arrest—unless she hands over the child.
Nebus has said he wants his son to undergo a circumcision because it's “just the normal thing to do,” adding that the boy has a condition called phimosis that makes it difficult for him to retract his foreskin—a claim Hironimus denies.
Her lawyers have filed an emergency motion asking the court to allow the boy to undergo a mental evaluation to assess any potential emotional harm.
“This is not a situation where [the child] is a newborn; he is old enough to remember the procedure and what his body looked like before,” wrote lawyer Thomas Hunker. “Removal of part of the most private part of his body could emotionally scar [the child] for the rest of his life.”

Three Dutch World War Two ships considered war graves have vanished from the bottom of the Java Sea, the Dutch defence ministry says.
All three were sunk by the Japanese during the Battle of the Java Sea in 1942, and their wrecks were discovered by divers in 2002.
A report in the Guardian says three British ships have disappeared as well.
The British government says it is "distressed" by the reports and is investigating.
A new expedition to mark next year's 75th anniversary of the battle found the wrecks missing.
The Guardian says it has seen 3D images, showing large holes in the seabed where HMS Exeter, HMS Encounter, the destroyer HMS Electra, as well as a US submarine, used to be.
Experts say salvaging the wrecks would have been a huge operation.
The Dutch defence ministry is to investigate the mysterious disappearance.
In a statement, it said that two of its ships had completely gone, with sonar images only showing imprints, while large parts of a third ship, a destroyer, were missing.
"The desecration of a war grave is a serious offence," the ministry said.
The UK's Ministry of Defence confirmed that it had contacted the Indonesian authorities.
An MOD spokesperson said, "Many lives were lost during this battle and we would expect that these sites are respected and left undisturbed without the express consent of the United Kingdom."
Deep sea salvage: How to recover lost treasures of the deep
Theo Doorman, 82, son of legendary Rear Admiral Karel Doorman, who led the battle, was on the expedition which hoped to film the wrecks two weeks ago.
He said he could not believe his eyes when the sonar images came in, showing only a groove where his father's ship had been.
"I was sad," he said.
"Not angry. That doesn't get you anywhere. But sad. For centuries is a custom not to disturb sailors' graves. But it did happen here."

The Battle of the Java Sea
27 February 1942
Allied action to stop Japanese Navy
Dutch, British, Australian, US forces ships involved
Five cruisers and nine destroyers involved, Led by Rear-Admiral Karel Doorman
Only two ships remained
Vanished ships are HNLMS De Ruyter, HNLMS Java, and HNLMS Kortenaer
Defeat led to the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia)
The seas around Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia are a graveyard for hundreds of ships and submarines sunk during the war.
Illegal salvaging of the wrecks for steel, aluminium and brass has become commonplace.
But the three missing wrecks were located 100km (60 miles) off the coast of Indonesia, at a depth of 70m. Salvage operators say it would not be easy to lift them.
"It is almost impossible to salvage this," Paul Koole of the salvage firm Mammoet told the Algemeen Dagblad. "It is far too deep."
Experts say the operation would have needed large cranes for long periods of time and would be unlikely to have gone unnoticed.
The Indonesian Navy, when contacted by the BBC, said they were unaware of the disappearance but said they would investigate.
"To say that the wreckage had gone suddenly, doesn't make sense," Navy spokesman Colonel Gig Sipasulta said. "It is underwater activities that can take months even years."
The Dutch authorities have also notified the other countries that formed part of the international expedition: the UK, Australia and the US.
Public Acceptance Of Same-Sex Marriage At All-Time High
Two new polls reflect the extent to which public attitudes on same-sex marriage have changed dramatically over the past twenty years, and it's only a matter of time before that's reflected in the law.
Doug Mataconis · · 49 comments
In what is likely one of the most dramatic turnarounds in public cultural and social attitudes in quite sometime, we're seeing yet more evidence that public acceptance of same-sex marriage is now at points where it's the opponents of marriage equality who are soon likely to be in the minority.
First, a new Pew poll finds that public attitudes on same-sex marriage have moved consistently in favor of same-sex marriage:
The survey finds a continuing rise in support for same-sex marriage since 2009. Currently, 45% say they favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally while 46% are opposed. In Pew Research surveys conducted in 2010, 42% favored and 48% opposed gay marriage and in 2009, just 37% backed same-sex marriage while 54% were opposed.
Chart:
A different survey, the 2010 General Social Survey found similar dramatic shifts in public attitudes on same-sex marriage:
When you look at that graph, the shift is dramatic; in 1988, just 22 years ago, only 12% of Americans supported gay marriage. In 2010, it was 46%, with only 40% opposed. And it's even a big shift from 2008 to 2010: support went up seven points, and opposition trended downward seven points.
That's quite a dramatic shift over a period of 22 years, especially considering that during a portion of that time the gay rights movement had several major setbacks such as Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the Defense of Marriage Act, and the wave of state Constitutional Amendments barring same-sex marriage and civil unions that swept much of the nation during the early 2000's. Even victories were met with setbacks, as the California Supreme Court's decision permitting same-sex marriage was quickly followed by Proposition 8 which, despite polling early on showing that it would be defeated, ended up passing even in a Presidential election year when Democrats who might be sympathetic to the cause were more likely to vote
So, what accounts for the dramatic change in public attitudes over the past two decades? Partly, of course, is the fact that these numbers are reflecting the views of younger Americans, among whom issues like homosexuality have largely become a matter of everyday life. For many members of this generation, the idea that two people who care about each other can't form a legal relationship is likely a pretty foreign concept. In addition to that, though, I think the change in attitude reflects the fact that it's very easy to have judgmental, or prejudicial, attitudes, about people when you really don't know any of them It's the reason, for example, that many northern whites in the 1960s and 70s seemed to reflect the same racial attitudes as whites in the South even though they didn't live among large African-American populations. Over the past two decades, as public attitudes about homosexuality have become more accepting, people have come to realize that gays and lesbians don't necessarily fit the stereotypes that they were taught to believe in, and that they're no different than the rest of us. The implications of this are clear, thanks to these changing attitudes and demographic change, the social stigma against homosexuals has largely disappeared (except in relatively closed, religious populations) and the legal barriers to equality are quickly falling away.
Matthew Ygelasias looks at these numbers and posits:
Five years ago, if there were five Supreme Court justices who believed that marriage equality should be the law of the land, they'd still probably have shied away from saying so for fear of issuing a desperately unpopular decision on a hot-button subject. Today, not so much. And with the Obama administration now saying that DOMA should be subjected to “heightened scrutiny” it would seem to follow that all forms of marriage inequity also deserve said heightened scrutiny. Consequently, I think we may actually wind up having nationwide marriage equality sooner than people think as long as Justice Kennedy continues to be sympathetic to gay equity claims.
He may not be far off the mark. The Supreme Court may not be subject to electoral politics, but they clearly do pay attention to societal attitudes, and the fact that same-sex marriage in on the verge of being supported by a majority of Americans (if it isn't there already) may just be enough to persuade a wavering Justice (or two) to cast their vote in favor of marriage equality.
Star Wars Battlefront II Preview — I Have a Bad Feeling About This
Logan Moore October 10, 2017 9:00:14 AM EST
Star Wars Battlefront II's beta has left a bad taste in my mouth after seeing how the newly implemented loot crate system seeps into nearly every element of the game's multiplayer progression.
As someone who seems to be in the minority that loved 2015's Star Wars Battlefront, the game's sequel — Star Wars Battlefront II — has easily been one of my most anticipated games slated to release this fall. I was able to check out Battlefront II earlier this year at EA Play and came away quite impressed with the changes that had been implemented.
During the game's open and closed beta periods that took place over this past weekend, I expected to be even more impressed upon sinking a larger amount of time into the multiplayer. Unfortunately, I now have more concerns and reservations with Battlefront II than I would like to admit.
Like many others, my foremost issue with Battlefront II stems from the use of loot crates. Yes, a loot box system has invaded Battlefront II and the rewards that you can receive from these crates include new weapons, weapon modifications, and stat bonuses, to go along with some cosmetic rewards like character stances and more skins for Hero characters. If the beta is an indication of the full game, everything that you will need to alter your characters or equip new items will come randomly from these crates. That sucks.
The problems that many fans had with the 2015 Battlefront are understandable, but as someone who has poured almost 100 hours into the game, the one thing I really loved was the unlockables system — especially after the advent of Hutt Contracts.
Battlefront did a fantastic job of providing you with real challenges and goals in order to unlock new gear. It made me feel like I was working towards something worthwhile and oftentimes made me adapt to new playstyles. Loot crates, on the other hand, are just a crap shoot. Even when I would get a good pull from a crate in the beta, it was unsatisfying because I had done nothing other than have dumb luck.
What bothers me the most about the new loot crate system is the way in which Star Cards are tied to class progression. If you didn't already know, Battlefront II now has four classes that you choose from in multiplayer. Each class has its own unique set of Star Cards and your class level will increase as you earn more cards for that class. However, that means that if you have a preferred class that you enjoy playing as but you can't get any Star Cards for that class in your loot crates, then you're out of luck. The random nature at which you receive Star Cards means that you might consistently earn cards for classes that you don't even enjoy playing as leaving the classes that you do like at lower levels. There's no player choice.
“Knowing that I could spend thousands of credits in Battlefront II and still not get the specific Star Card or item that I desire is more than frustrating, it's a straight-up slap to my face.”
The larger concern that I (and I'm sure others) have with this system is that it might end up being “pay-to-win.” Those who are willing to spend real money to earn more of these Star Cards will have clear advantages out of the gate compared to those who try to progress naturally.
The only thing that would make me think otherwise is that most of the Star Cards I earned while playing the beta kind of sucked. While they would give me statistical boosts, their effects seemed minimal. This might change as you begin to upgrade the cards the more you play, but their stat increases initially seemed weak.
While I'm not sure if Battlefront II will necessarily be pay-to-win, I don't like the implementation of loot crates in any way. Despite the complaints that many had with 2015's Battlefront, I greatly enjoyed the weapons and cosmetics system that allowed players to freely purchase whatever it is they wanted, as long as they had the credits to spend. Knowing that I could spend thousands of credits in Battlefront II and still not get the specific Star Card or item that I desire is more than frustrating, it's a straight-up slap to my face. Loot crate systems like this don't respect the time investments that players make.
Loot crates aside, the gameplay and actual matches in the Battlefront II beta were a ton of fun. The new battle points system is a breath of fresh air compared to the tokens from the last Battlefront, and the core shooting mechanics feel relatively solid.
I had some minor issues with the aiming reticle not standing out well enough on my HUD, along with enemies blending in too well within the Naboo environment. The Naboo map as a whole I also didn't care for structurally, and I'm hoping that other maps within the full game will be more to my liking.
Starfighter Assault was a blast to play and the added features in this area of the game really stood out. Each match felt like it had more well-defined objectives compared to last time, and the larger variety of ships was much appreciated. The Starfighter mode in Battlefront was one that I didn't play very often, but I think this time around it could have a lot more staying power.
Another issue that I found dealt with balancing in the Galactic Assault game mode. In every single match that I played of this game type, the Separatist army lost. Currently, it seems far too easy to win as the Republic in this mode. It feels reminiscent of when Walker Assault felt unbalanced in the original beta for Battlefront in 2015. By launch, Walker Assault had appropriately been balanced and I'm hoping the same will happen this time around with Galactic Assault.
I still believe that Star Wars Battlefront II has the potential to be a fantastic game, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that the beta has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Certain issues like game balancing can probably be fixed ahead of launch, but the loot crate system as a whole is far too integral to the multiplayer experience. Despite the issues that were created with the season pass in the last Battlefront, I would've rather once again had a season pass for Battlefront II if it had prevented this dreadful system.
I'm still excited to check out the full release of Battlefront II on November 17, but the beta definitely makes me think that I might not be sticking around too long after launch.
Sitting at the front of a small room inside a nondescript building at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, Navy Lt. Aaron Kleinman was dressed in a uniform rarely seen on these grounds: On top of his gray suit, dress shirt and tie, Kleinman's head was covered by a kippah and his shoulders, torso and back were draped with a large, dark green and olive-colored military-style tallit.
Kleinman was leading a small explanatory prayer service on Sept. 25, the first day of Rosh Hashanah, part of a larger High Holy Days program for the camp's Jewish Marines. It was the first-ever High Holy Day program of its kind at this base, where nearly 40,000 service members work and live.
Kleinman serves as an Orthodox rabbi and chaplain in addition to his Navy rank, and on this day spoke of forgiveness by describing an experience involving his 9-year-old son, Mati, the eldest of his three children.
Mati, Kleinman told the group, has a habit that can make his father lose his cool. One year, at synagogue on the Shabbat preceding Rosh Hashanah, Kleinman said Mati approached him somewhat awkwardly and said, “I'm sorry. I'm really trying not to, but sometimes it's hard.”
As Kleinman spoke to the group, his emotions at the memory of his son's earnest words were evident. His congregation at this small breakout service included a female Marine, a former Navy pilot and his wife, a chaplain-in-training and his girlfriend, plus a young Jewish man who'd come as a guest from Los Angeles. Kleinman told the group: “God doesn't expect us to be perfect. He expects us to look at ourselves honestly and say, ‘I'm sorry. I'm really trying not to, but sometimes it's hard.' ”
That, Kleinman said with moist eyes, is what the High Holy Days are all about. We want to be better, or at least “want to be better.” But, he admitted, it's often hard and we need help. It's a message that can resonate with anyone during the High Holy Days, but maybe it strikes a particular chord for Jews in the military “who want a connection” in the midst of an environment that can be “spiritually corrosive,” as Kleinman wrote later in an email. “It is easy to feel tremendous distance from God [in the military],” he wrote.
Using Torah to teach leadership
Kleinman is one of only nine Jewish chaplains among the Navy's close to 800 active-duty clergy. He is also an expert marksman and former naval aviator, having served 14 years on active duty (including four years studying at the Naval Academy) before joining the reserves, then re-enlisting as clergy. As a result, Kleinman is just as fluent in the language of his fellow soldiers as that of Torah.
An avid reader of Pirkei Avot, or “Ethics of Our Fathers,” the Jewish compendium of ethical teachings from the sages, Kleinman, during a June tour of the base, referenced a quote, attributed to Hillel, that helps him explain why he felt drawn to chaplaincy: “In a place where there are no men, strive to be a man.”
“In a place where there are no leaders, strive to be that leader,” Kleinman said. “I got into this because there was a need, and no one else was stepping in.”
Lt. Eric Berman studies Torah with Lt. Aaron Kleinman, a rabbi, who is currently serving as a chaplain at Camp Pendleton.
Jews in the military are, in Kleinman's words, a “low density, high demand” faith group. There aren't tons of them (it is estimated that fewer than 5,000 are currently on active duty, of which 2,000 serve in the Navy) and they're spread out across the globe, wherever America's armed forces are stationed.
“You're talking all the major rivers, lakes and waterways in the continental U.S., all up and down the East and West Coast,” Kleinman said, listing the vast territory protected by America's sailors and Marines. “Hawaii, Okinawa, the Mediterranean — we now have a presence in Australia, Europe. That's a lot of area for nine Jewish chaplains to cover.” Kleinman's job includes the constant possibility of relocation — he goes wherever there is a need.
And, many servicemen and women could use a rabbi to lean on, particularly one like Kleinman, who has seen combat and understands the physical and mental demands of military life.
On an earlier visit to Pendleton on a scorching summer day, Kleinman's routine schedule seemed anything but routine to a civilian.
He socialized with Marines in the gym and those training in the Corps' martial arts program, then delivered the benediction at a change-of-command ceremony and observed a combat medical evacuation team's training mission at a site built to resemble a typical Middle Eastern desert village dotted with light-brown two-story structures, mirroring what an actual combat zone might be like.
Kleinman was 17 when he entered the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., in 1991. He served as a Navy pilot in both Iraq and Afghanistan and speaks with the authority and confidence of a fighter who has trained for and experienced combat.
The tone of his rabbinic teaching, as a consequence, sounds very different from that of a typical community rabbi. He's more deliberate, perhaps.
“If you strive for the good of the assembly, you should do so for the sake of heaven,” he said, sharing with a lunchtime Torah study group in June what he calls “Kleinman's version” of an excerpt from “Pirkei Avot.”
“Because if you're expecting gratitude or thanks, you're going to be sorely disappointed,” Kleinman said.
He says his combat days are behind him. These days, his work is to help the men and women at Pendleton — both Jews and non-Jews, alike — with their personal, emotional, familial and theological issues, all of which continually get tested by the demands of the life of a Marine.
From phonebooks to the Naval Academy
Drinking an iced coffee outside a Dunkin' Donuts at the base, Kleinman tried to explain why he felt compelled as a teenager to pursue the less-traveled path of enrolling at the United States Naval Academy.
He grew up just a few miles from Virginia's Naval Station Norfolk, a massive base a few hours south of Washington, D.C. His childhood was a mix of military ethos in a Jewish home where, as he put it, the expectation was, “The dumb ones became lawyers [and] the smart ones became doctors.”
His stepfather, who was in the Navy, had worked side jobs to help bring in extra money for the family. One of those jobs, Kleinman recalled, was delivering phonebooks. One day, Kleinman tagged along with his stepdad and three Navy buddies who were helping three women make their deliveries across Virginia Beach.
As Kleinman remembers that day, the women were moving slowly while they tried to figure out how and where to deliver the books. So his stepdad and the three sailors intervened, reading through the distribution list and, in 20 minutes, delivering a semi-trailer truck's worth of phone books.
“That kind of motivation, that kind of take-charge attitude, that kind of, ‘let's get the job done and cut through the nonsense,' was highly appealing to me,” Kleinman said.
As he neared high school graduation, and as his friends were looking at schools like the University of Virginia and the College of William & Mary, Kleinman instead applied to and was accepted by the Naval Academy.
At that time he was not a kippah-wearing Orthodox Jew, as he is now, but Kleinman said his fellow sailors in the Navy knew he was Jewish.
And in the military, what happens when people know you are a Jew?
“Mazel tov, you're a rabbi!” Kleinman said. “You represent Judaism, and you represent God, no matter how much or little you know.”
Being the “official expert on all things Jewish,” as the chaplain described his academic and active-duty experience, may not have been what put “rabbi” onto his list of possible post-combat careers — but it didn't bother him, either.
“I didn't have the language of kiddush ha Shem [sanctifying God's name] at the time,” Kleinman said, discussing his early days with the Navy, “but I understood very quickly that I represented Judaism as a whole to basically everybody who saw me.”
In 2000, Kleinman served aboard the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, piloting an E-2C Hawkeye—an $80-million aircraft that provides crucial communications and surveillance support against threats on the ground and in the air within enemy territory. He was deployed to help enforce “Operation Southern Watch,” which created a no-fly zone over the skies of southern Iraq to buffer Kuwait's northern border and to protect Iraqi Shiites from Saddam Hussein, the country's former Sunni dictator.

Two years later, in 2002, Kleinman shipped out on the USS John F. Kennedy, flying more than 60 missions, again on an E-2C Hawkeye—this time over Afghanistan as part of “Operation Enduring Freedom,” in which U.S. and coalition forces attempted to rout Al Qaeda and the Taliban following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States.
Kleinman would not elaborate on the substance of his missions, but he did say, when asked, that he had some “close calls” piloting the Hawkeye.
“There's not a carrier aviator who has not had close calls,” Kleinman said. “It's a dangerous job. No one goes through flight school without losing friends.”

It's rogue algo day in the markets today, which sounds rather as though the plot to The Fear Index has just become real, especially since the firm at the center of it all is called The Dark Knight, or something like that. At heart, however, is something entirely unsurprising: weird things happen when you get deep into the weeds of high-frequency trading, a highly-complex system which breaks in entirely unpredictable ways.
In fact, it's weirder than that: HFT doesn't just break in unpredictable ways, but works in unpredictable ways, too. Barry Ritholtz has an excerpt from Frank Partnoy's new book, Wait, all about an HFT shop in California called UNX:
By the end of 2007, UNX was at the top of the list. The Plexus Group rankings of the leading trading firms hadn't even mentioned UNX a year earlier. Now UNX was at the top, in nearly every relevant category… Harrison understood that geography was causing delay: even at the speed of light, it was taking UNX's orders a relatively long time to move across the country. He studied UNX's transaction speeds and noticed that it took about sixty-five milliseconds from when trades entered UNX's computers until they were completed in New York. About half of that time was coast-to-coast travel. Closer meant faster. And faster meant better. So Harrison packed up UNX's computers, shipped them to New York, and then turned them back on. This is where the story gets, as Harrison put it, weird. He explains: “When we got everything set up in New York, the trades were faster, just as we expected. We saved thirty-five milliseconds by moving everything east. All of that went exactly as we planned.” “But all of a sudden, our trading costs were higher. We were paying more to buy shares, and we were receiving less when we sold. The trading speeds were faster, but the execution was inferior. It was one of the strangest things I'd ever seen. We spent a huge amount of time confirming the results, testing and testing, but they held across the board. No matter what we tried, faster was worse.” “Finally, we gave up and decided to slow down our computers a little bit, just to see what would happen. We delayed their operation. And when we went back up to sixty-five milliseconds of trade time, we went back to the top of the charts. It was really bizarre.”
Partnoy has a theory about what's going on here — something about “optimizing delay”. But that sounds to me more like ex-post rationalization than anything which makes much intuitive sense. The fact is that a lot of the stock-trading world, at this point, especially when it comes to high-frequency algobots, operates on a level which is simply beyond intuition. Pattern-detecting algos detect patterns that the human mind can't see, and they learn from them, and they trade on them, and some of them work, and some of them don't, and no one really has a clue why. What's more, as we saw today, the degree of control that humans have over these algos is much more tenuous than the HFT shops would have you believe. Knight is as good as it gets, in the HFT space: if they can blow up this badly, anybody can.
I frankly find it very hard to believe that all this trading is creating real value, as opposed to simply creating ever-larger tail risk. Bid-offer spreads are low, and there's a lot of liquidity available on a day-to-day basis, but it's very hard to put a dollar value on that liquidity. Let's say we implemented a financial-transactions tax, or moved to a stock market where there was a mini-auction for every stock once per second: I doubt that would cause measurable harm to investors (as opposed to traders). And it would surely make the stock market as a whole less brittle.
It's worth recalling what Dave Cliff and Linda Northrop wrote last year:
The concerns expressed here about modern computer-based trading in the global financial markets are really just a detailed instance of a more general story: it seems likely, or at least plausible, that major advanced economies are becoming increasingly reliant on large-scale complex IT systems (LSCITS): the complexity of these LSCITS is increasing rapidly; their socio-economic criticality is also increasing rapidly; our ability to manage them, and to predict their failures before it is too late, may not be keeping up. That is, we may be becoming critically dependent on LSCITS that we simply do not understand and hence are simply not capable of managing.
Today's actions, I think, demonstrate that we've already reached that point. The question is whether we have any desire to do anything about it. And for the time being, the answer seems to be that no, we don't.

By Erik Kirschbaum BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will add a record of up to 3 gigawatt (GW) of photovoltaic capacity this year due to unexpectedly strong demand in the final months of 2009, the head of Germany's BSW solar industry association said on Monday.
Carsten Koernig told Reuters the late surge would take the forecast past last month's increase to 2.5 GW from 2 GW.
“We're all surprised by how strongly demand is picking up now,” the BSW managing director said, adding the fourth quarter was especially robust due to pent-up demand from the easing of the financial crisis and fear of looming changes in German laws.
Lower prices have also attracted investors, he said.
“It looks like we'll end up with 2.5 to 3 GW for 2009,” he added. “It's still too early to say if it will be closer to 3 or 2.5. It'll be well over 2.5. But it won't be over 3 GW simply because there isn't enough capacity. We're already at the limit.
Germany, the world's leader in photovoltaic which turns sunlight into electricity, had 5.3 GW installed at the end of 2008, including a previous record 1.6 GW added in 2008.
That was about a third of the world's total of 15 GW. Three GW installed this year would produce as much power as three large coal-burning plants or three nuclear power plants.
Spain installed a record 2.5 GW last year. But demand dropped sharply in Spain due to a cap on state support that also caused prices worldwide to fall due to overcapacity.
The slumping prices have hurt some companies. Two of the two biggest — Q-Cells and Conergy — both posted third quarter losses but aim to return to profit in 2010.
FALLING PRICES LIFTS DEMAND
Koernig said many companies in Germany have reached capacity limits and that demand for equipment such as inverters has far outstripped supply. He said he expected the strong demand to continue into 2010.
German group SMA Solar Technology, which makes inverters, last week raised its 2009 guidance for the second time.
Koernig said falling prices for PV systems that had exceeded the decline in state-mandated feed-in tariffs was a key reason for the strong growth in 2009 after the economic crisis slowed the sector's growth in the first half.
He said fears that Chancellor Angela Merkel's newly elected government might accelerate the scheduled cuts to feed-in tariffs contributed to the end of the year rush, even though it now appears unlikely there will be major changes in the law.
“Our member companies report lower prices are attracting investors,” Koernig said. “There's also some who have long thought about investing in it but are pulling those plans forward now due to fears the laws would be changed.”
Koernig said Germany's feed-in tariffs would decline, as already scheduled, by about 10 percent in 2010.
“We're now confident the government does not want to endanger the sector and any adjustments to the law will be minor,” Koernig said. “The government sent us an important signal that they're still counting on renewable energy.”

Dexter Filkins has long been a skeptic and critic of the Iraq war, from his tenure at the New York Times to his current assignment at the New Yorker. Still, that hasn't kept Filkins from reporting honestly on developments in the theater; in 2008, while at the NYT, he wrote extensively about the success of the surge just a few months before the presidential election. A month later, Filkins wrote again about the “literally unrecognizable” and peaceful Iraq produced by the surge. Six years later, Filkins was among the skeptics reminding people that the Iraqis' insistence on negotiating the immunity clause for American troops was more of a welcome excuse for Obama to choose total withdrawal — and claim credit for it until this year — rather than the deal-breaker Obama now declares that it was.
Yesterday, Filkins told Hugh Hewitt that while one can argue whether the 2003 invasion was ill-advised, the total withdrawal in 2011 was the worst strategic mistake made by the US:
HH: And on that point, Dexter Filkins, you're a very wide open critic of the Bush war, the never ending war, your first book. But buried in this article, not buried but in the middle of it, is a conversation with Mohammed Ghafar, a 28 year old soldier who said the army never functioned as well as he had hoped, and it grew much worse after 2011. He had respected the professionalism of the Americans, the training they offered, but, “Everything changed after the Americans left. The commanders steal everything, they sell it in the local market. It is true the absentee rate soared, the rations went bad.” In other words, America leaving in 2011 may have been the worst strategic decision of many bad strategic decisions over the last ten years. DF: It's hard to conclude otherwise, you know, because that little, that quote from that deserter that I talked to in Kirkuk, I mean, you can almost say the same thing for all of Iraq. We left, the United States left in 2011. We went to zero, and we left. I mean, we packed up and left. So when you drive around Baghdad now, there is not a trace that the United States was ever there, and I mean apart from the American weapons, but in terms of like American presence and projects and guidance, gone. And I think that we spent almost a decade there. We paid with a lot of lives and a lot of blood, and building, essentially, rebuilding the Iraqi state that we destroyed. And I don't think it was ready. I mean, it just wasn't ready to function on its own. And it couldn't function without us. And actually, Ambassador Crocker, who was on your show, had a really good description of it. He said you know, we build ourselves into the hard drive of the place, and so we, the United States, were the honest broker. We were the only people that could sort of bring all the Iraqi factions together, and then we left. You know, and so the thing doesn't work without us. And you can see that in Iraq at a micro level, like when I talked to that deserter, who said as soon as the Americans left, the commanders started stealing all the money and everybody left, and everything fell apart. Or you can see it at the macro level. I mean, that's what's happened to the Iraqi state.
It's not the first time Filkins has reminded us about this. Last April, Filkins laid out the cost on the ground for leaving a power vacuum in Iraq:
“We used to restrain Maliki all the time,” Lieutenant General Michael Barbero, the deputy commander in Iraq until January, 2011, told me. “If Maliki was getting ready to send tanks to confront the Kurds, we would tell him and his officials, ‘We will physically block you from moving if you try to do that.' ” Barbero was angry at the White House for not pushing harder for an agreement. “You just had this policy vacuum and this apathy,” he said. “Now we have no leverage in Iraq. Without any troops there, we're just another group of guys.” There is no longer anyone who can serve as a referee, he said, adding, “Everything that has happened there was not just predictable—we predicted it.” Indeed, months before the election, American diplomats in Iraq sent a rare dissenting cable to Washington, complaining that the U.S., with its combination of support and indifference, was encouraging Maliki's authoritarian tendencies. “We thought we were creating a dictator,” one person who signed the memo told me. Less than twenty-four hours after the last convoy of American fighters left, Maliki's government ordered the arrest of Vice-President Tariq al-Hashemi, the highest-ranking Sunni Arab. Prosecutors accused Hashemi of having run a death squad that assassinated police officers and government officials. The practice was not uncommon at the time. “During the civil war, many political leaders in Iraq had death squads,” a former Western diplomat said. “Maliki started using the security forces to go after his rivals.” In moving against Hashemi, Maliki was signalling that he intended to depose his sectarian rivals. Hashemi flew to the Kurdish region, in northern Iraq, where officials offered to protect him. Seven of his bodyguards were arrested, the first of sixty. Only a few days earlier, in a press conference at the White House to mark the end of the American war, President Obama had praised Maliki as “the elected leader of a sovereign, self-reliant, and democratic Iraq.” When Hashemi fled, American officials did not publicly protest. Three months later, he was convicted in absentia and sentenced to death; he remains in exile. With the expulsion of Hashemi, Maliki began an aggressive campaign to crack down on dissent—especially Sunni dissent—and to centralize authority in his office. In the following months, he forced out a number of senior officials, notably Sinan al-Shabibi, the governor of the Central Bank, who had tried to stop him from diverting Iraq's foreign reserves into the government's operating budget. After the inconclusive 2010 election, the chairman of the Independent Election Commission was arrested. When the Integrity Commission uncovered a network in Maliki's cabinet that was issuing government contracts to fake companies, he blocked the prosecutions; soon afterward, the commission's director was replaced with a Maliki ally. In addition, Maliki created the Office of the Commander-in-Chief, which gave him personal control over the country's million-man Army and police force, often requiring local commanders to report directly to him. As Maliki gathered power, he set out to banish every trace of Sunni influence from the bureaucracy. One of the places he began was the Iraqi National Intelligence Service. The director was an imposing former general named Mohammed Shawani, a Sunni whose three sons had been tortured to death by Saddam's men. In August, 2009, Shawani told me, he went to Maliki with an intelligence report that detailed insurgents' plans for attacks on several government offices. The Prime Minister brushed off his warnings, he said. (Maliki denied this, saying, “It is impossible to believe Shawani.”) Two days later, a wave of car bombs struck the Finance Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, and other government targets, killing a hundred Iraqis and wounding more than five hundred. Shawani fled to the United States. “I knew I had to leave,” he told me. “I thought I was next.” In the following several months, according to Shawani and former American officials, Maliki purged the service of nearly all its Sunni agents and analysts, some five hundred in total. “It's essentially a Shiite organization now,” Shawani said.
Now the US wants to woo the Sunnis back into a coalition with Baghdad, but without putting American troops back into position as a guarantor of access. Filkins wonders what the American strategy is for victory against ISIS in Iraq. If it's just air power, Filkins says, it won't work:
DF: Well, yeah. I mean, I think the trick there, or the trouble is we're not there. You know, we're not on the ground. And so we've kind of seen this movie before. And you just alluded to it. And you know, during the Iraq war, the American war in Iraq, al Qaeda became the strongest insurgent group. And al Qaeda's just a precursor to ISIS. And in fact, it's the very same people. It's basically the guys we didn't kill. And you know, the Iraqis didn't like them, and they rebelled against them, and they rebelled against the harsh kind of medieval religion that they're imposing on everybody. They were offended by their brutality. And what did they do? They went to the Americans, and they said look, we'll tell you where they live, let's make a deal. And that was one of the great turning points of the war. And I think that there's a pretty good chance that's going to happen again, because I just don't think the Iraqis are going to buy it. But the problem is that the United States isn't there anymore, and so you don't have that kind of firepower to take care of these guys. And what have you got? I mean, you've got the Iraqi Army, which you know, we've seen what they're like. I mean, they're a joke. And so I think, and if you couple that with the hatred that the Sunni Arabs have for the Maliki government, it's tough. So the plan, I think, the White House plan is just to do it from the sky. And they can kill a lot of people from the air. But in the end, I mean, what's the end stage?
And we may be about to make the same mistake twice:
HH; Let me ask you, Dexter, you've spent a lot of time in Afghanistan as well. I had dinner last night with a Marine Corps major just back from Leatherneck, just finished his eight months there. He's going home, he's a reservist, and I don't want to quote him. It's just, I think we're doing this again. DF: Yeah. HH: We're going to see a replay of the collapse in Afghanistan of what we've seen in Iraq. Do you agree with that? DF: You know, I have spent a lot of time in Afghanistan. And I'm worried that you have essentially the same problem, which is a very fragile state in Afghanistan that basically we've built, and it doesn't work that well, and it doesn't work without us. And what that means, it doesn't work without us, yes. You know, it's just, and if we take the training wheels off, which is to say we leave, and we leave abruptly, I think we're supposed to go to zero within a couple of years, yeah. I mean, I think there's a great danger that you're going to see something on the order of what's happening now in Iraq.
Be sure to listen to it all.
According to ESPN's Keith Law (Insider link), the Houston Astros have the number one ranked farm system in Major League Baseball. Considering that the Astros have only ranked first in negative categories in recent years, this recent development should come as welcome news to Houston fans.
However, to be fair, this is not a “recent development.” The Astros have been shrewd businessmen in the last couple years and while the results have been horrendous on the field, good times appear to be on their way. Houston has used its recent futility to use their high draft picks to stock their farm system with young talent, from position players to pitchers.
The 2012 number one overall draft pick, nineteen-year shortstop is ranked as the 8th best prospect by MLB.com. Top pick in the 2013 draft, right-handed starter Mark Appel is ranked 17th. There are five other Astros ranked in the top 70 and the Astros already have some good young talent on their active roster.
Brett Oberholtzer, Josh Zeid, and Jarred Cosart all contributed in their stints as pitchers last season and will look to have a full season worth of work in 2014. Outfielder Robbie Grossman and third baseman Matt Dominguez also showed promise in 2013.
The Astros have lost an astounding 324 games in the last three seasons and in 2013 they were defeated 111 times. These are lean times in Houston and it probably won't be much better in 2014, but good times are just around the corner.
The world's first robotic operation inside an eye has been performed by British surgeons at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital. This could mean revolutionary changes for the healthcare industry and the ocular surgery in particular. The patient who underwent the groundbreaking operation was 70-year old, associate priest, Father William Beaver of St Mary the Virgin Church in Oxford. Following the procedure, Father Beaver said that his eyesight was returning. Previously the priest had been experiencing distorted vision that was described as “looking in a hall of mirrors at a fairground.”
“We have just witnessed a vision of eye surgery in the future. Professor Robert MacLaren, Nuffield Laboratory of Opthalmology”
Father Beaver suffered from a condition that left him with a membrane growing on the surface of his retina, pulling it into an uneven shape and affecting his vision considerably. The procedure would fix this by removing the membrane from the retina. Normally the procedure would be carried out by hand by very skilled surgeons, but experts say that robots could complete these high precision tasks much easier than a human can. So, in this innovative procedure, the surgeons used a joystick and touchscreen to control the robot on the outside of the eye while an operating microscope allowed them to monitor its progress.
This operation was a world first regarding surgeons using a device that could achieve the 3-D precision needed to carry out the procedure. The surgeon to complete the procedure was Professor Robert MacLaren, and when asked about the procedure he stated, “This will help to develop novel surgical treatments for blindness, such as gene therapy and stem cells, which need to be inserted under the retina with a high degree of precision.”
Further tests are continuing, and the current trial involves 12 patients, all undergoing operations with increasing difficulty. First, the robot peels membranes off the retina without damaging it. Next, if the first part is successful, the robot will be used to inject fluid through a fine needle under the retina. The team is hopeful that these procedures could lead to more robots being used in retinal gene therapy, which is currently being trialed across the world as a new treatment for blindness.

Januar 2016 - I ZR 65/14 - Freunde finden Der unter anderem für das Wettbewerbsrecht zuständige I. Zivilsenat hat heute entschieden, dass die mithilfe der Funktion "Freunde finden" des Internet-Dienstes "Facebook" versendeten Einladungs-E-Mails an Personen, die nicht als "Facebook"-Mitglieder registriert sind, eine wettbewerbsrechtlich unzulässige belästigende Werbung darstellen. Der I. Zivilsenat hat weiter entschieden, dass "Facebook" im Rahmen des im November 2010 zur Verfügung gestellten Registrierungsvorgangs für die Funktion "Freunde finden" den Nutzer über Art und Umfang der Nutzung von ihm importierter Kontaktdaten irregeführt hat. Der Kläger ist der Bundesverband der Verbraucherzentralen und Verbraucherverbände in Deutschland. Die in Irland ansässige Beklagte betreibt in Europa die Internet-Plattform "Facebook". Der Kläger nimmt die Beklagte wegen der Gestaltung der von ihr bereit gestellten Funktion "Freunde finden", mit der der Nutzer veranlasst wird, seine E-Mail-Adressdateien in den Datenbestand von "Facebook" zu importieren, und wegen der Versendung von Einladungs-E-Mails an bisher nicht als Nutzer der Plattform registrierte Personen auf Unterlassung in Anspruch. Der Kläger sieht in dem Versand von Einladungs-E-Mails an nicht als Nutzer der Plattform registrierte Personen eine den Empfänger belästigende Werbung der Beklagten im Sinne von § 7 Abs. 1 und 2 Nr. 3 UWG*. Er macht ferner geltend, die Beklagte täusche die Nutzer im Rahmen ihres Registrierungsvorgangs in unzulässiger Weise darüber, in welchem Umfang vom Nutzer importierte E-Mail-Adressdateien von "Facebook" genutzt würden. Das Landgericht hat der Klage stattgegeben. Die Berufung ist ohne Erfolg geblieben. Der Bundesgerichtshof hat die Revision der Beklagten zurückgewiesen. Einladungs-E-Mails von "Facebook" an Empfänger, die in den Erhalt der E-Mails nicht ausdrücklich eingewilligt haben, stellen eine unzumutbare Belästigung im Sinne des § 7 Abs. 2 Nr. 3 UWG dar. Die Einladungs-E-Mails sind Werbung der Beklagten, auch wenn ihre Versendung durch den sich bei "Facebook" registrierenden Nutzer ausgelöst wird, weil es sich um eine von der Beklagten zur Verfügung gestellte Funktion handelt, mit der Dritte auf das Angebot von "Facebook" aufmerksam gemacht werden sollen. Die Einladungs-E-Mails werden vom Empfänger nicht als private Mitteilung des "Facebook"-Nutzers, sondern als Werbung der Beklagten verstanden. Durch die Angaben, die die Beklagte im November 2010 bei der Registrierung für die Facebook-Funktion "Freunde finden" gemacht hat, hat die Beklagte sich registrierende Nutzer entgegen § 5 UWG** über Art und Umfang der Nutzung der E-Mail-Kontaktdaten getäuscht. Der im ersten Schritt des Registrierungsvorgangs eingeblendete Hinweis "Sind deine Freunde schon bei Facebook?" klärt nicht darüber auf, dass die vom Nutzer importierten E-Mail-Kontaktdaten ausgewertet werden und eine Versendung der Einladungs-E-Mails auch an Personen erfolgt, die noch nicht bei "Facebook" registriert sind. Die unter dem elektronischen Verweis "Dein Passwort wird von Facebook nicht gespeichert" hinterlegten weitergehenden Informationen können die Irreführung nicht ausräumen, weil ihre Kenntnisnahme durch den Nutzer nicht sichergestellt ist.
