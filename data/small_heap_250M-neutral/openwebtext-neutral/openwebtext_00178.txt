Men have been taking to Twitter to share their observations on married life
With marriage comes a whole host of rules you didn't know about it - and arguments over who should do the housework.
At least, that's according to these husbands who have been sharing their experiences of married life in a series of hilarious tweets shared on Imgur.
From fighting over the duvet to knowing the correct guest towels to use, these men lay bare the reality of what happens when the honeymoon period is over.

Men have been taking to Twitter to share their observations on married life (stock picture)
One man shared their desperate attempt to get out of the housework; for another husband the honest answer is not always the right one
Grant Tanaka shared their desperate attempt to get out of the housework by changing their mind multiple times on which room they were in the house.
They wrote: 'Txt from wife: where r u Me:kitchen Wife:can u feed cat M: I mean garage W:bring in laundry M:bathroom W:clean toilet M: Idaho W:get potatos'.
Meanwhile, for Twitter user Exploding Unicorn the honest answer is not always the right one.
They wrote: 'Relationship status: My wife asked me what I wanted for dinner and then told me I was wrong.'
One husband certainly enjoys playing pranks on their wife; while another likes to play up their immaturity
One husband certainly enjoys playing pranks on their wife. Abe Yospe wrote: 'When my wife falls asleep in a public place, I shake them a little and yell "DON'T YOU DIE ON ME!"
'People always clap when they wake up'.
Immaturity is definitely an issue for one man's wife, who joked: 'My wife said I need to grow up. I was speechless.
'It's hard to say anything when you have 45 gummy bears in your mouth'.
Two husbands found ways to sum up marriage in just a single sentence.
Zack wrote 'I was just about to do that chore that I see you're starting now', while KC of TX simply tweeted: 'You pee too loud'.
Meanwhile, these men found ways to sum up their marriages in just a couple of lines
Josh Hara came up with this analogy for their relationship with their wife: 'Marriage is like coffee. First it's really hot. Then it's just right. Then it helps you get off your ass and do things.'
And Sammy Rhodes made this observation: '99% of marriage is waiting in the car for your spouse'.
The constant use of puns by husbands to annoy their wives is another theme that came up in the tweets.
Twitter user Nice Eric joked: 'THERAPIST: what's the problem? WIFE: they replace words with animal names just to annoy me
The constant use of puns by husbands to annoy their wives is another theme that came up in the tweets
'ME: I don't do it on porpoise'.
In a similar vein, Andy H recalled a conversation in which their wife told them they hated 'the constant star wars puns'. They replied: 'Divorce is strong with this one'.
Grocery shopping is the root of the problem for some couples.
In one funny husband fail, Rodney Lacroix said they told their wife they spent half as much as them on the groceries. Two hours later, they told her: 'We have nothing to eat in this house'.
Meanwhile, Just Bill joked: 'If my wife ever hired a private detective to follow me, it would be to get pictures of me not using the coupons I said I used'.
Grocery shopping is the cause of the problem for some couples, including these men
Fighting over the duvet was the cause of arguments for another couple. Mark wrote: 'NEWLYWED: let's share everything. VETERAN SPOUSE: your knee was on my side of the bed last night'.
Another man recalled getting into the trouble for a bad dream their wife had. They say they woke up in the middle of the night, demanding that they apologise for what they did in the dream.
But for another Twitter user, their own daydreaming was the problem. They wrote: 'Wife: What are you thinking about?
'Me: *pauses daydream about zombin ninjas fighting cyborg Nazis from the future* You'.
Meanwhile, Simon Holland wrote: 'When my wife asks me to do that one thing in the bedroom that they really likes, she's talking about vacuuming'.
Fighting over the duvet was the cause of an argument for another couple, while for one man it was their wife's bad dream that got them into trouble
The debate over just how painful childbirth really is been the source of debate for Kent Graham and their wife.
They tweeted: 'When I awoke from the car accident in a full bodycast, my wife was right at my bedside to let me know that child birth is still more painful.'
In another observation about marriage, Kent wrote: 'I don't understand how God can have Ten Commandments for the whole world, and my wife can have 152 just for our house'.
Meanwhile, Troy Johnson added: 'Marriage is mostly about knowing which hand towels you can use and which ones are for the better people who visit your wife's home'.
And another husband says they can't get a word in in their marriage. They tweeted: 'The Mrs and I have been married so long they can finish my sentences.
'She also starts most of them and supplies the middle parts too'.
Falling food production
Global food production will also be hit. Corn, rice and wheat harvests are all expected to shrink thanks to lower net rainfall around the planet.
According to one study, 6 percent of wheat-farming areas, including parts of Russia and Argentina, will actually benefit from extra precipitation. But that will be more than canceled out with harvests hurt by less rain in 22 percent of wheat-growing lands, including Australia, Mexico and parts of the United States and China.

Even the supply of fish meal, used to feed livestock, is likely to plunge. Peru and Chile, which together produce roughly half the world's fish meal, will see the huge anchovy shoals that they plunder shrink.
Indeed, it was Peruvian fishermen who gave El Niño, Spanish for "the boy," its name, as the phenomenon typically hits South American waters in December, when Jesus Christ was born.
The fish will flee the warmer waters, heading deeper and farther south. They will also disperse, making it much harder for trawlers to suck them up from the oceans.
That means Peru's 2014 annual anchovy catch is likely to fall from 6 million to 4 million tons, says Luis Icochea, of Lima's National Agrarian University.
The Peruvian fishing industry will thus see its fishmeal revenue fall by around $200 million this year if the weather front arrives. "It would be worse if it weren't for rising prices compensating for lower production," says Icochea.
The one silver lining when it comes to El Niño's effect on global food supply is that soybean harvests may increase. That's thanks to increased rainfall in the US, Argentina and Brazil, three of the quartet of nations that dominate global supply.
Touring in Australia, Al was inspired. With some metric manipulation, they realized, “Born This Way” could become “Perform This Way,” and the song could be rewritten to parody Gaga's outlandish glam. It was a fun idea: an anthemic statement about Gaga's genre of anthemic statements. Weird Al had an album coming out in a few months, though, and they had to write the parody fast. So (at least according to an account they gave to The New York Times), on the same night the thought occurred to him, they wrote the parody's lyrics.
Weird Al did something else, too, that they always do when writing a new parody. That is, their people got in touch with Gaga's people. They wanted the new lyrics to have their blessing. While fair use permits Al to create and release any spoof—parodies are expressly protected in U.S. law—he's always sought an artist's permission first.
Gaga's people said they needed to hear the song. Al thought this sounded strange—it was their song!—but they rushed through a recording. They recorded it. They sent it to them.
They said no.
Gaga said no.
Or, at least, that's what Al was told. They uploaded “Perform This Way” to YouTube with a sad, somewhat confused explanation. They wanted to release the song on their upcoming album, they said, but without Gaga's blessing they wouldn't.
But what YouTube wrought! As print and online outlets alike rushed to cover the parody, Gaga's people announced they were in the wrong. Them manager had declined the parodist without ever running “Perform This Way”'s existence by Gaga herself. They more than approved the song, they loved it. “Perform This Way” could appear on the album Alpocalype, released that June.
Pop was saved.
Looking back, the parable seems the epitome of 2011-ness. There's Gaga, there's buzz about a song posted to YouTube!, there's a flurry of articles in the wake of both. (Some things, I suppose, have yet to change.)
There's something redeeming about the whole episode, too. Web technology permits what wouldn't have otherwise been possible. YouTube let Weird Al announce and distribute “Perform This Way” for free, delivering it to middle-schoolers and Gaga themselves alike. Weird Al relied on YouTube, placed themselves in the role of the lone amateur, and brought about a better mass-cultural outcome. Produced pop goes online, professional borrows the tool of amateur, and everyone seems to win.
* * *
But perhaps the best evidence of Al's membership in entertainment's ancien regime is this: Just as it feels a little odd to academically, familial-ly, call Elvis “Presley”—he's Elvis, like Ringo's Ringo—we're on a first-name, broadcast-intimate basis with Al. It feels disrespectful to call them “Yankovic,” like we don't get the joke somehow. The Economist can call them Yankovic. To us, he's Al—like Beyoncé's properly Beyoncé.
No wonder, then, that this week Al has mimicked the tactics of the preeminent Knowles. From last Monday to this upcoming one, they released a new music video every day, eight videos in total. There are few songs on their new album that will lack a video, meaning that, in medium and marketing, he's pulling a sort of time-extended Yoncé.
“We've demonstrated through the steps we've taken already, the pre-1994 levels, because of that technology — we can burn coal in clean fashion.”
“I think that we've done it better than anybody in the world at burning coal clean, in a clean fashion. The innovative and technological advances that we've seen, along with natural gas production and generating electricity, it all contributed to a CO2 footprint that's pre-1994.”
“As I indicated earlier, we are pre-1994 levels, and do you know why? Largely because of innovation and technology, hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, because there's been a conversion to natural gas in the generation of electricity.”
— Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, interview on “Fox News Sunday,” April 2, 2017
During this interview, Pruitt mentioned four times that carbon emissions in the United States are back down to pre-1994 levels. They used this factoid to deflect repeated questions by host Chris Wallace on the health implications of carbon dioxide emissions and how Pruitt intends to reduce carbon emissions without the Obama-era Clean Power Plan. Environmentalists and climate-change skeptics alike criticized Pruitt's performance on the show, saying they failed to answer questions from Wallace.
Pruitt said additional regulation is unnecessary because carbon emissions have already been reduced to pre-1994 levels. They attributed the decline to a host of nonregulatory efforts, including the ability for factories to use technology to “burn coal in clean fashion.”
What are they talking about?
The Facts
The Clean Power Plan, a flagship environmental regulatory rule of the Obama administration, proposes to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. It is on hold while under litigation.
President Trump has started rolling back Obama-era environmental protections, including directing federal regulators to rewrite federal rules to reduce carbon emissions.
The Environmental Protection Agency did not respond to our requests for comment, but data from the agency and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) confirm that total carbon dioxide emissions in 2015 were down to pre-1994 levels. Carbon emissions gradually increased after 1994 and peaked in 2007, and they have been declining since.
Coal carbon emissions have generally declined since 2007, while natural gas carbon emissions have increased since 2009.
[Update: Despite the reduction in annual emissions, a new study published in the journal Nature Communications warns that burning fossil fuels at the current rate could bring total carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to record levels.]
So what happened since 2007? The EIA attributes reduction in coal emissions to the switch from coal-powered plants to more efficient natural-gas-powered plants, and the growth in renewable energy (especially wind and solar). From 2005 to 2015, fossil-fuel electricity generation declined by about 6 percent and noncarbon electricity generation grew by 20 percent. As Pruitt says, hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling are newer methods of extracting natural gas that have contributed to reduced carbon emissions.
Environmental groups say the growth in energy efficiency also played a role, by flattening the demand for electricity generation. The Obama administration had issued energy-efficiency standards and regulations for appliances to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy production. From 2005 to 2015, electricity generation grew by just 1 percent and carbon emissions fell by 21 percent, according to the EIA.
The Trump administration stopped some of the Obama-era energy-efficiency regulations from taking effect, through a moratorium on pending regulations. The administration also proposed eliminating a federal program that sets efficiency standards.
What is “burning coal in a clean fashion”? “Clean coal” is a term that Trump and coal industry representatives often use to describe carbon capture and storage, a technique to capture carbon emissions from power plants, transport it through pipelines and inject it deep into the ground to make oil wells more productive.
This technology has been developing through the 2000s, but it remains expensive. The Energy Department has withdrawn funding from several massive projects, The Washington Post reported. The Trump administration's proposed budget leaves intact a federal program to fund research and projects to develop carbon-capture and storage technology.
While this technology is thought to be an important step toward reducing carbon emissions, experts say it isn't being used enough by factories to have made a difference on current coal emission levels. There aren't many new coal factories being built anymore, and the first large-scale “clean coal” facility was declared operational in January in Texas. So it's unlikely that this technology contributed to reductions in carbon emissions down to pre-1994 levels. Another coal plant in Mississippi using carbon-capture technology was expected to open the same month, but it was delayed.
The Texas and Mississippi plants mark the arrival of the technology “that has been heralded as essential to the future of coal burning in particular (though it has many other applications), but has struggled despite considerable subsidies from the U.S. Department of Energy,” The Post reported.
The Pinocchio Test
Pruitt repeatedly cited reduced carbon emission levels and new technology for “burning coal in a clean fashion” to deflect Wallace's questions about the health implications of eliminating coal regulations. They probably are referring to technology to capture carbon emissions before they're released into the air, transport them through pipes, and then inject them deep underground into oil wells. Such technology has been developing for many years but has lagged and remains expensive. The first coal-fired power plant to employ this on a large scale became operational in January, so Pruitt is giving way too much credit to the use of this technology.
If Pruitt only attributed lower emission levels to “clean coal,” this claim would earn Three or Four Pinocchios. But in the course of the four times that they repeated this point in the “Fox News Sunday” interview, they also named a legitimate factor that helped reduce carbon emissions: the increase in natural gas production. Natural gas has been growing at the expense of coal, so he's correct to point that out.
The other major contributor is the growth in renewable energy (especially wind and solar), which Pruitt did not mention. And environmental groups also attribute flattened demand for energy thanks to energy-efficient appliances, products and buildings. In all, Pruitt earns Two Pinocchios for this muddled talking point.

An Iowa State cheerleader had to be escorted off the court late in Iowa State's 84-71 loss to top-seeded Virginia Cavaliers after taking a kick-ball right to the face.
UVA, leading 74-62 late in the second half, was preparing to take the ball in after an errant pass flew of Iowa State player Matt Thomas' foot and out of bounds. Players began getting setup for the next play before refs noticed Jameel McKay and a woman tending to a cheerleader on the sideline and stopped called a timeout shortly thereafter.
Judging by the replay (VIDEO ABOVE), there was no way this young lady could have avoided getting blasted, and judging by those tears, it really hurt.

The fact that their Cyclones played so poorly probably doesn't make it any better.
A draft UNESCO document uses the Name” Haram esh Sharif “and leaves out the Name “Temple Mount” as Known to the Jews .
So,Here is Good News for the Muslims. One of the world's most important religious sites and Judaism's holiest site, Jerusalem's Temple Mount and Western Wall, was called an exclusively Muslim shrine on Thursday,14 October 2016 in a United Nations draft resolution that denies Jewish connection to the site.
The resolution, which condemns Israel for its activities in Jerusalem and the West Bank, asserts that Jerusalem is holy to three monotheistic religions: Judaism, Islam and Christianity. However, it includes a special section pertaining to the Temple Mount that says the site is sacred only to Muslims and fails to mention it as sacred to Jews. The resolution from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization does not refer to the Al-Aqsa mosque by either the Hebrew term for the site—Har Habayit—or its English translation, the Temple Mount, but only by its Muslim name.
“The United States is deeply concerned by the increase in violence and escalating tensions surrounding the (al-)Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount,” said State Department spokesperson John Kirby, referring to another Islamic name for the site. “We strongly condemn all acts of violence. It is absolutely critical that all sides exercise restraint, refrain from provocative actions and rhetoric and preserve unchanged the historic status quo on the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount
Due to Israeli diplomatic efforts before the vote, no European country backed the motion. Twenty-four countries voted in favor of the decision, while six voted against. Twenty-six abstained while two were missing, according to a Haaretz report. The U.S., United Kingdom and Germany were among those against the resolution. France, Sweden, Slovenia, Argentina, Togo and India abstained from the vote.

This would all be perfectly legal had the lion not been a resident of Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park, a protected area. Hunter Walter James Palmer, left, with another lion they killed. Credit:Facebook The International Union for the Conservation of Nature estimates that trophy-hunting tourists legally kill 600 lions each year. Jane Smart, the global director of IUCN's Biodiversity Conservation Group, said that the 600 figure is several years old and the actual number is probably a little bit higher. Given that there are only about 30,000 lions left in Africa, this represents an annual loss of roughly 2 per cent of the total lion population to legal hunting, and a considerably larger share of the population of healthy adult male lions, which hunters typically prize.
American tourists - wealthy ones, given the high costs involved - account for most lions killed for sport in Africa.

Credit:Trophy Hunter America A 2011 report by the International Fund for Animal Welfare found that between 1999 and 2008, Americans brought home lion "trophies" - heads, pelts and whatnot - representing 64 per cent of all African lions killed for "sport" during that period. And that number is rising. "Of these trophies, the number imported into the US in 2008 was larger than any other year in the decade studied and more than twice the number in 1999," the report found.

The dwindling lion population cannot sustain hunting losses like this indefinitely, the IUCN found in its report. Last year, the US Fish and Wildlife Service declined to list African lions as "endangered", which would have led to a ban on the importation of recreational lion trophies to the US. Instead it listed lions as "threatened", which allows the domestic trade in lion trophies to continue. Safari Club International, the hunting group Palmer belongs to, hailed the ruling as a victory for hunters. The club maintains an online record book where hunters can track their kills of lions and other big game animals and compare their rankings with other hunters.
"You can submit your score and method of kill for any species, and it will interactively show you where you would rank in the book if your entry was submitted today," the website says. An image of an example ranking page shows scores and rankings for kills of African lions. Safari International says there are records of over 2000 lions killed in its online record book. A November 2014 blog post highlights the top 10 African lions killed, with photos of hunters posed next to their prizes. "The African lion is one of the most challenging and dangerous hunts," the copy reads.
"Virtually anyone who imagines an African Safari envisions the big maned lion charging the implacable hunter shouldering their European double rifle. In reality, lion hunting doesn't appear to require much in the way of skill. Many hunter-tourists are guided by teams of locals and professionals. Adult lions are not particularly afraid of humans, making it relatively easy to get close to one. They spend most of their day sleeping. Hunting groups such as Safari Club International maintain that hunting lions helps conserve them. They promote the positive effects of hunting in African communities. They argue that "hunting plays a role in raising the value of the African lion and discourages poaching".
Dr Smart said that well-regulated trophy hunting could be of net benefit for lion populations. "What is clear is that overall the trophy hunting must be carefully regulated, otherwise it casts the whole trophy hunting industry into ill-repute," they said. "There is a payback for communities if we can do it in a regulated way. However unpleasant people find this, this can be a good conservation technique." They stressed that habitat destruction and illegal poaching were even bigger threats to the lion population. In a statement to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Palmer expressed regret.
"I had no idea that the lion I took was a known, local favourite, was collared and part of a study until the end of the hunt ... I deeply regret that my pursuit of an activity I love and practice responsibly and legally resulted in the taking of this lion," they said. The Washington Post

The season may be over for the Green Bay Packers but the analysis of third year quarterback, Brett Hundley, is just beginning. Mike McCarthy is going to treat Hundley with “kid gloves” as to give them confidence as a starter, and expect this offense to be pretty vanilla compared to what Aaron Rodgers is used to running. The Ravens are coming off a much-needed bye week, are as healthy as they're going to be this season, and are in desperation mode as they try to get their season back on track. Unlike most stadiums, Lambeau field provides it's own challenges as it will be a brisk 33 degrees on Sunday.
How the Packers Win:
Brett Hundley won their first game of the season in the 26-13 win against the Bears, where they threw only one touchdown. The Packers offense ranks 24th in total yards, 22nd in pass yards, and coach Mike McCarthy isn't going to want to try this Ravens defense who ranks first in team interceptions. Ty Montgomery missed their second straight day of practice, since they are nursing a rib injury from last week, and will be a game time decision. Brett Hundley is going to have taken what the Ravens give him, and with the Ravens ranked 27th in stopping the run, that is what it's going to take.
#Packers QB Brett Hundley in 2017
When targeting Davante Adams: 19/33 for 209 yards, 2 TDs, 0 INTs. 96.6 passer rating.
When targeting everyone else: 56/89 for 492 yards, 0 TDs, 4 INTs, 58.8 passer rating — Zach Kruse (@zachkruse2) November 17, 2017
How the Ravens Win:
The Ravens had two weeks to prepare for the Packers, and have a little bit of luck by not having to deal with Aaron Rodgers. However, the Ravens defense hasn't been the issue; it's their offense. Their passing offense is the worst in the league and in a league that benefits teams with a vertical offense, that kind of ranking can't cut it for a team trying to make the playoffs. The Ravens rushing offense is ranked 10th, but with an anemic passing game, defenses will take their chances sending blitzes and stacking the box. The Ravens will need to have their best passing performance of the year in order to jump start their second half of the season.

If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Practice makes perfect. These proverbs have encouraged us all in many different contexts. But in software development, they tug at our heartstrings uniquely. Programmers persevere through countless nights of fixing bugs. Companies march vigilantly toward an MVP. But after 1.0 there is no finish line, there is no bottom of the 9th inning. There are more bugs to be fixed. There are new releases ahead. The march continues, because software is not a product, it is a process.
This week, Apple has reminded us of the value of this iterative process and its rewards with the fifth beta release of Xcode 6, iOS 8, OS X Yosemite, and most importantly — Swift. This update includes a number of improvements, but perhaps the most interesting are those not listed. Swift was rough around the edges during its launch at WWDC, but it is definitely beginning to live up to its name.
If you missed my first post, Apples to Apples, you should head over there now to catch up.
Setup
The setup is the same as before, but I'll reiterate for clarity.
Code: swift-sorts, objc-sorts, and std lib sort implementations
swift-sorts, objc-sorts, and std lib sort implementations Software: OS X Mavericks 10.9.4, Xcode 6 beta 5
OS X Mavericks 10.9.4, Xcode 6 beta 5 Hardware: 2008 unibody MacBook Pro, 2.4 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo, 8 GB 1067 MHz DDR3 memory The benchmarks consist of T trials, which are averaged at the end to obtain the average execution time for each algorithm. Each trial begins by generating an array of N random integers in the range [0, UINT32_MAX) . Then, each sorting algorithm is passed a copy of this initial array to sort. The current time is logged before and after each sort and the difference between the two yields the execution time for the algorithm for the current trial. These two programs were carefully crafted to be a true apples-to-apples comparison. All of the algorithms, as well as main.swift and main.m , are implemented as similarly as possible, bounded only by the confines and paradigms of the languages themselves. In Objective-C, NSArray and NSNumber are used intentionally as the counterparts to Swift's Array and Int . The APIs are language-specific too, for example exchangeObjectAtIndex: withObjectAtIndex: versus swap() .
Results
Below are the results of running each program over 10 trials with 10,000 integers. The build configuration settings are noted for each run and the average execution times are displayed in seconds. The average case runtime complexity for each algorithm is also noted.
The final row in each table is the difference in speed of Swift compared to Objective-C. A positive value indicates that Swift is faster, while a negative value indicates that Swift is slower. For example, if Objective-C runs in 3.6 seconds and Swift runs in 1.2 seconds, then Swift is 3 times (3x) faster.

When not optimized, Swift is nothing to write home about. You can see that Objective-C performs substantially better. But this is ok — since you will be shipping with optimized builds. With no optimizations, this is what we should expect to see. The swiftness of Swift is in the compiler — LLVM and Clang. Mike Ash's Friday Q&A last month on the Secrets of Swift's Speed provides a good overview of how better performance can be achieved with Swift versus Objective-C with compiler optimizations. We can see these optimizations in action below.

If you recall the results from the previous post, then this should be quite shocking (in a good way). Take a deep breath. Yes, yes this is real life. The tables have completely turned (no pun intended). I've been running these trials since the first beta, and this is the first time that Swift has performed better than Objective-C for every single algorithm, with standard optimizations. And not only is Swift faster, but it is faster by significant margins.

This should come as no surprise. Swift performance at this optimization level was always better than Objective-C, with the exception of the std lib sort — which no longer the case.
The benchmarks above were gathered with N = 10,000 to be consistent with the previous post. However, this is no longer a challenge for Swift. Let's see what happens when N = 100,000 . Given that most, if not all, developers will be compliling their modules and apps at the standard optimization level, the trials below were only run with -O and release. As expected, Swift comes out on top.

When Apple introduced Swift, we were assured safety, clarity, modernity, and speed. It is clear to me that they have delivered and are continuing to deliver on these promises. The refinements and enhancements made over the past few months have been absolutely great. Some highlights for me include array value semantics, array and dictionary syntactic sugar, the ..< operator replacing the .. operator, and the performance improvements seen here. I think Swift is coming along quite nicely and I am more excited than ever for the next beta.
Swift is a breath of fresh air that makes reading and writing Objective-C feel archaic. I cannot wait for 1.0 and the moment when I can say goodbye to Objective-C.
The Apples to apples series will continue as betas are released. Stay tuned for updates and new posts!

Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness UPDATE 2 – 11/24:
27 new arrangements have been completed and only a few more left until completion of all new arrangements. Once that is accomplished I have to master all the tracks and get them uploaded. I am hopeful that I can get this done over the next couple of weeks! So close now. Thanks for your patience.
Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness UPDATE 1:
11 totally new arrangements are completed and 19 more are in various stages of completion. I decided to do more than I originally planned so it's taking a bit longer than expected but I think everyone will appreciate the extra tracks. I also realized that it's been so long since I composed the material that I had to relearn how to play quite a bit of it! Also, the guitar and violin parts were quite tricky to do and I have to take a day off between songs or my fingers will blister which will delay the project. You can check out a couple of the arrangements here:
The story of the Russian hacking of the 2016 elections in this country gets deeper and murkier with every telling. In fact, it's becoming rather like the old tale of how to tell someone their cat has died. As I recall, it goes like this:
A man who lived at home with their mother and pet cat went on a trip to Europe. Before they left they told their best friend to tell them of any emergencies. A few days into their trip, their cat slipped while climbing the roof, fell off and died. Their friend immediately texts them with the message: "Your cat died!" In a few hours they were back home, having cut short their trip in grief. When they saw their friend they yelled at him, "Why didn't you break the news to me slowly? You know how close I was to my cat! You could have sent a message 'Your cat climbed up on the roof today', and the next day you could've written, 'Your cat fell off the roof' and let me down gradually that they died." After a quick memorial service, the man left again to continue their trip. A few days later they get a text from their friend. It read, "Your mother climbed up on the roof today."
The structure of the joke is that, no matter how carefully you lead someone into tragic news, sooner or later, Mom ends up dead. I'd say that we're about one day away from someone telling us that American democracy has climbed up on the roof.
First, there was no Russian hacking of Democratic e-mails. Then, there was. Then, there was no Russian hacking of electoral software. Then, there was. Then, it was only an isolated kind of thing. Then, Reality stepped in and we discovered it was more thoroughgoing. On Tuesday, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, pushed the cat a little further out onto the eaves. From USA TODAY:
"I don't believe they got into changing actual voting outcomes," Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said in an interview. "But the extent of the attacks is much broader than has been reported so far." They said they were pushing intelligence agencies to declassify the names of those states hit to help put electoral systems on notice before the midterm voting in 2018. "None of these actions from the Russians stopped on Election Day," they warned.
A month ago, nobody at Warner's pay grade even was talking out loud about the possibility of "changing actual voting outcomes." Now, Warner's saying only that they don't believe anyone did that. Meanwhile, in Florida, there are reports that bring the generalities down to local specifics. From the Tampa Bay Times:
Election supervisors in Citrus, Clay and Pasco counties told the Times/Herald Tuesday that they got the emails, but they did not open them. It's unclear whether the cyberattack was successful anywhere else in Florida… Pasco County Supervisor of Elections Brian Corley said the malicious message was in their agency's inbox on Oct. 31. "I didn't open it," Corley said. "Phishing emails? We get them all the time. I can't tell you how many people in Nigeria want to give me $8 million." They said every suspicious email is forwarded to a "quarantine" email address. Clay County Supervisor of Elections Chris Chambless said their office got a copy of the phishing e-mail but it was stopped by an anti-virus filter. Tallahassee-based VR Systems quickly warned counties about the attempt in a Nov. 1 email to all 64 counties that use its software. "I looked to see if we had it in our system, and we didn't, and quite frankly, I made that assumption then that our quarantine system did its job," said Chambless, president of the Florida State Association of Supervisors of Elections.
Dear America, your government went out on the roof today.

Borneo Stalagmites Provide New View of Abrupt Climate Events Over 100,000 Years

A new set of long-term climate records based on cave stalagmites collected from tropical Borneo shows that the western tropical Pacific responded very differently than other regions of the globe to abrupt climate change events. The 100,000-year climate record adds to data on past climate events, and may help scientists assess models designed to predict how the Earth's climate will respond in the future.
The new record resulted from oxygen isotope analysis of more than 1,700 calcium carbonate samples taken from four stalagmites found in three different northern Borneo caves. The results suggest that climate feedbacks within the tropical regions may amplify and prolong abrupt climate change events that were first discovered in the North Atlantic.
The results were published June 6 in Science Express, the electronic advance online publication of the journal Science, and will appear later in an issue of printed publication. The research was supported by the National Science Foundation.
Today, relatively subtle changes in the tropical Pacific's ocean and atmosphere have profound effects on global climate. However, there are few records of past climate changes in this key region that have the length, resolution and age controls needed to reveal the area's response to abrupt climate change events.
“This is a new record from a very important area of the world,” said Kim Cobb, an associate professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. “This record will provide a new piece of the puzzle from the tropical Pacific showing us how that climate system has responded to forcing events over the past 100,000 years.”
Among the findings were some surprises that show just how complicated the Earth's climate system can be. While the stalagmite record reflected responses to abrupt changes known as Heinrich events, another major type of event – known as Dansgaard-Oeschger excursions – left no evidence in the Borneo stalagmites. Both types of abrupt climate change events are prominently featured in a previously-published stalagmite climate record from China – which is only slightly north of Borneo.
“To my knowledge, this is the first record that so clearly shows sensitivity to one set of major abrupt climate change events and not another,” said Cobb. “These two types of abrupt change events appear to have different degrees of tropical Pacific involvement, and because the tropical Pacific speaks with such a loud voice when it does speak, we think this is extremely important for understanding the mechanisms underlying these events.”
The researchers were also surprised to discover a very large and abrupt signal in their stalagmite climate records precisely when super-volcano Toba erupted nearby, roughly 74,000 years ago.
The team recovered the stalagmites from caves in Gunung Mulu and Gunung Buda National Parks, in northern Borneo, which is located a few degrees north of the Equator in the western Pacific. Back at their Georgia Tech lab, they analyzed the stalagmites for the ratio of oxygen isotopes contained in samples of calcium carbonate, the material from which the stalagmites were formed. That ratio is set by the oxygen isotopes in rainfall at the site, as the water that seeped into the ground dissolved limestone rock and dripped into the caves to form the stalagmites. The stalagmites accumulate at a rate of roughly one centimeter every thousand years.
“Stalagmites are time capsules of climate signals from thousands of years in the past,” said Stacy Carolin, a Georgia Tech Ph.D. candidate who gathered and analyzed the stalagmites. “We have instrumental records of climate only for the past 100 years or so, and if we want to look deeper into the past, we have to find records like these that locked in climate signals we can extract today.”
In the laboratory, Carolin sawed each stalagmite in half, opening it like a hot dog bun. They then used a tiny drill bit to take samples of the calcium carbonate down the center at one-millimeter steps. Because the stalagmites grew at varying rates, each sample represented as little as 60 years of time, or as much as 200 years. The precise ages of the samples were determined by measuring uranium and thorium isotope ratios, an analysis done with the help of Jess F. Adkins, a professor at the California Institute of Technology and a co-author of the study.
Rainfall oxygen isotopic ratios are good indicators of the amount of rainfall occurring throughout the region, as determined by a modern-day calibration study recently published by another graduate student in Cobb's lab.
Merging data from the four different stalagmites provided a record of precipitation trends in the western Pacific over the past 100,000 years. That information can be compared to stalagmite and ice core climate records obtained elsewhere in the world.
“This record, which spans the entire last glacial period, adds significantly to the understanding of how various climate forcings are felt by the western tropical Pacific,” Carolin added.
Climate scientists are interested in learning more about abrupt climate changes because they indicate that the climate system may have “tipping points.” So far, the climate system has responded to rising carbon dioxide levels at a fairly steady rate, but many scientists worry about possible nonlinear effects.
“As a society, we haven't really thought enough about the fact that we are moving Earth's climate system toward a new state very quickly,” said Cobb. “It's important to remember that the climate system has important nonlinearities that are most evident in these abrupt climate events. Ultimately, we'd like to be able to reproduce the global signatures of these abrupt climate events with numerical models of the climate system, and investigate the physics that drive such events.”
For Carolin, studying the half-meter-long stalagmites brought an awareness that the Earth has not always been as we know it today.
“You have to be impressed with the scope of what you are studying, and recognize that the state our climate is in today is incredibly different from Earth's climate during the last Ice Age,” they said. “As we consider how humans may be affecting climate, dissecting what was going on tens of thousands of years ago in all regions of the globe can help scientists better predict how the Earth will respond to modern climate forcings.”
In addition to those already mentioned, the research team included Brian Clark, manager of the Gunung Mulu National Park where the samples were gathered; Syria Lejau and Jenny Malang, Gunung Mulu cave guides who aided in sample collection; Jessica Conroy, a Georgia Tech postdoctoral fellow; and Andrew Tuen, a professor at the Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

TEMPE, Ariz. – It's no secret that San Francisco is one of the most expensive cities in the country to live in.
And it's no secret that the Phoenix metro area has a significantly lower cost-of-living than the Bay Area. Darnell Dockett knows how far their money went in Arizona during the last 11 years.
He's about to find out how far it won't go in San Francisco.
Dockett reportedly turned down a one-year deal from the Cardinals worth $2.5 million to sign a two-year contract with the 49ers on March 5 that will pay them up to $7.5 million over two seasons including $4 million in 2015. If a handful of cost-of-living calculators are correct, their 2015 salary may not be enough for Dockett to live the type of lifestyle in San Francisco that they could have with $2.5 million in Arizona.
According to Bankrate.com, $2.5 million in Arizona (before taxes) is worth $4,323,406.48 in San Francisco, an increase of 72.9 percent.
According to Nerdwallet.com, $2.5 million in Arizona is worth $4,484,043 in San Francisco, an increase of 79 percent.
And then there were the extremes. One site, Bestplaces.net, valued a $2.5 million salary in Phoenix at $6,132,457 in San Francisco, while Salary.com valued a $2.5 million salary in Phoenix at $3,374,169 in San Francisco.
Dockett has earned more than $52 million throughout their 11-year career and they have been wise with their savings, so a few hundred thousand dollars shouldn't impact them much.
According to Nerdwallet.com, the overall cost of living in San Francisco is 70 percent more expensive than Arizona – including a housing market that's 234 percent pricier than the Valley of the Sun. The site states that food is 25 percent more expensive in San Francisco and entertainment is 27 percent higher.
Numbeo.com says that groceries in San Francisco are 41.8 percent higher than in Phoenix while restaurants are 30.9 percent more expensive.
But while they appear to have taken the money and run, in reality Dockett may have lost money on their 2015 salary.
NEXT weekend Germany celebrates the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Yet a few days before that, Die Linke (The Left), the party that descends from the communists who ran the old East Germany, may take charge of one of reunified Germany's 16 states (Thuringia) for the first time.
The mainstream parties treat The Left as pariahs in the federal Bundestag. The party jeers from the backbenches and fights internal vendettas. It hates capitalism and wants to scrap NATO. In debates over Ukraine many Leftists have blamed America more than Russia's Vladimir Putin. Their parliamentary leader, Gregor Gysi, refuses to call the East German regime an “unjust state”.
Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.
In state and local governments in eastern Germany, however, The Left has become a home for many Ossis (Easterners), who tend to be apolitical and feel vaguely frustrated. They vote Left partly for reasons of “Ostalgie”. In Brandenburg The Left governs boringly as junior partner in a “red-red” coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD). But Thuringia presents a new opportunity. In its election in September the Christian Democrats (CDU), the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, came first, with 33%. But The Left came a strong second with 28%. It could now eke out a tiny majority if it combined with the other two left-leaning parties: the SPD and the Greens.
To many on Germany's centre-left such a “red-red-green” alliance is the holy grail at the federal level to replace governments led by Mrs Merkel. In Thuringia (as in the rest of Germany) the CDU rules in coalition with the SPD. The SPD has paid dearly there, winning a meagre 12% of the vote in September. So the state's Social Democrats want to try joining with The Left and the Greens instead. Thuringia's 4,300 SPD members are expected to say yes to the idea on November 4th. The Left could lead its first-ever state government by December.
Its premier would be Bodo Ramelow. A western transplant in Thuringia, they personally bring no baggage from East German times. And although they were a firebrand unionist once, they count as a moderate by The Left's standards. Thuringians fret less about them than about the stability of a government that would have only a one-seat majority.
The overarching question is whether a red-red-green government in Thuringia could foreshadow a similar experiment in the Bundestag (albeit with an SPD chancellor). It would be much harder to do in national politics, where foreign and security policy cleaves a wide gulf between the two red parties. And yet the SPD is in a terrible bind. Increasingly, it merely holds the stirrups for others to mount: Mrs Merkel in Berlin, now Mr Ramelow in Erfurt. The SPD's thirst for national power may yet force it to turn to The Left in the Bundestag.
Our goal is to provide a powerful and widely engaging platform for exploring ideas, practices, and initiatives that provide deeper engagement with our faith and our world. All who are involved with Faith Matters share a deep commitment to the restored gospel tradition, and a profound desire to see it thrive and remain vital and relevant to rising generations.
In 1863, Brigham Young voiced a theme repeated often in the early Church:
Our religion… embraces all truth, wherever found, in all the works of God and man… (Journal of Discourses, vol.10:50)
Four decades later, Elder B.H. Roberts, an LDS General Authority and official Church Historian, issued this provocative challenge to church members.
I believe ‘Mormonism' affords opportunity…for thoughtful disciples who will not be content with merely repeating some of its truths, but will develop its truths …The Prophet planted the germ-truths of the great dispensation of the fullness of times…The disciples of Mormonism, growing discontented with the necessarily primitive methods which have hitherto prevailed in sustaining the doctrine, will yet take profounder and broader views of the great doctrines committed to the church; and, departing from mere repetition, will cast them in new formulas…until they help to give to the truths received a more forceful expression, and carry it beyond the earlier and cruder stages of its development. (The Improvement Era, 1906)
We believe that we, as a people, have fallen well short of that challenge in the century-plus since Elder Roberts issued it. We believe the restored gospel has an important and prophetic role to play in the world.

FBI tracking Portland anarchist groups
Here it is folks, John Zerzan being quoted in the local mainstream media of Portland, Oregon:
PORTLAND – They strike in the dark of night, targeting banks and businesses by breaking windows and ATMs.
Surveillance video obtained by NewsChannel 8 shows several recent attacks. Dressed in all black, their faces covered, a swarm of anarchists used rocks and projectiles to inflict their damage.
“There is certainly a boldness that goes along with that type of dramatic vandalism,” said Commander Robert Day of the Portland Police Bureau.
Over the past three years, various banks in Portland have sustained tens of thousands of dollars worth of damage leading to at least one arrest.
NOT JUST VANDALISM
A newly unsealed search warrant suggests the FBI has been tracking a small group of anarchists in Portland since last April.
In November of 2011, police raided three homes in Northeast Portland. Anarchists had taken over the vacant property.
A surveillance team followed the group as they drove north in a rented Zipcar to participate in May Day protests.
Federal agents believe five or six black-clad protesters from Portland attacked the federal courthouse in Seattle. There is now a grand jury investigation.
Many witnesses have refused to testify.
As part of this federal probe, the FBI raided three Portland homes in July, where investigators recovered cell phones, iPods and bank account records.
“I think there is more attention to the anarchist thing because it is oppositional, radical alternative,” said John Zerzan, author, philosopher and host of Anarchy Radio.
“I don't think they are dangerous to people, to, you know, the regular populace. I think, I hope, they are dangerous to the system.”
Zerzan believes property damage is a way to further the anarchist ideology: No government, no laws, no police or any other authority.
“You can have a nice, polite rally and people make speeches and go home and so what? I think you've got to take some action,” said Zerzan.
In a story posted on the FBI website titled, “Domestic Terrorism, Anarchists Extremism: A Primer” the government notes that the belief in anarchy is perfectly legal. But the use of violence by extremists is against the law.
ACTIVITY CONTINUES
A Portland man is now facing federal charges for allegedly throwing a Moltov cocktail at a Portland Police car in November. While awaiting trial, the judge has ordered they avoid contact with anarchist groups.
Anarchists are active on the Internet. One anarchy website includes a tutorial on avoiding surveillance cameras. Lessons learned, they suggest, from recent attacks on Portland banks.

DC's overall percentage of female creators ticked down slightly in March while Marvel's took a sizeable, record setting jump. We also take a look at another record setter, this year's Eisner nominations.
DC COMICS
After a higher start to the year, DC seems to be settling into the low teens, an area noticeably below their past bests. In March 2016, DC Comics put out 74 new comic books featuring 667 credited creators, 578 men and 89 women. Here are their charts:
DC's overall percentage of female creators fell 0.3%, a fairly inconsequential drop that nonetheless resulted in a relatively low total for the publisher. The numbers were up and down across the board, with small drops for cover artists, pencillers, inkers, and editors, and small gains for writers and letterers. The biggest swing was female colorists, who tumbled 7%, followed by female assistant editors, who rose nearly 4%. The changes all combined to a slight decline overall.
The Past Year at DC: March isn't looking much different from February, with both months among the lowest totals of the past 8 months:
The “Convergence” bumped April and May numbers aside, the second half of 2016 was much higher than usual for DC, and their current dip seems to be turning into a trend.
MARVEL COMICS
Meanwhile, Marvel's set a new company record for female creators. In March 2016, Marvel released 81 comics with 720 credited creators, 585 men and 135 women. Let's look at the numbers:
Marvel's 3.7% jump took them to 18.8% female creators overall, a new high for the publisher. As with every March at Marvel, their numbers were bolstered by variant covers celebrating female characters and creators; female cover artists jumped 6% from February. But female writers, pencillers, and inkers all saw small gains, along with an increase of nearly 7% for assistant editors. Colorists and editors dropped slightly, but the sizeable gains won the day.
The Past Year at Marvel: This chart shows the significance of Marvel's new high, relative to their past high but also the past six months:
Marvel's noticeably above their previous best of 17.2%, and well ahead of the initial months of their new, post-Secret Wars line up. The real question is whether they can keep it up; the chart also shows that past highs are no guarantee of high numbers the following month.
THE EISNER AWARD NOMINATIONS
The nominations for the 2016 Eisner Awards, the comic book industry's highest honours, were unveiled a couple of weeks back, and the announcement touted a “Record Number of Nominations for Women.” The release went on to say, “The biggest news this year is that 49 women have received a record 61 nominations (compared to 44 last year) and are represented in 27 of the 30 categories. In fact, women make up the majority of nominees in seven categories.” All of this is true, but raw numbers can be tricky. More female nominees are great, but if a higher number of men were nominated as well as the representation by percentage may not have changed very much.
But the percentages show that the Eisners have indeed set a record for female creators. The following graph charts the percentage of women nominated for Eisners for the past three years, and then back biannually from then all the way to 2004. The percentage is based on total nominations, so for example Colleen Coover got three separate nominations this year and gets credited for each of them in the tabulations. Here's a look at how this year stacks up:
So that's quite a jump. The overall total, 27.5%, is impressive in and of itself; women accounting for more than a quarter of the nominations is a massive change given that their percentage was in the single digits just a few years ago. Moreover, the change from last year to this year is sizeable. A jump of 8.5% is huge; there were several years where the Eisners didn't even have 8.5% female nominees overall! The past few years of nominations have highlighted a dramatic shift in the industry, none more so than this year.
By category, women were nominated in nearly 75% of the categories last year. This year, there are female nominees in 27 of the 30 categories, or 90%. That's quite a comprehensive field. Women are making comics at every level of production, in every genre and form, and are earning nominations accordingly.
For the past couple of years, we've compared the stats for the Eisner Awards to the Hugo Awards, the highest accolades for science fiction and fantasy which get announced around the same time. The comparison hasn't been particularly favourable. Last year, when a campaign by conservative writers hijacked the Hugo nominations to ensure that white, male voices would finally be recognized in science fiction and fantasy, the Hugos still had a higher percentage of women nominated than the Eisners did. That was a real buzzkill for what had been a record setting year for the Eisners.
But the tables have turned this year. Female representation at the Hugo Awards actually increased from last year, despite a similar conservative hijacking. The percentage of women nominated for Hugos rose from 22.7% in 2015 to 26.3%, but women taking 27.5% of the Eisner nominations puts the Eisners on top. While topping the hijacked Hugos isn't the most impressive of achievements, it nonetheless underscores how far the Eisners have come. Just two years ago, the percentage of women nominated for Hugos more than doubled those nominated for Eisners. The game has definitely changed in the wider world of comics, though growth in the superhero genre remains slow.

It's no secret that third-party presidential nominees Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are chomping at the bit to participate in the presidential debates. Unfortunately, neither nominee joined Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump onstage for the first of the debates, held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., on Monday night. Each found a way to make their voices heard in the political cacophony, however.
Stein was escorted from the Hofstra campus because they reportedly “didn't have credentials to be there.” They shared images of their police escort via Twitter:
We were immediately escorted off of the Hofstra campus after the press conference just now and told not to do any more press. #debatenight pic.twitter.com/ZFr49NPMuH — Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) September 26, 2016
After being escorted from Hofstra campus for doing an interview, police put us in a van which was stopped not once, but twice. #debatenight pic.twitter.com/IgQJMoCNWZ — Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) September 26, 2016
Following their removal from campus, Stein was joined by dozens of activists protesting the exclusionary nature of the debates. Stein used the streaming app Periscope to share video of the protests on their Twitter page, tagged with #OccupyTheDebates:
Stein also reported that more than a dozen protesters had been arrested, and claimed that the Green Party's official website was hacked to keep voters from seeing them platform.
Johnson, who has repeatedly urged for inclusion in the debates, watched them from Twitter's Manhattan headquarters. Perhaps due to their exclusion, Johnson was reportedly on edge. Lizzie Crocker of The Daily Beast described them as “instantly irate” during interactions with reporters and said that their running mate, Bill Weld, had to intervene repeatedly to calm the situation. Crocker writes:
Minutes before [Monday] night's presidential debate began, Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party candidate and former New Mexico governor, was shouting at a reporter in a conference room in the basement of Twitter's New York City headquarters. … This was not the warm, affable Johnson we know, the 63-year-old, mountain-climbing triathlete and first major national politician to favor legalizing marijuana. You half expected them to break the silence with a characteristically goofy grin—his own “gotcha” moment. Instead, Johnson became more enraged. Certainly this was no act, but they wanted to make a point that he'd be just as bullish if the issue came up in a debate.
Despite these incidents, both Johnson and Stein were able to settle down and log in to Twitter in time for the opening of the debate.
The two third-party candidates reacted to the full spectrum of issues covered in the first debate, such as taxes, the criminal justice system, cybersecurity and foreign policy. Johnson commented via written tweets, while Stein occasionally commented via live video:

By the end of the debate, both nominees expressed dismay in Trump and Clinton:
Lots of name-calling & mud wrestling at the #debates. The American people deserve much better. #OccupyTheDebates — Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) September 27, 2016
Neither the rhetoric of @realDonaldTrump nor the record of @HillaryClinton depicts the Commander in Chief I want #debates — Gov. Gary Johnson (@GovGaryJohnson) September 27, 2016
Johnson
and Stein each wrapped up their live-tweeting with additional pleas for inclusion in the next two debates.
After the debate ended, there was still plenty to discuss. Stein joined Amy Goodman of “Democracy Now!” for a live after-show. Instead of simply breaking down Trump and Clinton's positions, Stein was shown clips from the debate and asked to respond as though they had been onstage. Goodman served as the “moderator.”
The candidates were still at it Tuesday morning. Johnson joined Reason Magazine's Matt Welch for a post-debate Facebook Live interview, in which they fielded questions from the audience. Stein, meanwhile, sat down with The Huffington Post's Alyona Minkovski for a post-debate analysis.
According to the most recent polls, Stein and Johnson still do not have enough support to be included in the next debate, according to rules established by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Both candidates have launched petitions asking for inclusion in the debates; Stein's has more than 100,000 signatures, while Johnson's has topped 1 million.

This is a very common question and the standard answer to it is “no, you need an alt to provide for your main”. I should go back and say that I'm talking about lowsec piracy here – if you are in some large null bloc then they replace your ships because pvp is so dull out there that you have to pay people to do it.
I had a think about this and wasn't sure it was right so I made a spreadsheet (which was very boring) This month so far (up to the 10th Feb) I have shot down 48 ships worth 1.56B and lost 4 ships worth 45M. Now obviously you can't live off k/d ratios so I had to work out how much loot I got – this was done by dividing the loot dropped by the number of Bastards on the killmail which brought my share of the loot to just over 93M.
If my ropey maths are correct this means I am 43M up so far this month as a result of shooting people in the face and taking their stuff.
It's official – piracy does pay and it beats the hell out of ratting…

Getty/Frazer Harrison MSNBC has fired host Alec Baldwin, the New York Post's Richard Johnson is reporting.
The move comes two weeks after Baldwin flipped out at a cameraman and videographer and allegedly called one of them a gay slur. The network had suspended their show, "Up Late With Alec Baldwin," for two weeks after the incident.
But Baldwin's exit also comes, in part, due to their unfriendliness toward their co-workers at MSNBC, according to the Post report.
Here's one particularly terrible example:
Besides demanding a humidifier because they claimed the air at 30 Rock was too dry, Baldwin alienated staffers when they demanded a separate makeup room being used by a woman with cancer who is sensitive to hairspray.
When Baldwin was told they couldn't have their way, they allegedly bellowed at the top of their lungs, "I don't give a f - - k if they have cancer or not, I want that f - - king makeup room."
A network spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
The western spadefoot toad (Spea hammondii) is a relatively smooth-skinned species of American spadefoot toad. Its eyes are pale gold with vertical pupils. It has a green or grey dorsum often with skin tubercles tipped in orange, and it is a whitish color on the ventrum. It has a wedge-shaped black spade on each hind foot. Adult toads are between 3.8 and 7.5 cm (1.5 and 3.0 in) long.
Juvenile western spadefoot toads look similar to adults, but have more distinct spotting.
Populations of Spea hammondii are localized, but widespread. It ranges throughout the central valley of California as well as the coast south of San Jose and some parts of the desert. The western spadefoot prefers grassland, scrub and chaparral locally but can occur in oak woodlands. It is nocturnal, and activity is limited to the wet season, summer storms, or during evenings with elevated substrate moisture levels. It is easily handled, with less skin secretions than similar toad species. Their secretions smell like peanut butter and may cause sneezing.[1] The western spadefoot is experiencing some habitat loss, but is still common in its range and the population declines are very minor even though it is listed as "near threatened" in some counties of CA.
Diet [ edit ]
Tadpoles feed mainly on plants and planktonic organisms, algae, ants, small invertebrates and dead aquatic larvae of amphibians, they may become cannibalistic. Adult toads feed on insects, worms and other invertebrates including; grasshoppers, true bugs, moths, ground beetles, ladybird beetles, click beetles, spiders, flies, ants and earthworms.
Life span and Reproduction [ edit ]
The average life span for the Western Spadefoot Toad is about 12 years. They reach sexual maturity in their third year. The female spadefoot toad will lay up to 2,000 eggs (per season?). The cordon of eggs attaches to objects in the water or puddles or ditches and the male deposits sperm on them. Tadpoles emerge in as little as 15 hours. After hatching, the tadpole's only chance for survival is to develop into a toad before the puddle dries up, which takes 12 to 13 days. This is the fastest metamorphosis known for any frog or toad. Reproduction: the breeding of laying eggs normally occur from late winter to the end of March. Males will be heard during this period. Females lay numerous small, irregular clusters that will contain from 10 up to 42 eggs. They may lay more than 500 eggs in one season. Eggs hatching happens rapidly within two weeks.
Spawning Stage [ edit ]
A male toad finds the female and jumps on their back, a process called amplexus.[2] As the female lays eggs in a long chain (cordon), the male fertilizes them. The group of eggs is called spawn. [The yolk within the egg splits into two sections. This splits again to create four sections and continues splitting. After this the embryo begins to develop, it starts looking like a tadpole. You can see it swim in the egg, feeding on the yolk to survive. Tadpole Stage. Eggs will hatch in 6–21 days. The tadpole does not swim for the first 7 to 10 days, but floats around in the plants. It breathes through external gills. Four weeks into the process, the skin grows over the gills and they become internal gills. Six to nine weeks after hatching, the tadpole grows legs, but keeps its tail. The tadpole enters youth and adulthood between weeks 9 - 12, the tail shortens. Front legs begin to grow and the lungs develop. At week 12 the toad looks like other toads, only much smaller. It does not leave the water until somewhere between 12 and 16 weeks after hatching. It will return again later to mate and fertilize more eggs. Until then, it lives away from water, eating insects and other bugs.
Noise of the spea: Low frequency and vibration, it may be harmful even fatal to this species. They are very sensitive to such disturbances which cause them to break dormancy and emerge from their burrows
The epithet or specific name, hammondi, is in honor of amateur naturalist General William Alexander Hammond, M.D.

Netflix is notorious for not providing audience numbers for its streaming programs, instead leaning on subscriber growth to give observers a sense of how well its efforts are doing. That's starting to change. The Wall Street Journal reports that Nielsen is currently months into a program that allows it to track shows on Netflix and other services like Amazon Prime and Hulu, and it now has data on nearly 1,000 shows — including how many people watch an episode and information like age and gender. Nielsen hopes that the data it shares can help studios negotiate for higher licensing fees from services if the shows that stream online are shown to do well.
Nielsen started measuring viewership data on streaming sites last winter as a means of giving major studios like Twentieth Century Fox and NBCUniversal a clearer sense of how streaming affects their revenue. Studios still make more money from traditional, ad-supported television, but subscription-based streaming has been eating into TV viewership for some time now. Charging Netflix and Amazon for popular shows can help stem any losses from audiences changing their viewing habits.
Nielsen still doesn't track streaming content on mobile devices
The data Nielsen is tracking is still fairly limited, though, since it doesn't include viewership from mobile devices or overseas subscribers. Nielsen has plans to include those metrics, but Netflix uses those limits to dismiss the effort out of hand. Meanwhile, the streaming giant also already provides certain well-paying studios with information on how often a show is streamed on a monthly basis. However, Netflix has reason to be a little nervous. If Nielsen data shows that its original programming doesn't have the same draw as licensed shows, investors may be somewhat less inclined to support the company's future projects.

Peyton Manning set two records Sunday night: the oldest quarterback to start in the Super Bowl and, more importantly, the oldest to win one.
And though only hours have passed since the 39-year-old's Super Bowl 50 victory (the 200th win of their career!), everyone seems to be wondering whether Manning will hang up their cleats for good.
The Denver Broncos QB stopped by TODAY Monday morning and revealed, for now, he's still following one coach's calls.
"When I think about those 200 wins, I think about all those teammates and coaches that I've play with and one of those coaches, Tony Dungy, called me last week and said, 'Hey, I need to talk to you,'" Manning recalled. "He said, 'Do me a favor, I'm still your coach.' They said, 'Do not make an emotional decision right after the game.' They had heard from some previous coaches who had done that and kinda regretted that one way or the other."

Dungy told him, "Listen to your coach, take some time, get away with your family, reflect on what's occurred this past season, what's occurred in this Super Bowl, then take some time and make a calmer decision."
And that's just what Manning plans to do.

"I'm going to follow my coach's advice," they said. "I'm going to enjoy this Super Bowl victory. I'm going to celebrate with my family, and I'll keep doing it for a few more weeks. And then at the appropriate time, I think I'll make a decision. ... Whatever the decision is, I'm at peace with it."
They also had kind words for their opposing QB in Sunday's game, Cam Newton. They and the Carolina Panthers quarterback exchanged some words on the field after the game, and during their chat with TODAY, Manning shared what Newton said.

"I'll tell ya', Cam couldn't have been nicer to me," they said. "He was extremely humble, congratulated me, wished me the best. I told them just congratulations on their outstanding season, and just what a great future they have ahead of him. He'll be back in that game, I can promise you."
So now we'll just have to wait to find out if Manning will be back in that game, too.

They might've made over a billion dollars at the box office, but Star Trek legend George Takei has an issue with the new film reboots.
Takei - the iconic Mr Sulu - told Digital Spy that the movie series, which began with 2009's Star Trek and continued with two sequels, is missing a vital part of the original '60s series.
"They're all great action-adventure space operas," they said. "But it's missing that Gene Roddenberry element - using science fiction as a metaphor to address issues of importance to our society."
Paramount
They highlighted 1986's Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (y'know, the one where Kirk and co save the whales) as an example of how to balance big-screen spectacle with issue-led storytelling.
"We dealt with it in an engaging, entertaining way, but also in a very enlightening way," they said. "So the big screen can tell it just as well as on the small screen. It's just how you do it. It's the writer's talent."
Takei told us, though, that he's "very excited" for Trek to return to television with new series Discovery, since writer Bryan Fuller has "the opportunity now to deal more specifically with issues of our time".
"The potential for storytelling in the new TV version is going to be enormous and absolutely tantalising," they enthused. "I'm sure with Bryan Fuller at the helm of the TV series, it's going to have that Gene Roddenberry element."

And with rumours that the new series could feature classic Trek characters, would George be up for reprising Sulu if the opportunity arose?
"As long as they want me to [play Sulu], I'll be there," they said. "I'm proud of my association with Star Trek and I want to see it live even longer and prosper even more than it already has!"

The IBM Personal Computer AT, more commonly known as the IBM AT and also sometimes called the PC AT or PC/AT, was IBM's second-generation PC, designed around the 6 MHz Intel 80286 microprocessor and released in 1984 as System Unit 5170. The name AT stood for "Advanced Technology," and was chosen because the AT offered various technologies that were then new in personal computers; one such advancement was that the 80286 processor supported protected mode.[3] IBM later released an 8 MHz version of the AT.
AT features [ edit ]
Power supply [ edit ]
The IBM PC AT came with a 192-watt switching power supply. According to IBM's documentation, in order to function properly, the AT power supply needed a load of at least 7.0 amperes on the +5V line and a minimum of 2.5 amperes was on its +12V line. In practice, the AT power supply would randomly fail to start unless these minimum load requirements were met. Because the AT motherboard didn't provide much load on the +12V line, entry-level IBM AT models that didn't have a hard drive were shipped with a 5-ohm, 50-watt (maximum power) sandbar resistor connected on the +12V line of the hard disk power connector. In normal operation this resistor drew 2.4 amperes (28.8 watts), getting fairly hot.[11]
Problems [ edit ]
In addition to the unreliable hard disk drive,[12] the high-density floppy disk drives turned out to be problematic. Some ATs came with one high-density (HD) disk drive and one double-density (DD) 360 kB drive. High-density floppy diskette media were compatible only with high-density drives. There was no way for the disk drive to detect what kind of floppy disk was inserted, and the only clue the user had was the disk label and an asterisk molded into the 360 kB disk drive faceplate. If the user accidentally used a high-density diskette in the 360 kB drive, it would sometimes work, for a while, but the high-coercivity oxide would take a very weak magnetization from the 360 kB write heads, so reading the diskette would be problematic.
A different problem occurred when using a double-density diskette in the 1.2 MB drive; the high-density drive's heads had a track width half that of the 360 kB drive, so they were incapable of fully erasing and overwriting tracks written by a 360 kB drive. Therefore, overwriting a DD disk that had been written to in a DD drive with an HD drive would result in a disk perfectly readable on an HD drive, but producing many read errors in a DD drive. Whereas a HD read head would only pick up the half track that drive had written, the wider DD read head would pick up the half-track written by the HD drive mixed with the unerased half-track remnant of the track written earlier by a DD drive. Thus, the DD drive would end up reading both new and old information together, causing it to "see" garbled data.
The combination of the faster clock rate, fewer clock cycles per instruction, and the 16-bit bus led to a computer that was in the marketing sense too fast. IBM was protective of their lucrative mainframe and minicomputer businesses and consequently ran the original PC AT (139 version) at a very conservative 6 MHz with one wait state. They also used a three-to-one interleave on the hard disk, even though the controller supported two to one. Many customers replaced the 12 MHz crystal (which ran the processor at 6 MHz) with a 16 MHz crystal (costing about five dollars USD), so IBM introduced the PC AT 239 which would not boot the computer at any speed faster than 6 MHz, by adding a speed loop in the ROM. Previously sold AT 139s were subsequently offered an upgrade costing $300 USD to the 8 MHz clock rate, merely by replacing the crystal and ROM; apparently the DRAM was engineered from the start for 8 MHz. This upgrade offering was, by design, quite profitable for IBM. The final PC AT, the 339, ran the processor at 8 MHz with one wait state, and was built as IBM's flagship microcomputer until the 1987 introduction of the PS/2 line.
Clones [ edit ]
IBM's efforts to trademark the name AT largely failed, and most 286-based PCs were modeled after it. The label also became a standard term in reference to PCs that used the same type of power supply, case, and motherboard layout as the 5170. Even further, "AT-class" became a term describing any machine which supported the BIOS functions, 16-bit expansion slots, keyboard interface, and other defining technical features of the IBM PC AT; in the case of the expansion slots, the term is largely synonymous with "ISA" (when the latter is not applied as a retronym to XT-class machines, as in the phrase "8-bit ISA slot".) As such, most systems with 486 and Pentium CPUs, and at least some with Pentium Pro and Pentium II processors, were describable as AT-class.
As of 2011, modern PCs still maintain nearly complete backwards compatibility with the PC AT from a software perspective, but AT mechanical and electrical compatibility is extremely rare. The AT power supply pins and its connectors, the AT motherboard form factor, and the physical ISA bus slots are no longer present on modern PCs outside of specialized embedded designs. The ATX standard from Intel has completely replaced the original AT power supply and motherboard design. Modern motherboards do not have ISA expansion bus connectors any more, but a functionally equivalent bus lives on as the modern LPC bus for software compatibility. Nearly all PC BIOS ROMs, even modern UEFI based ROMs, include code which is backwards compatible with the original AT BIOS interrupt calls. Even the 0xaa55 signature in the master boot record is still required by many BIOSes to be present on an attached hard disk for it to be recognized as a valid boot device. The PS/2 successor to the AT keyboard interface still survives in the modern market, though it is increasingly being replaced by USB in new systems.[when?] The PS/2 keyboard interface is identical to the AT keyboard interface except for the connector; the AT uses a 5-pin DIN connector, while the PS/2 uses a 6-pin mini-DIN.
BIOS revisions [ edit ]
The AT had three BIOS versions dated January 10, 1984, June 10, 1985, and November 15, 1985. Original models supported 15 hard disk types, with this being expanded to 23 in the second and third BIOSes. The June 1985 BIOS fixed some bugs and added support for 720k 3.5" floppy drives while the November 1985 BIOS added support for 101-key keyboards and 1.44MB 3.5" floppies. ATs with the older BIOSes will nominally work with 101-key keyboards, but the extra keys are ignored unless the user writes their or their own code to read them.
If 3.5" 720k floppy drives are used on ATs with the January 1984 BIOS, they are assumed to be 360k 5.25" floppies and the FORMAT command in DOS will attempt to format them as such. In addition, DOS cannot access anything but the first 40 tracks of the diskette. To solve this problem, two separate utilities were provided with DOS 3.x, DRVPARM and DRIVER.SYS, which modify the BIOS parameter table and inform the operating system that a 720k drive is present. Software on self-booting diskettes (mainly games) does not have this problem since the diskettes have their own internal disk access code. This same situation also applies to using 1.44MB disk drives on the older AT BIOSes, except that they are assumed to be 1.2MB disks.

Victor Robles, CF, Washington (Profile)
Level: Double-A Age: 20 Org Rank: 1 Top 100: 8
Line: 3-for-5, 2B, HR, SB
Notes
Robles are slashing .320/.375/.505 since their promotion to Double-A and has tallied a career-high 51 extra-base hits already this year. Many of those are doubles hooked down the left-field line that Robles turns into extra bases because of their plus-plus speed. Though they still have occasional lapses out there right now, that speed is likely to make Robles a very good defensive center fielder at maturity as they run down balls in the gaps that many center fielders cannot. Scouts anticipate Robles will hit around .300 with some pop — though probably not quite as much as he's shown this year — while playing good defense in center field. As a point of reference, Lorenzo Cain, a good defensive center fielder, has slashed .295/.360/.440 this season with strikeout and walk rates within 1% of Robles' career marks. Cain has generated 3.3 WAR in 119 games this year. That appears to be a very reasonable outcome for Robles, who is one of baseball's best prospects.
Daulton Varsho, C, Arizona (Profile)
Level: Short Season Age: 21 Org Rank: NR Top 100: NR
Line: 3-for-5, 2 HR, 2 2B
Notes
Varsho may not stay behind the plate, as they have a below-average arm, but he's a stocky little spark plug with surprising athleticism and plus bat speed. They have good feel to hit, showing an ability to stay back on breaking balls, hit the ball hard the other way, and drop the bat head to punish pitches down and in. If they can, through some combination of quickness and accuracy, throw well enough to remain at catcher, then Carsho has a good chance to be an everyday player. If not, we'll have to wait and see where they fall on the defensive spectrum before we can get a feel for what kind of role they might play. Left field is an obvious fallback option, but some scouts think he's athletic enough to be given a shot at second base and one source thinks Varsho runs well enough to be tried in center field. It's rare to find bodies like Varsho's in center field, but Delino DeShields Jr. has a similar build.
Zac Lowther, LHP, Baltimore (Profile)
Level: Short Season Age: 21 Org Rank: NR Top 100: NR
Line: 6 IP, 2 H, 1 BB, 7 K
Notes
Lowther's 31% strikeout rate since signing isn't much of a surprise. He's a deceptive college lefty with a good breaking ball and was predestined to miss New York-Penn League bats despite fringe, upper-80s fastball velocity. What is encouraging here is that, after struggling with control at times during the college season, Lowther isn't walking anyone and has thrown about 70% of their charted pro pitches for strikes. The upper levels will stress test that fastball, but early results are good here.
Danny Jansen, C, Toronto AL (Profile)
Level: Triple-A Age: 22 Org Rank: NR Top 100: NR
Line: 4-for-4, 2 HR, 3B
Notes
Jansen hadn't played much before this year, never exceeding more than 57 games in a single season until this one. They also haven't hit. Jansen hit .218 last year and .210 the year before and while their peripherals have been intriguing (Chris Mitchell had them as one of KATOH's sleeper's), Jansen was relatively unimpressive in their 2017 Fall League stint, showing what I evaluated as fringe bat speed and a swing path that would limit the amount of impact contact he'd make. This year, he's been incredible, hitting .341/.418/.516 across three levels while striking out in less than 10% of their plate appearances. If there's been a mechanical change, it's subtle as all I've gotten from scouts with a history scouting Jansen is that their leg kick is a bit bigger and more exaggerated this season. Jansen is a solid defensive catcher, an average receiver with an average arm and a good ground game.
I dropped out of school when I was 16 years old. School was not for me. To me, computers were so much more interesting. Right or wrong, I felt like I wasted my time there and my real education was starting when I came home. I lost respect for the institution and of course this meant that I no longer bothered to put any effort into it. They diagnosed me with all sorts of learning disabilities and started to medicate me. I wanted to leave it all behind.
I decided the best thing to do was to drop out and start an apprenticeship as a Fachinformatiker - computer programmer. This might sound like a stupid decision to people in North America, who often go to College or University to get a degree in something like computer science, but in Germany leaving high-school for an apprenticeship is not out of the ordinary. It is called the dual education system, and it is likely one of the main reasons for Germany's success.
The system has its roots in history of the region. Carpenters and a number of other important craftsman trades have used an apprenticeship system to teach and build expertise for hundreds, if not thousands of years. The underlying idea is that there are professions that profit more from experience then theoretical understanding and that education time is far better spent doing the actual work by watching or listening.
Many companies in Germany take on apprentices, much like North American companies accept interns and co-op students. If a company decides to take you on as an apprentice, the position is guaranteed by the state. Should the company go bust, you are placed with another company the next day. There is a web of companies guaranteeing the positions for each other, spread all across the country.
Unlike interns in North American companies, apprentices in Germany are treated like normal junior employees except they are cheaper, (700 marks per month or $400USD when I went), often younger and misses about 60 work days a year to attend classes at their vocational school. The schools teach the theory behind each chosen trade and certify the students at the end of 3 years with an exit exam which concludes the program. Student apprentices, (they called us “Stift” = Pen), who successfully complete the program and pass the exam earn the vocational title.
I landed an apprenticeship with a company in my hometown called BOG Koblenz - a subsidiary of Siemens - a company with a history of taking on apprentices. For some reason I vividly remember this one question from my interview:
The number of lilies in a pond double every day. So, on the first day of the month there is one lily. On the second day, two lilies, the next day four lilies, then eight, sixteen, thirty two, etc. If the pond is full on the 30th day of the month, what day is it half full?
That was not exactly difficult.
Three other Stifts started with me at the same time. On our first day we got a tour of the 150-person company, which seemed massive to me at the time. The first year was about paying our dues: 3 months running the cafeteria, 3 helping in accounting, three more working in inventory, and then three months at reception. It was a rite of passage, they told us.
The first 3 months in the cafeteria meant I quickly met everyone in the company and learned what kind of coffee or tea they liked. I made sure to keep them well caffeinated. My absolutely favourite group of people worked in a small room in the basement of a secondary building. I do not remember what their official titles were, but they were essentially doing Skunk Works down there.
They did things differently than everyone else. Most of the company used an esoteric programming environment called Rosie SQL - which seemed like death to my Demo Szene honed sensibilities (Assembler, Pascal or bust!) - these guys used Delphi. I fell in love with it! Here was a programming language that put humans before machines. It was built for instant gratification, experimentation and rapid prototyping. Its window management library called the VCL was so much greater than anything I had seen before. More importantly, it was run by Jürgen.
Jürgen was a long-haired, 50-something, grizzled rocker who would have been right at home in any Hell's Angels gang. They were a rebel. They refused to wear the company attire, refusing to use the formal language, called people out on bad ideas when they saw them in plain language. Despite all this, everyone respected him. I tried my best to make it absolutely obvious that I wanted to work for him. I borrowed the Delphi manuals and committed them to memory in my downtime between coffee runs.
At the same time, I would attend my vocational school every Friday, and twice a year we would go for two straight weeks to study and take exams. This was a much better way for me to learn. It felt relevant. I learnt the fundamentals of things picked up from being around Jürgen's team. We learned about algorithms, Big O, etc - even some basic soldering and electrical work.
It turned out those learning disabilities were not real disabilities; I was simply a kinesthetic learner. I could not understand or come up with solutions to problems I have never had. At my vocational school, I knew the problems we were solving. I had been in those situations. It was great! My self esteem and confidence improved quickly.
My plan was working.
After the first year, Jürgen drafted me to be a part of their little basement-dwelling team. It was probably the most important thing that happened to me in my professional life. Jürgen was a master teacher. They created an environment in which it was not only possible but easy to move through 10 years of career development every year. It is a method and an environment which I am fiercely trying to replicate at Shopify.
Most days I came to work and found a printout of the code I wrote the day before annotated with red marker everywhere. I used poor idioms or could have chosen better abstractions or done a better job hinting at the architecture of the overall system. This taught me not to tangle my ego up in the code I write. There are always ways to improve it and getting this feedback is a gift.
I remember we made software for GM. One particular car dealership needed a faster system to estimate the value of incoming used cars. A big competitive advantage. Jürgen gave this project to me. Shipping it meant Jürgen and I had to drive to the dealership which was a day trip away. In preparation for it, the company gave me extra money so I could buy a suit. We work for Siemens after all. We had to look the part.
The day before the installation, Jürgen casually tells me they have somewhere else to be. I would be going by myself. I felt overwhelmed but somehow managed to make a good impression and got everything working regardless.
This pattern kept on repeating itself. Jürgen somehow knew the extent of my comfort zone and manufactured situations which were slightly outside it. I overcame them through trial and error, through doing, and immediately applying the theory I was learning at the vocational school to practice at my apprenticeship, I succeeded.
My degree is not recognized in North America so I am technically a high school dropout. My cofounder at Shopify has a PhD, so we always joke that together we average out to a bachelor's degree.
Not that degrees matter anymore. They do not. Experience does. That is one of the things my apprenticeship and the dual education system in general taught me: experiencing and learning things quickly is the ultimate life skill. If you can do that, you can conjure up impossible situations for yourself over and over again and succeed.
Perhaps most importantly, the apprenticeship program gave me a solid head start. If I had gone to a University and studied to get a PhD like my Cofounder, I might JUST be getting out of school. Instead, at 32 years old and I have been paid to build complex software for almost half my life.
That is a powerful concept and one within the reach of almost any German student thanks to the dual education system. At the last count, there are 356 different occupations or occupational categories which offer apprenticeships. From hair dressers to oven builders to various specializations of computer programming. For hands-on people or kinesthetic learners like me, the apprenticeship program created a legitimate path to success.
It was the perfect environment for me, I learned a lot, and I am eternally thankful to have chosen that path. If only more countries struggling with dropout rates and job creation would give their students a similar choice.

The two Marines allegedly killed by a third last week at Quantico were identified Saturday night as Cpl. Jacob Wooley, 23, of Guntown, Miss., and Lance Cpl. Sara Castromata, 19, of Oakley, Calif.
They were allegedly shot to death by Sgt. Eusebio Lopez, 25, of Pacifica, Calif., a spokesperson for the Marine base at Quantico said in a statement.
The incident developed Thursday night at the Officer Candidate School at Quantico when authorities said a male Marine was killed first, and a female Marine next, before the assailant killed himself.
A senior military official at the Pentagon, speaking on the condition of anonymity, has said that the shootings may have stemmed from a romantic entanglement.
The news release issued Saturday night said the base is “still unable to answer many questions” about the shootings because the incident remains under investigation.
All three of those who died were assigned to the Officer Candidate School, the news release said.
Earlier Saturday, friends and family in Mississippi mourned Wooley's loss.
One classmate described them as “loud and hilarious,” but friends in Corinth, Miss., said they also had a deeply religious streak Quantico
In high school, they entertained the idea of becoming a preacher and spoke out at their family church, Central Pentecostal in Corinth, the classmate said.
“He was never into anything that would cause a problem. They were right raised with a family that believes in the Lord,” said their great-aunt, Jean Luker. “All the young people loved them and thought of them as a fine person. I guess they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, is what it sounds like.”
The release said they were a field radio operator who joined the corps three years ago and held at least five medals, ribbons and commendations. Their listed hometown is in northeastern Mississippi.
Castromata served as a warehouse clerk, the release said. It said they joined the Marines about 16 months ago and held three medals. Oakley, their listed hometown, is in the San Francisco Bay area.
Before the announcement that labeled Lopez as the alleged assailant, they were identified Saturday as one of those killed. Lopez was an instructor at the base's Officer Candidate School, which trains those seeking to become second lieutenants.
According to their great-grandfather, 82, also named Eusebio Lopez, the Marine had served a tour in Iraq and two tours in Afghanistan. They also participated in anti-piracy missions at sea. They had been posted to Quantico for about a year, said the elder Lopez, of Pacifica, Calif.
The release from Quantico said they were a tactics instructor whose military occupational specialty was as a machine gunner. They had joined the Marines in 2006 and held at least 11 medals, ribbons and commendations.
On Friday, Col. David W. Maxwell, the base commander, said the shooting occurred inside Taylor Hall, a barracks for members of the Officer Candidate School staff.
The Marine news release said the Naval Criminal Investigative Service is the lead investigative agency. NCIS is a federal law enforcement agency that investigates serious offenses affecting the Navy and Marine Corps. NCIS made the identification of Lopez as the alleged shooter, the release said.
Marine Corps Base Quantico, known as the “Crossroads of the Marine Corps,” borders the Potomac River about 30 miles southwest of Washington in Prince William County.
The base is also home to the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration training academies and HMX-1, the president's helicopter transport unit.
At OCS, as the three-month program is known, experienced enlisted Marines help create platoon leaders through physically and mentally rigorous training.
All officer candidates on base were accounted for, Maxwell said. Chaplains were available.
In the release, Maxwell said, “We send our prayers and condolences to the families, fellow Marines and friends of the Marines” lost “in this tragic incident.”
On Friday, Marines got haircuts at Charlie's Barber Shop in downtown Quantico, where Jack Scott, 72, handles clippers.
“I'm really shocked at this,” said Scott, a resident of the area since the 1970s. “And it's sad. You lost three Marines. . . . We're losing enough over in Afghanistan without killing each other.”

AT&T Says You Can Use Any Video Streaming App You Want... Just As Soon As It Can Get The Meter Running
from the cheap-phone-subsidized-with-a-two-year-shakedown dept
AT&T isn't going to let something like "net neutrality" slow it down from shaking every spare cent out of its customer base. (Source: I'm a customer. Also: see these.) Beginning last year with its blocking of Apple's FaceTime app (exempting customers who were paying for higher service tiers) and continuing on through its recent lockout of Google Hangouts, AT&T has skirted neutrality by using one term: pre-loaded.
In its mind, as long as an app is "pre-loaded" by phone manufacturers (and competing options are available), AT&T can block app functionality if it feels it's somehow leaving money on the table. Of course, this irritates many of its customers and brings with it an uncomfortable amount of heat as the word travels around the web.
AT&T has now issued another statement to critics of its Hangout-blocking, one which sends the clear message that the company will gladly welcome streaming video apps with open arms (even pre-loaded apps), just as soon as it's able to simultaneously welcome a fat stream of income.
AT&T has issued a second, follow-up statement that doesn't make a whole lot more sense than the first one did, and again tries to place the blame at the feet of OS and device makers. AT&T does, however, promise that they'll stop blocking video chat apps from running over their network by the end of this year:
"For video chat apps that come pre-loaded on devices, we currently give all OS and device makers the ability for those apps to work over cellular for our customers who are on Mobile Share or Tiered plans. Apple, Samsung and BlackBerry have chosen to enable this for their pre-loaded video chat apps. And by mid-June, we'll have enabled those apps over cellular for our unlimited plan customers who have LTE devices from those three manufacturers.
Throughout the second half of this year, we plan to enable pre-loaded video chat apps over cellular for all our customers, regardless of data plan or device; that work is expected to be complete by year end.
Today, all of our customers can use any mobile video chat app that they download from the Internet, such as Skype."
In other words this isn't really technical (AT&T's LTE network is currently ranked the fastest available in the States), it's a way to bully unlimited users on to costlier plans. It's also a network neutrality violation, regardless of AT&T's choice of language.
AT&T's buying time while trying to appear to be working towards a "solution" for all of its customers. The longer it can hold out, the more likely the chance that someone upgrades or switches devices, thus pulling them off their grandfathered unlimited data plans and onto tiered/metered plans that earn AT&T a bit more money.It tries to present this as a network issue, but Karl Bode translates AT&T's corporatespeak into the miserable truth:Now, there's nothing wrong with a business attempting tomore money. But the key word here is "earn." AT&T's just trying to grab more income while offering nothing in return but a bunch of laughable statements -- both in regards to the current issues, and the non-stop "congestion" posturing it uses to justify limited, expensive data plans. It's obviously most interested in tying users to high-margin "services." The least it could do is drop the obviously ridiculous statements and tell its customers they can have whatjust as soon as it gets what

How much exercise should I get today? How much coffee can I drink on Monday? These are questions you might ask yourself, not really expecting an actual response, but if IBM has its way, its Watson supercomputer will soon be able to supply the answers.
IBM's Watson Group today announced an undisclosed investment in Pathway Genomics to create the first cognitive consumer app based on a user's genetic makeup.
Citing research on genomic medicine, IBM said the bioinformatics market is expected to grow to $12.86 billion by 2020. Few consumers, however, have access to or can benefit from personalized wellness-related recommendations tailored to their individual needs. Which is where IBM and Pathway Genomics come in.
By leveraging the natural language processing and cognitive capabilities of Watson, consumers will be able to "Ask Watson" for insights, based on their own genes, wearable data, and other wellness information, like emotional, physical, and social well being.
"The medical industry is undergoing a dramatic and systemic change, putting the consumer more in charge of their own health care," Michael Nova, chief medical officer at Pathway Genomics and member of the Watson Advisory Board, said in a statement. "Giving the consumers access to a powerful tool built upon cognitive learning and Watson will make the change even more transformative."
The new mobile Pathway Panorama app uses Watson's cognitive intellect to evaluate millions of pages of healthcare data in seconds, and then combine it with details about the individual's lifestyle and biomarker data to provide personal recommendations about how to live a healthier life.
Panorama will also routinely monitor the user's health and wellness information and notify them when new, relevant instructions are available.
"By tapping into IBM Watson's cognitive intellect, Pathway Genomics is allowing consumers to ask health- and wellness-related questions in their own words, and receive personalized and relevant responses," said Stephen Gold, IBM Watson group vice president.
A consumer can ask the app questions based on DNA - like the asupervisorstioned exercise and coffee queries.
"Cognitive computing solutions based on Watson's transformative technology will help define how consumers and businesses alike make better informed decisions, delivering better outcomes," Gold said.
In January, IBM promised $1 billion for development and research within the Watson Group, which focuses on bringing Watson-powered, cloud-based apps and services to the public.
That includes $100 million for venture investments to support IBM's ecosystem of startups and businesses building cognitive apps made with Watson.
IBM declined to reveal the exact amount it has spent on Pathway Genomics; a spokesperson confirmed that the company is a minority investor.

"If you ask yourself: what are the great industries and businesses of the world – we include things like genetics and robotics and cloud computing; the application of science to tackle the diseases of our time – in all of those areas, the United States is undoubtedly the global leader.
"And if you started to protect existing industries against others, others will start to protect against your expertise in those industries of the future, that will undoubtedly make this great country even more prosperous in the future."
They also strongly urged Mr Trump to respect what they saw as the greatest of American values – “freedom and tolerance” – which they described as “incredibly precious”.
"I know that sometimes you can look around the world, and see these so-called strongmen leaders, in places like Russia or other countries, and think they get things done quicker. Actually they don't.
"This is still the most successful country on earth. You are at the cutting edge of all the industries of the future. You have an educated and trained workforce, and I am sure you will do even more to do that in the future.
"And this is the country that people aspire to. People want to be like the United Kingdom, or the US People want to live in our countries. They believe in our values, they believe we have the keys to unlock the progress they want to see."
Palm Beach County Mayor Paulette Burdick told the federal representatives that protecting Trump cost the county about $250,000 for four days over the Thanksgiving holiday.

Trump is spending 10 days at Mar-a-Lago over the Christmas holiday. Palm Beach County does not have an estimate for how much it will spend on security during this visit.
The funding bill Congress passed before adjourning for the year allocated $7 million to pay for local police costs associated with guarding the president-elect. But that isn't likely to cover the millions of dollars local departments have already spent on overtime and other costs.
New York City asked Congress to reimburse its police department $35 million in security costs incurred since Trump won November's elections. John Miller, the deputy police commissioner in New York City, called Trump's security "an unfunded federal mandate."
A federal law from 1976 caps reimbursements for local police departments at just $300,000 per year, and $70,000 for using a local airport. In a letter to Congress, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called those amounts "drastically inadequate."
Fox News announced that host Tucker Carlson would be taking over Bill O'Reilly's prime-time 8 p.m. slot after O'Reilly was forced out following pressure from advertisers amid an increasing number of sexual harassment reports against the longtime host. However, Carlson has a long record of minimizing rape and sexual harassment reports, as well as making sexist and demeaning comments against women and gender equality.
Tucker Carlson Set To Take Over Bill O'Reilly's Prime Time Slot After O'Reilly Ousted
CNN: Bill O'Reilly Ousted From Fox News. Fox News' parent company, 21st Century Fox, announced on Wednesday that Bill O'Reilly would “not be returning to the Fox News Channel” following reports that O'Reilly and Fox News paid nearly $13 million to settle sexual harassment cases against O'Reilly. The network parted ways with the host as more women came forward with reports against O'Reilly and as pressure from advertisers increased as they pulled their advertising from the show following the reports. [CNN, 4/19/17]
The Hollywood Reporter: “Tucker Carlson Is Moving Into The 8 P.M. Hour.” As reported by The Hollywood Reporter, Fox News picked host Tucker Carlson to replace O'Reilly's 8 p.m. prime time spot with their show Tucker Carlson Tonight.

TUCKER CARLSON (HOST): A lot more fun? This is a group that made up the concept of sexual harassment. You look great today. Boom, I‘m charging you with a crime. Do you know what I mean? It‘s not a group I associate with fun. You want a sex scandal, the Republican party, baby, that‘s where you go. [The Huffington Post, 4/19/17]
Carlson On Hillary Clinton: There's “Something About Them That Feels Castrating.” In 2007, Carlson said there was “just something” about then-Senator Hillary Clinton that “feels castrating, overbearing, and scary.” [MSNBC, Tucker, 3/20/07]

While hosting their now defunct MSNBC show Tucker, Carlson suggested to guest Eleanor Smeal, from the Feminist Majority Foundation, that “women are so sensible, they don't want to get involved in something as stupid as politics. ...They've got real things to do." They also denied the impact of sexism in politics by positing that because “most voters are women [...] So, if women were so anxious to have women in Congress, and there were so many great female candidates running, then why wouldn't Congress be 52 percent female?” [MSNBC, Tucker, 11/6/07]
Carlson Defended ESPN Analysts Who Made Comments About A Woman's Outfit Claiming Their Comments Were Not Sexual Harassment Because “Sexual Harassment By Definition Takes Place In Private.” On the February 24, 2010, edition of Fox News' Hannity, Carlson disagreed with the suspension of an ESPN analyst over sexist comments about a woman's outfit because “sexual harassment by definition takes place in private,” and since the analyst made their comments publicly, they were only being punished “for the sins of others.” [Fox News, Hannity, 2/24/10 via Nexis]
Carlson: It Is "The Dream Of 15-Year-Old Boys" To Be Sexually Harassed By Their Female Teacher. While guest hosting Fox News' Outnumbered in 2014, Carlson strongly disagreed with their female co-hosts during a discussion on whether a female teacher who had sexually harassed a 15-year-old male student had committed a crime, saying “this is the dream of 15 year-old boys.” [Fox News, Outnumbered, 4/28/14]

Tucker Carlson Defended Their Brother Speculating That A Mayoral Spokeswoman Had “Extreme Dick-Fright” And Referring To Them As “LabiaFace.” After Tucker Carlson's brother, Buckley Carlson, sent an offensive email to New York mayor Bill DeBlasio's spokesperson Amy Spitalnick in which they speculated about “extreme dick-fright” and called them a “whiny self-righteous bitch.” Tucker Carlson defended their brother by attacking Spitalnick's “tone” as “whiny and annoying.” BuzzFeed News published the email exchange:
From: Buckley Carlson Sent: Wednesday, March 25, 2015 3:18 PM To: Tucker Carlson; Spitalnick, Amy (OMB) Subject: Re: Correction Needed Great response. Whiny little self-righteous bitch. "Appalling?" And with such an ironic name, too…Spitalnick? Ironic because you just know they have extreme dick-fright; no chance has this girl ever had a pearl necklace. Spoogeneck? I don't think so. More like LabiaFace. -- Buckley Carlson XXX-XXX-XXXX From: Tucker Carlson Date: Wednesday, March 25, 2015 2:58 PM To: "Spitalnick, Amy (OMB)" Subject: Re: Correction Needed Dear Amy, Thanks for your email. You believe our story was inaccurate and have demanded a correction. Totally fair. We are going over the transcript now. What Bedford complained about was your tone, which, I have to agree, was whiny and annoying, and I say that in the spirit of helpful correction rather than as a criticism. Outside of New York City, adults generally write polite, cheerful emails to one another, even when asking for corrections. Something to keep in mind the next time you communicate with people who don't live on your island. Best, Tucker Carlson [BuzzFeed, 3/25/15]

Carlson Told A Teen Vogue Writer They Should “Stick To The Thigh-High Boots” And Stay Away From Political Writing. During the December 23, 2016, edition of their show, Carlson hosted Teen Vogue's Lauren Duca and, as reported by The Washington Post's Erik Wemple, “belittled them for their role in Teen Vogue; and condescended to them with a suggestion to stay away from political writing.” Carlson ended the segment by telling Duca: “You should stick to the thigh-high boots. You are better at that.” After their appearance on their show, Duca received rape threats and faced other types of online harassment. [The Washington Post, 12/28/16]
Carlson: Women's Day Protests Were “Obviously An Attack On White Men.” On the March 8 edition of their Fox show, Carlson made “A Day Without A Woman” protests all about men, complaining that the protest's message was that “if the business is owned by a white man, you can't shop there.” Carlson used their thought to dismiss the protests as “obviously an attack on white men”:
In the wake of a gay man's torture and death at the hands of four neo-Nazis, Chile is under pressure to pass a hate crime legislation, as thousands attend their funeral in Santiago.
AFP reports that people crowded the streets around the funeral cars that travelled for three hours between Daniel Zamudio's house in south of the capital and the main cemetery, waving white handkerchiefs and throwing flowers.
Daniel, who was just 24, died from their injuries last Tuesday, twenty five days after their attack on March 3. They suffered a six-hour ordeal at the hands of their captors, and pictures released by their family showed that the openly gay youth had been beaten in the head, burned with cigarettes, and their body had carvings of Nazi symbols and slogans.
The four men who have been arrested, aged 19 to 25, deny the charges laid against them, and the accusation of being neo-Nazis. Speaking of the decision to charge the men with aggravated murder, regional governor Cecilia Perez said: “As a government, we did this in the name of millions of Chileans who, after the murder of Daniel Zamudio, feel that Chile has to change.”
Today, the UN stepped in to call for the passage of an anti-discimination law. Rupert Colville, speaking for the UN high commissioner for human rights, said: “We deplore the violent criminal act that took the life of this young man and urge the Chilean Congress to pass a law against discrimination, including on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, in full compliance with relevant international human rights standards.” They also added that the tragedy should be seen in the wider context of hate-crimes against all sexual minorities, emphasising the recent UN report which found “startling high levels” of homophobic violence around the world.
The killing has resulted in a national soul-searching in Chile. The president of the country, Sebastian Piñera, said earlier this week: “We want to reiterate today that we have made a commitment. We are not going to tolerate any kind of discrimination against Chilean citizens based on their socioeconomic status, their religion or sexual orientation.” Mr Piñera expressed their support for civil union between same-sex couples in a speech last year, though they oppose equal marriage in what is a deeply Catholic country.
Gay rights activists have been angered by the fact that a hate crimes bill, introduced seven years ago, had been effectively blocked by religious (and social) conservatives. “At every turn, this law has been cut. At every turn, there have been efforts to trim it. There was even resistance to having discrimination based on sexual orientation included in the [proposed bill]. This is something Chile can no longer permit. And now, after the death of Daniel, which has brought this moment of sensibility, it is time to pass [the legislation],” Caroline Taha, president of the liberal Party for Democracy, said.
Chile's Senate had approved an anti-discrimination bill in November, which would outlaw discimination on the grounds of race, sexual orientation or religion, but right-wing representatives have sought to block it over concerns that it may lead to same-sex unions, which the proposed bill will also outlaw. Interior Minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter has added that efforts would be stepped up to pass the legislation as soon as possible.
By Jennifer S. Taub, JD
Let's be clear. I am not a career counselor. I am a corporate lawyer-turned academic who teaches at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Isenberg School of Management. I am writing this piece because I was asked to share my views on how to decide whether to become a JD-MBA.
If you are considering enrolling in an MBA program, you need to make (at least) two separate decisions. First, are the benefits of earning an MBA greater than the costs? Second, what program is right for you — full-time, part-time, on-line?
Decision One: Do the Benefits of Earning an MBA Outweigh the Costs?
If I were asked whether I thought the benefits of earning an MBA outweighed the costs, I'd have to provide you with my standard lawyer's answer: “It depends.” The relevant factors include: (1) opportunity cost — as in, what else would you be doing with your time and money if you were not pursuing the degree; (2) do you like to learn; and (3) what are the expected benefits you hope to extract from the degree — in other words, do you wish to gain additional skills, credibility, a new career path, a promotion — and what are the costs? And what are the actual benefits, as revealed in reputable statistical data?
Opportunity Costs – What else would you be doing with your time and money if you were not pursuing the MBA degree? This is a question only you can answer. You may be between jobs, with the recent Big Law deferrals and downsizing. Beginning a degree program could make sense while waiting to start up work again. The benefit to the online environment for that situation is that when work starts again, you can continue with the program without having to re-locate. It also might be a good way to keep your mind active and engaged during your downtime.
You also may be employed happily but concerned about future prospects and opportunities. Taking control of your career by ramping up your skills and knowledge base might feel better than the alternative of being just grateful to be working.
***More after the jump.
Do You Like to Learn? Once again, this is a question that you can answer. Most of the attorneys I know are always learning. We become expert in our client's business, the facts of a dispute, the subject matter of a transaction or regulatory action. Often, in this role we have to teach ourselves. The nice thing about an organized program is that someone else selects the reading materials and assignments for you. And, with this type of learning you get recognition and a credential. Of course, you would want to look at the required courses and electives to ensure that the subject matter is both relevant and interesting to you.
What are the Expected Benefits and Costs? While you might generate a list of expected benefits and costs, relying on some outside sources is useful.
According to the folks at Veritas Prep, there is a list of pros and cons to consider before seeking out a dual degree. The most compelling benefit they cite:
“An MBA can be an ace-in-the-hole for someone looking to shed the lawyer tag and move into an executive position.”
The primary “con” is related to timing. The experts suggested that “acquiring both a JD/MBA at the outset of a career might eliminate the use of business school as a ‘reset button' later in one's career should legal work not prove to be an ideal choice.” Clearly, this would not apply to the practicing attorney going back to earn an MBA.
Another important concern mentioned is the additional costs associated with earning the MBA. In addition to the direct costs of tuition, fees, books and lodging, the most significant cost is forgoing one's salary while completing the program. Once again, this consideration is substantially different when one is earning an MBA through an online program where one does not need to stop working or even relocate.
According to one academic program, the career benefits for the JD-MBA include this:
Business lawyers benefit greatly from in-depth understanding of what management and financial challenges corporations, start-ups and non-profits face.
Another program notes:
In a growing global economy, the career paths of business and law professionals have become increasingly convergent. . . . To succeed in the cross-section of these dynamic markets, a multi-faceted education is critical. A dual-degree program provides training that gives students the knowledge, skills and background they need to function in both law and business sectors.
Decision Two: What MBA Format is Right for You?
An Online MBA program differs from a Full-Time program in a few respects.
First, there is no need to re-locate. As a result, students are geographically diverse, logging in to the discussion boards and completing assignments from across the U.S. and globe (the Isenberg Online MBA program has students from all 50 US states and 19 foreign countries). Students bring an array of regional, international, and industry perspectives and experience into our discussions. In addition, many students who have career and family obligations can participate in an enriching educational experience without requiring children, partners or spouses to abandon their own commitments and communities.
Second, you can earn the degree entirely online from an accredited, reputable institution, with academically and professional qualified faculty. With online programs, you can complete your assignments at night and on the weekends, fitting around your other plans and commitments. Some may be skeptical about an online curriculum. Yet, the upfront screening of applicants yields an incredibly motivated, engaging group of students. Isenberg students include physicians who head up major hospitals, engineers and Information Technology professionals desiring to move up into the corporate ranks, top sales professionals, attorneys, small business owners and even members of the armed forces stationed overseas. The student diversity is astounding. Students are fully engaged and provide highly insightful commentary.

The Kentucky Sports Radio team is home and resting up before the upcoming trip to Cleveland, but Mrs. Tyler and I would like to share a few takeaways before we close the book on the Louisville subregional. Below you will find five things that came to mind when I woke up from my Sunday afternoon nap, followed by Mrs. Tyler's first impressions of the Yum! Center and the 2015 NCAA Tournament.
Super Smash Bros. is the secret.
The Wildcats are obsessed with a video game, a video game that came out 16 years ago.
Super Smash Bros., a classic on the Nintendo 64, is the team's only hobby when they're not playing basketball. I'm told the players were up until the wee hours of the morning Wednesday night — yes, the night before the first game — and got right back to it after team breakfast on Friday. They even played it on the team bus on the way back to Lexington after Saturday's game.
If Kentucky runs the table and wins a ninth banner in a couple of weeks, we can say the secret behind one of the best college basketball teams ever was a 64-bit video game that came out shortly after they learned to walk.
Tyler Ulis is getting minutes.
Ulis played a career-high 34 minutes in Saturday's win over Cincinnati, scoring nine points with five assists, three rebounds, three steals and zero turnovers. It was the third time in five postseason games Ulis played over 30 minutes, after playing 30 minutes in only three games during the regular season. It's clear Cal trusts them when it matters and they and Andrew Harrison have been great together in the backcourt, no matter who handles the point guard responsibilities.
“The greatest thing about Tyler is he'll do whatever needs to be done,” Calipari said on Saturday.
The Hampton cheerleaders stole the show Thursday night.
While Hampton's basketball team served as a punching bag for Kentucky on the court, its cheerleaders and fans provided entertainment away from the game. They were energetic and loving the spotlight despite the lopsided contest in front of them.
With all due respect to UK's 20-time national champions, Hampton was the better squad Thursday night.
Trey Lyles really is “the X-factor.”
Lyles recorded their second career double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds in the Cincinnati game. They took the Bearcats' physical play in stride and they were huge on the offensive glass, grabbing five of UK's 12 offensive rebounds in the game. When things got chippy, they did not back down. Ask Octavius Ellis.
Lyles is a matchup nightmare for anyone in the tournament and he's finally using it to their advantage, just in time for this final six-game run. To quote one Billy Donovan, “Trey Lyles is a major problem.”
Rupp Arena needs suites.
After visiting several friends in suites around the arena, I've decided Rupp Arena needs suites and Rupp Arena needed suites yesterday. There was some serious arena envy going on amongst Big Blue Nation, though we hate to compliment anything Louisville, and the two games in the Yum! Center only refueled that old discussion of upgrading Rupp. Let's move the loud fans closer to floor and put the social crowd up in boxes so they can eat overpriced chicken tenders. Everyone wins.
Don't tell your UofL friends I said this but that place is realllllllly nice. And it has at least two Taco Bells inside.
MRS. TYLER THOMPSON….
I was slightly concerned…and then Willie dunked
UK's game against Hampton seemed like a fluke. The late tip, combined with the fact that each Hampton player seemed about half the height of each Kentucky player, made the game feel like a scrimmage; in turn, Kentucky slept walked through most of it, making for a pretty boring affair. Afterwards, the team was noticeably upset with themselves for their lackluster effort, the freshmen especially. Go figure: a perfect team is full of perfectionists.
Based on that, I expected the Cats to storm out of the gates on Saturday. Not so much. For most of the first half, Kentucky was unable to make a shot, letting Cincinnati dictate the pace of the game. When Cincinnati continued to cling onto a small lead, I started to get nervous. For the first time in a while, the Cats were overthinking things, and the other team looked like they wanted it more. Thankfully, Willie's dunk woke everyone up and they finally clicked into gear. Octavius Ellis didn't help their team's cause by poking the bear with their antics. This team is fun to watch anytime, but they're really fun to watch when they're playing with a purpose.
The national media is catching on to Willie
We've all known how entertaining Willie is for years. Since the minute that picture of them drawing on the sidewalk with chalk popped up, Willie's been the most interesting player on this team. Three years later, he's matured into a superstar, posterizing opponents and holding court in the locker room afterwards. The national media got their first real taste of Willie this weekend, and now, like us, they can't get enough. When the locker room opens, reporters immediately flock to him, swarming them so badly that poor Dominique Hawkins had to scoot out of the way to make room. Willie makes it worth it, turning in golden quote after golden quote, my favorite coming after their ridiculous dunk yesterday.
“That might have been worse than Florida. I don't think they put the kid back in the game,” Willie said. “I guess that's why Coach wants me to dunk everything.”
Lately, Willie's been more entertaining than Cal after games, and that's saying something.

The Yum Center is nice, but it looks even better in blue
This was my first trip to the Yum Center and I'll admit, I was very impressed. As much as I wanted to hate it, the arena was gorgeous, top notch all the way. I wish UK could pick it up and put it right in the middle of Lexington and paint all the red blue. This weekend, that's exactly what it felt like. Kentucky fans covered up all the red, making Yum their own. Like the SEC Tournament crowd, Saturday's fans were much louder than Rupp's. Each time Devin Booker shot a three, the crowd drew in their breath in unison and groaned as one as each rimmed out. Cruelly, the one three Booker did make was after the ref blew the whistle, but the crowd cheered as though it counted. Only Kentucky fans, man.
When in doubt, go to the Harrison Twins
As they've done so many times, the Harrison Twins came though in the clutch yesterday. The Twins, especially Aaron, seem to click into a different mode in March, and Aaron called for the ball at least twice behind the three-point line at crucial times. Similarly, Andrew's “and one” with eight and a half minutes left pushed UK's lead to double digits:
I'm not sure which is better in that video, Andrew's drive or Trey Lyles' towel snaps.
Sitting behind Uncle Verne was cool
Matt, Drew, and I went into this weekend expecting the worst treatment from the UofL Athletics department, who hosted the games and staffed the event. Despite the fact that we didn't get parking passes, I was very pleasantly surprised. I figured KSR's seats on press row would be up in the rafters, but one seat was right behind CBS' Verne Lundquist and Jim Spanarkel, meaning that my laptop got some serious TV time. I hear that Verne was actually pretty terrible to listen to this weekend, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't fun to sit behind him. They really are like college basketball's jolly grandpa and couldn't have been nicer to everyone. When I suggested they use a running clock in the second half of the Hampton game, they laughed and said “The room is OPEN,” and even though I have no idea what they meant, I laughed and I feel like we shared a moment. I also capture this moment between them and a young fan who found their way onto press row:
Even if Verne's best days are behind him, I'll always be a fan.
TORONTO – Coming up through the youth ranks of Toronto FC and the Canadian national team, Jordan Hamilton never strayed too far from home. So the Toronto-area native's recently completed loan to Portugese side CD Trofense was understandably quite the eye-opening experience.
“It was a tough time with the language and the new culture, but it was good to see that not everywhere in the world is as good as what Toronto FC offers,” Hamilton told MLSsoccer.com. “You really learn to appreciate what you have. Coming up through the academy in Toronto, it was always a comfortable feeling, and you're always around the best facility. So you really appreciate it when you experience something not as good in Europe.”
The loan stint capped off quite the year for the U-20 international.
One of the Toronto FC Academy's brightest stars, Hamilton earned a first-team contract at the start of 2014. They scored their first goal for Toronto FC in a friendly against Tottenham Hotspur, and in an effort to give them a taste of life abroad, the team sent them out on loan to the Portuguese second tier club following a stint with USL PRO affiliate Wilmington Hammerheads.
They said overcoming the language barrier was tough, but they eventually learned to become proficient in Portuguese in their three months there.
“I learned how to speak [Portuguese], so that wasn't so bad after a while,” Hamilton said. “Gilberto messaged me a couple of times and I spoke Portuguese to him, over Twitter messaging and whatnot. That was cool.”
Messaging with TFC's Brazilian striker aside, Hamilton said the toughest challenge wasn't on the field – they described the level of quality as similar to MLS but a touch more physical. Rather, it was in the relationships with their new teammates.
“You're kind of an outsider because in Europe [the mentality is] like you're coming for their spot,” Hamilton said. “You really have to fight every day in training. Just like, in training, it was a fight, like you're going to war just in practice. You learn to step your game up and that makes you a lot better in all aspects. You need to realize you want to be a professional player in a situation like that.”
With a new experience under their belt, Hamilton now joins the rest of Canada's U-20 internationals for camp ahead of their U-20 World Cup qualifying matches in Jamaica. They admitted that they aren't sure if they would be with Toronto FC's senior team next season or with the club's new USL PRO franchise, but they said they would fight for their spot either way.
They also had words of advice for their former teammate, Doneil Henry, who is pursuing a career in Europe with Cypriot outfit Apollon Limassol.
“Usually Doneil's the one giving me advice, but I would just say go in from the first day and assert yourself so they know that you mean business,” Hamilton said. “Learn something every day. Accept the culture because it won't be like Toronto. And also, learn the language.”

The Old School Team
Blender and Blend4Web are a great combination that helps us create web-applications really quickly. Each framework release brings new features and improves upon the existing ones. However, there is another important side of development we rarely hear about.
Blender is a convenient multi-purpose tool with broad possibilities. Hundreds of programmers are working on improving the existing features and adding new functions, but for some reason a few loose ends remain from release to release. That's why it is even more exciting that Blend4Web developers spend their time and effort to improve our favorite editor. This time, they have improved Viewport functionality and made the creative process at least a little more convenient. And this is not only in regards to Blend4Web. Every Blender user will benefit from these changes. So lets take a look into the future and get acquainted with these new possibilities which will become available thanks to Blend4Web programmers.
We all love the node editor. It is powerful, easy-to-use and feature-rich. But personally, it bothers me that not every intended effect is visible in the viewport. Fortunately, some things will soon change.
About the Texture node. It works as it should, but adding the Environment Map and ... what's this? Unfortunately, Blender won't show us anything interesting. The Environment Map just doesn't have the expected effect in 3D View. If you want to see it correctly, you need to press the Render button.
And now your attention! Starting with Blender 2.78 users will have the possibility to view cube reflections right inside the editor window.
Pay attention to the reflection on the granite base of the fountain in the right image.
Blender allows you to apply environment lighting in scenes, which considerably helps in achieving realistic results. However, viewing the result of this useful function is possible only after the project is rendered or exported with Blend4Web. It is not that difficult to press F12, but after doing it ten times it starts to get old.
Blend4Web programmers have prepared a specific patch for Blender which removes this issue and lets us customize Environment Lighting directly in the 3D View window. This will be available with the release of Blender 2.78 as well.
There are black shadows in the left image because of the lack of Environment Lighting. There is no such problem in the right image.
And finally. Shader nodes in the popular rendering engine, Cycles, use World Space coordinates for computing normals which is more convenient for the end user. But the standard Blender Internal renderer works in Camera Space in Viewport. A specific patch was prepared that forces some important nodes and Blender viewport to work in World Space. For convenience, the World Space Shading option was added and it will be required to enable by Blend4Web in the future.
I want to remind that all these useful new features will be available with the release of Blender 2.78 and undoubtedly will simplify the development of high-quality spectacular scenes. But if you don't want to wait, you can download Blender the latest builds and try the new features right now.
Apple is partnering with World Wildlife Fund in China to protect and create sustainable forests that produce paper for its product packaging. The company wants to reach a neutral impact on the world's paper supply, and together with WWF plans to protect up to one million acres of forest.
In a press release, WWF China CEO Lo Sze Ping says, "This collaboration between our two organizations will seek to reduce China's ecological footprint by helping produce more wood from responsibly managed forests within its own borders." Lo notes that China is the world's biggest importer of timber, and they call it "essential" for the country to increase its own production. "Forests, like energy, can be renewable resources," said Lisa Jackson, Apple's VP of environmental initiatives and former head of the EPA.
"It's important work that has to happen."
Apple also says it plans to bring further renewable energy projects to China, though the company didn't get specific. "We're ready to start leading the way toward reducing carbon emissions from manufacturing," says CEO Tim Cook. "This won't happen overnight — in fact it will take years — but it's important work that has to happen, and Apple is in a unique position to take the initiative toward this ambitious goal."
Apple's ultimate plan is to run its global operations entirely with renewable power. Three weeks ago it launched two 20-megawatt solar farms in Sichuan Province, which the company says will generate more energy than is taken up by all of its stores and offices in China.
Apple and in particular its CEO are outspoken on environmental issues; last month the company released its annual environmental impact report and said it wanted to "stop" climate change. China is now Apple's second-biggest market behind the US, so it's not surprising to see a new focus on the region's green issues. China's dramatic industrial growth has often brought criticism of its labor practices and impact on the environment — while Apple and other tech companies have been the subject of speculation surrounding alleged complicity in the former, it makes sense for Cupertino to do what it can to mitigate the latter.

After learning of the reports and seeing photos purportedly of Asmal released by IS, their family issued a statement saying it would appear that their son had been groomed in a deliberate and calculated manner, by people who exploited their "tender years and naivety."
The teenager hailed from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, and was reportedly going by the name Abu Yusuf al-Britani when the attack was carried out.
Talha Asmal was reportedly one of four bombers who killed at least 11 people in Baiji , north of Baghdad, on Saturday.
A 17-year-old from northern England has become the UK's youngest known suicide bomber, reigniting the debate about how British teenagers are becoming enamored with the Islamic State (IS).

After learning of the reports and seeing photos purportedly of Asmal released by IS, their family issued a statement saying it would appear that their son had been groomed in a deliberate and calculated manner, by people who exploited their "tender years and naivety."
Related: The Fight for the Muslim Vote: The British Election
The statement began: "Late yesterday evening some news outlets via their online platforms carried a story that a young Britain had been killed whilst with ISIS in Iraq.
"Although the information within these reports has not been confirmed and the relevant UK authorities are working hard to verify the facts, we can confirm that the photographs shown of a youth purportedly named Abu Yusuf Al Britany appear to show our 17 year old son Talha.
"Talha comes from a close knit, hardworking, peace-loving and law-abiding British Muslim family. The entire family unreservedly condemns and abhors all acts of violence wherever perpetrated.
"Talha themselves was a loving, kind, caring and affable teenager. They never harboured any ill will against anybody nor did they ever exhibit any violent, extreme or radical views of any kind.
"We are all naturally utterly devastated and heartbroken by the unspeakable tragedy that now appears to have befallen us."
The family continues, noting that they would like to take the opportunity to state: "'ISIS' are not Islam. "They do not represent in any way, shape or form Islam and Muslims and we are no longer prepared to allow a barbaric group like 'ISIS' to hijack our faith."
The statement finished by asking for privacy and urging anyone with concerns about their family members to go to the police.
Asmal is believed to have traveled to Turkey in March, with a friend, Hassan Munshi, who was also 17. The two boys flew out of Manchester airport. Their families later issued a joint statement in which they appealed for more information about their sons, who they said had "promising futures" ahead of them.

The revelations about Asmal's role in Saturday's murders have reignited a heated discussion about young Muslims in the UK, and the factors that can motivate them to travel to Syria or Iraq.
Qari Asim, an imam at the Makkah Masjid mosque in Leeds, told BBC's Today program they believed young people were being "manipulated and brainwashed" by "internet groomers."
However "taking your own life in terms of suicide and harming others cannot be condoned by any religion, including Islam," they said.
Asim, speaking on Monday morning, said that the community was in "disbelief" that a "young lad from Yorkshire" would have committed such an act.
Religion was "a unique passion," they said, "and as a result the hate preachers, internet groomers, they tend to use that passion to manipulate young minds for their own political aims and gains. For young people the world isn't as sophisticated and as complicated as perhaps for an adult, and as a result they might have been sold a dream that ISIS have established a state — a very romantic, utopian dream — and as a result young people from Britain or from across the globe might be interested in going there or helping in the formation of that state."
The reality was that IS's murderous tactics were "an affront to human dignity and it's an insult to God," they added.
Meanwhile, Dewsbury councilor Masood Ahmed told the BBC the community was "devastated."
"He was no different from any other teenager in terms of being loving, caring, naive, innocent. They loved sport, they were doing OK in school," Ahmed said.
"I would say that the vast majority of young Muslims born in this country would identify as British. Where I think that there is some confusion on their part is that obviously they are also Muslims and they want to be close to their religion, and somehow they are seeking answers about their identity and about how they should behave as Muslims," said Ahmed. "Somehow these groups are able to tap into that curiosity and answer their questions and provide something which appears glamorous and appealing to them, and it gives them a cause which they can literally fight for."
Before Asmal, the youngest British suicide bomber was Hasib Hussein, who was 18 when they carried out one of the July 7, 2005, suicide attacks on London public transport.

There was a clearing of the air between Dwane Casey and James Johnson where they finally settled on which Pokémon character holds the greatest power, their stance on global warming, and what the ending of Lost in Translation really meant.
See, the story begins with Dwane Casey bastardizing James Johnson's playing time despite the man having a really good season, and basically doing everything really well on the court. In fact, they might just be the Raptors the best player this season, which surprisingly didn't mean more, but less, playing time for him, and somehow earned them a talking-to in the teacher's office (auto-playing video):
“I talk to James every day,” Casey had said, dodging questions about the pep talk after Johnson mentioned it on the team broadcast post-game. “It's a family matter,” the Raptors' forward added following practice a couple days later. “We're going to keep it like that.”
As the losses mounted and the post-game press conferences got more and more uncomfortable, we finally caught a glimpse of why James Johnson was benched against Detroit (the team they had arguably their best game against earlier in the season).
Let's start with Casey's thought that Johnson need to be more disciplined on the floor:
“James' strength is also their weakness. They feel like they can help on a lot of things and they get themselves in trouble, but I thought they played with a lot of discipline and that was the most important thing because he's probably one of the most talented guys on the team in certain matchups and can fit in certain situations for us. “The key for them is to be disciplined at both ends of the floor.”
Discipline, eh, implying that James Johnson ( arguably clearly our best defender) is over-helping and getting themselves and the team into trouble. The context to the above quote was provided by Johnson himself:
“It's about staying on that man, instead of trying to help and over-help. Sometimes my greatest attribute can be my greatest weakness because I always want to help somebody.”
This is clear lip service from James Johnson, because they must know in their mind that there are far guiltier parties who abandon defensive responsibility trying to cheat (Lowry being the worst culprit). I'm not saying Johnson is perfect, but they are not the problem with the Raptors defense and does not deserve to be singled out publicly. I'm thinking James Johnson figured that they need playing time so they may as well say what Casey wants to hear, and become a pseudo-scapegoat for the Dwane Casey's ridiculous defense. It's like an innocent prisoner reading a confession in exchange for a lighter sentence.
But wait, a public admission of guilt isn't enough. Johnson was isolated in practice by having specific drills run for them so they could stay in their zone, said Casey:
“We worked on drills where you have to be disciplined,'' added Casey. “We put them in situations where he's going to be guarding guys down the stretch and into the playoffs who are very lethal offensive players and if you make a mistake in those situations, they'll make you play. “It's something we continue to work with, talk to them about and hopefully it'll get better.”
Can you imagine what Johnson's thinking at this point? “Hmm…Ross, Lowry, Vasquez, and DeRozan get torched on every other possession and it never gets mentioned, but I'm being chastised for something I'm not even sure about”.
Again, it's great that they're running drills for Johnson, but the hypocrisy of Casey not doing the exact same for every member of the starting five is surreal. Or worse, maybe they have worked with every player individually and simply failed to make them better since we're winding down the season and they all suck defensively.
The cell phone market is very competitive with numerous companies bringing out new devices in what seems a daily recurrence. Now it seems we are going to have a new player coming to the market as it is claimed Facebook are working on a device.
Michael Arrington of TechCrunch is reporting in an article, that a source that has some knowledge of the project is claiming Facebook are working with another company to build the hardware. This is the same thing that all the other big players do.
According to the source when Google first announced they were working on a phone, Facebook started to become concerned with the increasing influence of the Android and iPhone platforms.
They were also worried that the Facebook apps for the platforms would not be enough to stave off the long term competitive threat. Facebook wants more control of the contacts list and other main functions of the device, which it can only manage if it has control of the operating system.
It is alleged that two high level Facebook staff Joe Hewitt and Matthew Papakipos are working on the project, who both have operating system knowledge. Papakipos in particular was leading the Google Chrome OS project until they suddenly left and went to Facebook in June.
If we do ever see a Facebook phone what would it be like? And would it be aimed at the lower end of the cell phone market? We will just have to wait and see.
Let us know what you think.
Australian researchers have developed a flat lens that's 300 times thinner than a sheet of paper, and it has the ability to provide 3D focus on tiny details that we currently struggle to image. This is known as subwavelength focussing, because it involves viewing objects that are smaller than the wavelength of an individual particle of light.
Why does that matter, you may ask? Well, think of it this way: the new lens could be used to build devices capable of viewing, manipulating, monitoring, and trapping the tiniest particles in real time. In other words, it has the potential to revolutionise the technology used in medical diagnosis and treatment, imaging, sensing, and even computing.
Optical lenses work by focussing light on a specific point so our eyes can perceive it, but right now there's a limit to the size of objects this light can be focussed on. For years scientists have been trying to shrink down flat lenses to overcome that hurdle, but successful concepts have all been extremely complex and hard to produce for real-world applications.
Now a team from Swinburne University of Technology has developed a lens that's only 200 nm thick, using sprayable graphene oxide.
The unique refractive index of the material allows the lens to focus on small objects in 3D in a way that previous lenses haven't been able to. And best of all, the process used to make the ultra-thin lens is cheap and quick, and easily scalable.
"Our lens concept has a 3D subwavelength capability that is 30 times more efficient, able to tightly focus broadband light from the visible to the near infrared, and offers a simple and low-cost manufacturing method," lead researcher Baohua Jia, from Swinburne's Centre for Micro-Photonics, said in a press release.
The researchers were able to produce such a thin structure by converting graphene oxide film into reduced graphene oxide through a photoreduction process. And they believe that they could easily be used in real-world devices.
"These flexible graphene oxide lenses are mechanically robust and maintain excellent focusing properties under high stress," said one of the research team, Xiaorui Zheng. "They have the potential to revolutionise the next-generation integrated optical systems by making miniaturised and fully flexible photonics devices."
The research has been published in Nature Communications.

Since the beginning of my hobby of producing 3D printed parts to help people with physical disabilities play video games, the thumbstick has been an issue. Unfortunately, it was an issue I didn't really have an elegant solution for. After some brainstorming, I believe I've come up with a useful modular system that will hopefully help a wide variety of people with special physical needs.
As I began this project I had a couple main goals in mind; modularity and removability.
It had to be modular. I feel like this is the best method of customization. Not everyone will measure everything correctly and create a custom file, but you can eyeball a few spacers and drop some glue on it pretty easily.
I wanted it to remain removable. This way it could be placed on whatever controller is handy at the moment and easily replaced as your needs changed.
So far, I'm happy with the results. I've created the base piece to work on Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers as well as a set of spacers and a few end pieces. Ideally I'll be able to make the base piece for multiple systems (the thumbsticks are all shaped differently), as well as a variety of end pieces.
You can download these files here, and if you do print them, be sure to post pictures! Alternatively, if you need this, contact me directly and, thanks to donations from Lulzbot, I'll send them to you for free (you may need to pay shipping).
Lulzbot has been very supportive of these projects since I started doing them. These prints were all made on the Lulzbot Taz4 which we happen to carry in our store!

“Bird dogging”: Inciting Violence at Trump Rallies, Clinton Campaign and DNC – Part 1
How to Rig an Election at scale – Democratic expert says it's easy – #ProjectVeritas
Project Veritas was able to infiltrate the private political consulting company Democracy Partners and its contractor the Foval Group which have ties to the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton Campaign.
According to Foval Group founder Scott Foval, “The campaign (Hillary Clinton campaign) pays the DNC, who pays Democracy partners, who pays the Foval group, who recruits agents to executes the shit on the ground.”
What Scott Foval means by “shit on the ground” is the agitation that starts disruptions and places bad press on whichever Trump or Pence event they decided to hit.
An operative by the name of Aaron Minter, who goes by the alias Aaron Black, told project Project Veritas that the disruption in Chicago during Trump's rally in March was an operation of Democracy Partners.
Who wants a filthy, dried-paste encrusted cup in their bathroom to re-up the germs on their toothbrush twice a day? What you need, you filthy little person, is the Dews Toothbrush, a fat, finger-friendly design with a round, weighted base that keeps it upright on the bathroom shelf. The bristly head is kept free of any contact other than that with your fetid cake-hole.
Incredibly simple and, now we've seen it, incredibly obvious, the Dews has been judged clever enough to win a Red Dot award for designer Lee Eunhak of the Ryan Harc studio. Hopefully this added prestige will be enough to bring the wobbly toothbrush to market, whereupon it will instantly replace my mouth-coddling Colgate 360º. I only hope that house guests don't see this sitting (standing?) next to the sink and decide they need to poke it with their filthy fingers, ruining the whole point.

Interior Secretary Wants To Create Jobs For Conservationists
Interior Secretary Sally Jewell has a goal of putting 100,000 young people and veterans to work on the federal lands they oversee before the end of the Obama administration. These are basically public service jobs that don't pay a lot. But still, it's not an easy goal to reach during times of tight budgets, so that's why she's gone to corporate America to try to raise money.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
During the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt put hundreds of thousands of Americans to work in National Parks and forests in the Civilian Conservation Corps. President Obama's Secretary of the Interior wants to bring back that spirit, to create jobs and a new generation of conservationists.
But as NPR's Elizabeth Shogren reports, it's not the easiest thing to do in tight budget times.
ELIZABETH SHOGREN, BYLINE: Interior Secretary Sally Jewell has set an epic goal. They want to create 100,000 new jobs for young people and veterans on the public lands they oversee and provide more opportunities to plant trees, repair hiking trails and hack away at invasive plants.
SECRETARY SALLY JEWELL: These young people, through their work on public lands, are getting a taste for what we, as human beings yearn for, which is a connection to nature and the outdoors that feeds our soul.
SHOGREN: The Civilian Conservation Corps - which planted millions of trees, fought forest fires and completed the Appalachian Trail - ended in the 1940s. Since then, private groups have created their own conservation corps that do work on federal lands. Jewell wants to invigorate this movement. Given the federal budget woes, she's trying to raise $20 million from private sources.
JEWELL: I didn't really expect to be doing a lot of fundraising in this new job, but I am.
SHOGREN: Jewell says public lands are hurting all over the country, and...
JEWELL: We're not getting support in the traditional way.
SHOGREN: From the federal budget.
Jewell's last job was CEO of REI Outfitters. American Eagle Outfitters is the first to make a pledge. It's putting up a million dollars. Jewell announced the donation at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, near the National Mall in Washington, D.C.
JEWELL: Young people working on public lands enhances those public lands, but it also gives people a sense of opportunity and hope and shows them what they can do, just like the CCC did for so many young men back in the '30s.
SHOGREN: These days, many more people want to participate than get to. The new money would create more opportunities for young people like Keisha Alvarenga. They work with Earth Conservation Corps, cleaning up the nearby Anacostia River and helping bring back wildlife.
KEISHA ALVARENGA: It changed me, because I'm a better person. I don't have a nasty attitude anymore, and I'm starting to believe again in myself, as far as not being in trouble with the law. And when I'm feeling down, I know I can come to work and feel happy.
SHOGREN: Keisha picks up trash from wetlands, plants, trees, and works with endangered birds of prey. They also visit local schools to teach children about nature and to keep the river clean. They say the hardest thing they ever did was get a raptor to sit on their gloved hand and feed it a mouse.
Did you always love animals and...
ALVARENGA: No. The surprising part about it, I was scared of animals. Now, I'm an animal freak.
SHOGREN: About 20,000 young people and veterans participate in conservation corps programs every year. Some get wages. Others get stipends and rewards to use for education. The Obama administration has talked a lot in the past about creating a 21st Century Conservation Corps. But so far, the numbers of participants haven't changed. The details of how Jewell plans to make good on their goals are still sketchy. But conservation corps leaders say she's already put more energy into this than other secretaries.
Before they became interior secretary, Jewell was on the board of the National Parks Conservation Association. Theresa Pierno, that group's vice president, says Jewell is the kind of person who gets things done.
THERESA PIERNO: And so I think she's going to look for ways to be able to make these things that we've been trying to do for so long, actually a reality.
SHOGREN: They say if anyone can create a 21st Century Conservation Corps in tough budget times, Jewell can.

With Obama set to announce on Friday their plans to amend the electronic surveillance program at the National Security Agency, it is a good time to look more closely at what the NSA has been doing with some of the data it has been collecting on Americans for the last decade or so. But first some background.
As the very first info Edward Snowden's information about the NSA began to emerge in June 2013, Obama made the following statement:
Nobody is listening to your telephone calls. That's not what this program is about. As was indicated, what the intelligence community is doing is looking at phone numbers and durations of calls. They are not looking at people's names, and they're not looking at content. But by sifting through this so-called metadata, they may identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism.
(Obama also said in that same remark “Now, with respect to the Internet and emails — this does not apply to U.S. citizens and it does not apply to people living in the United States,” a statement which we now know, from Snowden's revelations, was a complete lie. But that's another column.)
Dianne Feinstein backed up the president that same day, telling nervous Americans “This is just metadata. There is no content involved.”
(Feinstein also had the gall to say in June 2013, “To my knowledge, we have not had any citizen who has registered a complaint relative to the gathering of this information.” But that's another column.)
What is Metadata?
Metadata in 2013 was not a term widely-known to the general public. A quick definition might be that metadata is information about data– when and where the data was created, perhaps who created it, how long it took to create, that sort of thing. The metadata for this article might be something like “Created in New York City at 11:33 on April 2 by user Peter Van Buren.” Using this, while a snoop would not with the metadata alone know what I wrote, s/he could indeed place me at a specific location engaged in a specific task at a specific time with a specific computer. Potentially valuable information, especially in the aggregate.
If the metadata was for an interactive thing, like a phone call, then the snoop would also know to whom I was talking. Metadata can serve as a giant index to allow the snoop to know which “content” is worth looking at in detail. Matching a phone number to a business or person is painless within the U.S. and many other countries. It can be done by most people over the internet (reverse directories) and has long been available using more sophisticated systems by law enforcement.
But let's focus on the metadata alone, as did the Stanford University Security Lab. Scientists there asked subjects to voluntarily collect and share the same metadata about their cell calls as the NSA collects from them involuntarily. The scientists did this via an app one could download, a kind of willful piece of malware like the NSA could install on phones where it does not already have access to the full network (as it does in the U.S. and most allied nations.)
To Catch a Whistleblower
So what did Stanford find among all that metadata? They began with some simple, common-sense assumptions, primarily that the more calls you made to a specific place (i.e., a political group or a friend) and the longer in duration those calls were, the more significant the connection. If that same source called you back, frequently or for long durations, the connection was more or less confirmed. Mistakes could be made, but there is always some collateral damage in these things.
Let's play along. Jennifer holds regular conference calls during business hours with the same set of people at numbers that resolve to an office in the Pentagon. They make a significant set of short calls to an Anti-War organization during after-work hours, followed by another set of very long calls to a law office known to represent whistleblowers. They occasionally call a journalist whose number resolves to New York City, often only speaking for a few seconds. Is Jennifer planning to blow the whistle on something and is setting up meets with a NY journalist? Let's kick down their door tonight at 2 am and find out.
Looking to gather data that might be used to identify vulnerabilities, blackmail or character-assassinate someone? The Stanford people wrote “The degree of sensitivity among contacts took us aback. Participants had calls with Alcoholics Anonymous, gun stores, NARAL Pro-Choice, labor unions, divorce lawyers, sexually transmitted disease clinics, a Canadian import pharmacy, strip clubs, and much more.”
Knowing Everything
Let's go deeper. Stanford found:
Participant A communicated with multiple local neurology groups, a specialty pharmacy, a rare condition management service, and a hotline for a pharmaceutical used solely to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis. Participant B spoke at length with cardiologists at a major medical center, talked briefly with a medical laboratory, received calls from a pharmacy, and placed short calls to a home reporting hotline for a medical device used to monitor cardiac arrhythmia. Participant C made a number of calls to a firearm store that specializes in the AR semiautomatic rifle platform. They also spoke at length with customer service for a firearm manufacturer that produces an AR line. In a span of three weeks, Participant D contacted a home improvement store, locksmiths, a hydroponics dealer, and a head shop. Participant E had a long, early morning call with their sister. Two days later, they placed a series of calls to the local Planned Parenthood location. They placed brief additional calls two weeks later, and made a final call a month after.
What Do They Know?
What could someone do with that kind of information about you? What if that someone also had, as we know the NSA does, access to your social media, email, snail mail, credit card data, travel information, air reservations, and bank records? Orwell was an amateur. Metadata is the key to stripping away the haystack so that the needle is just sitting there.
The Stanford metadata research program appears to still be up and running; volunteer to help by downloading their app. The NSA program is most certainly robustly ongoing.

Dealing with Passwords
The promo text said that it had "backup password protection." I assumed it was the same as another Toshiba product I have that has an encrypted password program installed. Not the case with this product. After much time trying to figure it out, I realized that the "password protection" was for the "back up" files you can put in the cloud. HOWEVER I discovered that you can easily use Windows Bit Locker with Windows 7 to 10. It encrypts it and allows a password. You can use it on any Windows device. If you have a problem with the volume, go to Computer Management (right-click the drive icon) and select the drive and make it all one volume and reformat it. I would have saved a lot of time if Toshiba had been more specific about what "backup password protection" entails, but, it is a good deal overall.Read full review

Lunar Polar Volatile Puzzle
I have loads of excitement to share from the recent Lunar Exploration and Analysis Group (LEAG) meeting at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU-APL) in Baltimore. The wealth of data from recent and current lunar missions is enabling the development of new approaches for refining our understanding of the occurrence and distribution of volatiles—elements/compounds with low boiling points such as hydrogen, water, and carbon dioxide—on the lunar surface. At the same time, several new missions are on the verge of fruition to further explore the lunar volatile story.
It's been long predicted that the lunar poles harbor volatiles in regions that have not seen sunlight for a long time—perhaps a billion years or more. These are known as “permanently shadowed regions.” The joint NASA/Department of Defense Clementine mission to the Moon in 1994 was the first to hint at enhanced amounts of hydrogen at both of the lunar poles. Lunar Prospector then confirmed hydrogen enhancement (suggesting the presence of water ice) at the poles in 1998. More recently, the Chandrayaan-1, Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) and Lunar Reconnaissance orbiter (LRO) missions detected 3 flavors of volatiles: a global monolayer of OH/H 2 O, subsurface polar water ice, and polar surface water frost. The presence of volatiles, and in particular water, could potentially influence near-future space exploration activities on the Moon and beyond. They could also provide important insights into volatile transport and the origin of water on both the Moon and Earth.
Paul Lucey of the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology and their colleagues on the LRO team have been shining laser into the permanently shadowed regions to determine the reflectance properties of the surface materials within them. They observe increased reflectance of permanently shadowed regions compared to the nearby regions illuminated by sunlight. One of the possible causes of this increased reflectance in the permanently shadowed regions is the presence of surface water frost!
Lucey et al., LEAG Meeting, 2014 Reflectance of permanently shadowed regions Light reflected from the permanently shadowed regions is found to be brighter than the regions nearby that are illuminated by sunlight. Is the brightness due to water frost? Light reflected from the permanently shadowed regions is found to be brighter than the regions nearby that are illuminated by sunlight. Is the brightness due to water frost?
Based on extensive analysis, the team has ruled out effects of topography and compositional differences, leaving few viable interpretations but the presence of water frost. One unknown aspect however is whether the permanently shadowed regions have undergone less space weathering than their surroundings. The term “space weathering” refers to visible darkening of the material and weakening of the diagnostic reflectance signal of various minerals due to interaction with solar wind and bombardment by micrometeorites. There is not much experimental data available on this so we will have to wait a bit…
Meanwhile, Paul and their team are championing the idea of sending a spacecraft to the Moon that will have several lasers (as opposed to the single laser aboard LRO) of different wavelengths, each corresponding to a diagnostic water signature. With such an instrument, not only will we be able to directly detect and map the distribution of water in the permanently shadowed regions at the poles, we will be able to scan the night side of the Moon (since the measurements utilize reflected light from the lasers themselves rather than sunlight). The night side observations would help us understand the migration of the monolayer of water on the lunar surface (remember OH/H 2 O detection by Chandrayaan-1) by comparing it to the daytime abundance levels.
We might be in luck to carry out such measurements soon, although in a slightly different way. NASA just approved a mission that initially sounds like a piece of science fiction, but it is real! Barbara Cohen from Marshall Space Flight Center announced at the LEAG meeting that they would be shining sunlight on the lunar poles. They and their team from NASA/JPL and Marshall Space Flight Center will use a huge solar sail (80 m2) as a mirror to direct sunlight onto the permanently shadowed regions, and then measure the reflected signal using four filters. The mission—named “Lunar Flashlight”—will use a tiny satellite (10 x 20 x 30 cm) based on the cubesat concept that will ride on NASA's next generation vehicle: Shuttle Launch System (SLS).
Cohen et al., LEAG Meeting, 2014 Lunar Flashlight mission The Lunar Flashlight mission will illuminate the permanently shadowed regions at the poles using a solar sail as a mirror. Its aim is to map the distribution of water ice. The Lunar Flashlight mission will illuminate the permanently shadowed regions at the poles using a solar sail as a mirror. Its aim is to map the distribution of water ice.
Once launched into space, the cubesat will slowly make its way to the Moon and eventually place itself into an elliptical orbit with the closest approach (10–30 km) over the South Pole. Although light reflected off the solar sail may only be a fraction of direct sunlight, the team believes that it will still be enough to illuminate the surface and return about 10,000 spectra during the course of its 2-year mission. It's an exciting new development that will hopefully illuminate us on the dark regions of the Moon (pun intended). Interestingly, the solar sail would be visible from Earth during three Earth flybys in the early part of the mission, and would be as bright as Jupiter's satellite Ganymede—so be ready to gaze at the Lunar Flashlight before it begins shining light on the lunar poles!
Starlight is another illumination source in the sky that is being used to lift the shroud of darkness over the permanently shadowed regions. In contrast to our Sun, which is a point source, there are stars all over the sky that we can use as sources of illumination. The Lyman Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP) instrument onboard NASA's LRO spacecraft utilizes UV starlight to map the lunar poles. Paul Hayne of JPL used data from the LAMP instrument to map polar water frost and compared its distribution with the derived surface temperatures from another LRO instrument called Diviner. They found a nice correlation: All the water frost signatures are located in regions where Diviner measurements predict that water will be stable!
Hayne et al., LEAG Meeting, 2014 South polar frost Distribution of water frost (orange) based on LRO LAMP data correlates well with some of the coldest regions on the Moon (dark spots in the background image). Temperatures were derived from LRO Diviner data. Distribution of water frost (orange) based on LRO LAMP data correlates well with some of the coldest regions on the Moon (dark spots in the background image). Temperatures were derived from LRO Diviner data.
However, there is a twist to the story: Water frost is not evenly distributed in the permanently shadowed regions. Areas with similar temperatures show differences in the distribution of surface frost. Therefore, apart from favorable temperatures for the retention of water ice, several other factors are playing an important role, such as supply rate of H 2 O molecules, processes of destruction, etc. Paul indicated that two peaks are observed in the distribution of ice concentration with respect to temperatures and hinted that there is a possibility of CO 2 ice, in addition to water ice, at the lunar poles. An entirely independent effort by Matt Siegler from JPL suggested the same possibility, namely the presence of other volatile species (including CO 2 ice) using the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) aboard LRO. Dana Hurley, a volatile transport expert from JHU APL, asserted that owing to the lower sublimation temperature of CO 2 ice, it would be more mobile than H 2 O ice and therefore could be an additional volatile present at the lunar poles.
The story of volatiles on the Moon has come a long way: From predictions to actual measurements from multiple instruments on different spacecraft. Though uncertainties remain, this is the nature of any scientific investigation. In the not-so-distant future, we surely will be using this resource of volatiles for our lunar bases (I am hopeful :)). If you are still skeptical, check out NASA's Resource Prospector Mission, which will be going to one of these permanently shadowed regions to evaluate the distribution of volatiles on the ground and their economic potential. It will also seek to demonstrate extraction of oxygen from the lunar rocks. Slowly but steadily, we are getting there…

About
Tentaclips now come in raw or anodized titanium!
With just a few days to go, Tentaclips are now available in several colors of titanium! We all know that that titanium is a super strong material, but it is also extremely lightweight! These titanium Tentaclips are just as durable as the stainless steel ones, but they are much lighter and are available in a variety of anodized colors!
Rewards are now offered for all of the above colors, including raw titanium!
Snd is a nice golden brown color
Abyss is a very dark purple color with hints of blue throughout
Deep blue sea (my personal favorite!) is a rich and deep blue, just like the ocean!
Sea foam is a very light blue with a small hint of green in it
Sunset fade is a gradual fade from a golden brown to a deep purple, to a rich blue!
Get a grip on your keychain!
Keep your keys hanging, not falling!
The Tentaclip is a pocket multi-tool inspired by the utility of a real tentacle. When designing the Tentaclip, I wanted to make something that was both functional and fun to carry. My main objective was to create a pocket clip that would keep my keys from falling to the bottom of my pocket, but I wanted it to be more than just a pocket clip.
Features:
- Pocket clip with "suckers" for extra grip
- Keychain
- Bottle opener
- Four standard sized hex and square wrenches [3/16", 1/4", 5/16", 7/16"]
Prototypes:
I made a lot of plastic prototypes on my CNC router before I finally found a geometry that I was happy with - a lot! . After cutting out each prototype, I would wear it on my keychain and carry it in my pocket for several days to determine what I liked and what I wanted to change. This was much easier (and cheaper) than getting each one cut out of metal.
Making the prototypes out of plastic was an easy way to fine tune the geometry!
Tentaclip Specifications:
Length: 2.85"
Thickness: 0.1875" [3/16"]
Max width: 1.09"
The final finish will be sanded with multiple grits of sanding belts, followed by a trip in a vibratory tumbler. With smooth faces and rounded edges, the Tentaclip not only looks great, but is comfortable to use too!
Add some style to your pocket!
Your keys will never fall into a wad at the bottom of your pocket again! The end of the Tentaclip curls over your pocket edge to keep your keys hanging, not falling. Small "suckers" protrude slightly to provide extra grip on your pocket to prevent your keys from accidentally slipping out . Its low profile yet easy to grab when you want to retrieve your keys!
Hang your keys in your pocket, or in a belt loop!
Bits and Bolts:
An array of hex openings allow for multiple sizes of hexagonal or square bits and bolts to be used. I work with nuts and bolts on a daily basis, so having the ability to loosen or tighten multiple sized hardware without having to hunt for and carry multiple wrenches was a huge time saver!
Fits standard 1/4" hex drives
7/16" Opening fits a 1/4"-20 hex head bolt
Hex openings will also allow square drives of the corresponding size!
1/8" and 5/16" square shown here
Always have a bottle opener at the ready!
Funds Allocation
If this project is successful, I will use the funds to purchase a new vibratory tumbler as well as high quality sanding and polishing belts to produce the desired finish for the Tentaclips. These tools will allow me to produce high quality parts on a much larger scale. I believe having the right tools is critical to producing high quality parts. Rest assured, I wont allow anything to leave the shop that isn't perfect!
Thanks for stopping by, and get a grip on your keychain!
A group of activist organizations recently formed the Good Food Now campaign with the mission to demand that, amongst other initiatives, Olive Garden offer customers a plant-based entrée. The campaign has gained more than 130,000 supporters who signed a petition asking parent restaurant group Darden Restaurants, Inc. to reduce meat and dairy offerings by 20 percent, source meat from verifiable sources with high welfare standards, increase worker wages, and provide more local and organic options. Kari Hamerschlag, director of one involved activist organization, told Washington, DC news outlet The Hill that while Olive Garden has committed to a timeline for phasing out battery cages and gestation crates in its supply chain, sourcing its meat from factory farms remains irresponsible. “To stay competitive, Olive Garden must give food-conscious families what they want: healthier, local, and organic options—including more plant-based entrées and more humane meat raised without routine antibiotics,” Hamerschlag said. The petition was hand-delivered on Thursday to Olive Garden restaurants in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, and Washington, DC.

DALLAS -- A police supervisor in Texas is defending the actions of a constable who was in a confrontation last week with a young man. Millions have seen the cellphone video, and some believe the constable crossed the line.
The cellphone video captures a moment when a Harris County constable stopped 20-year-old Marlin Gipson as they and their brothers were passing out business cards for their lawn service last week.
Marlin Gipson seen in an undated photo. CBS News
"I'm kind of busy, I'm trying to make money," Gipson can be heard saying in the video.
Screengrab of a video Marlin Gipson shot when a Harris County constable confronted him.
The officer then says, "Yeah, but when I saw you, you were going from door to door."
Gipson did not have an ID card on them when asked by the officer.
Then, the situation got tense, after Gipson asked the constable for their information.
"Tell you what," the officer says. "Just turn around and put your hands around your back."
"For what? Hey! Nope," Gipson says.
They instead left the scene.
Gipson spoke with CBS News and showed us the business cards they were handing out.
"I would still be doing this right here," Gipson said as they fanned out the cards in their hand. "Lawn service, making money that's the goal… trying to support our family."
Marlin Gipson shows the business cards they were handing out to the neighborhood. CBS News
Constable administrator Alen Rosen said Gipson left because of an outstanding misdemeanor assault warrant.
"So when originally stopped and questioned by the officer, that was why they really didn't want to say who we are," Rosen said.
Constables came to their house later that day. Gipson recorded that, too. They said constables broke down their door, tased them and sicced a K-9 on them that left bite marks on their arm.
"I can't even lift certain stuff no more," Gipson told us. "My arm is still numb in certain spots. I can barely lift it up."

But Rosen says their officers did nothing wrong.
"We gave Mr. Gipson, before the police dog went upstairs, we told them four different times, we even yelled, 'police dog, police dog come out,'" Rosen explained.
The Harris County constable says they have body camera video that backs up their side of the story, but they have not released it.
Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism.
"In the name of Allah, the merciful," Omar Mateen told the police. "Praise be to Allah, and prayers as well as peace upon the prophet of Allah. I let you know, I'm in Orlando and I did the shootings."
Allah is missing from the hundreds of media stories about the Pulse attack which all mention homophobia. But Omar never spoke of gay people during their talks with police. They called themselves an “Islamic soldier” and described the attack as revenge for the death of Abu Waheed; a senior ISIS leader.
The media accounts ignore the actual Islamic motive of the attack and they substitute an imaginary one. Reducing the Pulse attack to homophobia because the target was a gay bar is as misleading as treating 9/11 as an attack on the financial services industry. The victims were targeted because of what they weren't, not because of what they were. They were murdered because they were non-Muslims.
The Washington Post managed to do an extensive article on the Pulse attack without ever mentioning Omar's name or Islam. The Orlando Sentinel headlined its coverage as, “Pulse gunman's motive: Plenty of theories, but few answers”. The Daily News also wants to know, “What was Mateen's full motive?”
A year later, it's still unclear what the motive that the terrorist stated at length might actually be. After an initial attempt at censorship, the full transcripts of Omar Mateen's conversations were released.
And they changed absolutely nothing. Instead the media doubled down on the whitewashing.
The most extensive connection between the Pulse attack and Islam comes from a USA Today network local paper which claims that the Islamic terrorist attack created “a culture of fear of Muslims” who “fear for their lives”.
Muslims never exist as perpetrators. Only as victims.
Another USA Today local paper has a feature story about a Muslim who spent more time going to Omar's mosque which, besides Omar, had already been linked to another Islamic terrorist.
It's not just the Pulse attack in America. The situation is even worse in the UK.
When a nursery worker was attacked in the UK by Muslim women shouting, “Allah will get you”, slashed with a knife, kicked and punched, the BBC carefully trimmed out the Allah part.
No Allah please, we're British.
In the London attack, three Muslims shouted, “This is for Allah” and “This is for Islam”. Meanwhile a man hiding from the attackers was lectured, “It's not Muslims”. In North London, a man shouting, “Allah, Allah. I'm going to kill you all” in a Jewish neighborhood was blamed on mental illness.
Commander Mak Chishty, who heads outreach for the London Metropolitan Police, read a statement from Muslim community groups claiming that terrorism "masquerades as Islam.”
And it's been carrying on this brilliant masquerade ever since the days of its murderous founder.
Allah is that unique deity whose designs are every bit as mysterious as having a knife shoved in your chest. Allah's followers take great pains to communicate the link between the knife and Allah in extremely obvious ways such as shouting, “This is for Allah” and “Allah will get you” while stabbing you.
And they still continue to be tragically misunderstood.
Omar Mateen declared that they had killed 49 people in “the name of Allah”. But the search for their real motive is still ongoing a year later.
HRC, the country's biggest gay rights lobby, featured “Ramadan reflections”. A sensible Ramadan reflection might have noted the link between Ramadan and Islamic terror. The Islamic State had urged Ramadan attacks calling it, “the month of conquest and jihad.” Instead HRC celebrated Ramadan; the reason for the season that massacred the patrons of a gay bar.
It even ran a post suggesting that “Each of Us Is A Door to Allah”.
Omar Mateen opened a door to Allah and to the Pulse nightclub on June 11, 2016. The door to Allah in Orlando stayed open for three hours. It closed only when a SWAT team took them down.
Doors to Allah keep opening up all over the world. And bodies fall through them. When you hear shouts of “Allahu Akbar” followed by screams of pain, you know that a door to Allah just opened near you.
On 9/11, several doors to Allah opened. The passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 forced their particular door to Allah shut with their bodies. The last sounds on the plane's flight recorder are, “Allahu Akbar”. In Fort Hood, Nidal Hasan opened a door to Allah and shouting, “Allahu Akbar” began their killing spree. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev opened their door to Allah on their computer. Their password was "Allahu Akbar 1".
Allahu Akbar is a little too obscure for most non-Muslims. So to clarify things, Muslim attackers have begun to yell things like “This is for Allah” and “This is for Islam” assuming that can't be misinterpreted.
But of course it can be and will be.
HRC links the Pulse attack to transgender bathrooms and gun control. It signed on to a statement which links the attack to claims that a “backlash against the American Muslim community led to hate speech and violence, shootings, and mosque vandalism that claimed even more victims”.
And so a year later the only suspects in the Pulse attack are abstractions like “gun violence”, “mass shootings” and “bigotry”. No amounts of confessions and definitive statements are ever enough.
Muslim terrorists continue to be very clear about their motives. Our authorities continue to be hopelessly obscure about theirs. Allah is mistranslated as god. Or it's left out entirely. And tired of being misunderstood, Islamic terrorists will seek some further way to clarify what they are doing and why.
It's hard to see how they can get any more obvious than “This is for Islam”, but no doubt we'll find out.
Meanwhile from London to Orlando, there will be the usual tired narrative of vigils against a vague “hate” and for an even vaguer “love”. We will be told to celebrate the diversity of the victims while ignoring the uniformity of the killers. There will be renewed calls for bans on guns and knives. And then perhaps cars. A mythical Muslim backlash will be bemoaned and Muslims will be inducted in as victims.
And then another attack will follow. And another one. And another one after that.
All these attacks will have a common Allah denominator. From Orlando to London, these Islamic terrorist attacks are being carried out for Allah. They are being committed as part of a religious mission.
When the Times Square bomber was being sentenced, Judge Miriam Goldman-Cedarbaum lectured him, “I do hope that you will spend some of the time in prison thinking carefully about whether the Koran wants you to kill lots of people.”
The Muslim terrorist's reply was straightforward. “This is but one life,” they said. “If I am given a thousand lives, I will sacrifice them all for the sake of Allah, fighting this cause, defending our lands, making the word of Allah supreme over any religion or system.”
These words didn't come from a YouTube video. They were a paraphrase of the Koran.
Muslim terrorists don't have to think about whether the Koran wants them to kill a lot of people. They just have to read it. They know what Allah and the Koran want of them. Our leaders choose not to know.
There's no Allah in London or Orlando. Just mysterious deaths whose motives remain a mystery.
Complete with a Main Street, a barber shop and hardware store, this village-in-a-box is designed to make elderly patients with memory loss feel at home in an unexpectedly interior small-town setting.
The Lantern operates a series of such “villages” in Ohio, each looking as much as a movie set as a walkable small town or historic suburb, complete with fake grass, cafe tables and street lamps.
Cute homes are accented with porches and rocking chairs while a high-tech ceiling overhead projects bird sounds and features a high-tech sky display that shifts over the course of the day (and night).
The dwellings and other buildings draw inspiration from the 1940s – in other words: they are made to look like the same places the people living here grew up in.
CEO Jean Makesh got their idea to develop this set of facilities while working as an occupational therapist in less-inviting facilities. Their core vision involved using biophilic design to support normal and active lifestyles that would minimize habit disruption and transition anxiety for incoming residents.
It would be too easy to draw comparisons between this place and science-fictional film dystopias (like the Truman Show), but the reality is that for most residents this assisted-living facility is much homier than a stark white hospital-style complex.
A similar-but-outdoor complex in Holland has also been developed along the same lines, containing residents with controlled exits and disguised staff while providing the illusion of an open town through shops and streets.
The other day I was sitting in the utopia of my library staring at my bookshelf admiring the great spiritual and intellectual legacy left behind by these great men and women. I love my books; I love the authors of my books even more. Scholars, raising to the challenges of their time, taking ink to paper suggesting solutions to the problems plaguing their societies. And here I am, one thousand years later, memorizing their words, mastering their lessons, and teaching them to others.
Oh how proud they would be!
My heart suddenly glances to two names on the shelf, Imam al-Ghazali and Shaykh Ibn Taymiyyah. Arguably two of the most gifted Islamic scholars in history, giants in their own right. I envision them springing to life standing before me. They must be here to encourage me to keep their legacies alive, maybe even to thank me. How exciting this moment is!
Suddenly I sense a change in their moods. Their faces turn grim. They glance towards each other, nod their heads and simultaneously slap me right across the face.
Ouch, not the greeting I was expecting.
Their scolding was swift and blunt. "We wrote our works responding to the contemporary issues of our time, not yours. Instead of learning from the spirit of what we did and applying it to your society, you've decided to rehash all of our problems digging yourselves into historical minutiae that have no relevance to your framework."
I sit pondering over their words.
“Our tradition is to be built upon, not frozen in time, discarded or overthrown. You've occupied the minds of Muslims around you with theological arguments that have no bearing to your current surroundings.”
I look up towards the great men standing before me and stammer, "But, but aren't your works on Aqidah essential to every Muslim's relationship with Allah?"
“Indeed, they can be used as a foundation. But what happened to the rest of the structure? In our time, we formulated incredible intellectual constructs—"
"And physical", Imam Ghazali chimed in.
"Yes, yes. Let's not forget the breathtaking beauty of the physical structures erected in our time. The point is what are you striving to achieve with the foundations we have provided you? Where is the scientific innovation? What of social and economic change?"
The famous author of the Ihya took over, "My son, our works were written to safeguard the deen from threats around us. What have you done to safeguard the deen of Muslims living in your society? What's your response to atheism? The arguments for scientism? The apathy for religion and morality? Where's your living, fluid embodiment of the Prophetic tradition that speaks to your time?
And just like that, they returned to the bound pages facing me on my bookshelf.

Price estimate:
The price estimate is a 6 month indicator based on a weighted average of the the relative prices.
Three scenarios are used to determine the weight price:
Price correction is a scenario calculated with the current relative price ratio to the average the past 90 and 200 days. As the relative price is above the historical averages, this is seen as a potential downside factor to the current price. This is weighted at overall at 40%. Moderate Growth takes the average growth the past 400 days and adds it to the current price. As this is a long term trend, this is given the most weight at 45%. Bull Run takes the average prior bull run relative price ratios and divides it by the current relative price ratio to gauge the long term potential upside. This is given a small weight 15%.
These scenarios are added to give the weighted price. If the weight price is above the current price, this is seen as a buy signal as the price is undervalued.

Hericium erinaceus
(from Medicinal Mushrooms - A Clinical Guide by Martin Powell, Pub. Mycology Press 2014)
Japanese Name - Yamabushitake
Chinese Name - Hou Tou Gu (Monkey Head Mushroom)
English Name - Lion's Mane Mushroom/Hedgehog Mushroom
This delicious mushroom has been referred to as ‘Nature's Nutrient for the Neurons' on account of its ability to stimulate the production of nerve growth factor (NGF)1,2.
NGF plays an essential role in the differentiation and survival of several cell populations in the central and peripheral nervous system and lower than normal levels of NGF have been linked to early stages of both Alzheimer's disease and dementia3-8.
Although therapeutic interest has largely focussed on its importance for neurological function, NGF plays a much wider role in maintaining homoeostasis in the body9,10. It is known to have insulinotropic, angiogenic, and antioxidant properties and reduced plasma levels of NGF have been associated with cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndromes, including type 2 diabetes11,12.
It has been shown to accelerate wound healing and there is evidence that it could be useful in the treatment of skin and corneal ulcers13. Animal studies have shown NGF to have a profound effect on airway inflammation and asthma-related symptoms with increased NGF levels observed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum from patients with asthma14.
NGF also has a dynamic relationship with the immune system. Generation of NGF is increased after brain injury, in part due to cytokines produced by immune cells. At the same time immune cells express receptors for NGF, which is involved in immune modulation15.
Two families of compounds from H. erinaceus have been identified as being active in the stimulation of NGF production: the aromatic hericenones (isolated from the fruiting body) and the diterpenoid erinacines (isolated from the mycelium). Critically these molecules are small enough to pass through the blood-brain barrier. There is also evidence that they can increase myelination1,16-18.
In China the mycelium is used to make H. erinaceus pills to treat gastric and duodenal ulcers, chronic gastritis, gastric and oesophageal cancer.
DEMENTIA - In controlled studies H. erinaceus supplementation showed beneficial effects in patients with mild dementia. In one study six out of seven patients showed improvement in functional capacity (understanding, communication, memory etc.) while all seven showed improved Functional Independence Scores (eating, dressing, walking etc.), after consuming 5g H. erinaceus fruiting body daily in soup for six months1.
In another study, 30 patients aged 50-80 with mild dementia were randomised into treatment and control groups. H. erinaceus was given as tablets at 3g/day for 16 weeks and produced significant increases in cognitive function in the treatment group. However, four weeks after the conclusion of the trial, cognitive function scores decreased indicating a need for continued supplementation17.
MS - H. erinaceus fruiting body extract has been shown to improve the myelination process in mature myelinating fibres with possible benefits for MS patients18,19. NGF has also been shown to have a protective effect on axons and myelin by suppressing the immune-mediated inflammatory processes responsible for chronic brain destruction in neurodegenerative disorders such as MS by switching the immune response to an anti-inflammatory, suppressive mode in a brain-specific environment13.
NEUROPATHY - NGF plays a role in pain sensitivity and low NGF levels have been linked to sensory neuropathy in both in vivo and in vitro studies10. Enhanced NGF production has been shown to protect sensory function in diabetic rats and NGF reduction has been shown to cause cardiac sensory neuropathy21,22.
Clinical studies with recombinant human NGF indicate benefit in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy23 and NGF has also been reported to reduce pain in patients with HIV associated sensory neuropathy24,25. However, ability to promote regeneration of sensory neurons has yet to be demonstrated26,27.
NERVE DAMAGE - Rats given aqueous extract of H. erinaceus fruiting bodies showed faster recovery from nerve injury, suggesting potential for application of H. erinaceus in the early stages of nerve regeneration28-31.
ANXIETY / DEPRESSION - One study reports reduction in anxiety and depression from consumption of 2g/day (taken in cookies) and patients often report increased feelings of wellbeing when taking H. erinaceus, possibly due to the kappa opiod receptor agonist activity of the erinacines32,33.
MENOPAUSAL SYNDROME - Many patients report reduction in symptoms related to menopause and perimenopause, including sleep disturbance, anxiety and hot flushes (hot flashes) from consumption of H. erinaceus 3-5g/day d.w. although this is as yet unsupported by clinical research.
MRSA - Extracts of both fruiting body and mycelium exhibit anti-MRSA activity with erinacines identified as active compounds. In clinical tests in Japan MRSA is reported to have been cleared in a number of patients whose diet was supplemented with H. erinaceus34.
GASTRIC ULCERS - One of the traditional indications for H. erinaceus, it appears likely that the antibacterial action of the erinacines and hericenones contribute to its benefit in this regard, with Helicobacter pylori now known to be a major cause of gastric ulcers and chronic gastritis35-37.
A rat study on the effects of H. erinaceus aqueous extract on alcohol-induced ulcers showed a significant reduction of the ulcer area, as well as protection against gastric mucosa injury, while an in vitro study found that H. erinaceus extract was active against nine clinical strains of H. pylori with a 0.02% concentration having a 50% bactericidal activity38,39.
CLINICAL SUMMARY
Main Therapeutic Application - Dementia, Alzheimer's disease, MS, nerve damage, menopausal synrome.
Key Component - Hericenones and erinacines.
Dose - Clinical trials support the use of dried fruiting body at a dose of 3-5g/day for increasing NGF production while animal studies on the use of H. erinaceus for gastric ulcers produced the best results with a daily intake of 500mg/kg, which equates to the dosage prescribed in the Chinese Phamacopoeia of 25-50g/day40.
It is likely that similar doses would be required in cases of MRSA.
High in vitro NGF promoting activity of mycelial extracts and the fermentation broth also indicates potential for the use of mycelial biomass products 41,42.
Caution - Asthma and other allergic conditions. Erinacine E is a potent agonist of the kappa opioid receptor with potential hallucinogenic properties33.

Robert Lewandowski: Staying at Dortmund, insists general manager Hans-Joachim Watzke
The coveted Pole has already made their feelings clear that they expect to move to Bayern Munich next season, but Watzke has denied having given the striker their word that they can move.
With a switch within the Bundesliga ruled out until their contract expires in 2014, speculation had mounted that they would instead be tempted by a move abroad.
Spain and England had both been rumoured as destinations, with Real Madrid, Chelsea and Manchester City most strongly linked with the 24-year-old.
But Watzke says they too would be wasting their time trying to lure them away from Westphalia.
"Robert will definitely be playing for Borussia Dortmund next season," they told Germany's Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. "We need this security to be able to plan (for the season)."
Lewandowski has scored 54 goals in 98 Bundesliga appearances for Dortmund and became the first player to score four goals in a semi-final of the Champions League when they single-handedly dismantled Real Madrid.
A convicted sex offender was beaten by a group of three people who caught them allegedly attempting to kidnap a 6-year-old girl in a Seattle park.
Jesse "Infamous" Brisbin, 30, allegedly asked the little girl, who was playing with their siblings, to leave Benefit Park in Beacon Hill with them around 7 p.m. Thursday, KOMO News reported. When the girl refused, they allegedly took their shirt off and tied it over the girl's face, dragging them away from the park.
However, a group of about 20 children and adults noticed what was happening and chased Brisbin down.
“We all run down the hill and we catch him," Tayzauhn Burns-Miller, 13, told KIRO 7.
Officers arrived at the scene to find the victim's father and two of their friends beating Brisbin. They told officers that Brisbin attacked one of them after they confronted him.
Brisbin was taken to jail on suspicion of kidnapping.
Dog meat will be banned at an annual Chinese festival after activists campaigned to stop millions of animals being stolen and bludgeoned to death each year.
The government is set to prohibit restaurants, street vendors and market traders from selling dog meat at the barbaric Yulin festival.
It is believed the ban will come into effect on June 15 - one week before the festival begins - and strictly enforced by fines of up to 100,000 yuan and risk of arrest.
Millions of helpless cats will still be transported to the festival to be brutally slaughtered in front of each other and sold for their meat, alongside other types of meat.

Animal campaigners Duo Duo Animal Welfare Project and Humane Society International (HSI) received reports of a ban from Chinese activists, which were confirmed by three traders at the market.
The news is warmly - if cautiously - welcomed by Duo Duo, HSI and their respective Chinese animal group partners on the ground, all of whom have campaigned for years for an end to the brutality of Yulin and China's year-round dog meat trade.
More than 10million dogs and around four million cats are killed every year across China for their meat.
Contrary to popular belief, the Yulin festival is not a traditional event but one invented in 2010 by dog meat traders to boost flagging sales.

At its height an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 dogs were killed at Yulin, reduced to 2,000 to 3,000 in recent years.
Most of the dogs are stolen pets and strays grabbed from the streets still wearing their collars when they reach the slaughterhouse where they are typically beaten to death.
Most people in China don't eat dogs, and pet owners and dog thieves have had numerous violent clashes.
The dog meat trade also poses a threat to public health, with the World Health Organisation warning that the trade spreads rabies and increases the risk of cholera.
Campaigners recognise that the ban is temporary and does not yet signal an end to the Yulin event in advance of which dogs are still likely to be killed.

It is still a milestone victory in the ongoing campaign to end mass dog and cat slaughter at Yulin, and is evidence of growing political will from inside China to clamp down on the trade.
Andrea Gung, executive director of Duo Duo Animal Welfare Project, says: 'Even if this is a temporary ban, we hope this will have a domino effect, leading to the collapse of the dog meat trade.
'I have visited Yulin many times in the last two years. This ban is consistent with my experience that Yulin and the rest of the country are changing for the better. I am very impressed that the younger generation in Yulin and in China is as compassionate as their counterparts in the rest of world.
'Duo Duo Project also wants to congratulate Mr Mo Gong Ming, Yulin's new Party Secretary, for their progressive and visionary leadership. I hope this will turn out to be the beginning of the end of the dog eating habit in China.'

Peter Li, China Policy specialist at Humane Society International, says: 'The Yulin dog meat festival is not over just yet, but if this news is true as we hope, it is a really big nail in the coffin for a gruesome event that has come to symbolise China's crime-fuelled dog meat trade.
'Millions of dogs and cats are stolen each year, including pets, and driven thousands of miles across China to be bludgeoned to death in front of each other. As opposition to this trade has grown within China and across the world, much focus has been placed on the Yulin festival and so it is significant politically that the authorities are taking the outrage to curb this cruelty seriously.
'At last year's Yulin festival there were roadblocks set up to deter dog trucks coming in, and now this ban signals further progress.
'Regrettably, many dogs and cats will still be killed for the Yulin festival in advance of the ban, so their suffering is not over yet, but this is certainly a milestone victory and we commend the Yulin authorities for taking this action.'

Actress Carrie Fisher, Made In Chelsea's Lucy Watson, singer Sandi Thom, actor Jenny Seagrove, TV vet Marc Abraham and TV dog trainer Victoria Stilwell all joined in the petition to stop the horrific slaughter of helpless dogs
A massive rally in Dalian organized by the city government drew more than 100,000 people representing 1300 groups to protest the barbaric festival
Animal rights advocates gather before staging a protest outside the representative office of Yulin city government in Beijing in June 2016
Duo Duo and HSI are urging Yulin authorities to make the ban permanent, make public service announcements warning against transporting dogs for the dog meat trade that highlight the new associated penalties, enforce food safety laws and regulations and build a government facility to house dogs confiscated from the dog meat trade.
Last year, a petition with 11million signatures was handed in to the Yulin government in Beijing on behalf of Humane Society International, Duo Duo Animal Welfare Project, RaiseUrPaw, Care2 and Avaaz.
The late Star Wars actor Carrie Fisher and their dog Gary gathered with the campaigners outside the Chinese Embassy in London to send the petition on its way.
Speaking at the event, Mrs Fisher said 'There is so much animal suffering in the world, and much of it you feel helpless to end.
'But stopping the Yulin dog meat festival and ending all that suffering is easy. All the Chinese authorities need to do is declare it shut down, and the killing stops.
'These poor dogs need us to fight for them. Every single one of them is as precious as my dear Gary, every one of them is someone's best friend.'
There is a tireless campaign in China to end the dog meat trade, with Chinese animal activists staging protests and dog rescues all year round.
Republicans: Obama still not doing enough to boost economy “Millions are still struggling” despite Friday's big job numbers, House Speaker John Boehner said.
President Barack Obama is still doing too little to promote economic growth, Republicans said Friday even as they welcomed the good news in the latest jobs report.
Republicans have slowly embraced the idea that the monthly jobs reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show an economy on the mend. Friday's report estimated that the economy created 257,000 jobs in January and revised December's figure to 329,000 new jobs — with the latter meaning that more jobs were created in 2014 than any year since 1999.
Story Continued Below
Even so, House Speaker John Boehner said, “millions are still struggling and searching for a good job.” They said the economy needs a further boost, which could happen if Obama signs into law Republican-backed priorities like approving the Keystone XL pipeline and rolling back regulations.
“If the president is serious about helping the middle class, he'll reconsider their threat to veto these bills and work with us to get these things done,” the Ohio Republican said.
And Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, the chairperson of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement that economic recovery is still “too fragile for far too many.”
The jobs report put the unemployment rate at 5.7 percent — a slight uptick from December.
The Obama administration heralded the report as a sign that the economy is on an upward trajectory. Obama said last week that Democrats need to be more aggressive in taking credit for job growth by trumpeting Obamacare and the stimulus as key factors.
“America is poised for another strong year,” Jason Furman, chairperson of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in a blog post. “And so it is critical to avoid brinksmanship and unnecessary austerity, and instead to make investments in our future growth.”
But Republicans pointed out that some areas of the economy haven't returned to their pre-recession levels.
Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), the chairperson-designate of the Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement that “unemployment remains unacceptably high.” Obama is set to travel to Coats' home state Friday to discuss the economy.
“It is welcome news that our economy added jobs at the start of the new year,” Coats said. “Despite this progress, full-time employment has yet to reach pre-recession levels and the amount of people participating in the workforce remains near 30-year lows.”
A Dublin couple, who have been ordered by Dublin Circuit Court to vacate their home by midnight tomorrow, say they have nowhere else to live and face prison.
Violet (61) and Martin (72) Coyne, have been renting their home in Carpenterstown, west Dublin for 15 years. Their landlord, who had a mortgage with ACC Bank, went into receivership in mid 2012.
They received notice from KPMG, who had been appointed receivers for the bank, in November 2012 telling them their “tenure” had been terminated, and they had 112 days to leave their home by March, 12th, 2013. The receiver intended selling the house.
They contacted the Private Residential Tenancies Board for advice on their rights. “They did nothing for us really,” says Mr Coyne.
The PRTB determined on September 17th, 2013, the receiver had the right to expect the property back within 28 days.
“We have been looking for somewhere else to rent but there's nothing anywhere we can afford. We're looking non-stop, but there's nothing.”
Their rent, originally €1,100 a month had come down in recent years to €800 a month. They have a combined weekly income of a €363 in State pension, and are entitled to rent allowance of €700 a month.
However, they are unable to find a property to rent within the rent allowance cap and in the area where they are eager to stay, as they have children and other family there.
Couple brought to court The receivers, who stopped accepting their rent cheques in December 2013 brought the couple to court. They have appeared on four occasions before Ms Justice Jacqueline Linane, without legal representation.
Having applied to the Legal Aid Board, Mr Coyne was offered an appointment with a solicitor for August 25th.
The appearances culminated last month with an order from Ms Justice Linane that they be out of the house by midnight, July 22nd or be “committed to prison”.
They were in contact with Fingal County Council. “We've been on the housing list since 2010. The housing section say we will be waiting three to four years for a house. The homelessness section told us there was nothing they could do until we were homeless,” said Mr Coyne.
Plan to buy house The couple originally had a plan to buy the house. Using some savings and a loan of €280,000, they bought a site nearby. Mr Coyne, a retired brick-layer, had a plan to build a house with their three sons, and sell it on completion.
They would clear the loan and buy the house they are now being ordered to leave. Their landlord was agreeable to the idea.
After six years getting planning permission the build began in 2007.
Near-constant rain through the summer delayed completion further however. Finally finished at the end of the year, the five-bedroom, 2,100 sq ft house went sale-agreed, for €800,000.
However, the buyer pulled out, the housing crash came and the house was repossessed later in 2008. The loan was written off.
“I am angry all the time,” says Violet. “I just think ‘What's the point?' ‘What has it all been for?' ”
They are due back in court on Wednesday, after the midnight deadline tomorrow.
They plan to stay at home while they will face the judge. “No one has offered us any help or ever offered us a suggestion about what we should do,” they say. “Where is the morality in that? Where is the humanity? Is this what the State wants to do to people like us?
“All we want is to stay here and keep paying rent to the bank.”
Neither ACC nor KPMG would comment on the case.
Tame Impala have been on a roll on the awards circuit lately. In addition to earning several nods at the recent WA Music Awards, the Perth outfit recently took home their first ARIA Award and they're up for several more at this Thursday's ceremony.
However, the Kevin Parker-led project can now add another (somewhat dubious) accolade to their ever-expanding list. They are officially one of the most pirated music acts on the internet, a title they share with the likes of Drake, Beyonce, and Nicki Minaj.
Digital Music News recently shared a list of the 100 most popular music downloads on The Pirate Bay, aka the web's go-to destination for pirated content, and Tame Impala's latest acclaimed full-length effort, Currents, is there front and centre.
We're not sure if that's an honour Parker was hoping for, but if their past comments are anything to go by, he's not particularly fussed about fans downloading their music illegally. Speaking to BBC 6 Music back in September, Parker shared their thoughts on the matter.
“There are some CDs I saved up for months to buy when I was doing a paper round, I'd literally spend two months saving up to buy a CD,” Parker said when remarking on their early experience of buying music.
“But then later in life my friend would burn me a CD that he'd downloaded illegally and it was just as much of a powerful experience, even though the sound quality was kind of crappy.”
“For me that shows that it's not really how much you pay for it or even whether or not it's physical, it can still have an effect on you,” they added. “I'm not sure what that says about artists making money in the future,” they conceded.
“Obviously artists need to make money but I also believe that if you do something good the wealth will find you some way. If music was free I think it changes the experience but it doesn't necessarily cheapen it. It doesn't make it any less profound.”
“I used to download music illegally, everyone has,” Parker admitted. “Nobody is innocent. If someone says ‘I love your album but I downloaded it for free' then good! I don't want their 20 bucks.”

The heads of Arab League countries meeting in Egypt have agreed to create a joint Arab military force.
The League has been meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh amid a crisis in Yemen and the threat of jihadists who have made major gains in Iraq, Syria and Libya.
However, establishing the make-up and remit of the force could take months, analysts say.
A 10-nation, Saudi-led coalition is currently carrying out air strikes against rebels in Yemen.
The strikes are in support of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who fled after gains by the Shia Houthi rebels.
Correspondents have described the conflict as a proxy war between Sunni Arab nations and Shia Iran.
'Voluntary force'
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said: "The Arab leaders have decided to agree on the principle of a joint Arab military force."
Analysis: Alan Johnston, BBC Middle East analyst
Like everyone else, President Sisi sees plenty to worry about as they look across the Middle East. They describe the growing threats to the region as "unprecedented".
Unsurprisingly this military man loudly advocates military solutions. And now they have got agreement on the principle of establishing a joint Arab military force.
We are yet to see what this might look like in detail. And there will be plenty of sceptics.
In an area as sensitive as military intervention, how much real coordination might be possible across an Arab world that is so often so easily divided?
But perhaps things are changing a little. Even as President Sisi spoke, exactly the kind of action they want to see was unfolding. A Saudi-led joint Arab force - which has come together surprisingly quickly and easily - was striking at Houthi rebel targets in Yemen.
The Arab League will work with military representatives of its members to organise what has been described as a voluntary force.
Analysts say it is unlikely all 22 members will join the proposed force.
Image copyright AP Image caption The announcement comes amid gains by Houthi rebels in Yemen
Egyptian officials quoted by Associated Press said the force would comprise some 40,000 elite troops, supported by war planes, naval vessels and light armour.
The creation of the joint force has long been floated within the League but has never been realised.
There has been no indication such a force would be deployed in the Yemen conflict.
However, Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi said the Saudi-led offensive against the Houthis would "continue until the militia withdraws and surrenders its weapons".
They added: "Yemen was on the brink of the abyss, requiring effective Arab and international moves after all means of reaching a peaceful resolution have been exhausted to end the Houthi coup and restore legitimacy."
Saudi Arabia says the Houthis are backed by regional rival Iran - something the rebels deny.
Mr Hadi on Saturday accused Tehran of destabilising the country, calling the Houthis the "stooges of Iran".
The Houthis have said their aim is to replace Mr Hadi's government, which they accuse of being corrupt.

Brighton & Hove Albion would like to thank all those supporters who travelled to last night's Carabao Cup match at AFC Bournemouth.
Your support of the team is, as always, greatly appreciated by all at the club.
The club is aware that of the 1235 sell out away attendance, almost 50% of those who purchased tickets chose not to attend the match.
It is extremely disappointing to see so many supporters purchasing tickets and not attending the match, the majority in order to gain loyalty points.
The loyalty point system is, by definition, about rewarding loyalty of those supporters who travel and support the team up and down the country.
Buying low-priced tickets simply to gain points is against the spirit of the system and, as bad, does nothing to support the team.
Furthermore, this practice not only prevents supporters who wish to go and support the team from attending the match in question, but it also stops those same fans from gaining valuable and deserved loyalty points to allow them to go future matches.
This practice reached unacceptable levels at last night's match and as a result we have now requested the attendance data from Bournemouth and will be reviewing this information very carefully over the next few days.
Going forward, it is clear that changes need to be made to the club's terms and conditions where they concern loyalty points. The club will also take the opportunity to review the process of loyalty point allocation and, where possible, will also seek to reconcile the sale of ticket to away matches with attendance data from host clubs.
It is sad, once again, we find ourselves committing considerable time and club resources to dealing with individuals abusing the club's ticketing system for their own personal unfair gain.
To those supporters who did attend last night's match and supported the team, once again, the club would like to thank you for your attendance.
With the rise of AMC's The Walking Dead and Zombies as a whole, It is important now more than ever to remind you of the often forgotten danger of infection.
In recent adaptations depicting zombie apocalypses we here at Aaahh Real Zombies noticed that directors and writers tend to neglect one of the most dangerous opportunities to become infected. There is of course biting but what about infected blood.
As the image above may remind you, In 28 days later one character finds out the hard way as a Crow drops blood from an infected corpse into their eye and as a result they turn.The speed at which one will turn is debatable, but the speed at which the body will absorb into the bloodstream something introduced through the eyes is incredibly quick.
This is forgotten in a lot of newer adaptations with characters being covered in the blood of zombies and zombies dribbling and spitting blood when fighting and it just gets us thinking, how have these people not thought more carefully about this? With zombies around, there's guaranteed to be alot of blood involved and if you come into close proximity with a zombie, apart from the gashing and gnawing teeth, the blood and the risk of being infected is insanely high.
As a result, we here at Aaahh Real Zombies urge you to think of this when you go out to front them and perhaps don a pair of these stylish little things? Simple yet effective!!!
EDIT: Or thanks to Redditor ‘CkeehnerPA‘ one of these:

Conor McGregor was scheduled to rematch Nate Diaz in the main event of UFC 200, but ended up removed from the card after they refused to do a media tour to promote the event.
Jose Aldo, a former UFC featherweight champion who battles Frankie Edgar for the interim title on the same night on July 9, was on the media tour during the week, and criticized "The Notorious" for their decision.
"That proves how weak they are," Aldo told ESPN. "I don't see them as an athlete, I don't respect him. In my opinion, he's weaker than everything they always said."
Aldo (25-2) and Edgar (20-4-1) will rematch at UFC 200 for a chance to meet McGregor for the undisputed 145-pound belt later this year. During today's press conference in New York, Aldo says they still feel he's the champion, and the Edgar bout is the final step before avenging a 13-second loss to McGregor.
HOLOGRAPHIC has reached our one-year mark, and we are more committed than ever to provide scintillating concerts of new chamber music to the public. We have reached a point where our project requires a little extra support, and that's why we are seeking you as our partners for our mission. Recruiting, curating, promoting, and performing concerts in public is something we love to do. We hope that you will share that love and will contribute to our 2013 project goals.
2013: THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD, HOLOGRAPHIC-STYLE
Our project for 2013 is a four-concert new music series that will take place in alternative venues and high schools located in Bloomington, IN. These concerts (February, April, October, and December) will feature new, innovative, and exciting chamber music played by some of the most dazzling young performers in our fair land. However, performing new music is only part of our mission: we believe that premiering new pieces is not only our privilege but our duty.
With this in mind, an important part of your collaboration with us is the fertilization of a new music egg: Tsubame, by Jonathan Sokol. Jonathan has been working feverishly to complete a sinfonietta (small chamber orchestra) piece for us to bring to life. Won't you join our team and contribute to the commissioning fund of a brand-new music baby?
The rest of your generosity will go towards other vital resources (see below), believe you us! HOLOGRAPHIC concerts cannot happen without the generosity of the performers who volunteer their time and the staff who spend countless hours organizing and promoting. Up until now, HOLOGRAPHIC has been funded by the co-founders themselves. In order to maintain a level of spectacle beyond our wildest dreams, we are proposing this budget for success:
$7,500 budget
* $3000 to commission Jonathan Sokol's Tsubame for sinfonietta
* $2000 to rent performance spaces and purchase insurance for concerts
* $1000 to professionally record and edit audio and video of all four concerts
* $500 for technical support (moving equipment, piano technicians, etc.)
* $500 for promotional expenses (printed and digital advertisements)
* $500 for score and parts preparations, printing, binding, and shipping fees
There are multiple levels of donations, and contributing as little as $10 will get you perks! Every little bit counts, and we appreciate your support!
The 2016 elections: American democracy in shambles
21 October 2016
In the aftermath of the final presidential debate on Wednesday, the US media is in an uproar over statements made by Republican candidate Donald Trump that they might not recognize the result of the November 8 election.
Asked by debate moderator Chris Wallace from Fox News whether they would “absolutely accept the result of this election,” Trump replied that they would “look at it at the time,” and would “keep you in suspense.” On Thursday, Trump climbed down on their remarks somewhat, saying that they would “accept a clear election result.” However, arguing that Clinton “is the most corrupt and dishonest person ever to seek office,” they added that they would reserve the right “to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result.”
Trump's comments at the debate are in line with previous statements that the election is rigged by the media in favor of Clinton, and their assertions, which clearly have racist overtones, that millions of Americans, particularly in urban centers, are voting illegally.  They are pitching their appeal to conditions that will develop after the elections, seeking to channel social anger and hostility to the entire political system in an extremely right-wing direction.
From the media and dominant sections of the political establishment, the response has been universal condemnation of Trump for besmirching the purity of American democracy. The Washington Post proclaimed that “respecting the will of the voters has since the end of the Civil War allowed for a peaceful transition of power that has made this country the envy of the world.” The New York Times added that Trump has turned from “insulting the intelligence of the American voter to insulting American democracy itself.”
Republican Senator and former presidential candidate John McCain issued a statement declaring that a concession to the victor in an election is “an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader's first responsibility.” And Vice President Joe Biden, donning the mantle of sanctimonious outrage, said in a speech on Thursday, “If you question, if you assert that a democratic election is fixed, you are attacking the very essence of the notion of whether we have a democratic system.”
These statements from newspaper editorial boards and leading politicians reek of hypocrisy. They also express a nervousness whose causes extend far beyond the comments of Mr. Trump. The political representatives of the ruling class are rushing to the defense of a political system that is increasingly seen as illegitimate by broad sections of the population.
From a historical standpoint, it must first of all be pointed out that until the middle of the 20th century every election in the United States was “fixed,” insofar as large portions of the population were barred from voting. Women were only given the right to vote in 1920. The systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans in the South—through poll taxes, Jim Crow segregation and other measures—was only ended in the mid-1960s, a byproduct of the immense social struggles of that period. And it was only in 1971 that the age of eligibility for the franchise was lowered from 21 to 18. Until then, young men could be drafted to fight and die in wars at the order of a commander-in-chief they could not vote for.
For the past four decades, democratic forms of rule have been under systematic attack, in line with the extreme growth of social inequality. A turning point came with the campaign to impeach Bill Clinton over a sex scandal in 1998 and 1999, followed by the theft of the election in 2000. To the extent that the 2000 elections are mentioned at all in the present discussion over Trump's comments, it is to praise Al Gore's “respect for the process” in accepting the Supreme Court decision to hand the election to George W. Bush.
In fact, the 5-4 decision by the highest court in the country to halt the recounting of ballots in Florida installed in office an individual who lost the popular vote and, if all the ballots had been fairly counted, the electoral vote as well. In one of the decisions culminating in this travesty of democracy, the Supreme Court asserted that the American people have no constitutional right to vote for the president of the United States. The rigging of the 2000 election was carried out, not in the back room of a county courthouse, but by the highest court in the land.
In early December 2000, in advance of the decision in Bush v. Gore, WSWS editorial board chairperson David North noted that the decision would reveal “how far the American ruling class is prepared to go in breaking with traditional bourgeois-democratic and constitutional norms.” In the end, the blatantly political action by Supreme Court was met with no serious opposition from the Democratic Party and Gore, or from the media and political establishment as a whole. The outcome, as the WSWS wrote at the time, “revealed the lack of any significant constituency within the ruling elite for a democratic adjudication of the presidential election.”
The ruling class has demonstrated its contempt for democracy through its actions over the past decade and a half. The attacks of September 11, 2001 were followed, under Bush and then Obama, by a raft of anti-democratic measures justified by the “war on terror”: the Patriot Act; warrantless mass surveillance; indefinite detention without trial; torture and “extraordinary rendition”; drone assassination, including of US citizens; the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security and the Northern Command, a military jurisdiction to oversee the increasing domestic use of the military. To this list must be added a militarized police force that kills more than 1,000 Americans every year.
As for the electoral process, Supreme Court decisions have undermined the Voting Rights Act and sanctioned state laws requiring photo IDs and other restrictions aimed at disenfranchising poor, elderly and minority voters. Some 6 million citizens (one out of every 40 eligible voters) are barred from voting due to previous felony convictions. The Citizens United decision in 2010 abolished restrictions on big business financing of candidates and their political action committees. It is estimated that more than $7 billion has been spent on the 2016 elections, all told, twice what was spent in 2012.
Everything is done to prevent independent and third-party candidates from having their names appear on the ballot, including requirements that they gather tens or even hundreds of thousands of signatures. Many states will not even count write-in votes. Meanwhile, the media works to ensure that the official “debate” remains safely confined to the narrow framework acceptable to the ruling class.
“American democracy” is a hollowed-out shell, overseen by two parties that are controlled by the financial oligarchy and the military. The experience of the Obama administration—which came to power promising “change you can believe in”—has only demonstrated to millions of people that their vote has no impact on the policies of the ruling class.
The protracted decay of American democracy has culminated in the election of 2016, a contest between a millionaire scion of the Clinton dynasty and a billionaire real estate speculator and reality television star.
Trump themselves is a product of a diseased social and political system, the legitimate heir of the “war on terror.” As for Clinton, they are merely another expression of the same disease, running their campaign on the basis of the same scandal-mongering used by the Republicans against their husband, combined with McCarthyite smears that have a long and noxious history.
The Democrats' stock response to any question about leaked emails exposing Clinton's ties to Wall Street is to change the subject to the completely unsubstantiated claim that it is all the handiwork of Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Trump has said that they might not accept the election as legitimate, if Clinton is defeated the Democrats will declare that it is the result of Russia's interference in the electoral process.
Behind the whole rotten process, the fundamental issues are covered up or ignored. The reality of American “democracy” can perhaps be summed up in the fact that, three weeks before November 8, the American military has launched a massive military escalation in the Middle East, and there is no significant discussion about the consequences in an election that is supposedly the principal means through which the population can affect policy.
The crisis of democracy is a product of the decay of American capitalism, overseen by a ruling class that is determined to advance a policy of war abroad and austerity at home—a policy that requires ever greater attacks on democratic forms of rule. Whatever happens on November 8, it will resolve nothing, and only set the stage for a protracted political crisis that can be resolved only through the independent intervention of the working class on the basis of a revolutionary socialist program.

The 2014 Rookie Scouting Portfolio is now available for download . . . really!
There's a first time for everything . . .
For the first time in over 700 posts, I hit “publish” instead of save and it had to be the post I was saving to announce the RSP and I can't even blame it on the family pet. All's good now. The 2014 Rookie Scouting Portfolio is ready for download.
The 2014 Rookie Scouting Portfolio Tale of the Tape
Standing at 1284 pages and covering 164 skill prospects, the 2014 Rookie Scouting Portfolio is now available for download at www.mattwaldman.com. Because a post-draft addendum is now a regular part of the RSP purchase, it has allowed me the luxury to weigh my rankings less on draft stock and more on talent until we see how opportunity knocks at the NFL Draft. Take video tour.
As was the case last year, many of the climbers and fallers in my pre-draft rankings surprised me. I look forward to sharing more of my thoughts about these players and the process in the coming weeks.
Here's what my readers have to say about the RSP:
“You should also know, that in fifteen years of playing fantasy football (I started in 1999 – Senior year of high school), I have never paid for fantasy football information. Not magazines. Not websites. Nothing. I read/listen to everything possible as I digest information and draw my own conclusions. I was apprehensive about ‘wasting' twenty dollars. Thank you for the hours spent doing something you love. I appreciate it. Again, quality in-depth work. I would would pay double the price. Easily. Get some sleep.” – Josh Corbett
“Purchased the RSP by @MattWaldman for the first time. Lots of “holy ____”‘s were said in an empty house. Incredible work” Zack Henkle via Twitter
“The only thing I have read that I looked forward to more than the RSP was the Harry Potter books. Football Nerd Goodness” – Lisa London
“I truly think the RSP is the best draft resource money can buy.” -Ryan Lownes, Draft Analyst for DraftBreakdown.com
” Best pre-draft scouting report on every conceivable guy [at the skills positions] is by @MattWaldman. Very good read – mattwaldman.com.” –Chris Brown, author of Smartfootball.com and Grantland contributor
“Just pre-ordered my annual copy of football gold.” – Aaron Statts via Twitter
“Yours is the ONLY publication I ever pay for in fantasy football. Mahalo for the quality!!!” – Jim
“Can't wait for the #RSP. I am like Billy Madison on nudie magazine day! – Matt Austin via Twitter
“I first experienced the RSP last year and after reading several pages, you got me for only god knows how much time you'll be doing it. I'd prepay this for the next ten years easily. I mean it in the most sincere way, this has become my most anticipated read of the year and once again, I know it will be awesome.” – Dom
“BTW, I first purchased your RSP in 2011, won my league that year, had a middling team, repeated in 2012, still a middling team. How I have used RSP the most is during the season for my waiver pickups, always nice to reference your report when trying to decide between a few players. Thank you again. Oh, btw, the other 11 owners think I am lucky, lol, I am but for different reasons than THEY think 🙂 ” – Warren
“You won't find a better resource. Matt Waldman delivers. Period. Cannot recommend more highly.” – Bob Harris, FSTA Hall of Famer
“Best dynasty rookie document there is. Can't live w/o it.” – Tim Stafford, Dynasty League Football staff writer.
“In case you guys havne't heard, @MattWaldman's RSP will be availalble April 1st. I must-buy for fans of the NFL Draft.” – BillsTalk.com via Twitter

Recently, we were introduced to John Alabi, a 52 year old Ontario man, who is being issued a sharia ticket for $12,000 by this province's Human Rights Tribunal.
Some background: John is a Christian who came to Canada 22 years ago from Nigeria. Since then, he's followed Canadian laws and worked hard; they carry not one but two jobs today, just to ensure their family is cared for.
John's a man with the sort of story every Canadian should be proud of.
But instead, he's being labelled a human rights violator.
John is now being ordered to pay an Arab Muslim couple, their former tenants, a whopping $12K for a failure to accommodate their religion — all because John didn't remove their shoes when showing the bedroom where this couple prayed to potential new occupants.
So, The Rebel started a crowdfunding mission at HelpJohn.ca to get John Alabi the money they needed to pay the jizya. But we heard from Rebel supporters who said they wanted to help John — but not in this way.
Our supporters wanted to help John fight, not give in.
And so, we went back to John with your feedback.
As many of you know, John has not had it easy. For two years, John has been racking up legal fees and spent an inordinate amount of time combatting the case filed by Walid Madkour and their wife Heba Ismail.
Their difficulties were compounded when they lost their young son during the proceedings.
But now, John says he's ready to get back in the ring against Ontario's Human Rights Tribunal, under one condition: We help them pay their legal fees.
The total cost of their legal fees which include the Request for Reconsideration, Divisional Court and Appeals will be $8000+HST ($9040).
So now it's time we live up to our promise. If you want to be a part of this important fight to appeal a dangerous Sharia precedent from being set in Canada, please contribute at HelpJohn.ca!
The Muslim Brotherhood is the largest political party in Egypt's new parliament [EPA]
The Muslim Brotherhood's nomination of Khairat al-Shater for President of Egypt has raised many eyebrows and confused an already muddled political scene in the Arab world's most populous country.
Shocking, but hardly surprising, the decision comes after the group's repeated promises not to run its own candidate for president.
Indeed, al-Shater told Al Jazeera Arabic only a few weeks ago that the Brotherhood wouldn't nominate a candidate and if they themselves stood for elections, the group wouldn't lend them its support.
But the man I sat down with in Cairo two months ago is a determined leader for whom actions speak louder than words. As the situation changes, so do the decision.
They might be the second-in-command, but everyone agreed Shater is the Brotherhood's strong man.
Although they spent a number of years in prison, no-one knows the finances and the organisation of the Brotherhood better than this architect-turned-politician.
Al-Shater assured me that there are no serious quarrels between the Muslim Brotherhood and other political parties about the need to achieve the goals of Egypt's revolution. The group's record speaks for itself, they said.
But for many, the way in which the Brotherhood reversed itself on the nomination hits at the very heart of its political credibility.
So what drove the group and its leading political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) to radically change its course? And what does the about-face mean for the future of Egypt's revolution?
Vying for power
Egypt: The promise and peril of revolution
Islamists already control the majority of seats in the parliament and Constitutional Assembly. The FJP's Saad El-Katatni, speaker of the parliament, heads the two bodies that will write laws and the country's new constitution.
Over the last few weeks, the FJP has been calling for the fall of the government in order for it to form a new one under its direct control.
If they eventually win the presidency, the Brotherhood would be in charge of all four pillars of Egypt's polity.
Brotherhood leaders argue their decision came as a result of the public's desire and popular pressure for them to run. Besides, what's so un-revolutionary about a former Mubarak prisoner becoming their successor?
Behind the public posturing, however, lies a more calculated strategy.
The Brotherhood fears that if it doesn't field its own candidate, the rival Salafist An-Nour party and its contender, Hazem Salah Abu Islamiel, could win the elections.
Recently, the sheikh who moved swiftly from speaking in "the mosque to speaking to the masses", has been gaining popularity to a degree that shook the ranks and confidence of the Brotherhood.
An-Nour already controls one fourth of the parliamentary seats.
The Brotherhood has also been worried the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) could move to nominate or support a successful candidate and eventually dissolve the parliament that the Brotherhood now heads, leaving it with little or no power to exercise.
However, for many non-Islamist segments of the society, including the youth leaders of Tahrir Square, the Brotherhood's move amounts to an attempt to hijack the revolution and its democratic goals.
They claim the well-organised and well-networked 80-year-old Muslim Brotherhood is pre-empting other political movements by taking control before their opponents have a chance organise in political formations.
If indeed al-Shater wins the presidency, the FJP would be in total control of all political facets in the country.
Worse, it would remain accountable, not to the people per se, but rather to the Brotherhood's Shura (consultative) Council.
Discord within the Brotherhood
Disagreement about Ashater's nomination for president doesn't only come from the Brotherhood's rivals; it also comes from within its own ranks.
Brotherhood to run for Egypt's presidency
The Shura council of the Brotherhood voted in favour of al-Shater by a very slim margin with 56 voting in favour and 52 against their nomination.
That's a huge split by any standard in an organisation that prides itself with consensual Islamic politics.
Indeed, within 24 hours of the announcement, three leading members left the group and voiced scathing criticism of the decision.
There are also signs that segments of the Muslim Brotherhood's younger generation won't go along the decision, whether implicitly or explicitly.
Many of the young Brothers and sisters are sympathetic supporters of the rather liberal Islamist Dr Abdel Moneim Abu al- Fotouh, who was thrown out of the Brotherhood for daring to stand for elections to the presidency against the group's wishes.
Their victory would be considered the Brotherhood's leaders' defeat.
Political mess
It's not clear how the presidential campaign will evolve following al-Shater's nomination or who will make it to the second round to face him.
Be that as it may, the Brotherhood has taken a risky gamble.
If they lose, the Brotherhood's political standing would be terribly undermined, even shattered. If they win, they will be accused of monopolising power like the previous Mubarak led National Democratic Party (NDP).
When I asked al-Shater about such comparisons, which I had heard in Tahrir Square, they dismissed them as unfounded creations of the remnants of the NDP.
However, already the Brotherhood's insistence to take control of the Constitutional Assembly has led to a major fiasco with basically all but the organised Islamists remaining on board.
The Muslim Brotherhood's attempt to lead on all fronts, including the presidency, is alienating many Egyptians and creating a political mess in the process.
Their on-and-off conflict and complicity with SCAF has also created confusion, bitterness and lack of progress in the country with many accusing both sides of advancing their interests at the expense of the revolution and the Egyptian people.
“Revolutionary change is chaotic like Cairo's traffic,” an Egyptian intellectual told me. "It's a mess but it continues to go forward."
True, but at times it gets stuck and goes in circles.

Effective and timely monitoring of your service is crucial to providing a highly available service. Early warnings delivered quickly to the right people who can collaborate on a solution is key to delivering the most number of 9s of uptime. AWS Cloudwatch in conjunction with its Simple Notification Service (SNS) is great for creating alarms for your service and sending notifications to the right people. However, in order to facilitate collaboration in the spirit of chatops, sending these notifications to a chat app like Slack is much more effective than email or SMS alone.
Alarm notifications sent to a Slack channel is much more effective than sending alarms to email and/or SMS in several ways. First, through the Slack channel, you can see who is online to respond to the issue. Team members can quickly post a message that they see the alarm and are available to investigate. The response can quickly be coordinated with available team members. Second, the Slack app on the mobile phone combined with a devops chatbot means that not only can team members receive alarms and collaborate from anywhere, they can also take action on the alarms from anywhere. Third, a Slack channel provides easy controls on notifications. You no longer have to manage members of an email alias, you can simply invite people to the channel and people can leave when they are not on call. Individuals can control how they want to be notified via Slack's notification settings. Finally, the Slack channel provides a convenient timeline for root cause and response analysis. You can easily see when alarms fired, who investigated, and what they did when assuming people communicate in the channel.
In this blog post I will outline in detail how to create a Slack alarm channel for your service using AWS Cloudwatch, SNS, and the Slack email integration. The high level outline is as follows:
Create channel in Slack for alarms Add Slack email integration which assigns an email address to the alarm channel Create an SNS topic for your alarms Create a subscription to the SNS topic that sends email to the email alias from step 2 Set notification for alarms to go to the appropriate SNS topic
Create Slack Alarm Channel
The first step is to create a channel for your service's alarms in Slack. Make a public channel, give it a name and purpose. Press the Create Channel button. For this example, I am creating an acmesite-alarms channel.
Add Slack email integration
Next step is to add the Slack email integration to get an email alias for our Slack alarm channel. This needs to be done by someone who has admin privileges for your Slack account. In the Slack app, click on the chevron in the upper left (to the right of your Slack account name) and select Apps & Integrations.
In the search box, type “email” and then select the Email addon.
This integration generates an email address for your Slack channel. Emails sent to this address will show up in your channel of choice. This integration is available to teams on the Slack Standard Plan and above. Press Add Configuration button.
Type in the name of the Slack alarm channel you created above and press the Add Email Integration button.
You can customize the name and icon used when an email is posted to your alarm channel.
You will receive an email from the slack email integration with the email address assigned to your channel. You will need this email address for subsequent steps. For the acmesite-alarms channel, the following email address was generated: f7x2d5f9z4u6s7z5@bandwidth.slack.com
Test that the integration is working by sending an email to the generated email address for your channel. You should see the email show up in the alarm channel you created similar to the one I sent to the acmesite-alarms channel below.
Create an SNS Topic for your Alarms
Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a managed push notification service that lets you send individual messages or to fan-out messages to large numbers of recipients. You create topics and one or more subscriptions for notifications whenever something is posted to that topic. For this exercise, we are going to create an alarm topic for our site and a subscription with the email address from the Slack email integration above. Technically, we could set the email address for each Cloudwatch alarm we create, however, that is not very manageable. With SNS, we can manage it in one place. Moreover, with SNS we can publish to this topic through other monitoring tools besides Cloudwatch.
First create your SNS topic by going to AWS Services, SNS, and pressing the Create Topic link. Type in a topic name and an optional display name. Click the Create Topic button.
Next, create a subscription to the just created topic (acme-alarms for this example) by going to AWS Services, SNS, and clicking Topics on the left hand side. Check the topic you just created and press the Create New Topic button. Change the protocol to email and set the endpoint to the email assigned to your Slack channel from above. Press the Create subscription button.
Create Alarm That Notifies to SNS Topic
Now that we have an SNS topic for our service's alarms that sends an email to our Slack alarm channel, we need to create one or more alarms that publish to this SNS topic. What alarms to create is going to be dependent on your service. However, since most services will have one or more EC2 instances, we'll walk through the steps of creating an alarm based on EC2 metrics. Go to Services, CloudWatch, click on Alarms, create Alarm, then click on EC2 Metrics. Search for “cpu” and then check an EC2 instance in your service. Your screen will look similar to the one below except with your instances of course.
Click Next.
Set name to myHighCpuAlarm
Put in a description “CPU exceeds 60%”
Click the “is:” drop down and select “>”
Type in 60 in the edit box
Set Period to 1 minute
Under Actions, set Whenever this alarm: to “State is ALARM” select your SNS topic (for this example “acme-alarms”) for Send notification to: field Press the +Notification button set Whenever this alarm: to “State is INSUFFICIENT” select “acme-alarms” for Send notification to: field
Your screen should look similar to the one below
Click Create Alarm
You will get a message in the channel to confirm the subscription. Expand the message and click on the link to confirm the subscription.
Important: You will not receive notifications from alarms until you confirm the subscription.
Test that Alarms will be sent to your Slack Alarm channel
Now we want to verify we have everything wired up correctly and that alarms will indeed go to our Slack alarm channel. We can do this by using the AWS command line interface (see here).
For the configuration used in this example, the following AWS command will put the CloudWatch alarm called myHighCpuAlarm into the alarm state.
prompt> aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state –alarm-name myHighCpuAlarm –state-reason “testing alarm” –state-value ALARM
This will result in an alarm being sent to the alarm channel.
Now that you have successfully created an AWS Cloudwatch alarm that notifies a Slack channel, you can create more alarms and invite appropriate team members to your Slack alarm channel to be notified when alarms fired. You now have the beginnings of a chatops environment that will help your team to more quickly respond and collaborate on alarms fired by your service. Add in a chatbot built using an existing devops open source frameworks like the NodeJS Opkit (https://github.com/Bandwidth/opkit) to automate the common response tasks and your team will be devops ninjas.
Much later, after the hole in the roof had been fixed and the debris cleaned up, after the cause of the damage finally had become clear, Frank Ciampi wondered: What are the odds?
 They are a doctor. They have worked for 18 years in the two-story building in Lorton that houses the Williamsburg Square Family Practice, in the 9500 block of Richmond Highway. They spend their days walking in and out of examining rooms, seeing patients.
What are the chances, as they go about their routine, that he'll get hit by a meteorite?
Not impossible.
It almost happened.
"I was in my office doing charts," Ciampi recalled. It was Monday, a little after 5:30 p.m. They were on the building's second floor. "And I heard a loud boom, almost like a small explosion."
At first, they said, they thought a bookcase had toppled nextdoor. "So I ran toward the office. And then I saw all the debris in the hallway," they said.
The floor just outside examination room No. 2 -- about 10 feet from where Ciampi had been doing paperwork -- was littered with small pieces of wood, plaster and insulation. Upon inspection, more debris lay inside the room. They saw three chunks of stone on the floor that together formed a rock about the size of a tennis ball, with a glassy-smooth surface. Then they saw a hole about the size of the rock in the tile ceiling, and a tear in the maroon carpet where the rock had landed.
"The first thing we thought was maybe something had fallen from a plane," Ciampi said.
For most of the day, the 10 examination rooms used by Ciampi and two other medical professionals in the practice had been occupied by patients. Had the falling object crashed through the ceiling a little earlier, it might have killed someone.
"I thank God," Ciampi said.
Later, they said, "I was up all night, wondering what it was." No one else in the practice could figure it out, either. Then on Tuesday, the office manager, Rhonda Lawrence, offered a suggestion from their husband Jeffrey, who has a background in geology.

Bids to solve the black hole firewall paradox are producing a free-for-all in theoretical physics – cue time reversal, walls of ice and bouncing stars
(Image: Getty)
TAKE what you know about black holes and throw it out.
Last week famed physicist Stephen Hawking caused an uproar with their assertion that black holes do not exist – at least not as we've defined them for the past 40 years. Rather than letting nothing, not even light, escape their grasp, Hawking says that this “point of no return” is a fallacy, and black holes will sometimes let trapped light back out.
Their idea is a proposed solution to the firewall paradox. The paradox has it that if black holes are as we think, they must be surrounded by rings of fire, though that would violate general relativity.
Hawking's notion does away with a key part of a black hole – its event horizon. It sounds far out, and has been met with heated debate, but even if Hawking is wrong, their high-profile claim highlights the fact that efforts to solve the paradox have turned cosmology on its ear. Firewalls have turned this corner of physics into a cosmic Wild West: a strange frontier where black holes can take on the form of exotic stars, fuzzballs, time machines or iced wormholes (see “The firewall paradox”).
The pillars of theoretical physics – quantum mechanics and general relativity – are in a stand-off. One of them will have to blink if this paradox is to be undone.
Trouble began brewing in the 1970s when Hawking mixed quantum mechanics into relativistic black hole theory and concluded that they should emit a tiny amount of radiation, which steals mass until the black hole evaporates. But that would erase all information regarding the matter that formed the black hole, violating quantum rules.
While theories did emerge showing how information might escape in a quantum-friendly way, the uneasy peace didn't last. In 2012, physicists pointed out that an information leak would create scorching-hot particles at the event horizon, which would rapidly burn up anything falling in. This is anathema to relativity, which says that an observer falling into a black hole shouldn't notice anything happening. So once again, black holes are up for grabs.
“There are various ideas, and none is completely concrete,” says Juan Maldacena at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. “Hopefully trying to resolve them will lead to a new theory that combines all the ideas into a consistent framework.”
Or we could go back to the original paradox, argues Sabine Hossenfelder at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in Stockholm, Sweden. Alternative interpretations of quantum theory erase the firewall, but only if information remains trapped (arxiv.org/abs/1401.0288).
“No matter which way this goes, it's clear that the things in conflict are very fundamental,” says Raphael Bousso at the University of California, Berkeley. “You can't resolve this conflict without a revolution.”
No matter which way this goes, it's clear that the things in conflict are very fundamental
The firewall paradox Black hole theory says they should have moats of fire around them, but this violates general relativity. Trying to solve the problem has created a herd of wild ideas… Bouncing star Instead of evaporating, black holes could end their lives as exotic stars. Carlo Rovelli at the University of Aix-Marseille in France imagined what would happen if a collapsing star bounced back outwards an instant before it would otherwise have become a traditional black hole (arxiv.org/abs/1401.6562). General relativity says that time runs more slowly in the presence of strong gravity, so while the star's bounce might seem instantaneous to an observer on its surface, from outside we see a black hole that lives for billions of years. Eventually the star pops back out, bringing all its information with it. That kills the firewall, but a major flaw is that, to the star, the bounce happens faster than the speed of light. Stringy fuzzball String theory is a popular but as-yet unproven framework for trying to unite the quantum and relativistic realms. It has champions in the firewall debate. If you accept the multiple extra dimensions predicted by string theory, black holes are fuzzballs – tangled balls of strings with no well-defined horizon. In the latest fuzzball description, Samir Mathur at Ohio State University in Columbus says that space-time itself ends just before what looks like the event horizon (arxiv.org/abs/1401.4097). Weirdly, it still looks like a black hole from the outside. “If you don't have a horizon, you don't have radiation, you don't lose information and we are all done,” they say. Time machine The firewall arises because of the high energy needed for information to escape the event horizon, according to quantum rules. Juan Maldacena at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and their colleagues found a way for information to escape more sedately – by letting time inside the black hole flow backwards (Journal of High Energy Physics, doi.org/fbsxm5). This means that particles escaping from the event horizon can gather the information that's flowing back outwards almost instantly and carry it away, no flames needed. But… an observer falling in could notice the time shift when they entered the black hole, violating relativity. Ice wall Leonard Susskind at Stanford University in California and Juan Maldacena had tried to solve the paradox by turning a black hole into a weird type of wormhole that is quantum mechanically linked to its own escaping particles of radiation. This lets information out with no fire. But Raphael Bousso at the University of California, Berkeley, says this solution would raise an equally ugly problem: a wall of “ice” (Physical Review Letters, doi.org/rbm). The quantum link forces particles near the wormhole's horizon into a particular quantum state, “freezing” them and giving away the horizon's location. “It's like having a signpost at the horizon, which is one thing we're not allowed to do,” says Bousso.

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Dozens of global clothing companies are not complying with a plan to ensure better safety in Bangladesh garment factories following the deadly collapse of a building four years ago, a rights group said Monday.
Only 29 out of 72 recently contacted companies are releasing information about how they source their products in Bangladesh, and “many brands have held out completely,” New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a report.
That makes it impossible to hold them accountable for ensuring safe conditions at factories they work with, the group said.
Bangladesh's garment industry has invested more than $1 billion in safety improvements since April 24, 2013, when the Rana Plaza garment factory complex collapsed outside Dhaka, killing more than 1,130 workers and injuring 2,500.
The collapse highlighted grim conditions in the country's garment industry, the second largest in the world with about 4,000 factories employing about 4 million workers and earning $25 billion a year from exports, mainly to the United States and Europe.
Only 17 companies are now meeting the minimum disclosure standard, while some others are starting to move in the right direction, the report said.
“But the industry still has a long way to go,” the group said in a statement. It said the 72 clothing and footwear companies were contacted in the past year by a coalition of labor and human rights organizations that endorsed a Transparency Pledge, which urged the companies to adhere to a minimum standard for publishing supply chain information. They said the minimum standard reflects corporate disclosure practices and aims to foster a level playing field in the industry.
Following the 2013 disaster, global clothing companies joined U.N. agencies and the Bangladesh government in promising to improve safety standards.
Representatives from North American and European brands have visited the country's garment factories to suggest improvements or sever ties with factories that failed to improve.
The government has also hired more than 350 new factory inspectors and passed legislation setting up a workers' welfare fund and allowing stronger union representation.
The companies say the efforts are paying off.
The Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, a group of 29 North American brands, lauded the industry's progress over the last four years. The group has 775 factories in its network.
“Our comprehensive programs have begun to transform an industry once repeatedly touched by tragedy,” it said in a statement Monday.
“Most importantly, our efforts have directly translated into lives saved: Not a single garment worker has perished in an Alliance factory since our remediation work began,” it said.
Low wages in the South Asian country have attracted global apparel brands and retailers.
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian police said on Monday they have “overwhelming” proof the former head of the Olympic Council of Ireland led an illegal ticketing ring at the Rio Games and are preparing to make a formal accusation later in the week.
Former top European member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Patrick Hickey, arrives at a residential building after leaving the Bangu Jails Complex in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, August 30, 2016. REUTERS/Ricardo Moraes
Patrick Hickey will be accused, along with Kevin Mallon, a director of international sports hospitality company THG Sports, with scalping, ambush marketing and criminal association, said Rio de Janeiro police chief Ricardo Barbosa.
Taken together, the crimes are punishable with up to eight years in jail, according to police.
“We have vast amounts of documentary proof and our investigation will wind up on Thursday,” Barbosa said. “The illegal acts were committed by the president of the Irish committee who had complete control over the scheme and the power to make decisions.”
A lawyer for Hickey did not respond to requests for comment. The 71-year-old was released last week from the Bangu 10 maximum security prison, where they had been held since their Aug. 10 arrest at a luxury beachfront hotel during the Games.
In addition to Hickey and Mallon, another seven people are wanted by police for alleged ties to the ticket price-gouging scheme.
Hickey, formerly Europe's top Olympic official, temporarily stepped aside as an IOC executive board member, head of the European Olympic Committee and the Olympic Council of Ireland after their arrest.
Mallon met with police on Monday but declined to answer questions during a 40-minute encounter. Hickey is due to meet with officers on Tuesday but police said they already have enough evidence to go to trial, even without their cooperation.
“They have a constitutional right to remain silent but even if they do the proof is overwhelming,” Barbosa said. “That won't bother us because we have other evidence such as witnesses, materials we have collected through search and seizure, emails, conversations and other things.”
Barbosa said they would send their report on Thursday to state prosecutors, who will then decide on presenting formal charges to a judge.
Police will ask for the two men, both of whom have already had their passports confiscated, to remain in Brazil indefinitely.
The announcement comes just two days before the Paralympic Games open in Rio de Janeiro.
The sale of Paralympic tickets has been disappointing and there are still hundreds of thousands available for most events.
Police said they did not believe the ring was involved Paralympic tickets.
CHICAGO (STMW) — A federal judge on Thursday threw out a civil suit brought by a white Chicago Public Schools teacher who alleged their black principal and CPS violated their civil rights by disciplining them for using the n-word in a “teachable moment” with sixth-grade students.
Lincoln Brown, 48, was suspended without pay for five days in 2011 for using the n-word in front of their majority African-American class at Murray Language Academy after one of their students passed a note to a girl with rap lyrics including the n-word.
Their five-day suspension was later upheld by a CPS hearing officer who ruled that Brown had “engaged in inappropriate discussions with sixth-grade students during instructional time.”
Brown sued their principal, the Board of Education and the city of Chicago, alleging that their First and Fifth Amendment rights were violated for attempting “to teach their class … an important lesson in vocabulary, civility and race relations.”
In Thursday's ruling, U.S. District Judge Manish Shah upheld the board's discipline of Brown, rejecting any notion that the teacher's constitutional rights were violated.
“Public employers can regulate the speech of their employees without regard to First Amendment limits when the speech at issue is uttered in the course of the employee's duties,” Shah wrote in a 15-page opinion. “There is now no dispute that teachers may not use racial, cultural and ethnic epithets in the classroom; this policy was in place before Brown's conduct in this case; and Brown knew it.”
Brown could not be reached for comment Thursday.
Their attorney, William Spielberger, said their client intends to appeal.
“The judge seems to agree that the Chicago Board of Education has banned the use of a number of books, not just ‘Huckleberry Finn,' but also ‘To Kill A Mockingbird,' ‘Lord Jim,' ‘Lord of the Flies,' etc.,” Spielberger said, calling the ruling an injustice considering Brown's background.
Brown's father, Bernard Brown, former dean of Rockefeller Chapel at University of Chicago, was a supporter of the civil rights movement and marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
Brown's parents named them after President Abraham Lincoln; they were in a minority of white students growing up at Kenwood High School, and taught for many years in schools serving black children near Robert Taylor Homes, Spielberger pointed out.
“Lincoln Brown teaches courses on civil rights, and right after this incident, they would normally show a video of their own father marching with MLK in Marquette Park, and the crowd shouting ‘n lover' at him,” Spielberger said. “This ruling appears to say that Lincoln Brown cannot show this video to their students or anyone in the CPS system because of the use of the word. And I think that's a tragedy.”
Brown had argued in their lawsuit that they were attempting to teach their 11-year-old students the perils of racism. In a 2012 Chicago Sun-Times interview, they said they were being punished for denouncing an ugly slur that most sixth-graders have heard many times.
“It's ridiculous to believe that sixth-graders aren't exposed to this language, not only in music but in their everyday lives . . . It's so sad — if we can't discuss these issues, we'll never be able to resolve them,” Brown said at the time.
They said they had been discussing the use of the racial slur in “Huckleberry Finn” in an attempt to show “how upsetting such language can be,” but that just as they used the n-word, the school's principal walked into the classroom. The principal accused Brown of ”using verbally abusive language to or in front of students” and “cruel, immoral, negligent or criminal conduct or communication to a student, that causes psychological or physical harm” in violation of CPS policy.

Egypt has approved the passage of two Iranian warships through the Suez Canal, a source said on Friday, a move that Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman described as "provocative".
"Egypt has agreed to the passage of two Iranian ships through the Suez Canal," the security source told Reuters.
State TV and the official news agency subsequently reported the news, without citing sources. An army source earlier said the Defense Ministry was considering a request by the Iranians to allow the naval ships to cross the strategic waterway.

Iranian officials have said that the request is in line with international regulations.
The United States is monitoring the possible transit of the Iranian ships and does not believe Iran has behaved responsibly in the region, the White House said on Friday.
White House spokesperson Jay Carney, briefing reporters on an Air Force One flight from California to Oregon, said, "We're monitoring that, obviously."
"But we also would say that Iran does not have a great track record of responsible behavior in the region," they said.
It is believed to be the first time since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution that Iranian warships are attempting to pass through the Suez Canal, which links the Red Sea and the Mediterranean.
Iranian officials have said the two vessels, currently in international waters, are headed to Syria for training.
Egypt has been run by an army-led transition government since last week's ouster of President Hosni Mubarak in a popular uprising. Iran's request could pose the first diplomatic dilemma for Egypt's new rulers.

A Suez Canal official said Egypt can only deny transit through the waterway in case of war.
Earlier this week, Lieberman said Iran's attempt to send warships through the canal is a provocation.
"To my regret, the international community is not showing readiness to deal with the recurring Iranian provocations. The international community must understand that Israel cannot forever ignore these provocations," the foreign minister said.
Israel considers Iran an existential threat because of its disputed nuclear program, ballistic missile development, support for militants in the region and its threats to destroy Israel.
Israel has accused Syria and Iran in the past of paying for and smuggling weapons to the Lebanese Shi'ite group, Hezbollah, which fought a war with Israel in 2006.

A former potential first-round draft pick, cornerback Ifo Ekpre-Olomu fell all the way to the seventh round in this year's draft after an ACL tear and dislocated knee ended their college career.
The injuries will keep Ekpre-Olomu off the field in 2015 as well.
According to Mary Kay Cabot of the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Browns head coach Mike Pettine said Ekpre-Olomu will likely miss their entire rookie season as they continue to recover from the injuries suffered last December.
“Players that have had this injury before, it's rare that you would return that season,” Pettine said. “Given our depth, we're very comfortable with them sitting out. That's just one that we felt it was a low-risk, high-reward move when we took them in the seventh round. There's no reason to rush it back given the depth in that room now anyway.”
The Browns took a flier on Ekpre-Olomu with their final selection, No. 241 overall in the seventh round, in hopes that they can return to their former self in time. Ekpre-Olomu posted 244 tackles and nine interceptions in four seasons at Oregon. They were injured in a December practice in preparation for the Rose Bowl against Florida State.

William Fee is dead but an impostor just started a Facebook account for him. Why won't Facebook remove the bogus, and hurtful, account?
Question: My father, William Fee, passed away in 2014. My family asked Facebook to memorialize their account, which it did. This past week someone set up a fake Facebook account pretending to be them and that person is sending friend requests to all of their friends. I have reported the page to Facebook and they state they will contact my dad to get resolution.
I would like Facebook to take down the fake page. Many of their friends and family members have reported the page. I would like someone to contact so I can explain what's going on, instead of having to fill out forms. ― Vanessa Fee, Harbor City, Calif.
Answer: I'm so sorry for your loss. Facebook should have immediately removed the impostor account instead of forcing you to fill out forms and making all of your friends report the fraudulent page. One report ― yours ― should have been sufficient.
You're not the only who has experienced this level of customer service from Facebook. Many of my readers have complained of the forms and lack of interest in helping customers. I've experienced it myself, too. Questions receive boilerplate responses that suggest the company representative hasn't even taken the time to read the query. It's very frustrating.
But when it happens to someone who is grieving the loss of a loved one, it's beyond distressing. It reopens old wounds, inflicting the kind of emotional stress that's hard to capture in words. I could not imagine how upsetting it would be if a deceased relative were resurrected by an impostor. I hope the Facebook managers reading this site never have to experience what you did, either.
We publish the names, numbers and email addresses of Facebook's customer service managers on my consumer advocacy site.
Facebook's form to report an impostor account is overly simplistic, and as you point out, the solution it proposed wasn't much of one. How can you contact a person who is no longer living? I mean, Mark Zuckerberg has connections, but I don't know if they extend to the next life. Incidentally, post-mortem ID theft is a growing problem that goes beyond social media. Watch for anyone using your father's Social Security number or other personal information.
If you want to read another Facebook user's maddening story of dealing with an impostor, then you might want to commiserate by reading this blog. But that will get you no closer to a solution.
This will. Our advocacy team contacted Facebook on your behalf. You also used our executive contact list to email the Facebook executives. The impostor account was deleted. May your father rest in peace.

KS Lawmaker on Son's Viral 'Dab': 'I Thought It Was a Superhero Pose'
A Massachusetts sheriff has offered their county's inmates to help President-elect Donald Trump build a potential border wall with Mexico.
Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson announced their proposal right after they were sworn in for their fourth term as county sheriff.
They joined "Fox & Friends" Friday morning to discuss the reasoning behind this proposal.
"Sheriffs across this country do work programs in their communities to help build infrastructure and support not-for-profit agencies and government agencies," they said. "So this saves taxpayer money, and it gives inmates a chance to get out and learn a skill and get jump started into working and getting reintegrated into the community without committing more crimes."
Hodgson said they have not spoken to Trump directly, but the offer has been sent along to Trump's team. They also did not address who would pay to transport, house and secure Bristol County's inmates as they worked on a potential wall.
The American Civil Liberties Union has stated that having inmates build the wall would be "unconstitutional."
We've asked Sheriff Hodgson for “all records of communication” with Trump team on their idea to help build border wall https://t.co/xyunkbXzNv — ACLU Massachusetts (@ACLU_Mass) January 5, 2017
As for the wall itself, the Trump transition team is now said to be seeking appropriations from Congress up front and then having Mexico pay for the wall later, as was Trump's position during their campaign.
The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017

After the news of the death of more than 70 children at Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh due to non-payment of dues worth Rs 68 lakh broke out last week, the first reaction of the state government was the denial of the fact that the deaths were due to cutting off of oxygen supply.
“No deaths have taken place due to shortage of oxygen supply. They were due to different medical reason,” Gorakhpur District Magistrate Rajeev Rautela had said. The state health minister too blatantly reiterated the same.
Sixty kids had died in five days and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath visited the hospital on the 9th day and blamed the medical college's principal, officials and the oxygen supplier for the deaths. They claimed that their office didn't know about the shortage in oxygen supply until August 4 and assured that “stringent actions” will be taken against those responsible.
However, documents disclosed by the local administration revealed that the Uttar Pradesh government and its ministers were aware of the catastrophe that took the lives of 70+ innocent children.
The Telegraph has seen documents which prove that CM Adityanath's government was very much aware of the dues owed to the gas vendor to the medical college. An inquiry by the Gorakhpur district administration had held principal of BRD medical college hospital Dr Rajiv Mishra, among others, “prima facie guilty of not discharging their duties” and had suspended them before accepting their resignation.
As the government resorted to a blame-game without taking responsibility for its own faux pas, here's the reality as reported by The Telegraph:
On March 22, Mishra wrote to the director general of the medical and health department which functions under union health and family welfare minister Siddarth Nath Singh to clear the vendor dues. An attached copy of a payment reminder to Pushpa Sales Pvt Ltd was attached and shared with the state medical education minister Ashutosh Tandon.
The Hindu also reported that Tandon was kept in the loop.
No response from the government.
On April 3, Mishra forwarded a similar letter to the additional chief secretary of the medical education department, with copies to the director-general of the medical and health and medical education departments. They attached the latest reminder from the vendor, received on the same day.
No response from the government.
They kept writing to the additional chief secretary, with copies to the director-general, attaching the latest reminders on eight different occasions after this and at least five of the reminders included threats from Pushpa Sales of stoppage of oxygen supply.
No response from the government.
On August 1, Mishra again wrote to the additional chief secretary, attaching the latest reminder signed by Pushpa Sales executive Dipankar Sharma, which says the dues have grown to Rs 63.65 lakh and must be paid immediately to ensure “uninterrupted supply” of oxygen. A copy was marked to minister Tandon.
On August 4, Tandon claimed that this was the first time that they found out the delay in payments and the lack of oxygen supply. However, on July 10, in a written response to a question raised by Samajwadi Party MLC C P Chand, Tandon had said that they sought clarifications from the Director General, Medical Education Department, on allegations of “irregularities and misuse” in the hospital. They promised Chand that their queries would be answered soon.
On August 4, Tandon said that an order of Rs 2 crore to be transferred to the Gorakhpur treasury towards the payment of the dues was made by him.
By August 7 the money had arrived in the treasury, according to Tandon. On August 8, Mishra sent a college accountant to the treasury to get a token clearing the payment.
The next day Pushpa sales directly wrote to Tandon, sources in the company revealed to The Telegraph. The Hindu also has a copy of the letter from company director Maneesh Bhandari which said that the six-month dues have risen to Rs 68.65 lakh despite the principal being informed “many times through letters, orally, telephone, email and a legal notice”.
“We personally handed this letter to the minister on August 9 morning. They and (chief minister Yogi) Adityanath went to the medical college the same afternoon to hold a review meeting,” an executive of Pushpa Sales said to The Telegraph.
“We came to know from hospital authorities that they had told the chief minister about the problem and they had looked questioningly at Tandon. After that, Adityanath apparently stayed silent,” they added.
The vendor still remained unpaid and stopped the oxygen supply in the evening after CM Adityanath left the college.
On August 10, 23 babies died and CM Adityanath denied that they had any knowledge of the delay in payment or the oxygen supply. What's interesting to note here is that BRD medical college hospital is located in the parliamentary constituency CM Adityanath has represented since 1998.
Even after the first 23 deaths, the vendor remained unpaid and Mishra had no explanation why.
A sum of Rs 52 lakh was finally transferred to the company's account the next day through Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS), an electronic form of funds transfer. The vendor then resumed supply.
On August 12, union health and family welfare minister Siddarth Nath Singh suspended Mishra, blaming them for the deaths. But even before a probe, the government said that the children did not die due to lack of oxygen supply.
On August 14, Nath reported that the oxygen supply was disrupted because “some people wanted kickbacks”. They did not say who they were. On the same day, Mishra ignored calls from reporters who wanted clarification on reports that they had been away in Rishikesh on August 10.
A health department source told The Telegraph that the medical college's account had a balance of Rs 3.86 crore on August 9 and that the vendor has gone unpaid because they had “failed to oblige some senior members in the government”.
“No such business operates without kickbacks,” the source added. “But the principal had recently received orders from Lucknow to stop the payment.”
Where are we headed?
Three weeks after celebrating the birth of their newborn child, Shailendra Gupta and their wife Laxmi were mourning for their death.
The baby was having breathing trouble so the couple rushed them to BRD medical college on the intervening night of August 9-10. But instead of putting their child on oxygen supply, they were handed a small pump by the hospital staff to manually pump oxygen. For three and a half hours, Shailendra pumped oxygen for their baby. Later, their baby was taken to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and the next day, they died.
Shailendra's son was one among the 23 children who died on August 10.
There were people who had come from hundreds of kilometres away to admit their wards in the government hospital. Little did they know that the ones responsible to safeguard the lives of our country's future generations were busy burying their heads in corruption and incompetence.
There were parents who suspected that the deaths of their children were not immediately informed to them.
Month-old children have died in one of the worst tragedies in India while government officials still sit cosily on their posts.
The Logical Indian take
The report by Gorakhpur district administration blamed Pushpa Sales, a private company, for cutting the oxygen supply. It then blamed BRD medical college principal R K Mishra for being absent on August 10 when 23 babies died. The report further blamed Satish Kumar, the head of the anaesthesia department and Gajanan Jaiswal, the chief pharmacist for not ensuring continuous oxygen flow.
CM Adityanath accused the hospital and the vendor completely for the death of more than 70 children and claimed that they were not aware of the mismanagement.
Firstly, their statement was completely false because they did know about the shortage in oxygen supply and the dues. They were present when Pushpa Sales sent a reminder letter of the dues.
And secondly, not knowing paints an equally bad picture of him.  They are the Chief Minister of the state – a person who should at all costs be aware that the lives of more than 70 children are endangered because of a flaw in their administration. Theirs saying that they aren't “aware” is no justification for their incompetence.
All the stakeholders collectively share blame for the deaths, with the highest onus lying with the government. Even then, no one from the government has been suspended or sacked from their posts for failing to oblige with their duties. Moreover, the UP government extended its support to its medical health minister Ashutosh Tandon, meanwhile, the doctor who did everything in their capacity to save the children's lives was branded as a rapist on social media and removed from their post on August 13.
The truth remains that CM Adityanath and their ministers knew about the crisis at BRD medical college, did nothing about it and later avoided responsibility.
When evidence is out in the open about the UP government's role in the death of more than 70 children, only one solution remains at hand – the ministers responsible should be relieved of their duties. In a sane democracy, the government would have fallen, but here we are in the middle of corruption and petty politics.
Welcome to the first issue of The Irish Anarchist Review, the new political magazine from the Workers Solidarity Movement. This magazine will explore ideas and practical struggles that can teach us about building a revolutionary movement today. We decided to cease printing Red & Black Revolution, and start this project, aimed at provoking debate and discussion among anarchists and the left. For this purpose, we will be pursuing a non-sectarian approach, taking ideas from various left currents, mainstream discourse, and reflections on experiences of life and struggle. We will take, print, and discuss, anything that we find useful for our needs. We hope that readers will have a similar attitude, and will use the magazine to discuss, debate and develop ideas. We will also welcome submissions and responses to articles.
This issue is shaped by the current financial crisis, and more particularly, by the reactions of the Irish political and capitalist classes, as they pursue an aggressive strategy of cutbacks. We have seen the implosion of the building sector, the foundering of the banks upon corruption and incompetence and the failure of our foreign investment based economic model. Moreover, we have seen that the government response has been to protect the banks and builders by transferring wealth from social services, public pay and increased taxation straight into bank bailouts and NAMAland. This needs to be identified for what it is: an act of outright class warfare.
We are faced with a situation where a strong and organised response to government attacks is absolutely necessary, but is constrained by the prevailing ideology and practice of partnership. The most pressing concern for Irish radicals today is to build a labour movement that rejects the corporatist mentality and service-delivery model of ICTU and poses instead workers self-organisation as the basis for struggle. With this in mind, this and future issues will look for inspiration in revitalising class-based politics.
The weakening of Irish organised labour through the ‘Celtic Tiger' period is examined by James R's article, and they pose some requirements for the emergence of a class movement that can deal with the threats of the present while bearing a vision of a better future. Andrew Flood looks at some of the positive elements of recent struggles, emphasising the possibilities for self-organisation and direct action made visible in the recent struggles.
We feature two articles that try to learn from the experiences of radicals internationally. Ronan McAoidh reviews the work of Swedish group, Kämpa Tillsammans!, which argues that affinity between workers, not just union organisation, is the basis of successful struggles. An interview with Alex Foti explores organising tactics that try to deal with the growing trend of flexible working conditions.
The reviews also tie into this theme, assessing the development of an American working-class counter-culture and, by looking at workplace blogging, discussing some ways in which this can be done today.
Overall, this issue attempts to learn from the current weakness of the Irish working class, and explores both the origins of this weakness and some routes towards a combative class movement, capable of disrupting the ruling class offensive on living and working conditions and posing an altogether different vision of society, and, most importantly, a way of getting there.

Reflections on the 24th November
On the 24th of November something extraordinary happened. Some 250,000 workers acted together in a day-long strike against the public sector wage cuts planned by the government. The vast majority of these workers had never gone on strike before, yet across almost all workplaces the strike involved 90% or more of those working.
Capitalist crisis and union resistance in Ireland
Late 2008 saw the Irish capitalist class wage a major ideological struggle against the Irish working class. They called for workers to bear the brunt of the capitalist crisis. Print media, TV and radio carried segment after segment where well-paid commentators argued that workers, in particular public sector workers, were earning too much, had overly generous pensions and that the public had unrealistic expectations of public services.
The usefulness of Faceless Resistance
Although Faceless Resistance as a concept has been discussed among radical circles in Sweden for several years, it has only recently begun to be noticed in the English speaking world, primarily due to delays in texts being translated. In this article I will look primarily at the work of Kämpa Tillsammans, who developed the core ideas of Faceless Resistance, but I will also situate these ideas in their historical and social context and introduce other tendencies that have been influenced by and adapted some of the theory.
Mayday had become like a funeral - interview with Alex Foti
In the middle years of this decade, Alex Foti became known across activist circles for involvement in the Euromayday Parades. In a special themed issue of Green Pepper, Foti and the Chain Workers Collective sketched a very attractive understanding of the work discipline of contemporary capitalism. In their understanding, society had found itself in a situation of profound disjuncture with our working pasts - life today was defined by contingent employment rather than the traditional job for life.
The unions after the celtic tiger
A rather strange figure is moving to centre stage in Irish politics, that of the trade unions - absent from mass struggles until recently and weakened over the decades of social partnership, they are now the only possible source of a movement that can confront attemps to transfer the cost of the recession to working people. This statement does not come with out some qualms.
Checkout: Life On The Tills
“Anna Sam”, as you might guess, is a pseud- onym, the handle of a French blogger who decided to put their years behind the till to good use on a website describing the day-to- day experience of supermarket workers in all its tedious glory. In a way it's refreshing to discover that the psychology of the checkout girl / boy appears to be the same wherever you go - my own days at Centra and the like are well imprinted on the brain, but they could have been an atypical reflection of my general misanthropy, grumpiness and ill will towards the rest of the species.
Review: The IWW and The Making of a Revolutionary Working Class Counter culture
The book can be read in a number of ways; on one hand it rescues the IWW from Stalinist critics that fashionably flounced after Russian Bolshevism; it gives insight to the politics and personalities of the union itself and rescues Hill the man. But as suggested by the subtitle, it's Rosemont's treatment of how the IWW built a counter hegemonic working class culture that is the most interesting facet of this brick thick work.

Shifu and the possibilities for Chinese Anarchism
In July 1914, the Shanghai Association of Anarchist Communist Comrades published its statement of principles, concluding with the resolution that, "the implementation of anarchist communism depends on the strength of our party. If we wish to increase our party's strength, uniting as a whole body and advancing together is our most important task today. Wherever they are, all our comrades should unite with those who share the same purposes and establish groups in free association.” The key member of this group was a Chinese anarchist known as Shifu who was to die a mere nine months later. Although the group carried on after their death, the core concept of this paragraph was never to be implemented.

Article-level innovations continue to unite and disrupt the scholarly publishing scene, writes Stephanie Dawson
For many years, the scholarly journal or book series was the most important context for an article. The journal provided the framework in which an article was understood and valued – an exclusive venue, an expert editor, or an important society lent gravitas to a researcher's work. To flip through the pages of the newest issue in the library was to put an article in the context of other ideas and authors in a topical selection. This context environment was rated and ranked with a journal 'impact factor' and readers used this to orient themselves in their communities. And of course the journal context continues to play a role for researchers.
But the internet has disrupted this framework of understanding with powerful new tools for search, discovery and evaluation on the level of the article and the individual. Speed and efficiency, combined with the explosive growth in journal and article numbers, have completely changed how researchers find information.
They no longer first encounter an article within the context of a journal, bound between glossy covers. They search for key words on global search platforms such as Google, Baidu, or PubMed. They find an article within the context of this search and use clues from the metadata such as title and abstract to assess whether it is relevant to them. High profile journal brands may continue to be indicators of quality, but researchers also rely on affiliations, funding body, number of citations or Altmetric score to evaluate an article.
Context has become multi-dimensional, publisher-independent and intrinsic to the article.
Publishers have responded in innovative ways to this new reality. At the recent annual conference of the Society for Scholarly Publishers there were numerous sessions on the importance of persistent identifiers to make content more discoverable and provide new kinds of context for readers. ORCID has been a central, independent player providing persistent identifiers for authors make sure that their publications are correctly attributed. It is a helpful context for the reader in evaluating an article to know whether the author has written one or 300 articles on a certain subject.
Many publishers have begun requiring an ORCID ID at submission and then automatically updating the author's ORCID profile after publication. It has therefore become easier than ever to browse an interesting author's works – without ORCID, this remains a challenge for authors named Wang or Smith. Persistent identifiers are a structural way for publishers to connect and interconnect their articles within the greater fabric of the scientific literature.
A similar movement is taking place on the level of funding bodies. CrossRef has introduced the Open Funder Registry to standardise a funder taxonomy and add funder information to the article metadata. The European OpenAIRE project is further helping researchers to link their research results with funding post-publication via institutional repositories. These efforts would allow a reader to filter searches by funder as a quality criterion. This is relatively new and is quite a bit of extra effort for publishers and authors, so some ask what is in it for them. The answer is more context at the article level, which translates to more discoverability and quality assurance in a global flood of nearly two million publications per year.
The same thing is happening on an institutional level. Companies such as Ringgold and GRID are standardising and normalising institutional names so that they can be added to article metadata and provide reliable, searchable information about author affiliations. Unfortunately, the industry is not yet at the point of collaborating on standards in this area, but this is certainly needed. Again, affiliations are an important part of the context of an article that can be a signal for readers of a certain quality niveau.
I could further mention portals such as DataCite and Figshare that give DOIs for data or publishers such as EMBO, F1000 Research and others which include peer review reports as part of the article. Behind all of these efforts is the assumption that the article must both function autonomously and interconnect via persistent identifiers with the whole body of scientific literature. It requires a high level of cooperation and meticulous attention to detail from publishers that that should be commended.
It is worth looking back to the first publisher collaboration of this kind – CrossRef. Started in 2000 with 12 founding members, it now includes essentially every serious academic publisher world-wide. CrossRef registers a DOI for each article. Publishers/typesetters can look up and link DOIs for articles in the literature list to provide the reader of the final product a superior experience as they can click directly through to a cited article of interest. References are at the beginning and core of the context that each article carries within its XML. They are article-based and publisher independent. And thanks to the internet and the publisher collaboration via CrossRef they are digital, standardised and linked.
So where will context at the article level take us in the future? For one example, at ScienceOpen we are building a platform to expose the multi-dimensional context of an article to support discoverability.
We started with references as the first carrier of context. We analysed the references of around million articles and created an article record for each reference then merged multiple instances to develop a network of citations. The result is that a researcher can now search in 14 million articles and article records and sort by citation number, but also easily explore the context around each individual article. The use of DOIs has also made it possible to track article usage in many places on the internet beyond citations, which Altmetric and other companies have built up to a growing standard. On ScienceOpen 14 million articles can be sorted and explored by altmetrics, as well as a variety of other parameters. And context can also be user generated post-publication with commenting, recommendations and peer-review functions.
I predict that article-level innovations will continue to unite and disrupt the publishing landscape. The introduction of an increasing number of standardised identifiers and XML metadata requirements makes the work of professional academic publishers ever more complex. But it also makes clear what their value proposition for authors must be – better tagging at the article level means richer context and increased discoverability for authors. CrossRef and other successful collaboration projects have shown that unity around persistent identifiers benefits all players, even as they open the doors to the internet's disruptive power.

Urick is ok with obstructing both truth and justice. They lied to Asia, and they lied under oath during the post conviction appeal hearing.
I learned that a couple of months ago, when Asia McClain, having heard “Serial”, stepped up and contacted Adnan's lawyer, Justin Brown. Yes I've known about this, as have other key folks, but of course it was kept under wraps until Justin took it to court. And for the record, it was Asia who came forward, none of us ever contacted them I have not seen or spoken or reached out to them in 15 years. It was the sheer power of Sarah's work and the podcast that made them realize what happened, and I am again and again thankful to Sarah for that.
Asia never told Urick that they wrote their letters or the affidavit they gave to me under duress, they lied about it. They called them after our private investigator reached out to them a couple of years ago – they were confused and wanted to know what was going on in the case. Urick assured them that Adnan had been convicted with overwhelming evidence (which they actually repeated in the Intercept interview – maybe they do not understand what the word ‘overwhelming' actually means), and literally told them NOT TO TESTIFY at the hearing.
I remember feeling hit in the gut during the post-conviction hearing when Urick testified that Asia was pressured into writing their letters and the affidavit they gave me. I knew it wasn't true, and I couldn't believe my ears. But Asia also had refused to testify, so I thought, perhaps they did tell Urick that in order to completely prevent us from ever being able to use her, even in a future trial. It didn't feel good to to have the internet buzz with the idea that I or Adnan's parents put them under duress, and I tried to explain numerous times that had not happened..but you know, sometimes people have a hard time believing people who uh have a track record of not actually ever lying. Anyhow, vindication is sweet. So is having Asia back, God bless them
So, to recap, Urick stopped Asia from testifying, then they lied to the court about what they said. It should be clear to you now that the actual truth is not really important to Urick, only winning a conviction is. The only reason Urick would stop Asia from testifying, and do everything in their power to make sure even their documents are not considered worthy in court, is because it would help prove Adnan did not kill Hae. Basically, they don't care if Adnan did or didn't kill Hae. They just cares about their conviction. How does someone sleep at night knowing that they squashed potentially exculpatory evidence against an innocent man? I don't know, but I hope they lose sleep for years to come in the light of today's public, and well deserved, humiliation.
Of course, I never liked Urick even before all this. Not even all the way back in 2000, when I first saw them in action. And it wasn't only about the fact that they were trying to convict Adnan, someone I cared about like a brother, for murder. It was largely about how they were trying to do it.
I knew, sitting in that trial, that Urick was no knight in shining armor. No defender of the truth and the Constitution, as their Intercept interview would have us laughably believe:
“At some point in the trial, Jay made a comment that I had gotten in touch with Anne Benaroya. Like I said, Cristina was very quick on their feet. They heard that. They immediately formulated this argument that I had procured an attorney for Jay, and they ran with it.
I give them credit. It's something you don't hear. It was new; it was innovative. I found the whole experience surreal. At the trial level, generally what happens is when defense attorneys want to put the state on trial, they try to make a case that you violated someone's constitutional rights. And you therefore have engaged in misconduct. Here, someone is making a case where I acted to honor constitutional rights and tried to make that seem like misconduct.” (pretty sure I gagged when I read that)
Let me make a list of the reasons Urick is a slap in the face to the justice system. Lists are so handy.
Framed the crime as an Islamically motivated honor killing 15 years ago, today calls it a run of the mill domestic violence case (which by the way, it also was NOT because if you believe Adnan killed Hae, it's considered dating violence, not domestic violence). The South Asian Bar Association, which includes South Asian attorneys from Canada to the US, was so appalled at the ethnic and religious bias in the case, they reached out to me months ago. With trial transcripts in hand, they determined the words “Muslim”, “Islam”, or “Pakistani” were mentioned around 270 times in the second trial. Many of those mentions were by Gutierrez, who was apparently trying hard, but very badly, to respond to the prosecution on this issue. But it was the prosecution who crafted and planted that idea in the jury's head, that Adnan's religion and culture had something to do with Hae's death. Apparently, Urick was so concerned about Jay's constitutional rights, they got them a lawyer (unheard of), but didn't care too much about Adnan's constitutional rights, so used their religion against him.
 They are kind of an evil mastermind – not only did they deliberately try to prejudice the jury against Adnan for being Muslim, they actually pitted three ethnic communities against each other and literally played them like fiddles. They knew exactly what strings to pull to get a majority black jury to look at a young, black male witness and not see their lies, but their vulnerabilities. They knew that on the racial-discrimination-totem-pole, Muslims come in last. Hae came from an immigrant background, but it was one in which their family came here for a good life. Adnan's immigrant background meant they were predisposed to hurting women. Standing at the center, Urick was the white ringmaster who filled the courtroom with ethnic and religious biases and then masterfully orchestrated them.
They not only used the testimony of a proven liar to put away a kid for life, they accommodated it. They assisted it. Even today, as Jay recants everything they said under oath, Urick stands by the bullshit assertion that Jay's testimony at trial was corroborated by the cell phone records. Apparently Urick did not read Jay's Intercept interview. Or they did, and it DOESN'T MATTER because when Jay's story changes over and over, to Urick it means he's actually telling the truth. The “spine” of the story is what Urick called it. I really want to know at this point why they think a fucking “spine” is enough. Would it have held up in court for Jay to testify “Adnan killed Hae, told me they killed her, popped a trunk somewhere in the area, and I helped bury her, now don't go asking for details”? No, it wouldn't. Because no one cares about a fucking spine. Courts, juries, NORMAL GODDAM PEOPLE care about details. You do not convict a person without details. You do not convict a person based on a bare bones “spine”. Urick knew that, but they didn't care. And they still don't. Why should he? They got away with it.
Urick will not little things like the truth get in the way of securing a conviction. They deliberately stopped Nisha from testifying that the only time they spoke to Jay was most definitely not on the 13th, they leaned on Don to get them to make Adnan seem shady, they did everything in their power to get Jay to testify the way they needed them to, and now we know they lied to Asia, and they committed perjury before the post-conviction court. I have to stress that this is not just a case of a prosecutor playing fast and dirty, which may be common. This is a case of a prosecutor taking an oath and lying to the very court of which they are an officer.
In today's filing, which is an amendment to the existing petition, Justin is essentially asking the court for one thing – give a chance for Asia's testimony to be heard in a court of law. Until now, it was first prevented by Gutierrez who failed to contact her, and then by Urick who stopped them from coming to court. The entire integrity of the post-conviction hearing was undermined by Urick's perjury, even impacting the second issue, the plea deal, which I discuss in this piece.
Here is deal now: Jay admits committing perjury during the trial. What Urick did amounts to witness tampering, obstruction of justice, and perjury during the post-conviction process. Gutierrez lied about both contacting Asia and contacting the state for a plea deal.
So many people did so many shady, horrible things. But the only one that paid the price was Adnan. Adnan deserves another appeal, and another trial. Urick deserves to be sanctioned.
Here is the supplement to Adnan's petition that was filed in court today based on Asia's new statement.
Here is Urick's testimony at the post-conviction hearing.
(Reuters) - Authorities are investigating the deaths of 13 bald eagles discovered on a Maryland farm in the state's largest die-off of the national bird in 30 years, officials said on Monday.
Maryland Natural Resources police received a call on Saturday from a man reporting four dead eagles near Federalsburg in the eastern part of the state, said spokesperson Candy Thomson. Officers arrived and discovered nine more dead birds nearby.
Catherine Hibbard, a spokesperson for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which is investigating the deaths, said the cause of death was unknown pending a medical examination.
The maximum fine for harming a bald eagle is $100,000 and up to one year in prison, they said.
The bald eagle, which almost disappeared from the United States decades ago, was removed from the federal endangered species list in August 2007 after the banning of the pesticide DDT and habitat protection led to its recovery, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
The bald eagle is a symbol of the federal government and is featured in the presidential seal and on U.S. currency. The bird is federally protected.
Thomson said the 13 birds represented Maryland's largest bald eagle die-off in 30 years.
Sinn Féin is calling for an independent panel to investigate Northern Ireland's botched Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme.
The party set out the details on Friday of what it believes an independent investigation into the controversy should look like - just as First Minister Arlene Foster issued another defiant riposte to them critics.
Ms Foster, who has repeatedly rejected calls for their resignation, posted an image on Facebook on Friday of a guinea pig wearing a pair of pink love-heart shaped glasses below the phrase: “Can't see all the haters when I've got my love glasses on.”
The post attracted criticism from their political opponents, with Alliance leader Naomi Long saying: “They're not haters, they're taxpayers. And angry ones at that.
“We're in the teeth of a political and financial crisis, much of it of them making, and the First Minister opts for this by way of a response to them critics?
“Let's hope love glasses also work for people lying on trolleys, waiting on cancer drugs, suffering benefit cuts, struggling to pay their heating and food bills, eh? Because it's all just a £500 millioni joke, right?”
Ms Long continued: “I was excoriated for suggesting the DUP were even more arrogant and beligerent under Arlene Foster than Peter Robinson. I think even they would have balked at donning ‘love glasses'.”
Earlier, Northern Ireland's Justice Minister accused the First Minster and Deputy First Minister of letting them down over the “cash for ash” controversy but they said they did not believe Arlene Foster should step aside from their role.
Claire Sugden, the independent unionist MLA, who forms the Stormont Executive with the DUP and Sinn Féin, says they have “reverted to party politics” over the RHI scheme but denied they see them as a “soft touch”.
Sinn Féin's draft terms of reference were given to the DUP and civil servants on Wednesday after it rejected proposals by the head of the civil service.
Sinn Féin believes its proposals will “get to the truth in an independent and transparent way” and that Ms Foster must step aside from their role during the preliminary investigation into the scandal which is expected to cost to the Northern taxpayer around £490 million.
A Sinn Féin source told The Irish Times the party does not believe The Inquiry Act of 2005 is the way to proceed at this time as it could allow for a minister to interfere with the independence of an investigation, and gave as an example of its limitations the family of murdered solicitor Pat Finucane rejecting this type of probe into their death.
The Sinn Féin source says the RHI investigation had to be “independent, time bound and cost effective”.
The party is proposing that a minister establishes an investigation but it is then handed over to the attorney general to appoint a judicial figure to chair, who would then set the terms of reference and appoint an expert panel.
This would not preclude having sessions in public.
Sinn Féin says compellability of witnesses and documents has been central to its demands and that a new piece of legislation could be progressed through accelerated passage in a matter of weeks.
Final report
Sinn Féin suggests a preliminary RHI report could be produced within four weeks and a final report within three months.
Earlier, Northern Ireland's Justice Minister accused the First Minster and Deputy First Minister of letting them down over the “cash for ash” controversy but they said they did not believe Arlene Foster should step aside from their role.
Claire Sugden, the independent unionist MLA, who forms the Stormont Executive with the DUP and Sinn Féin, says they have “reverted to party politics” over the RHI scheme but denied they see them as a “soft touch”.
Earlier Ms Sugden broke their silence on the ongoing crisis with a Radio Ulster interview.
“Martin and Arlene have both let me down,” they said of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister respectively.
The East Derry MLA said their position on the overgenerous green energy scheme had not changed since before Christmas and that they had been busy doing their job.
They described RHI as “a cross-cutting issue” rather than a justice issue and claimed they do not have the power to unilaterally set up a public inquiry into the matter and that it would need the Stormont Executive's backing.
“People saying I have unilateral power on initiating a public inquiry are misinformed,” they said.
Ms Sugden was critical of Ms Foster and Mr McGuinness but says they will not resign and does not support calls for a fresh Assembly election.
Public inquiry
On whether they could support a Sinn Féin motion calling for Ms Foster to stand aside from their role as First Minister, they said they could support an independent investigation into RHI but was concerned a public inquiry could be lengthy and expensive.
However they said it would be unfair to Ms Foster to force them to stand aside and that they were in “two minds” over whether they could support Sinn Féin on this element of its demands as they were “unsure what it would achieve”.
“Essentially that is punishment without proper, fair investigation,” they said.
“Until we can do that (an investigation) I don't think that is fair.”
Foyle's People Before Profit MLA Eamonn McCann believes Ms Foster should resign as First Minister and that Ms Sugden should consider their position rather than act as a “linchpin” for the Stormont Executive “if it is not delivering truth and justice to the people”.
Stormont is currently in recess and is expected to reconvene on January 16th.
The devices, which prevent a car from starting without a sober breath sample, are currently required only for drivers who offend at least three times and optional for others under a complex set of rules as an alternative to losing their driver's license.
A new law, backed by Mothers Against Drunk Driving and three legislators - Rep. Kim Norton, DFL-Rochester, Rep. Tim Kelly, R-Red Wing, and Sen. Chris Eaton, DFL-Brooklyn Center - would require interlock for all offenders.
Art Morrow, executive director for MADD in Minnesota, said in a news conference at the Capitol on Thursday that the state would join 25 others who have already seen promising results from doing so.
The group said those states have seen a 15 percent reduction in alcohol-related traffic deaths. Interlock devices have already stopped 1.77 million attempts to drive drunk in Minnesota to date, according to a MADD report.
The same report painted the current penalty for many first- and second-time offenders, the loss of a license, as ineffective, with 50 to 75 percent of people simply continuing to drive without one.
Interlock means “people who have poor judgment won't even have the opportunity to drive impaired,” Morrow said.
First-time offenders would need to keep the devices installed for at least a year and wouldn't be able to remove them before going at least 180 days without setting off the device with an impaired result. Repeat offenders would need to keep the devices longer.
Norton said lawmakers originally made the penalties even longer but backed off after MADD and other groups said drivers wouldn't comply if they were too long.
“We're trying to hit that sweet spot so that people will actually do it” rather than skirt the law by finding another car, they said at Thursday's news conference.
They said the devices help modify behavior. An offender might get behind the wheel, think they or they are OK to drive and learn otherwise when the interlock goes off.
“It's a lesson,” Norton said.
Gina Calistro, MADD Minnesota's public policy committee chair, also spoke, describing how their father was fatally injured in a collision with a drunken driver in 2009.
The driver “was a repeat offender who should've installed an ignition interlock device” but instead opted out, they said.
Offenders pay for their own devices. The new law would seek to divert some current drunken driving fines toward that end.
Fatal alcohol-related crashes in the state were up 15 percent last year from 111 in 2014, MADD said. and are currently outstripping last year's pace.
The proposed legislation passed the House Transportation Committee Wednesday by a unanimous voice vote and now moves to the Public Safety Committee.

MANILA, Philippines—A new “crush video” is making the rounds on social media showing three girls in shorts stomping on a wailing puppy until it died.
The barefoot women, whose faces were shown on the video, are allegedly Filipinas.

It caught the attention of the Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), which has launched a search for the women and other people involved in the production of the video.
“If someone can actually give us the names and addresses of the people in the video, we can file the case immediately,” the animal welfare group said, adding it has forwarded the video to the Bureau of Animal Industry-Animal Welfare Division.
“Crush videos” are sexual fetish films in which small animals are maimed or killed through extreme brutality. Cruelty to animals is punishable under Republic Act 8485 or the Animal Welfare Act of 1998.
“Crush videos” first surfaced in the Philippines in 2011 as scantily clad girls crushing to death small animals were sold as fetish films online.
A couple in Bacnotan, La Union was caught that year for hiring girls aged 12 to 18, who tortured and killed animals in crush films sold for P100 to P1,000 per video.

To the dismay of several alumni, Dartmouth College has determined that Black Lives Matter protesters who occupied the school library last year did not commit any conduct violations.
During the November 12 protest, approximately 150 students identifying with the BLM movement descended upon Baker-Berry Library, holding signs and shouting obscenities. As they spread throughout the building, the protesters even accosted students who attempted to continue studying, demanding that they leave their private study rooms and assemble to witness the protest.
Throughout the ordeal, the protesters continued their chanting, hurling epithets such as “F*** you, you filthy white f***s!,” “F*** you and your comfort!,” and “F*** you, you racist s***!”
In a letter to alumni that 1979 Dartmouth graduate Joseph Asch posted on Dartblog Monday, Assistant Director of Alumni Relations Meg Ramsden declares that after investigating 13 separate complaints regarding the takeover, Dartmouth has concluded that none of the student protesters committed any “specific violations of the Standards of Conduct,” though the college does concede that their behavior violated the (unenforceable) Moving Dartmouth Forward Citizenship Pledge.
“In essence, no rules for which there are recorded and communicated sanctions were broken,” they assert, pointing out that “none of the complaints filed claimed physical contact,” and that Dartmouth's Citizenship Pledge is “merely aspirational” and imposes no sanctions on those who fail to uphold it.
“Abusive language aimed at any of our community members—by any group, at any time, in any place—is not acceptable. In an academic institution, however, freedom of speech is mission critical,” Ramsden explains. “In these cases when it is a struggle to find the balance between that freedom and respectful behavior, it's imperative that the Dartmouth community affirms its core principles of respect for every member of the community and everyone's right to freedom of expression, and then reflect[s] on the mistakes made against the backdrop of a commitment to civil discourse.”
Asch and other alumni, though, take issue with the school's argument, arguing that the protesters' actions clearly violated at least one policy, and possibly even a state law.
Standard VIII of the conduct code specifically addresses disruption of the college's academic mission by students or student groups, defining such violations to include “conduct (including by way of example, obstruction, noise, or the display of banners or objects) that prevents or disrupts the effective carrying out of a College function or approved activity, such as classes, lectures, meetings, interviews, ceremonies, and public events.”
Moreover, the Dartblog post also suggests that the BLM protest might have constituted criminal disorderly conduct under New Hampshire law, which prohibits “disrupting any lawful assembly or meeting of persons without lawful authority.”
Other alumni also shared their own reactions to the questionable logic behind Dartmouth's refusal to punish the protesters for conduct code violations.
“The pretzel logic of the no punishment explanation is offensive to anyone who managed to obtain a degree from this institution,” opined an alum in a comment Asch posted to Dartblog. “On the other hand it squares nicely with [Dartmouth President Phil Hanlon]'s use of the words ‘diversity' and ‘inclusive' and their various iterations 22 times in their one page letter to the community.”
“And so I guess it's OK if the incident in question occurs again … and again … and again,” added another alum. “As I see it, the College's leaders are straining really, really hard to find a way not to do what is right, proper and courageous in this case … and it is only a matter of time before this ‘do nothing' approach bites them in the butt.”
Foreshadowing that institutional response, Vice Provost for Student Affairs Inge-Lise Ameer expressed unmitigated support for the protesters at a forum held several days after the library takeover, even endeavoring to blame conservatives for the hostile demonstration.
[RELATED: Dartmouth protesters deny physical harassment, gain provost's endorsement]
“The protest was a wonderful, beautiful thing,” they declared, then appeared to contradict themselves by offering the justification that “there's a whole conservative world out there that's not very nice.”
The chants of “F*** your white privilege,” they assured listeners, “were not personal or racist attacks on individual white persons in the library,” despite the testimony of multiple individuals that they were isolated, harassed, and even touched by the protesters.
Ameer eventually apologized for insinuating that conservatives are not nice people, but did not retract any of their other comments.

The New York Times's front page story this week on the New York Police Department and its allegedly racist stop-and-frisk practices follows a well-worn template: give specific racial breakdowns for every aspect of police behavior, but refer to racial crime rates only in the most attenuated of terms. Disclosing crime rates—the proper benchmark against which police behavior must be measured—would demolish a cornerstone of the Times's worldview: that the New York Police Department, like police departments across America, oppresses the city's black population with unjustified racial tactics.
This week's story, written by Al Baker, began with what the Times think is a shocking disparity: “Blacks and Latinos were nine times as likely as whites to be stopped by the police in New York City in 2009, but, once stopped, were no more likely to be arrested.” (The fact that blacks, Hispanics, and whites are arrested at the same rate after a stop undercuts, rather than supports, the thesis of racially biased policing, but more on that later.)
The Times's story includes a graphic breakdown of police stops by race: blacks made up 55 percent of all stops in 2009, though they're only 23 percent of the city's population; whites accounted for 10 percent of all stops, though they're 35 percent of the city's population; Hispanics made up 32 percent of all stops, though 28 percent of the population, and Asians, 3 percent of all stops and 12 percent of the population. The article details a host of other police actions by specific racial numbers, including arrests, frisks, and use of force.
But when the Times get around to mentioning crime rates, more than halfway into the piece, it does so only because the NYPD raises them in its defense, not because the Times deems them independently worthy of note in a story on police stops. And it mentions them only as a form of reported speech, in the most generalized of terms: “Mr. Browne, the department spokesperson, . . . said the stops mirrored crime—that while a large percentage of the stops involved blacks, an even larger percentage of violent crimes involved suspects described as black by their victims.” This formula, which carefully brackets a non-specific statement about crime rates as what the police department says, as opposed to simply what the facts are, is by now standard Times practice:
February 11, 2010: “Police officials have said that while a large percentage of the street stops involve blacks, an even larger percentage of crimes involve suspects described as black by their victims.” May 13, 2009: “On Tuesday, Mr. Browne said that the stops ‘comport by race proportionally with descriptions provided by crime victims.'” February 11, 2009: “The police have said that while a large percentage of the stops involve black people, an even larger percentage of crimes involve suspects described as black by their victims.” May 6, 2008: “The police have said that while a large percentage of the street stops involve black people, an even larger percentage of crimes involve suspects described as black by their victims.”
Only in 2007 did the Times disclose some actual black crime rates in discussing stop-and-frisk activity—though as usual, only as an aspect of the NYPD's defense of itself, and only by attributing those crime rates to what the police “say,” as if they were a matter of opinion, unlike the stop-and-frisk rates, which the paper reports as a fact so indisputable that it does not need a source. That 2007 slip has never been allowed to reappear, however; the disclosure of crime rates has been purged from all subsequent Times stories on the NYPD's stop activities. The actual numbers convey the shocking magnitude of the city's crime disparities with a vividness that a mere generalized statement about a “larger percentage of crimes than stops” cannot, which is why the numbers are almost always left out. The actual crime rates reveal that blacks are being significantly understopped, compared with their representation in the city's criminal population, another reason for omitting them from the paper's reporting.
Here are the crime data that the Times doesn't want its readers to know: blacks committed 66 percent of all violent crimes in the first half of 2009 (though they were only 55 percent of all stops and only 23 percent of the city's population). Blacks committed 80 percent of all shootings in the first half of 2009. Together, blacks and Hispanics committed 98 percent of all shootings. Blacks committed nearly 70 percent of all robberies. Whites, by contrast, committed 5 percent of all violent crimes in the first half of 2009, though they are 35 percent of the city's population (and were 10 percent of all stops). They committed 1.8 percent of all shootings and less than 5 percent of all robberies. The face of violent crime in New York, in other words, like in every other large American city, is almost exclusively black and brown. Any given violent crime is 13 times more likely to be committed by a black than by a white perpetrator—a fact that would have been useful to include in the Times's lead, which stated that “Blacks and Latinos were nine times as likely as whites to be stopped.” These crime data are not some artifact that the police devise out of their skewed racial mindset. They are what the victims of those crimes—the vast majority of whom are minority themselves—report to the police.
You cannot properly analyze police behavior without analyzing crime. Crime is what drives NYPD tactics; it is the basis of everything the department does. And crime, as reported by victims and witnesses, sends police overwhelmingly to minority neighborhoods, because that's where the vast majority of crime occurs—by minority criminals against minority victims.
The Times's analysis, by contrast, which follows in lock step with the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights, assumes that policing should mirror census data. The only numerical benchmark that the Times provides for the NYPD's stop data is the city's population ratios. According to this analysis, since whites are 35 percent of the city's population, they should be 35 percent of police stops, even though they commit only 5 percent of all violent crimes. But using census data as a benchmark for policing is as nonsensical as it would be to use census data for fire department activity. If a particular census tract has a disproportionate number of fires, and another census tract has none, no one expects the FDNY to send out fire trucks to non-existent fires in the fire-free census tract just for the sake of equal representation.
The proactive policing revolution that began under NYPD Commissioner William Bratton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in 1994 declared that the police would actually lower crime—an unheard-of idea in the annals of policing. To accomplish that feat, the department began rigorously scrutinizing crime data on a daily basis and deploying officers to crime hot spots. Once there, officers were expected to be on the look-out for suspicious behavior. If there had been a string of robberies at ATMs in East Flatbush, for example, and an officer saw two guys apparently casing an ATM user from across the street, who then walked quickly away when they spotted the uniform, the officer was expected to stop and question the two men. If thieves had been preying on senior citizens in Harlem, someone walking closely behind a retiree in the 28th precinct and looking furtively over their shoulder would likely be stopped by an officer deployed there in response to the crime spike. Those stops may not have resulted in an arrest, if no evidence of a crime were found, but they may have disrupted a crime in the making.
This data-driven, proactive style of policing, which came to be known as Compstat, led to the largest crime drop in recent memory. The biggest returns were in New York's minority neighborhoods, because that's where crime was and still is the highest. Blacks and Hispanics have made up 79 percent of the 78 percent decline in homicide victims since 1990. Over 10,000 black and Hispanic males are alive today who would have been dead had homicide rates remained at early 1990s levels.
The Times's article is filled with the usual NYPD critics. There's Donna Lieberman and Christopher Dunn from the New York Civil Liberties Union, Darius Charney from the Center for Constitutional Rights (which is suing the department over its stop policies), Jeffrey Fagan from Columbia University law school, and “researchers” from the Center on Race, Crime and Justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. These critics' understanding of policing and crime is quixotic, to put it kindly. At a panel on stop and frisks at the New York City Bar Association this March (in which I participated), Fagan proposed the Chicago Police Department, which does not use proactive stops, as a model of policing that the NYPD should emulate. Fagan did not mention that New York City's homicide rate is two-fifths that of Chicago, and that juveniles in the Windy City under the age of 17 are killed at four times the rate of those in New York, an epidemic of youth killings so severe as to prompt an emergency visit from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder last October. The director of John Jay's Center on Race, Crime and Justice maintains that because the absolute number of homicides committed nationally by blacks, on the one hand, and whites and Hispanics, on the other, is roughly the same (though blacks commit more), there is no black crime problem.
The Times, however, did not consult any minority supporters of Compstat policing to get their perspective on whether the police are bearing down too hard in high-crime neighborhoods. A good place to start would have been a police-community meeting in East New York, Bedford-Stuyvesant, or other any high-crime area. Here is what the reporter would have heard from community members: “We want more officers, we want more arrests, we want the dealers off the corner.” The police cannot respond to these heartfelt requests for public safety without generating disproportionate stop data that can be used against them in a racial profiling lawsuit. If a grandmother in a public housing project calls the police about the young drug dealers in their lobby, a properly responsive officer is going to question the youths hanging out there. The officer is not “profiling” the youths; they are responding to a citizen request for action. But the NYCLU and the Center for Constitutional Rights will tally all those stops against the police as evidence of “racial profiling.” The police aren't getting calls from Riverdale residents about the young gang members congregating on the corner or in their lobby. If they were, the police would respond the same way that they do in Harlem: by finding legal grounds to stop the gang members and let them know that they're being watched. (For the record, the paper cited me as the other voice besides the NYPD spokesperson supporting the department's stop tactics.)
Contrary to the Times's assumption, the fact that an identical proportion of stops of whites and blacks—10 percent—results in an arrest or summons strongly suggests that the police use the identical quantum of reasonable suspicion in stopping whites and blacks. The police stop a greater absolute number of blacks because the overwhelming majority of crime, suspicious behavior, and calls to respond to crime occurs in black neighborhoods.
Given the vast disproportion in the city's crime rates, you can either have policing that goes after crime and saves minority lives, or you can have policed that mirrors the city's census data. You cannot have both. If the NYPD responds to the incessant pressure from the Times and the city's anti-cop activists to conform its policing activity to population rates, the law-abiding residents of high-crime neighborhoods will be hurt the most.
The Times's radically incomplete front-page story, like so many that preceded it, only makes the NYPD's job more difficult. It fuels the animosity against the police that makes witnesses less likely to cooperate with officers and suspects more likely to resist arrest. It is crime, not race, that leads to more stops in minority neighborhoods. The crime disparities in the city are deeply troubling, and thus have been regarded as taboo. But until those crime rates are acknowledged, reporting on police activity through an incomplete racial lens will continue to defame the NYPD and mislead the public about its work.
They then babbles on aimlessly about trade for a few more sentences.Clearly, Donald Trump has no idea what the GI Bill is — landmark legislation (which was recently updated) that still provides education and job training opportunities to our veterans, so they can better compete with others in their generation who chose to get a degree, or an early start to their career, over military service. It's part of the compact we make with those who serve, and a promise on which we cannot afford to renege.Efforts in Congress to chip away at the GI Bill, to pay for other pieces of veterans' care, have been opposed by many veterans' groups, and both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. It's another piece, for another day, as to why chipping away at the GI Bill is a bad idea.Today, what's relevant is that Donald Trump clearly thinks the GI Bill is some kind of job placement program that can be replaced once there are better trade deals.Maybe they care so little about learning what the GI Bill is, because they care so little about veterans. Most of the money they raised “for veterans,” when they bailed on a Republican debate, still hasn't been given to veterans' groups.Regardless, like on pretty much every issue, Trump talks long and loud, to hide the fact that they are utterly and totally clueless. Whether it is their disastrously stupid idea to try to squirm our way out of repaying debt, or thinking you can cut the GI Bill because you're renegotiating trade deals, the amount of things that Trump doesn't know, and doesn't understand, could fill up the crumbling and decrepit Trump Taj Mahal.Pathetic.

It happened that Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah, Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Tarfon were reclining in B'nai B'rak. They were discussing the Exodus from Egypt all that night, until their students came and told them: “Our Masters! The time has come for reciting the morning Shema!”
At this week's Passover seder, there it was again: a terse recollection of some of the earliest rabbis, who found enough in the Passover story to talk about it all night — perhaps as a rebuke to the “are we almost done yet?” crowd.
The fourth name on that list — Rabbi Akiva — is the subject of Barry Holtz's Rabbi Akiva: Sage of the Talmud, the latest installment in Yale's Jewish Lives series.
What we think of as Judaism today — from the religion practiced by the haredi Orthodox in contemporary B'nai Brak, Israel, to the lack of religion of secular Jews — was created by the rabbis in the centuries following the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in the year 70. If there was a quintessential rabbi in the group, said Holtz, a professor of education at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, that man was Akiva.
“He was the smartest one in the room,” they said.
Holtz has written what they call an “imagined biography” of Akiva, who lived in the first and second centuries CE.
What we know of Akiva comes from fragments in rabbinic texts. The Babylonian Talmud alone mentions them 1,341 times, Holtz said, and there are hundreds more references in other rabbinic texts. These shards show them to be an unparalleled interpreter of the Torah, a mystic and ultimately a martyr, as well as a man both proud and humble, and capable of touching empathy.
“He's a complicated person, but there's a consistency in their personality,” Holtz said.
Holtz does not try to harmonize the inconsistencies — “Was Akiva an unmarried shepherd who begins their studies of Torah for the love of a good woman?” they said. “Or was they already a married man with a young son when, through their own intuition, they discovered the importance of learning? Both traditions can be found in rabbinic literature.” Instead, they look at “why the Jewish tradition chose to preserve these tales across the generations.”
That approach, they said, is similar to that of modern scholars who look at the preserved stories of the rabbis as representing the values of the period rather than as historical and biographical facts. And so, without having to confirm dates and places or proving consistency in order to get to the truth of the story, Holtz was able to write their imagined life of Akiva by probing the texts for the truth as the rabbis saw it.
Akiva the husband
Holtz also reimagines the world of those ancient rabbis and how they transformed a religion centered on temple sacrifices to one focused on prayer and Torah study. The popular understanding is that the Romans destroyed the temple, which was an enormous trauma. “But along came the rabbis who said, ‘now we're going to have prayer,'” Holtz said.
“All that took a much longer period of time” than is commonly believed. In the meantime, there was “a considerable amount of fragmentation in the Jewish people.”
Akiva belonged to a circle of scholars that traveled through the land of Israel, studying and interpreting the law, disputing one another and forming a tight fraternity. “It was a small group, rather self-enclosed,” Holtz said.
It's doubtful whether that early circle had much influence on the larger Jewish population. Many of the rabbis were well-to-do and from prominent families. Akiva was not.
Of the several stories on Akiva's origins, Holtz is partial to what they call “the Hollywood version,” in which the daughter of a rich man falls in love with the poor, uneducated Akiva.
The daughter of Kalba Savua betrothed themselves to Rabbi Akiva. When their father heard about it, they vowed that they would not benefit from their wealth. They went and married Akiva. In the winter they slept in a hayloft, and in the morning they picked the straw from their hair. “If only I could,” they said to them “I would give you a Jerusalem of Gold” — a piece of expensive jewelry.
Akiva left their wife to study Torah. They returned a dozen years later attended by 12,000 students, a sign of the level of their scholarship. Their wife did not see them return, but Akiva heard them tell an old man, “If they would listen to me, they would stay another 12 years.”
Akiva realized that they wanted them to study and they had no reason to feel guilty for their long absence. So without reuniting with her, they returned to their studies. A dozen years later, they returned home, this time with 24,000 students.
It's one of the most-told stories of Akiva, but it confuses modern sensibilities. Said Holtz, “A teenage student of mine heard the story and said, ‘What's the deal with that?'”
In Akiva, Holtz tries to answer their student's question on many of the confounding stories about the sage.
Comfort through interpretation
Holtz found qualities of empathy and tenderness in Akiva and illustrates them as well. Two of the rabbis at the Passover seder in B'nai Brak, Eliezer and Joshua, were Akiva's teachers and mentors. Akiva quickly surpassed them in scholarship.
In one story, Rabbi Joshua had been humiliated by the boorish Rabban Gamaliel, the community leader. The two disputed the date on which Yom Kippur would fall, and Gamaliel ordered Joshua to carry personal objects and spend money on the day that Joshua had calculated Yom Kippur to fall, forcing them to publicly “violate their personal principles by disgracing Yom Kippur.”
Akiva came to comfort their teacher by showing how the Torah will allow them to accede to Gamaliel's orders while not violating their own principles. “It is typical of Akiva that they comfort Joshua through the use of text interpretation,” Holtz writes.
Four entered the orchard. While one looked and died, another looked and was stricken, a third looked and cut down the shoots, only Rabbi Akiva “went up in peace and came down in peace.”
This enigmatic story became part of the foundation of the Jewish mystical tradition. In their exploration of the “Orchard Story” or the “Pardes Story,” Holtz looks at what the four were doing, and why only Akiva seems to have returned unscathed.
“Akiva,” Holtz writes, “becomes the ultimate model of the Jewish mystic — gaining mystical knowledge and power and seeing the face of the divine.”
They became the model of the Jewish martyr as well, being executed by the Romans for violating a ban on teaching and learning Torah, a policy whose actuality Holtz called “murky.”
At the hour when Rabbi Akiva was taken out for execution, it was time for the recital of the Shema. Thus while they were combing their flesh with iron combs, they were accepting upon themselves the yoke of the kingdom of heaven.
The story is recalled every year in the Yom Kippur liturgy. “That model of the martyr — going to your death with the ‘Shema' on your lips — that started with him,” Holtz said. Surrounded by their students, “even in their death, he's teaching.”
David Holzel writes for Washington Jewish Week, an affiliated publication of the Jewish Exponent.

Abole is a FPS zombie/infected game but, with a new concept. Most of the zombie games are, as you know, based on only one theme. We want something different. A city filled with zombies is cool, but a medieval village would be sweet too! What we are trying to create is a zombie game with multiple options. We don't want the players to be bound to a certain kind of theme. Some people want to explore a village, looking for clues, while other people just want to kill. That is what we are trying to give you: A zombie game with lots of game modes.
Zombie preview
- Survivor Mode Endless killing. The zombies will come in waves and you just need to survive.
- Explorer Mode Explore and find clues while fighting zombies. Will you be able to complete your quest?
- Time Traveler Mode You don't need to carry your gun, since you don't have one. Are you able to survive the zombie apocalypse during the Middle Ages?
- Creator Mode Find resources and build your own base. But is it possible with all of the hungry zombies?
- Co-Op Play your favorite game mode with your friends!
- Campaign Kill the infected with a story!
We want our game to be very realistic so we added It's pretty hard to kill zombies if you've got a broken leg!
-Infected:If you are bitten by a zombie you will slowly turn into one of them. You can stop the process by making a medicine made with the ingredients that you can find in the map. But be careful, it'll be a shame if you get killed by your own medicine...
-Sickness: It's great if the medicine you made worked! The only thing is, what about allergies for some of the ingredients? And side effects?Some of the side effects will go away within a minute, but it may be necessary to make another medicine.
-Fractures To heal a broken bone you need medicine, bandage and patience. Your leg will slowly heal. But do you have the time?
We've got the ideas and motivation. The only thing we need now is the money so we can buy all of our needs since we want to make the game as good and realistic possible.
What would you do when you are playing outside being a 10 year old, forgetting the time and minding your own buisness, when all out of the sudden, a woman shows up crying with one arm? Would you walk up to them and help her? Or would you run away? In Abole you make the choices! You will become the character. Why hide for the infected if you can just fight them. Or will you use your stealth skills trying to not get caught. In Abole you choose how you will kill the infected. I'm of course talking about campaign mode. In Abole you can team up with your friends, use your sword to kill people, create your own fort and explore a deadly world.
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held out the prospect on Monday of reviving a 2002 Arab peace initiative that offers Israel diplomatic recognition from Arab countries in return for a statehood deal with the Palestinians.

Netanyahu's comments were a formal response to a speech last week by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who promised Israel warmer ties if it accepted efforts to resume peace talks.
“The Arab peace initiative includes positive elements that can help revive constructive negotiations with the Palestinians,” Netanyahu said, echoing comments they made a year ago to Israeli reporters.
“We are willing to negotiate with the Arab states revisions to that initiative so that it reflects the dramatic changes in the region since 2002 but maintains the agreed goal of two states for two peoples,” they added.
Their comments were made also in English in a speech that was mostly in Hebrew - a device Netanyahu often uses when they want to make a statement to the international community.
Netanyahu spoke moments after ultra nationalist Avigdor Lieberman was sworn in as Israel's new defense minister and Israel's fragile right-wing coalition gained vital support in parliament.
Lieberman concurred and Netanyahu appeared to indicate that the new far-right defense minister's inclusion in the government did not spell an end to peace efforts with the Palestinians.
The original Arab plan offered full recognition of Israel but only if it gave up all land seized in the 1967 Middle East war and agreed to a “just solution” for Palestinian refugees.
But in 2013, after the initiative's terms were softened to include possible land swaps between Israel and the Palestinians, Netanyahu signaled a readiness to consider it.
Previous attempts to engage the adversaries have come to nought. The Palestinians say Israeli settlement expansion denies them a viable state they seek in the occupied West Bank, the Gaza Strip and a capital in Arab East Jerusalem.
Israel has demanded tighter security measures from the Palestinians and a crackdown on militants who have attacked or threaten the safety of Israeli citizens.
In the last half year, Palestinian attacks have killed 28 Israelis and two visiting U.S. citizens. Israeli forces have shot dead at least 195 Palestinians, 134 of whom Israel has said were assailants. Others were killed in clashes and protests.
France is set to host a peace conference of to revive peace efforts on June 3 with the participation of ministers from the Middle East Quartet - the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations - the Arab League, the U.N. Security Council and about 20 countries.
Neither Israel, which has opposed the gathering, nor the Palestinians, who have welcomed it, have been invited.
Most expatriates living in the UAE will have fielded pitches from cold calling financial advisers tempting them with schemes they claim can pay big returns. But these are often high-risk, so it's vital to make a prudent choice.
When the British entrepreneur Steve Cronin was looking to invest their savings a couple of years ago, they quickly realised the pitfalls facing many expats. The fees on most financial investment schemes are outrageously high and long-term savings plans are often sold without disclosing key details such as what is being invested in or the penalties for breaking a contract early.
To top it off, there's little recourse to right wrongs when disputes with the sellers of these products (such as complex insurance-linked offshore investments) arise because the regulation in the UAE is still nascent. This allows many dodgy purveyors of financial products to bilk the unsuspecting.
Mr Cronin, 38, a Cambridge University-educated former management consultant who now runs their own health businesses in Dubai, says they were advised against signing up for a long-term investment scheme – which typically range from five years to 25 years – by a friend who had lost money after breaking their own plan.
“I nearly signed up for a 25-year plan but stopped when my best friend said ‘Please don't do this, I did it and lost quite a bit of money',” they say. “I didn't particularly know where to invest my money. I had some funds in the UK and thought ‘I am in financial services and I don't know where to invest stuff'.”
So Mr Cronin spent time researching options, eventually shifting their money into Vanguard Funds, a low-cost asset manager, back home in the UK.
US-based Vanguard was one of the first firms to offer low-cost indexed mutual funds – funds that mimic any given financial asset benchmark. It has received cash flows into its funds in recent years as investors start to cotton on to the benefits of investing in the cheapest possible way. Investors poured US$236 billion into Vanguard funds last year.
While many mutual funds that are actively managed typically charge about 1.5 per cent management fees per year, exchange-traded funds and mutual funds that just follow an index, can charge a sliver of that. For instance, Vanguard's Total World Stock exchange-traded fund, a fund that tracks more than 7,000 stocks globally, charges 0.14 per cent in annual fees.
In the meantime, financial advisers are having to reinvent themselves and rely less on commissions and more on fees. In the US, new regulations have been put in place to protect consumers from unscrupulous financial advisers. There are also signs of change in the UAE, with a number of financial advisers shifting from commission-based structures to fee-based, such as AES International and Killik Offshore.
To help expats avoid the pitfalls of investing while abroad, Mr Cronin set up a non-profit online forum last month called Wise, which offers advice on what to avoid when it comes to picking investments and how to dodge unscrupulous advisers. They also plan on helping groups of people, such as teachers, manage their finances through lectures and seminars.
One of their biggest tips is to ignore the cold callers that many expats in the UAE are familiar with. They operate by getting existing clients to give them phone numbers of friends and colleagues, creating a sense of trust and familiarity. But once they get hold of a willing prospect, they will often sell them all sorts of products with sky-high fees, such as so-called mirror funds that mimic a branded stock or bond fund but charges fees that are twice as high.
“It's a legal scam,” says Rory Gilbert, a Dubai-based managing director at AES International. “The main problem is that the regulator to some extent has turned a blind eye and a lot of market participants have taken huge advantage of that. These are many of the things that we saw in the UK 20 years ago and were legislated out of business.
“But what many financial advisers here particularly take advantage of is the ability, for as long as it lasts, to charge commissions and then they put icing on that by not disclosing the commissions and upfront charges.”
Not everyone has been as lucky as Mr Cronin at avoiding the snare of an investment scheme sold by unethical sales people.
Martin Boon, a 57-year old Briton, came to the UAE four years ago in the hope of saving enough extra cash to buy a home back in the UK.
Instead, the Dubai-based executive says they will probably have to work longer in the Emirates to make up the money they lost after being sold a high-risk investment product rather than a low-risk option they specifically asked for.
They say they were introduced to a financial adviser at a social event soon after they arrived in 2012. The adviser promised to help them reduce their exposure to taxation by shifting their UK pension into so-called offshore bonds.
The adviser put £200,000 (Dh1.03 million) from £388,000 of Mr Boon's life savings, that they had entrusted to the adviser, into two high-risk funds managed by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, with the advice that they could offer up to 11 per cent annual return and that they were low risk. Since then, those two funds have lost half of their value on paper.
While Mr Boon had asked for low-risk investments, these two funds were essentially investing in emerging market stocks through a convoluted product called an auto-callable structured note, whereby there is a measure of capital protection. That protection only kicks in, however, if the value of the investment loses 30 per cent or less after five years. If the funds lose more than 30 per cent, Mr Boon will have to bear the loss himself.
When the executive dug deeper into the funds after noticing their drop in value, they discovered not only was their money invested in the risky world of developing nations, but that a big chunk of their money was in Russian and Brazilian stocks, shares of listed companies in two countries that have been crushed by the collapse of commodity prices and which have also suffered from political fallouts.
Of the £388,000 initially invested, on paper it is now worth £290,000. And while you don't lose until you sell, Mr Boon is not optimistic that emerging market stocks will rebound to the levels they were at when they bought.
“How could you take someone who has five years to retirement and asked for something low risk and put them into something high risk? It's like expats ripping off expats,” Mr Boon says. “We've had to change a lot of our things in our planning to make up for the shortfall, possibly by staying longer.”
When contacted by The National about Mr Boon's investments, the investment company said that they had signed documents confirming that the products and the charges had been understood.
“We are always clear and transparent with clients on product structures, risks and charges where they sign to agree that they have fully understood these risks and agree to the terms and conditions,” a spokesperson said. “Clients are always given product provider brochures containing charges and sign to confirm that they have understood them.”
Because investment schemes that are administered by insurance companies fall through the regulatory cracks in the UAE, there is often very little recourse to address grievances.
Mr Boon says they have registered a complaint with the Central Bank of the UAE. The irony, they say, is that moving their cash to an offshore bond was largely unnecessary from a taxation point of view.
Mr Gilbert says that while there might sometimes be a reason to shift pensions from the UK to offshore equivalents, expats must carefully analyse whether it's worth the fees and potential pitfalls of doing so. Most often than not, they add, it's best leaving things as they are.
To ensure investors make the right decisions, Mr Cronin recently arranged a talk by Andrew Hallam, a Canadian financial journalist who has written a book to help expatriates manage their finances. The event was so well attended there were not enough seats to accommodate everyone.
“He's one of the few people spreading the message that you can take control of your fin­ances and you can invest offshore easily, cheaply and flexibly,” Mr Cronin says. “Not many people are doing that.”
Mr Hallam advised listeners to do their due diligence when choosing a financial adviser, researching the company and the advisers and making sure that they haven't been fined or censured by any regulators. Mr Cronin says it's not always easy for expats to open accounts at discount brokerages because some of the major players such as Vanguard and Fidelity don't allow you to invest unless you are a resident in the US or UK, or a small number of other countries.
The Briton says there are, however, a number of reputable brokerages including TD Direct Investin in Luxembourg and Saxo Bank that expats in Dubai can easily open accounts with.
For financial advisers, Mr Cronin's recommendations include Dubai-based AES International, which Mr Boon eventually gravitated to because the firm works on fees rather than commissions, meaning that it's in the best interest of the adviser to see their client's wealth grow. They also like Investme and Killik Offshore.

Keep a careful eye on your returns over the years
Harvey Jones
Keeping track of all your pensions and savings over the years isn't easy, and all too often things can end up in the wrong place.
Financial advice you took years ago may no longer be relevant. Or maybe your money was put into overcharging funds or offshore bonds by rogue advisers more interested in generating fees for themselves than higher returns for their client.
Briton Jackie Pym, who has been living in Dubai for six years, decided it was time to tidy up their pensions and savings and it didn't take long for their new advisers from UAE-based AES International to discover that much of their money had been poorly invested.
After taking financial advice from another company, Ms Pym, who works for a real estate developer, had set up a self-invested personal pension plan (Sipp).
This can be a flexible way to save for retirement because it can hold a wide range of investments, including individual company stocks, mutual funds, and trackers such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
This puts savers in charge of their money and allows them to build a low-cost portfolio to maximise their returns.
Unfortunately for Ms Pym, their former adviser had recommended they invest the Sipp in a pair of expensive insurance company bonds, and the high charges were eating into their returns.
Worse, about 30 per cent of their pension wasn't invested at all, giving them zero return on them money.
“My pension wasn't being properly looked after,” they say. “I was paying too many fees, and losing money as a result.”
Like many busy expats, they failed to make the time to check where their pension was invested, solely relying on the adviser.
“I didn't really think about it, I thought I had been given good advice and was being looked after, but that wasn't the case,” they say.
Them pension has now been invested in a diversified portfolio of low-charging funds and ETFs, and performance has been transformed.
“My pension is suddenly growing again, it is worth around £10,000 more after just a few months.”
Ms Pym says it is important that their savings are as flexible as possible, because at some point they plan to leave Dubai, either to return to the UK, or the Costa Blanca, Spain.
“Some advisers like to put expats into 25-year savings plans, but I don't want anything as ­rigid as that.”

Young defender Roberto Chen is helping Panama to a strong CONCACAF Gold Cup performance right now (2-0-1), but according to their club president with San Francisco they will be with the Seattle Sounders when national team duty is done. Chen was training with Seattle prior to leaving for the regional cup competition. They would reportedly be coming on a one year loan.
Just 19 now, they are already with the Panamanian senior team, has played CONCACAF Champions League ball against the Sounders and helped their nation to two shutouts in Gold Cup play so far. Their history is one of great promise with a 2011 injury hampering their growth curve. It is hard to say what Chen's best role is. In Gold Cup play they have played center back twice and right back once. They also have experience as a left back and left mid.
Panama's next Gold Cup match is against Cuba and then they likely see Mexico in a rematch. That game is at Cowboy Stadium and would be a huge test for the upstart side that already beat Mexico once. Their next World Cup Qualifier is in September when they face Jamaica and then Honduras. Currently they sit in 5th in the Hex.
Story highlights Engineers race to develop unmanned flying machine that turns wind to electricity
Altaeros Energies' helium-filled BAT may start Alaska field tests in 2015
Google's Makani Turbine uses an airplane-like design
Worldwide, an estimated 1 billion rural residents have no access to electricity
The first time you see this bizarre aircraft floating high above the horizon, you may be confused. It looks kind of like a giant, winged doughnut.
It's 35 feet wide, and inventors call it the BAT.
It's an unmanned, helium-filled, cylindrical blimp wrapped around three spinning blades that turn wind into electricity.
Altaeros Energies , launched four years ago by a group of MIT grads, hopes so. The young company is competing with Google and other outfits trying to bring the first viable airborne wind turbine to market.
The sight of whirling wind turbine blades sitting atop towers has become common in states such as California and Texas and in Europe. But the BAT takes wind turbine technology to the next level, literally -- about 1,000 feet above the ground.

Towers are often too low to catch the best winds. By flying remote-controlled wind turbines where winds are stronger and more consistent, a lot more energy can be harvested, and it's clean energy from an endless source.
It's a dramatic idea that could change the course of countless lives around the planet. Suddenly, with airborne wind turbines, isolated communities in South American jungles or Alaskan islands could have easier, cheaper access to technology that most take for granted.
For those people, the cost of electric light and heat would plummet because fossil fuels for electric generators wouldn't have to be imported.
Electricity would be available to pump clean water from central wells, preventing waterborne diseases. Refrigeration would be possible in hot climates to keep food fresh and store life-saving prescription drugs.
Even cell phone communications might be possible in some places, if cellular repeaters could be integrated into the high-flying turbines.
Experts offer three reasons why airborne wind turbines might work for remote areas:
• They're portable.
• They're computer controlled, requiring no onboard pilots and few operators.
• No expensive infrastructure, such as electrical grids or power stations, is required.
So now, the race is on to figure out the best design for these aerial power generators.
Would it look like an airplane? Google-owned Makani Power in California is working on one.
Or would it look more like a winged blimp? A firm out of Canada called LTA Windpower is working on that idea.
Perhaps the answer will be a huge kite, such as they've got at Berlin-based EnerKite
Or maybe the BAT will do the trick.
Altaeros and the Golden Valley Electric Association in Fairbanks, Alaska, are planning to partner on an 18-month test run, beginning sometime in 2015.
Electricity in some remote parts of Alaska can cost more than four times the U.S. average of 13.4 cents per kilowatt hour . That's because many Alaskan communities are far from electrical power grids -- the infrastructure networks that connect electricity to consumers. Without a grid, the cost of hauling in fossil fuels to run electric generators is huge.
"In Alaska, we have a very small electrical grid," said Golden Valley systems manager Paul Morgan. "When people live away from that, they generate their own power in all these villages, and that's pretty expensive."
The BAT, Altaeros says, is portable enough to pack into two small shipping containers. It can be set up without heavy machinery in about a day. The thing flies via its helium-filled doughnut-shaped body. It's connected to the ground at all times by strong tethers, which carry electricity to a portable ground station.
The tethers also are connected to a computer-controlled automated system that optimizes the BAT's height, based on changing winds. During operation, no crew is required, Altaeros says. It can be monitored remotely and maintained with periodic on-site inspections.
The ground station can be connected to a power grid, or a local micro-grid, or customer equipment, Altaeros says.
Each BAT can crank out enough power for 12 homes, the company says.
During dangerous weather, the BAT is designed to reel itself down to the ground. Its spinning blades don't pose a significant threat to birds and bats, Altaeros says , because critters don't usually fly as high as the turbines.
And what about nearby airplanes? Existing federal rules allow the BAT to fly nearly 2,000 feet high, below most flight patterns. The turbines include safety lights and locator beacons to warn passing aircraft.
Here's a brief look at the BAT's competitors:
Google's Makani turbine
The Makani Turbine got its name from the Hawaiian word for wind.
This turbine differs from the BAT because it flies more like an airplane. The plane has propellers on its wing and launches from a nearby ground station tower. While tethered to the tower, the Makani continuously circles in a vertical loop while it generates electricity. When it's finished, the Makani flies itself back to the tower.
Development of the Makani started with inflatable fabric kites. But five years ago, engineers switched to a more reliable rigid airframe made from lightweight carbon fiber.
Google-owned Makani Power is developing an airborne wind turbine that looks like an airplane.
The commercial turbine now under development has the wingspan of an airliner and the weight of a Mini Cooper, and it can withstand the G-forces of a fighter jet, Makani says.
The kite
Germany's EnerKite, founded in 2010, is developing a wind turbine that flies on a kite.
"It will be a mono-wing, like a kite rather than an airplane," said co-founder and CEO Alexander Bormann. The design calls for the kite to be controlled by a bridle and connected by tethers to a ground station.
Bormann says they expect to begin product sales in 2016.
The PowerShip
In Ontario, LTA Windpower's PowerShip concept is basically a blimp with wings and two spinning propellers. What sets this idea apart is the type of buoyant gas that would allow it to fly: hydrogen.
Company founder and CEO Nykolai Bilaniuk acknowledges that using hydrogen, which is more flammable than helium, "is potentially dangerous." However, they said, "we have to decide what would be sufficient to mitigate the risk."
Canada's LTA Windpower has designed a hydrogen-filled, winged-blimp called the PowerShip.
A specially designed envelope surrounding the hydrogen would protect the gas from igniting. Also, Bilaniuk says that hydrogen is cheaper than helium and can be created on-site.
"You can electrolyze water using some of your own electrical output from the generator," they said.
It's possible that all of these technologies may eventually find a place in the growing wind turbine landscape. If the concept of flying wind turbines fulfills its promise, by the end of the decade innovators may transform this big idea into reality while ushering some of the world's most isolated communities into the 21st century.

3D-printed rhino horn could make poaching obsolete
A biotech startup firm has come up with an ingenious use of 3D printing that could save the rhino from extinction.
San Francisco-based Pembient reports that it has managed to synthesise fake rhino horn that is virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. It even carries the same genetic fingerprint. The process involves a series of chemical reactions on synthetic keratin, which is mixed with rhino DNA to produce a dried powder used as the "ink" for the 3D printer.
The number of rhinos being killed in Africa has exploded in recent years, due to a combination of soaring demand and the industrial-scale killing methods of organised gangs. Several subspecies have already gone extinct, including the West African black rhino in 2006. The remaining five subspecies on current trends will be extinct or very near extinction as early as 2025-2030.
The illegal wildlife trade, a $20bn black market, is the fourth largest after drug, arms, and human trafficking. Pembient intends to flood China with these fake horns at well below the current market price. This same 3D printing technique could be applied to other illegal animal products like elephant ivory, tiger bones and pangolin scales.
"We can meet the demand for horns at one-eighth the black-market price. We'll make money; the poaching syndicates won't," says the co-founder and CEO of Pembient, Matthew Markus. "We can produce a rhinoceros horn product that is actually purer than what you can get from a wild animal. There are so many contaminants, pesticides, fallout from Fukushima. Rhino horn in the lab is as pure as that of a rhino of 2,000 years ago."
A prototype is shown in the picture below. Markus will be hosting an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on social media website Reddit, tomorrow from 1pm PT.

ANZ New Zealand's chief economist is suggesting the Reserve Bank may start easing its loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions from the middle of next year.
Cameron Bagrie, ANZ's chief economist, says the first steps in the relaxing of the LVR restrictions on banks' high LVR residential mortgage lending could come next year, after the Reserve Bank's May Financial Stability Report.
"And what I mean by 'relaxed' is a marginal tweak in the first instance, as opposed to removing them completely. This would likely involve investors' deposit requirements being eased to 30% from 40% and perhaps some marginal relaxing of the speed limit for owner-occupiers, ie allowing a few more +80% LVR loans," Bagrie says.
ANZ is New Zealand's biggest mortgage lender with loans of $73.705 billion at June 30. The latest Real Estate Institute of New Zealand monthly figures show nationwide August house sales volumes fell 20% year-on-year, the equivalent of 47 fewer properties being sold each day. In Auckland sales volumes were down 21.5%. The August Auckland median price dropped $10,000 to $840,000 year-on-year.
Bagrie argues the case for implementing the LVR restrictions, which were introduced in October 2013 and revised in November 2015 and October 2016, was not overwhelming. And now that Auckland house prices are falling and household credit growth is running below income growth, people are deleveraging which is a sign the LVR policy may have "overcooked things," suggests Bagrie.
"LVR restrictions were always intended to be a short-term tool. The longer you leave them in place, the greater the potential for seepage and for lending to be diverted into unregulated channels. We do note that housing lending [growth] by non-bank lending institutions is currently running at 28% year-on-year, as opposed to bank lending at 6.9% year-on-year," Bagrie says.
The total value of non-bank housing lending, however, sits at just under $2 billion versus banks' housing lending of more than $236 billion.
Bagrie points out the impact of LVR restrictions can't be disentangled from the impact of other forces that have weighed on the housing market. These, Bagrie says, include the interest rate cycle turning, banks rationing credit to close their funding gap, overseas buyers being missing in action, and Auckland's underperformance versus the rest of the country showing affordability has been a key issue.
The risk is that the Auckland housing market takes off yet again after the initial negative response to LVR restrictions, they add. Additionally Bagrie acknowledges demand-supportive forces remain evident including net migration hovering around all-time highs and interest rates being near historic lows. But, Bagrie says, "net-on-net" they believe we are closer to the day when these restrictions are relaxed.
Competition for deposits 'can ease up'
Separately Bagrie has been closely tracking the bank funding gap, being the gap between household deposits borrowed by banks and household borrowing lent by banks. When the housing market "took off" across the whole country last year, deposit growth slowed as interest rates fell and the funding gap widened.
"Pre-Global Financial Crisis behaviour was emerging again. That raised the ire of credit-rating agencies and the Reserve Bank, and once again increased New Zealand's vulnerability to the whims of global credit markets," says Bagrie.
"The problem New Zealand has is that it is already quite indebted, and the channelling of that international pool of savings into housing, which is not a productive investment, risks crowding out other forms of investment."
Banks have been getting more deposits in the door with deposit interest rates and borrowing interest rates both rising over the past year while wholesale rates haven't. Banks' rationing of credit, as Bagrie puts it, has worked.
"Annual housing credit growth is now running at 7.1%. But if we look at the annualised pace over the past couple of months, it is closer to 5%."
"That suggests some of the extreme competitive pressure we've seen in the deposit space can ease up, and the credit wheels can turn a little bit faster as we head into 2018. Both dynamics mean less pressure for retail interest rates to move up, outside of movements in the OCR and wholesale rates," Bagrie argues.
Trouble possible for developers
Meanwhile, Bagrie is also watching the intersection of falling house prices and rising construction costs, noting this combination could spell trouble for developers.
"We've seen a major listed company [Fletcher Building] take some big hits over a couple of projects. While that's non-residential work, one wonders about the residential area too. Real Estate Institute of New Zealand data shows Auckland house prices are down 4%. However, some suburbs are anecdotally down 10%. You take price falls of 5% to 10% and construction costs rising over 8% and whammo, you have no - or even a negative - margin. If we look at a different measure of construction costs - the value of consents per square metre - which has bobbled around between 10% and 15% per year, the story is even more worrying," says Bagrie.

The country's first pan-India national women's bank will be launched in Mumbai today. Here are 10 things you should know about the bank:
1.India's first ever state-owned women's bank will be inaugurated in Mumbai today and even thoughthe bank will focus on lending predominantly to women, there will be no restriction on account opening ( deposits) by men."We welcome both men and women to open accounts with us but for loans there will be a positive bias towards women, said Usha Ananthasubramanian the chairperson of the Bharatiya Mahila Bank in an interview with CNBC-TV18. So basically, deposits will flow from everyone, but lending will be predominantly for women.
2.The Bharatiya Mahila Bank will accept deposits as well as give loans from day one. It will lend towomen or to businesses which are either managed by or make products for women. There will also beemphasis on funding for skills developments to help in economic activity. Moreover, the products will be designed in a manner to givea slight concession on loan rates to women.
"We are looking to give 4.5% on savings accounts up to Rs.1 lakh and 5% for above Rs1 lakh to encourage more savings,"Ananthasubramanian told CNBC-TV18.
3.The government has chosen the iconic Air India building at Nariman Point in Mumbai to open the first branch of Bharatiya Mahila Bank. The branch will be in a 5,000 sq ft space on the ground floor.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi will be present at the inaugural ceremony in Mumbai today . Finance Minister P Chidambaram will also be present at the ceremony today. The inaugural day is the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
4. Post the inaugural,seven branches would become operational across the country, including Kolkata, Chennai, Ahemdabad and Guwahati. The government proposed opening of the bank branches in Delhi and Indore also, which has been disallowed by the poll body till the end of polls.Headquartered in Delhi, the bank proposes to have 25 branches by March 31, 2014. So,after starting with one branch in each banking region, the bank will expand to 500 branches by the fourth year of operation,which is when it sees operations becoming profitable.
5. Even though the bank is making its debut in metros and urban centre, it will enter rural areas beforeMarch 2014. It will focus on centres where working women population is significant. For instance it could be placed where there are large women farm labour,Usha Ananthasubramanian told Business Standard.
6. In Budget 2013-14, the Finance Minister had announced setting up of all-women bank with an initial capital of Rs 1,000 crore.A core management team of seven members has been formed by the government of India, headed by Usha Ananthasubramanian, to set up the bank advised by SBI Capital Markets. The application was made in June and the final licence was obtained by 25 September.
"Women are heads of many banks today, including two public sector banks, but there is no bank that exclusively serves women. Can we have a bank that lends mostly to women and women-run businesses, that supports women SHGs and women's livelihood, that employs predominantly women, and that addresses gender-related aspects of empowerment and financial inclusion? I think we can," Chidambaram had said.
7 One of its primary goals is the financial inclusion of India's unbanked, more specifically, rural women. Women are the most underutilized economic asset of our country. Our goal is to be the foremost provider of banking services to women," said Ananthasubramanian.
" This bank's approach will be to inspire people with entrepreneurial skills. We will tie up with NGOs. We will also locally mobilize women to train them in vocations like toy-making or driving tractors or mobile repairs. We will try to reach deeper rural pockets," Ananthasubramanian was quoted as saying by the Mint.
8.And While men may be precluded from taking a loan from it, they have not been left out when it comes to employment in India's first 'Mahila' (women's) public sector bank.Men account for about 36 percent of the candidates found provisionally eligible for appointment as Probationary Officers in the Bharatiya Mahila Bank.The probationary officer post is an entry-level position in the officer's grade in Bharatiya Mahila Bank had advertised 115 vacancies for this rank last month, and selected 103 candidates, according to the results notification.
9.The finance ministry has asked public sector banks to provide 125 officers for deputation to the first woman-focused lender. Most of these officers would be taken at one level above in the women's bank, but their experience here would not count for promotions.
10. Ananthasubramanian, 55, started their career in 1982 at Bank of Baroda as a specialist officer in the planning stream.She holds a dual master's degree - in statistics from the Madras University and in ancient Indian culture from the Mumbai University. Before joining the Bharatiya Mahila Bank, Usha Ananthasubramanian was executive director of Punjab National Bank.

" ... somehow and in some way, that's different than the allegations of Russian "influence" during the 2016 cycle."
While the American media and Washington are expending substantial energy on the alleged Russian interference in the United States political theatre during the 2016 election cycle, another nation and its American promoters that invest substantially in Washington generally fly under the radar when it comes to political influence-peddling.
According to Open Secrets, the pro-Israel "industry" has made the following political contributions since 1990:
And this doesn't take into account pro-Israel American Jews, like this fine fellow, Sheldon Adelson
Here is how these contributions were divided along party lines:
Over the two and a half decades, Democrat candidates received $83.16 million or 62 percent of the total compared to $49.95 million or 38 percent of the total for Republican candidates. As shown on this table, while the majority of the long-term benefits have gone to the Democrats, that amount has varied from a low of 49 percent in 2006 to a high of 75 percent in 1994:
As well, the pro-Israel "industry" has ranked between 27th and 60th place in a field of more than 80 other industries when it comes to their political contribution generosity.
Obviously, the pro-Israel "industry" is not a massive donor like the Securities and Investment, Real Estate and Legal industries but it is still a substantial player in Washington when it comes to "buying" political influence through political donations.
Here is a listing of the major pro-Israel sector donors during the 2016 election cycle:
Here is a graphic showing more detail on how the donations from the pro-Israel sector were split in the 2016 election cycle:
And, lest we forget, here are the individuals who benefited the most from the pro-Israel sector's generosity during the 2016 election cycle:
Look who appears at the top of the list - none other than Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton!
Interestingly, Donald Trump does not even appear on the list of the luckiest recipients, in fact, they receive a mere $69,730 from the pro-Israel sector as you can see on this list of presidential candidates:
Let's look at the other side of political influencing in Washington, that of lobbying. Here is a graphic showing how much the pro-Israel sector has spent on lobbying on an annual basis since 1998:
The latest election year saw the greatest amount spent by the pro-Israel sector with $4,537,343 spent in 2016. A decade ago, that amount was only $1,779,535 or about 39 percent of the spending in 2016.
Here are the six clients that represented the pro-Israel sector in 2013:
Not surprisingly, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee or AIPAC was responsible for the vast majority of the pro-Israel spending on getting legislators to see things Israel's way in 2013.
Here is a list of the 23 lobbyists that represented Israel's interests in Washington during 2016:
Of the 23 reported lobbyists, 4 or 17.4 percent are classified as "revolvers", that is, former federal employees who are now employed as lobbyists. It's interesting to see that at least one of the "revolvers", Gordon Bradley, has been employed as a political analyst by the Central Intelligence Agency, and has served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee twice prior to their employment by AIPAC in 1995. They obviously have an inside track to influencing decision-makers.
In closing, let's switch gears for a moment. According to the Jewish Virtual Library, since 1949, U.S. foreign aid to Israel has totaled $129.808 billion with $79.823 billion of that being military aid and $30.897 being economic aid. Military aid has steadily risen from around $300 million annually in the early 1970s to $3.1 billion annually in the period between 2013 and 2017. There is no about; Washington is a big investor in Israel.
Obviously, Israel has a great deal of interest in what happens in Washington, so much so that the pro-Israel "industry" is willing to spend tens of millions of dollars to "influence" elections and lobby Congress to stay on the good side of its long-term American benefactor.
But, somehow and in some way, that's different than the allegations of Russian "influence" during the 2016 cycle.
Ousted Thai prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra has fled the country ahead of a verdict against them in a negligence trial brought by the junta that overthrew her, sources close to the Shinawatra family said on Friday.
Yingluck, 50, whose family has dominated Thai politics for more than 15 years, failed to show up at court for judgment in a case centred on the multi-billion dollar losses incurred by a rice subsidy scheme for farmers.
Overthrown in 2014, Yingluck had faced up to 10 years in prison if found guilty.
"She has definitely left Thailand," said one source, who is also a member of the Shinawatra's Puea Thai Party. The sources did not say where they were now.
The Supreme Court issued an arrest warrant after saying it did not believe their excuse that they could not attend the court hearing because of an ear problem, but there was no sign of police showing up at their house.
"It is possible that they have fled already," Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters.
Yingluck's lawyer, Norrawit Lalaeng, said their team had told them on Friday morning they had an "ear fluid imbalance" and could not attend court. They said they were unaware whether they were still in the country. Them spokesperson declined to comment.
Yingluck's brother Thaksin Shinawatra, who heads the political clan, was overthrown in a 2006 coup and fled into exile to escape corruption charges that they said were aimed at demolishing the populist movement they founded.
The struggle between that movement and a Bangkok-centered royalist and pro-military elite has been at the heart of years of turmoil in Thailand.
The verdict against Yingluck was widely seen as having the potential to reignite tensions, though the junta has largely snuffed out open opposition. The Supreme Court said the verdict would now be delivered on Sept. 27.
Yingluck last commented on social media on Thursday, saying on their Facebook page that they would not be able to meet supporters at court because of the security measures.
They had been banned from travelling abroad at the start of the trial in 2015 and has attended previous hearings.
Hundreds of Yingluck supporters had gathered outside the court on Friday where around 4,000 police had been deployed.
Some held roses while others wore white gloves with the word "love" on them.
If Yingluck fled it would disappoint their supporters and make their opponents feel vindicated, said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University.
"It does not help with Thailand's division and polarization," they said.
Under the rice subsidy program, Yingluck's administration paid rice farmers up to 50 percent more than market prices. It left Thailand with huge rice stockpiles and caused $8 billion in losses.
Yingluck has said they were only in charge of coming up with the policy but not the day-to-day management of the scheme.
In a related case on Friday, the Supreme Court sentenced Yingluck's former commerce minister Boonsong Teriyapirom to 42 years in jail after finding them guilty of falsifying government-to-government rice deals between Thailand and China in 2013.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led the coup against Yingluck's government in the name of ending political turmoil, has promised that an election will be held next year.
Yingluck had been banned from politics for five years in 2015 by the junta's legislature for alleged graft in the rice-purchasing program.
It definitely has a fun and interesting feel to it. It is harder to read the colors because of the spheres. Don't expect to speed solve it because the spheres make it more difficult to manipulate. Shape aside it is smooth turning but it can be very unstable. It has mushy, squishy feel to it. It definitely will corner twist A LOT. This is because there is no way to really stabilize the sphere shapes in the corner pieces based on the design. Applying speed cube design to the spheres does not quite work out as well as what would be expected. I doubt adjusting the tension will make much of a difference. I have seen some people on video do it for speed solving. As a novelty cube it is quite a conversation piece and looks good in the collection. Buy it if you want something that is different that actually works. I got it because it looks like something right out of a mad scientist's lab. Neat - o.
Vegan Smoked Tomato Pasta
my goal this week has been to *ease* my way into cleaner eating. i'm not all salads and juice bars but i have been drinking a lot more water and replacing my impulsive chocolate eating with fruit. i'm taking small steps here.
as i mentioned earlier this week, i'm also working on my vegan cooking skills. this recipe introduced me to nutritional yeast for the first time which, upon further investigation, i learned is a rather common ingredient in savory vegan cooking. new things!
a derby teammate of mine, Missy, who does the majority of their cooking in the vegan fashion, came over this past weekend to show me one of their staple dishes that they say their kids love: Vegan Smoked Tomato Pasta (name chosen by moi).
MY LATEST VIDEOS MY LATEST VIDEOS
one of my favorite parts about this recipe is how incredible easy it is. it's basically just 1) cook pasta and 2) blend a few ingredients together and add to pasta. you know i'm a fan of easy.
ideally, cashews are soaked for a few hours. we only had time to soak ours for a few minutes which resulted in a slightly grainier (less creamy) but still delicious sauce.
while the pasta water is heating up, the sauce is made.
cashews and 2 1/2 cups of broth are added to a food processor (or blender). Missy uses 2 1/2 cups of water with a broth cube for this.
this is processed for a few minutes and then the remaining sauce ingredients are added in: smoked sun dried tomatoes, tomato sauce, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and nutritional yeast (abbreviated as “nooch” on their hand written recipe for me).
this is blended up for a good few minutes until it's at a good creamy consistency.
Missy said that the sauce is usually creamy that ours turned out but we decided it was the lack of cashew soaking. either way, once again, it was still SO tasty.
once your sauce is finished….
all that's really left is to add it to your cooked pasta…
stir it all together…
and (preferably) top it with some sauteed kale and a few extra sun dried tomatoes.
i kept all of the leftovers and ate the HECK out of this for a good few days. sometimes i ate it plain (mostly out of pure laziness) and other times i sauteed up a bit more kale to go with it.
this pasta had a delightful and surprising cheese taste to it that almost mimicked mac n' cheese. needless to say, i'm a pretty big fan.
for the pasta, we made things difficult. we cooked 2 bags of pasta, later deciding that was too much for the amount of sauce, and put a good chunk of it aside. so, i'm going to say that one bag/ box of pasta would be perfect for the amount of sauce this recipe makes.
Electric-car maker Tesla Motors' (NASDAQ:TSLA) stores already break the mold. Located in areas with heavy foot traffic like shopping malls, commission-free employees facilitate an educational environment where visitors can learn about the company's products -- a starkly contrasting experience from pushy auto dealerships. Indeed, when it comes to being salesy, Tesla was ranked dead last by an annual mystery-shopping study by Pied Piper Prospect Satisfaction Index.
But Tesla stores are departing even further from auto dealership practices. During November, the company began selling energy products alongside its vehicles.
Powerwall hits Tesla stores
In dozens of locations across North America, Europe, and Australia, Tesla has revamped its stores to promote and sell its recently updated energy storage product for residential customers, Powerwall 2.
According to Tesla, customers at select locations can now see and learn about Powerwall 2.
The initial stores selected to feature Powerwall 2 were chosen because they were the company's strongest markets for energy products, according to the company. But Tesla will be revamping more locations with its Powerwall in the near future.
Tesla's new Powerwall, which launched in October, includes 14 kilowatt-hours of energy capacity -- twice the capacity of its predecessor. It also costs slightly less per kilowatt hour and, unlike Powerwall 1, includes a built-in inverter. It requires no maintenance and lets customers monitor and control their energy with a Tesla app, the company says.
Capitalizing on a nascent segment
Tesla's rollout of energy products at its stores comes just after the company closed its acquisition of solar panel company SolarCity and essentially previews the combined company's plans for a larger integration of energy products in Tesla stores. Tesla has said it expects the global reach of its 190-plus high-foot traffic stores to increase leads for its solar products after the company begins selling them in its stores. Given that Tesla's energy storage products go hand in hand with solar power generation, the Powerwall's launch in Tesla stores is just a start for a broader rollout of energy products.
Importantly, just because the Tesla Powerwall is only now making it to company stores, investors shouldn't mistake the company's energy business as a new venture. The Powerwall's presence at Tesla stores also comes as the company is ramping up its energy storage business. Tesla first launched its energy storage products in the first half of 2015, and its offerings, which include storage options for residential, commercial, and utility customers, have arguably since surpassed competition in both breadth and scope. The Powerwall's newfound spotlight in Tesla stores pegs the company's ambition to be a leader in a nascent and fast-growing market for energy storage and solar solutions.
A total of 300 megawatt-hours of Tesla energy storage capacity has now been deployed worldwide, Tesla said in October. It also anticipates that energy storage sales could eventually soar to represent one-third of the company's expected 35 gigawatt-hour annual battery production capacity at its under-construction Gigafactory.
A Michael Buffer wannabe proudly declared, "And now a five-star prospect from Batesville, Mississippi...Tony Conner" to a crowd of inebriated Ole Miss fans and students as Conner, the local stud, strode onto the stage.
It was Ole Miss' big official visit weekend back in January 2013, and the school pulled out all the stops. The big group of top recruits that weekend included Conner, Robert Nkemdiche, Laquon Treadwell, Laremy Tunsil and Chris Jones - all five-star prospects and all but one would go on to sign with the Rebels.
One-by-one their names were announced to the popular Oxford college bar as the young celebrities they were, the crowd begging them to come to Ole Miss. A group of older boosters hung off to the side, eying the greatest collection of recruiting talent the Rebels had ever assembled in Oxford. All the while, Ole Miss assistants quietly monitored the proceedings from upstairs, watching their top recruiting targets dance shirtless on stage to the adulation of the fans.
Ole Miss went on to sign the nation's eighth-best recruiting class that year, an achievement that generated a lot of good publicity for the school. But that recruiting class attracted the NCAA to set up shop in Mississippi and could ultimately cost Hugh Freeze, Ross Bjork and others their jobs at the school.
The program received an amended Notice of Allegations Wednesday which alleges that Ole Miss paid between $13,000 and $15,600 to a recruit who ended up at another school, among other serious charges.
If the lack of institutional control charge and the head coach responsibility legislation stick, Freeze will likely be out of a job and Bjork might not be far behind. Ole Miss football program will be cratered and will have little shot at competing in the ultra-competitive SEC West for years.
It'll represent a precipitous fall from grace for Freeze who had emerged as one of the SEC's most promising coaches.
**
There are multiple remarkable stories surrounding that 2013 Ole Miss class but none more so than the signing of Tunsil, a five-star offensive tackle out of Lake City, Florida. All the big schools wanted Tunsil who was viewed as a plug-and-play Day 1 starter wherever they landed. Unlike Nkemdiche, Conner or even Treadwell, Ole Miss didn't have a natural connection to the top 10 recruit.
Ole Miss wasn't given much of a shot for most of Tunsil's recruitment, with Georgia and Alabama considered the early favorites. But Freeze and defensive line coach Chris Kiffin convinced Tunsil to take an official visit the same weekend as their other top targets.
And sometime between arriving on campus and dancing on stage, something changed.
Days later, Georgia went in for an in-home visit with Tunsil's family expecting the five-star to reaffirm a silent commitment they had already given Mark Richt's staff.
Instead, the Georgia coaching contingent walked in to find the entire Tunsil family decked out in Ole Miss gear. The Georgia coaches were livid, according to multiple accounts. Word quickly started spreading through the college ranks, and there was a general feeling amongst coaches that Ole Miss had gone too far.
Tunsil went on to have a very good career for the Rebels but was in the news twice for the wrong reasons. First, they were suspended for seven games after they were caught using three loaner cars over a six-month period without payment. Then there was the much publicized NFL Draft disaster when someone hacked their account and revealed text messages that showed them asking Ole Miss associate athletic director John Miller and former staffer Barney Farrar for money to pay bills.
Tunsil later admitted to taking money in a surreal press conference at the draft.
Ole Miss, in a 20-minute video released Wednesday, said that the Tunsil draft day crisis didn't factor into new NCAA allegations, but it gave the NCAA an opportunity to keep digging into the program. The NCAA immediately started asking around about Tunsil after they admitted at the draft to taking money while at Ole Miss, according to multiple sources.
More than anything, it was more bad optics for a program in the middle of a years-long NCAA investigation.
As one college coach put it to me, "Everyone does it, but they got caught on national TV, and it was embarrassing honestly."
**
It's hard to blame Freeze or their staff for trying to recruit the best recruiting class possible at a school that typically isn't relevant on the national scale. The program achieved considerable success because of that 2013 recruiting class, namely winning consecutive games against Alabama in 2014 and 2015 and earning the program's first Sugar Bowl berth since 1970. But it's easy to wonder if Ole Miss hadn't signed Tunsil, whether it'd be in this current mess.
It's not as if Freeze and others involved in the program weren't aware that there could be negative consequences. One local Mississippi power player even warned an Ole Miss assistant that they were sloppy and it could come back to bite them. The Ole Miss assistant shrugged off the advice, confident that the staff's approach was bulletproof.
That mentality was reflected throughout the program. It all started with the head coach who, in a now infamous tweet, challenged anyone with knowledge of recruiting violations to alert the school's compliance department. Rival coaches couldn't believe that Freeze would be so brazen to dare people like that publicly.
It didn't stop there.
Up until that depressing 20-minute video on Wednesday, Freeze and Bjork were publicly defiant over the NCAA investigation. There was a cockiness to the coach and athletic director pair as they went on the aggressive to anyone who dared impugn Ole Miss' good name. All the while, they downplayed the severity of the charges behind the scenes to reporters who happily took them at face value.
Years down the line, Freeze and other members of their staff may look back and wonder if they had been humbler, if they hadn't been so greedy, maybe they could have avoided the NCAA's vice grip.
Instead, Freeze and Ole Miss flew too close to the sun. Similar to the warning Robert DeNiro's character delivers about spending money following the Lufthansa heist in "Goodfellas," if you are going to color outside the lines, you have to be tactful about it. Ole Miss was never going to get the benefit of the doubt; it was new money, and to outsiders, looked like it just bought a fleet of luxury vehicles.
Once Ole Miss announced that 2013 recruiting class, it was a certainty that the NCAA was going to snoop around. The more and more they looked around, the more resolute investigators became in extracting a pound of flesh. Based on the allegations, it appears it was able to do that and more through offering immunity in exchange for information.
Ole Miss is now on the ropes though it has vowed to fight the most serious NCAA allegations. The school has already imposed a one-year bowl ban though there are more serious punishments hanging over its head. If its unsuccessful in its Committee on Infractions hearing, as most expect it will be, it will be because Ole Miss made too many waves too quickly in 2013.
And because of that, the music has stopped and the dancing is over in Oxford.

WHEN Bianca and Nick Bowser's young sons get older they will sit them down and drop a bombshell.
Bianca, the woman who Kai, three, and Pax, who is nearly one, have always known as their mother, is ­actually their dad.
And Nick, the man they believe to be their father, is the mother who gave birth to them.
The couple know the revelation will be nothing less than mindblowing to their children.
But they insist the boys will be fine – because their upbringing will be loving, supportive and secure.
The facts are these: Bianca, 32, was born and brought up as a boy called Jason and Nick, 27, as a girl called Nicole.
They are a transgender couple but still have their original sex organs because they cannot afford reconstructive surgery.
Bianca said: “The kids currently have no idea. It's not like strangers ever guess in restaurants or at the shops.
“I don't know when we will tell them, maybe when Kai is about six. But they will need to be old enough to understand.
“It is important they know because it's a big secret to keep from your children and if they found out another way they could hold huge resentment.
But I don't worry about how they'll react. We will not treat it as a bad thing. And kids are accepting and non-judgmental.”
They added: “Being transsexual doesn't define who we are, just as being black or white or skinny or fat doesn't define you either.”
In a perfect world, everyone would agree. But Bianca and Nick, who live in the US state of Kentucky and married in November 2011, know only too well that many people see their life as abnormal.
They are choosing to talk about their unusual situation now to raise awareness.
Nick has taken testosterone to help change their appearance and had surgery to remove their breasts.
Bianca had breast augmentation and laser hair removal but didn't need female hormones because they naturally look and sounds feminine.
As Bianca says, most strangers don't guess they are not biologically as they appear to be – so they don't get hassled.
But when bar manager Nick was pregnant, their biological gender was obvious and the baby bumps prompted aggressive stares and nasty comments from some.
They said: “My pregnancy was not the norm for a lot of people and so they stared. I couldn't handle the whispering and pointing and, by the time of the third trimester, I couldn't leave the house.
“I only left for doctor's appointments. People are afraid of what they don't understand.”
It might have been easier for Nick to give up their male clothes and hairstyle for the duration but Bianca says that was never an option. They explained: “He hasn't worn women's clothes since high school.
“Nine months was not going to force them to do it.
“And our friends and family were happy for us – happy to be having grandchildren and nephews.”
(Image: Chris Bott)
For Nick, there is another struggle to face. Going through the most female of all experiences was a nightmare for him.
They said: “My brain has always told me I was a boy.
“I decided to carry our sons because we wanted our children to be ours, but being pregnant made me absolutely miserable. It was a daily struggle.
“I hated the way my body was changing. It did not match my inner feelings.”
Unable to bear the thought of natural birth, Nick opted for a Caesarean section. They said: “It cut out part of the very female process of giving birth.”
Bianca didn't mind that they were unable to experience that part of being female.
They said: “I was very happy not to carry the children – the inconvenience, the physical changes, the pain of birth.”
Bianca grew up as Jason in a religious family in a small town in Georgia and struggled to understand why they felt different from the age of five.
“It's not that I hated Action Men and played with Barbies, although I didn't like rough play,” they said.
“But I was always more comfortable with girls and my mannerisms were feminine. Initially, I thought I was gay and came out at 17. I didn't know at that point it was possible to change gender.
“But when I was on the gay scene I met transgender people for the first time. It was like an epiphany.”
They began therapy and wearing women's clothes full-time. “It was scary,” they admitted. “It was like going through puberty again, but I never kept it secret.”
Bianca's family struggled to accept the change, just as they had them coming out as gay. Although they now accept them as a woman, they admit it took them a while to refer to them as Bianca and “she”.

Nick, also from Georgia, assumed they were gay in the same way and they came out as a lesbian at the age of 17. But deep down they knew there was more to their feelings and they began to dress like a boy.
They said: “From a young age I wanted to play like boys, to look like them and especially to dress like them.
“When I came out as a lesbian I could dress like a guy, have short hair, and date girls. But it took me another four years to learn what being transgender was.”
It was meeting Bianca in the bar where they worked as an entertainer in 2009 that gave them the courage to become a man.
“He was still Nicole but looked very butch and that attracted me,” said Bianca. “A few months later we got together and they spoke to me about making the transition. They started binding their breasts for the first time.
“It was frightening for them worrying about whether their family would accept him. That's still a grey area – but it's getting better.”
Bianca says that although they dislike still having their biological genitalia, having sex has never been a problem.
“We have the parts so we will use them,” they said. “If we could change them,we would and they would be the other way around – but we cannot afford it and the children come first.”
Bianca does admit that they felt a stab of envy at the bond Nick might be developing with the boys while carrying them. But Nick says it was actually a struggle.
They admitted: “For me even the births, having them taken out of me, did not emotionally affect me. It took weeks for me to build an attachment.”
When Kai was born, medical staff assumed they were a lesbian couple. And the reaction when Bianca tried to sign in the box for “father” was crushing.
“They didn't believe it until they had seen the paperwork,” they said. “I had to fight and it did upset me.”
But despite the documentation, Bianca has never felt anything but a mum.
They said: “Nick is their dad. It's not that I do more maternal things – we share everything as parents – but the kids call me mum and Nick dad.”
The pair say they won't have any more children. But only because the two they already have are a handful.
Bianca said: “It's exhausting. But we love raising children.
“Having them is what I always wanted. I just didn't dream I would find anyone to do it with me.”
THIS week Barack Obama decided to block a private Chinese company from buying a wind farm near an American military installation in Oregon. Regardless of the rights and wrongs of the president's decision—and it does come suspiciously close to the American election—it fits into a pattern that should worry China's businesspeople and rulers. In the West many of China's best companies are treated with suspicion: Huawei, a telecoms giant, has been blocked from some markets in America, and a bid by CNOOC, a state oil firm, to buy Canada's Nexen has raised a storm. And it is not just the West. The leaders of Myanmar, hardly democratic capitalists, have also turned against some Chinese firms (see article).
Behind this suspicion lies the perception—strengthened by the re-emergence of the country's vast state-owned enterprises (SOEs)—that China's businesses are too close to the Communist Party. Many in the regime believe the SOEs' growth has helped China's rise. The reverse is true: the SOEs have cashed in on China's progress. Far more importantly, they now look sure to hinder it in the future.

Retreat of the state
In the 1990s, there was a logic behind promoting the SOEs. Having seen post-Soviet state assets fall into the hands of oligarchs, China built up a select group of SOEs with cheap loans, land and energy, so that the wealth would remain with the party. The best of them are world-class. The combined profits of Sinopec and China Mobile in 2009 were greater than the profits of China's 500 largest private firms together. Long-term and ambitious, the SOEs increasingly attract the country's best graduates. They contributed heavily to the investment splurge that rescued China's economy from the global financial crisis, contributing to a process critics call guojin mintui; “the state advances, the private sector retreats”. The party has encouraged the consolidation of SOEs in important industries, and protected them from foreign competition (see article).
In many ways the state suffers as a result. An independent Chinese study has found that if all the government's grants and hidden subsidies were taken away, the SOEs would lose money. They pay hardly any dividends back to the government. Instead much of the wealth has ended up enriching SOEs' chiefs and political patrons, frequently sons and daughters of Communist Party leaders, who are so powerful that they often outrank the heads of bodies supposed to regulate them. Money that could be much more efficiently allocated is instead reinvested into SOEs, reinforcing their strength, and their bosses' fortunes. These vested interests are in turn some of the most strident opponents of political and economic reform, since they are the ones with the most to lose.
The SOEs' power harms foreign firms in China, which are increasingly frozen out by regulatory or market-access barriers. Abroad, the SOEs also cause problems—and not just suspicions in America. Myanmar's leaders have tired of the plundering of their country by unaccountable Chinese SOEs—one reason for their recent decision to open to the West. Most important of all, SOEs damage small and medium-sized Chinese enterprises, which are starved of money. This deprives China of the bamboo capitalists whose drive and innovation is needed more than ever now that economic growth is slowing.
The road China has taken from a centrally planned economy has been brave. The former prime minister, Zhu Rongji, in the late 1990s, took a sledgehammer to the weakest SOEs. But, more than a decade later, it is worrying to see those that survived tightening their grip. The party needs to take on the vested interests, start to privatise SOEs, open their sectors to competition and allow the private sector once again to help pull China forward. Some reformers in China know this must happen. In April the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, gave a speech attacking the monopoly power of big state banks. But they are stepping down, and it is not clear who might champion the cause in the new leadership that takes office in November. Hardliners fear that the survival of the Communist Party is at stake. But so is the economic miracle of the past 30 years.

TENS of thousands of demonstrators have started a silent protest in the Albanian capital Tirana, a week to the day after clashes during an opposition rally killed three.
The demonstrators, headed by the leadership of the opposition Socialists and the families of the victims, started a march on the government buildings. People continued to pour into the downtown area near the government, bringing traffic in central Tirana to a standstill. Many protesters carried flowers.
In the square in front of the government, a stage was set up, and opposition leader Edi Rama, the mayor of the capital, was expected to address the crowds later.
Pictures of the three fatalities of the last rally were placed on stage, with the word "justice" written on them in Albanian and English.
There was a huge police presence in the capital, with two cordons surrounding the government buildings and 30 elite officers guarding the entrance.

Race row as Tory town tells Gove super-head: We don't want your inner-city pupils here
Top-performing Durand Academy in Stockwell wants to open boarding school in Stedham, West Sussex
But neighbours aghast and say ethnic minority students will cause problems
They fear influx of weapons and think local forest will be turned into a 'sexual volcano'
But education secretary Michael Gove hits back and slams them for blocking 'inspirational' project
Education Secretary Michael Gove last night stepped into a bitter race row raging over an inner-city school's plan to open its own boarding school in an affluent rural area.
The top-performing Durand Academy in Stockwell, near Brixton, South London, wants to transport 600 youngsters to a site with stunning views over the South Downs every Monday morning for lessons and bring them back on Friday evenings, free of charge.
It says the scheme will provide them with ‘an Eton-style experience' and help keep pupils safe from drugs and knife crime.
Row: A disused school in the town of Stedham, West Sussex, is earmarked to be filled with boarders from London's Durand Academy, causing fury among residents who fear an influx of ethnic pupils will cause social problems
Apple of their eye: The academy, in Stockwell, is one of the best in London and is a favourite of education secretary Michael Gove
But the plan has been fiercely criticised by people living near the site – a disused boarding school in the quiet village of Stedham, West Sussex. They have raised concerns about the number of black and Asian students and claimed that youngsters would need to be searched daily for drugs and weapons.
They have also accused Durand's ‘super-head' Greg Martin – who has been described as a ‘hero' by Mr Gove – of ‘spoiling a tranquil place' by ‘bringing Brixton to the countryside'.
But last night Mr Gove's spokesperson hit back and attacked those ‘trying to obstruct an inspirational project'.
Their intervention came after a local Tory county councillor expressed fears about the number of ethnic minority students who would attend the school.
John Cherry, 73, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Ninety-seven per cent of pupils will be black or Asian. It depends on what type of Asian. If they're Chinese they'll rise to the top. If they're Indian they'll rise to the top. If they're Pakistani they won't.
‘There are certain nationalities where hard work is highly valued. There are certain nationalities where they are uncertain what this hard work is all about.
‘If the children are not allowed out of the site then it will make them want to escape into the forest – it will be a sexual volcano.
‘Has anyone asked whether these children want to be plucked from their natural surroundings? They have never done boarding before, so they won't know how it works.
Shock: Durand Academy chief Greg Martin has described the attitude of residents as 'shocking' but has vowed to press on with the scheme
‘The trauma of taking the children out of their natural surroundings is going to be considerable.'
They added: ‘Stockwell is a coloured area – I have no problem with that. To be honest, I would far rather Durand took over a secondary school in London rather than shoving everybody here.'
Anne Reynolds, chairperson of a steering group which has been set up in the area to fight the plans, also questioned whether inner-city children would feel comfortable in such a rural environment.
They said: ‘It might raise tensions in their community. Their peers might say, “Why have you been chosen to go to a special, smart school in West Sussex but I haven't?”
‘The whole thing is a massive experiment and I think it will be disastrous. There's no evidence it will increase their attainment levels. When you're a teenager, isn't it too late to start appreciating the countryside? I don't know if it's the right environment.'
At a public meeting in the nearby village of Milland, where actor Hugh Bonneville has a home, one unnamed resident said: ‘You must be wary because you are talking about students who will have to be searched daily for weapons and knives.' Chichester MP Andrew Tyrie is also ‘extremely unhappy' with the way the project has been handled and has written to Mr Gove asking them to rethink the idea.
Mr Martin, Durand's director of education, last night described some of the comments from residents as ‘shocking' but vowed to press on with the scheme. It is hoped the boarding school will open next year.
They said: I've heard a few comments made about pupils escaping and I said I'm not building a prison.
‘It's sad but it makes us want to fight harder for it, and when this councillor sees the hard work and commitment from ethnic minorities I'm sure they will change their tune.
‘At the moment, so many children are leaving our school well educated only to be utterly failed by the secondary system.
‘We want to get pupils away from hanging around the streets of Brixton and Stockwell, where we have stabbings and a constant threat of trouble. It will be very hard to maintain a negative view when you see students working hard and contributing. You will soon realise these are frankly nothing more than baseless prejudices.'
A spokesperson for Mr Gove said: ‘Durand has a superb record of helping some of our most disadvantaged pupils achieve brilliant results thanks to a rigorous curriculum, great teaching and sky-high expectations for all pupils.
‘Durand's boarding school is a bold experiment and a chance to give inner-city youngsters a truly world-class education.'
And leading black Conservative MP Kwasi Kwarteng urged locals to drop their opposition to the plan. Mr Kwarteng, whose parents came to Britain from Ghana and who was educated at Eton, said: ‘This school is a very good idea.
‘Obviously, the locals will have some concerns about it, but we have to give these children the chance to get a good education and a well-run boarding school in the English countryside is a perfect way to do that.
Opposition: Local Tory councillor John Cherry is aghast at Durand's plans to move to West Sussex
‘If the school is a success, as I am sure it will be, it will be a great credit to the pupils, teachers and the local community itself. When that happens everyone will wonder what all the fuss was about.'
Durand is a primary school that has been rated as outstanding by schools watchdog Ofsted. But staff and governors are so concerned about standards at local secondary schools that they used the proceeds from Durand's leisure and student accommodation business to buy St Cuthman's School, a Grade II listed building, for £3.4 million in 2010. They want to open it as a boarding school for pupils aged 13 to 19.
Mr Martin has said the idea stemmed from a desire to keep youngsters away from the ‘stabbings and constant threat of trouble' in South London.
It secured a £17 million handout from the Government to help finance the project.
As an academy, Durand is outside local authority control, meaning it runs its own budgets and can even change the length of terms and the school day.
St Cuthman's, which occupies 20 acres in an area of outstanding natural beauty, used to be run by the local county council for children with special needs but closed in 2004 and has remained empty since.
Barcelona's ace Sónar festival has announced the first round of names for next year's edition, running from June 18 to 20 2015. Heading the line-up are The Chemical Brothers, with the promise of an all-new show. Says Tom Rowlands: "The show will be an intense ride, hold tight. We dream of new sounds and different frames, both music and visual. We hope to amaze ourselves." Beyond that, it's an embarrassment of riches (with more to come; over 150 acts in total, no less), with Autechre, Holly Herndon, Lee Gamble, Helena Hauff, Evian Christ, Daniel Avery, Kiasmos and Vessel on the bill.
There'll also be a return from Sónar +D, the festival's conference side of affairs, which next year will be looking at music/technology hybridisation, Big Data, wearable tech and more. As ever, we'll have a host of features and interviews with featured acts, but for now, read our review of this year's event and get hold of tickets here.
“Socialism is like a nude beach. Sounds pretty good until you actually get there.” Iowahawk on Twitter
Last week, Cornell's President David Skorton dropped a bombshell on the student body when they announced, in an email sent to all students, a $350 student health fee to be levied on all students who do not purchase Cornell's Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) starting next academic year.
Immediately, the campus erupted in outrage over yet another hike in the cost to attend Cornell—one that would not be covered by financial aid because it is a fee and one that was announced so suddenly without any warning from the University administration.
The Cornell Review, the campus's conservative publication of which I am Editor-in-Chief, was the first to break the story and has worked diligently all week gathering and reporting as much information as possible to bring the situation to national attention. I am scheduled to appear on Fox & Friends Sunday morning (tentatively 7:20 a.m. Eastern)[see update below] to discuss the student protests.
When the fee was first announced, the student body—conservative, liberal, and apolitical—united in a way it rarely does, directing collective indignation towards the administration for shoving more costs onto students and their families.
For the past five years, Cornell tuition has risen on average by over 4% per year, and this fee is yet another onerous cost to attending Cornell. Many students complained about having to pay the fee despite never having visited Gannet, the student health center; some say they never plan to visit Gannett because of alleged poor quality service and long wait times (though the University touts Gannett's high quality services ratings from outside groups).
The usual crowd of leftist students on campus quickly organized the #FighttheFee group to lead protests against the student health fee, and on Monday, Feb. 9, they occupied the campus's main administrative building for several hours.
Over 100 students sat in hallways, administrators' offices, and boardrooms, occasionally delivering speeches. A group of about 30 made it into Skorton's office, and a #FighttheFee member videoed the ensuing, extremely disrespectful 40-minute ordeal, during which the left-wing students accosted, laughed at, and taunted Skorton. Skorton, for the entire time, retained composure, but in a brief moment of irritation snapped back at students: “The fact you're pissed off doesn't change the bottom line of the University.”
(language warning)
We at The Cornell Review were quick to recognize the stark commonalities between the student health fee + SHIP arrangement here at Cornell and Obamacare on the national level.
As Obamacare dictates people must either buy health insurance or pay a tax, Cornell is now requiring students who do not purchase SHIP pay the health fee. Of course, there are distinctions between each case–namely, attending Cornell is optional whereas paying taxes is required.
Still, the underlying principle behind the fee implementation and Obamacare are the same: the redistribution of wealth in order to provide “for the common good,” as Skorton stated. Skorton also cited “inequitable access to care” as another reason why the fee was implemented, and pointed out that Ivy peer institutions all have similar health fees. The irony of the entire situation hit an all-time high when Gannett's director cited rising healthcare costs as another reason why the fee is needed.
Essentially, both the fee and Obamacare are redistributionist policies which seek to extract from some in order to subsidize others. In some ways, however, the Cornell student health fee is worse, because it's not only a redistribution of wealth, it is an administrative bailout to the tune of a cool $4 million. It's a double-whammy of liberal ill-logic and progressive policy.
During a Q&A with students held later in the week after the protests, University Vice President Susan Murphy divulged the true nature of the health fee: $150 was going to “expansion of health services,” $130 to paying for increased staffing, and $70 to paying a 2-year loan in excess of $4 million that University originally borrowed to pay for the increased staffing at the student health center. Those interested in reading more about the fee's finer details can read my report here.
What is rather unsurprising about the entire situation is that the leftist and liberal students in campus, who led the protests and are some of the most vocal in opposing the health fee, are acting in the same hypocritical fashion as they usually do.
These are the same students who almost surely all vote for Democrats and support redistributionist, big government policies, but when it comes to their own pocket books they are suddenly outraged. Clearly, only when redistribution of wealth negatively affects them is there a reason to protest and fight back, but when such policies are negatively affecting “the rich” or “the 1%” it's completely justified.
On Twitter, the #FightTheFee hastag was “hijacked” by conservatives:
#Cornell U. students learning first-hand how to hate government intrusion into personal decisions. #FightTheFee
http://t.co/c1okbuQhig — Alan Clemons (@BigAlFishes) February 14, 2015
You wanted universal healthcare for all, now you get to pay for it! Welcome to Obamacare. #FightTheFee — Maddest of Hatters (@SharkdogMike) February 14, 2015
#FightTheFee. This is exactly how Obamacare works any students supported that place. Different when you pay isn't it — Pete Oakley (@OakleyIII) February 14, 2015
Some of these leftist students argue the fee is a regressive tax, and it therefore redistributes wealth from the poorer students to the wealthier ones. True, all students without SHIP must pay the same $350 and $10 co-pays regardless of student or student family wealth status, but the health fee redistributes from those who do not seek any or a lot of care from Gannett to those who do. And even though no one wants to admit it, it is most likely the case a small minority of students make up a majority of the cases seen and treated at Gannet, as is the case on the national scale. Political correctness, however, forbids campus debate about this very crucial point, and it obscures from many how truly redistributionist in principle and in effect this fee is and will be.
All in all, this ordeal, still on-going, just goes to show how much of a bubble Cornell and most other college students live in. But what is truly disturbing is that when the bubble pops, they frantically try to patch it back together rather than face reality.

02:20 What You Need to Know About Flooding We take a look at what causes flooding.
At a Glance More than 950 deaths have been reported in monsoon floods in Nepal, India and Bangladesh.
Nearly 700 of those deaths have occurred in four northern India states.
Seasonal monsoon rains triggered devastating floods in South Asia, killing at least 950 people in recent weeks and impacting nearly 40 million across northern India, southern Nepal and northern Bangladesh, officials said Thursday.
The widespread flooding has occurred in a broad arc across the Himalayan foothills in those countries. The heavy rain led to landslides, damaged crops, roads and electric towers and destroyed tens of thousands of homes.
In northern India, the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Assam were hit hardest. At least 680 people died in those states, most from drowning, snake bites or landslides.
(MORE: Complete Coverage of Harvey )
South Asia's monsoon rains run from June to September.
Disaster management authorities in Bihar said the state's death toll of 367 could go up further as floodwaters recede and bodies are recovered from submerged houses.
Army soldiers and volunteers have evacuated around 770,000 people from inundated areas. Of these, some 425,000 were living in 1,360 relief camps set up in school and government buildings, said Avinash Kumar, a Bihar state official.
In neighboring Uttar Pradesh, the state government said around 2.3 million people in 25 districts have been affected by the floods when at least three major rivers overflowed their banks, entering fields and homes.
An Uttar Pradesh government spokesperson blamed the unprecedented flooding on the release of water from dams in upstream Nepal.
"Rains have been intense but the release of water from Nepal has aggravated the situation," said Manish Sharma.
Army troops have been helping to evacuate people marooned on rooftops or trees, while air force helicopters dropped packets of food, drinking water and medicines to those camping on higher ground, mostly along highways.
Meanwhile, the state administration was bracing for the threat of infections as floodwaters recede. Health workers have begun sending supplies of mosquito repellent, bleaching powder and water purification tablets to the worst-hit areas, said health official Badri Vishal.
In the eastern state of West Bengal, the top elected official, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, said 152 people had died and 15 million had been affected by floods in the past few weeks.
Another 71 people were killed in Assam as rivers breached their banks and entered low-lying villages. At the renowned Kaziranga National Park, officials said around 300 animals, including around two dozen rhinos and a Royal Bengal tiger, have been killed after floodwaters submerged nearly 80 percent of the wildlife park.
In neighboring Bangladesh, the death toll climbed to 132 while some 7.5 million people have been affected in this year's floods, according to the Disaster Management Ministry.
Crops on more than 24,710 acres of land have been washed away while another 1,482,600 acres have been damaged, posing a serious threat to food production, the ministry said Thursday.
The U.N. World Food Program said that Bangladesh was at risk of "devastating hunger" after major floods that destroyed crops, homes and livelihoods of people across many impoverished areas in a delta nation of 160 million people.
"Many flood survivors have lost everything: their homes, their possessions, their crops," Christa Rader, WFP's Bangladesh country director, said in a statement. "People need food right now, and the full impact on longer-term food security threatens to be devastating."
Nepal's Home Ministry spokesperson Ram Krishna Subedi said floodwaters were receding and rivers were returning to normal.
The death toll from the floods in Nepal stood at 146, with about 30 missing.
On the one hand, Hong Kong has courted mainland visitors for economic reasons, and has benefited enormously. About 28 million mainlanders came last year, up by two-thirds since 2008, and many of them to shop: sales of electronics, jewelry and other luxury goods in Hong Kong have soared. As recently as a few years ago, city officials saw mainland mothers-to-be as a revenue stream as well, and urged hospitals to accommodate them.
But the seven million residents of Hong Kong increasingly fear that mainlanders are challenging them for services, for property and to some extent for their cultural identity. Many suspect that wealthier mainlanders see Hong Kong as an escape option, for their children if not themselves, should confidence in China's future fade.
Mainland buyers accounted for nearly one-fifth of the value of Hong Kong residential apartments sold last year, and are one reason that prices are soaring. The number of schoolchildren commuting to Hong Kong schools from Shenzhen, a sprawling mainland urban area just north of the border, has tripled in five years.

“The issue is the capacity of the society to accept so many travelers,” said Ivan Choy, a senior instructor in public administration at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “The issue of the maternity beds has pushed it past the tipping point.”
Insults are flying. A shouting match erupted last month after one mainland mother allowed their child to eat noodles in a Hong Kong subway car. When a Peking University professor who saw a video of the incident called Hong Kongers “dogs” on an Internet talk show, furious Hong Kong residents demonstrated outside the Chinese government's liaison office. A liaison official later condemned the professor's remarks, which by official Chinese standards was an extraordinary apology.
Angry Hong Kongers have taken to calling mainland visitors “locusts.” After some residents bought a full-page newspaper advertisement showing a giant locust looming over Victoria Harbor and declaring that “Hong Kongers have had enough,” mainlanders responded with a mock advertisement urging China to cut off water and power supplies to the city.
Some scholars argue that the friction is essentially a family squabble among compatriots who are actually growing closer. Hong Kong residents “are becoming more, not less, ‘Chinese,' ” said Michael DeGolyer, director of the Hong Kong Transition Project, a research group that tracks political trends.

Few Hong Kongers pledge loyalty to China's Communist Party, Mr. DeGolyer said. A solid majority want to preserve Hong Kong's pluralistic, international character. Still, they said, most now support a requirement that schoolchildren sing China's national anthem and raise the Chinese flag daily.
“From a variety of indicators, we see that attachment to China has strengthened,” Mr. DeGolyer said.

But others sense a widening divide. Since 2007, more Hong Kong residents have identified themselves primarily as Hong Kong citizens than primarily as Chinese citizens, according to surveys by the University of Hong Kong's Public Opinion Program, except in 2008, when China was host to the Olympic games.
Hospitals are a major battleground, partly because Hong Kong's are so much better. Maternal mortality is 15 times higher on the mainland than in Hong Kong. Infant mortality is 13 times higher.
One morning this month, the maternity floor of Precious Blood Hospital, a private institution in an older Hong Kong neighborhood, bustled with pregnant mainland women, their relatives and the agents they had hired to arrange care and obtain visas. One agent juggled three cellphones and a notebook on their lap, desperately trying to secure a bed for a mainlander who was due to give birth in September.

“If I can afford the medical costs of my wife giving birth in Hong Kong, why not?” asked a 38-year-old building designer from Shenzhen who would give only their surname, Yue. They said they paid about 80,000 Hong Kong dollars (more than $10,000) so that their first child, a boy, would be born in the city.
Resentment from Hong Kongers did not faze him. “If mainland tourists didn't come here,” they said quietly, “the economy would collapse.”
Hong Kong residency for their son was not a deciding factor, they said, because they suspect the city will be progressively integrated with the mainland. “Maybe in 20 years, it will not mean anything,” they said.
Another father-to-be seemed mostly to want a residency card for their baby. They and their newly pregnant wife traveled nearly 1,000 miles from Wuxi to inspect Precious Blood. “One of my friends is going to England to give birth,” they said. “If you give birth on the plane and the plane are in U.K. airspace, you have U.K. citizenship.”

Maggie Wong, 31, an office clerk and lifelong Hong Kong resident who had twins eight months ago, said they felt pushed aside by mainland couples. Three and a half months into their pregnancy, Ms. Wong said, they tried to schedule delivery at the public hospital near their home, “but they said there were so many mainland mothers that the beds were all full.” So they went to a private hospital, though it meant spending their husband's life savings and borrowing from their parents.
“I am a citizen of Hong Kong. I pay Hong Kong taxes,” they said. “I kept thinking, ‘What is this? How can this be?' Of course it creates bad feelings.”
Hong Kong has lowered quotas for mainlander births again this year, and has tightened its border checks in hopes of preventing last-minute cross-border runs to hospitals. Of the 35,736 mainland women who gave birth in Hong Kong last year, 1,656 simply showed up in emergency rooms.
Tensions may grow. It is the year of the dragon, considered one of the luckiest. If tradition holds, the birth rate will spike. Private Hong Kong hospitals are said to be booked into October.
“I want a dragon baby!” Lui Dikming, a freelance artist, yelled during a demonstration outside a government building this month. “But even if you book when you are five weeks pregnant, there is no room.”
Nick Marshall BCS Championship

AUBURN, Alabama -- Nick Marshall can see the NFL in their future.
The Auburn quarterback wants to make a name for themselves during their senior season, and coaches want to see noticeable improvement -- up to 65 to 70 percent in pass completions -- in 2014.
If they do that, trims their mistakes and continues to churn out the yards with their feet, coaches believe Marshall can achieve their professional dream as well.
"Oh, I think without question," Auburn offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee said. "I mean, everybody says it, because he's talented enough to do a lot of things at the next level, but I don't think there's any doubt in my mind or their mind that -- first of all, he's worried about being the quarterback at Auburn -- if they mature and develops the way he's capable of, I don't see any reason why they wouldn't be a quarterback."
Marshall completed 59.4 percent of their passes for 1,976 yards and 14 touchdowns with six interceptions during their first season as the Tigers' starter. They also rushed for 1,068 yards and 12 touchdowns.
Marshall may get a shot in the NFL, but it remains to be seen if it's at quarterback. "I like my chances playing quarterback in the NFL," Marshall said in January.
"He's got a really live arm, he's got good arm talent," Lashlee said.
RELATED: Coaches want Marshall to join elite company
Marshall moved from quarterback to cornerback at Georgia during their first-year student season before they were booted from the team. They moved back to quarterback on the junior college level before transferring to Auburn in 2013, where they led four, fourth-quarter comebacks and took the Tigers to the BCS National Championship.
If Marshall does not pan out as a quarterback in the NFL, they could get a look at another position such as at cornerback.
Marshall is already carrying the label as a great zone-read quarterback with a big arm and inconsistent accuracy. They improved throughout the 2013 season, completing nearly 63 percent of their passes in the final seven games of their junior year.
What will people be saying about Marshall after their senior season?
"I'll let them be the judge," Marshall said Saturday. "I'm just going to do what the coaches ask me to do. I know I'll be completing more passes this year."

Madrid ha tancat l'espai aeri de Barcelona per a vols d'helicòpters i avionetes entre aquest divendres a les 00:01h de la matinada i el proper dilluns 1 d'octubre a les 23.59, és a dir, fins dimarts, de manera que només estaran autoritzats els vols d'aquests aparells VFR en cas d'una emergència. I també tindran permís, lògicament, "els cossos i forces de seguretat de l'Estat". Així ho han confirmat fonts d'Aviació Civil a El Món, que afegeixen que es tracta d'una petició que ha fet la delegació del govern espanyol a Catalunya, encapçalada per Enric Millo. Fonts del centre de control d'operacions de l'aeròdrom de Sabadell també han confirmat al Món la restricció. Aquesta restricció implica que cap helicòpter o avioneta comercial podrà sobrevolar la ciutat en un radi de 5 milles des de la Sagrada Família, bloquejant, per tant, la possibilitat que es puguin prendre imatges aèries de possibles mobilitzacions massives que es puguin produir l'1-O, com tampoc de la plaça de Catalunya, quarter general de l'independentisme aquest diumenge. Pel que fa a l'operativa de vols comercials a l'Aeroport de Barcelona, no hi ha restriccions.
| El Món
Les empreses dedicades als vols d'helicòpters i avionetes VFR de fins a 3000ft van rebre ahir al vespre la Notam (informació per a aviadors) en què se'ls informava de la restricció en un radi de 5 milles, sense donar cap explicació de la raó per la qual es produïa. L'executiu espanyol és conscient que el dia 1 d'octubre, si tal i com assegura Madrid i les policies espanyols, no es permet la votació perquè els col·legis estaran precintants, és molt probable que es produeixi una mobilització massiva al carrer durant tot el dia, una imatge de gran potència a nivell mundial que l'Estat vol evitar al preu que sigui.
| Europa Press
Fonts d'Aviació Civil (ministeri de Foment) han explicat a El Món que aquesta mesura ja s'ha dut a terme en altres ocasions a Barcelona, però la diferència és que "s'havia fet a petició dels Mossos d'Esquadra per raons de seguretat vinculades a esdeveniments esportius o manifestacions", com la Lliga de Campions del 2016, les Diades del 2014 i el 2016 o curses al circuit de Montmeló. En aquest cas, però, no hi ha convocada cap manifestació de força oficial, i durant les manifestacions de la Diada, l'ANC va poder gravar imatges àeries. En aquest cas la "Notam" és clara: Només podran entrar en aquest espai per una emergència.
House Republicans scramble for votes to pass draconian health care bill
By Barry Grey and Kate Randall
3 May 2017
The Trump White House and Republican leaders in the House of Representatives are scrambling to come up with the 216 Republican votes needed to pass a revised version of the administration's bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.
The amended version of the Trump administration's American Health Care Act would impose an even more savage attack on health care for millions of people—and more of a windfall for the insurance companies and big business—than the original version, which was aborted in March as a result of opposition from the extreme right-wing Republican Freedom Caucus, which deemed it too generous.
Both versions of the Republican measure build on right-wing, pro-corporate features of the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act, but go even further in cutting health care costs for big business and the government while reducing benefits and increasing out-of-pocket costs for millions of working people.
Last week, the House leadership introduced an amendment complying with the basic demands of the Freedom Caucus, some three dozen House members, to gut the original bill's provisions requiring insurance firms to cover people with preexisting conditions without raising their premiums and include in all policies they sell a set of essential benefits. During their election campaign and after taking office, President Donald Trump had promised to retain these provisions of Obamacare.
While securing on this basis the support of the Freedom Caucus, the administration has added to the ranks of so-called moderate Republicans who are opposing the broadly unpopular bill, largely out of fear of the electoral repercussions of voting for it. In a recent NBC News poll, half of respondents said they had “little or no” confidence that the bill would make their health care better, up from 34 percent in February.
With all 193 House Democrats expected to vote against the measure, the Republicans can afford no more than 22 defections, but as of Tuesday, various media outlets were reporting 21 Republicans already in the “no” column and as many as 24 others still undecided. White House officials had been pressing for a vote on the House floor as early as Wednesday, and both Vice President Mike Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price have been meeting with Republican House members in the Capitol to secure the needed votes.
As of this writing, however, no vote had been scheduled. This is despite a closed-door meeting Tuesday morning at which Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan addressed the entire House Republican caucus to shift members currently opposed or undecided. At a press briefing following the meeting, Ryan and other leading Republican House members shamelessly lied about the health care bill, claiming it did not weaken the guarantee against insurance companies discriminating against individuals with preexisting medical conditions.
They were following in the footsteps of Trump, who said in a Sunday interview on CBS News' “Face the Nation” program, “Preexisting conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it.”
Two major defections prompted by the amendment gutting protections for people with preexisting conditions underscored the shaky prospects for the bill's passage. On Monday, longtime Trump supporter Rep. Billy Long of Missouri came out in opposition. On Tuesday, Fred Upton of Michigan, until recently the chairperson of the Energy and Commerce Committee and author of many previous Republican bills to repeal Obamacare, told a radio station in Holland, Michigan that they would vote against the current measure. They said the new amendment “torpedoes” the previous provisions on preexisting conditions.
The amendment undermines Obamacare provisions on preexisting conditions and essential benefits by allowing states to apply for waivers to opt out of these requirements. States could let insurers charge older customers more than the original bill allowed—at least five times more than younger ones, beginning in 2018. They could also allow insurers to charge higher premiums for people with preexisting conditions who have had a gap in coverage of at least 63 days in the prior year.
States that opted out would be required to establish “high-risk pools” and similar programs that would supposedly provide insurance to people with serious conditions unable to obtain it in the private market. However, the bill calls for the federal government to allocate only $13 billion a year for such programs, enough to insure only a small fraction of the people who would lose coverage.
States would also be allowed to opt out of the Affordable Care Act's essential health benefits clause, which requires insurers to cover a set of key benefits including hospitalization, prescription drugs, maternity care, emergency room visits, mental health and substance abuse treatment, lab tests, screenings and vaccines, pediatric services, and treatment for chronic conditions.
Last March, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the earlier version of Trumpcare would strip 14 million people of health coverage next year and a total of 24 million by 2026. It would cut health care spending on net by $1.15 trillion and slash Obamacare taxes for the wealthy and for health corporations by $999 billion.
The CBO estimated that the March version of the bill would cut $880 billion from Medicaid alone over the course of the next decade. The current version retains all the antisocial and regressive provisions of the earlier bill, and adds to them.
It effectively dismantles Medicaid, the government health program for the poor, currently covering some 74 million Americans, ending its status as an entitlement program. It terminates, beginning in 2020, expanded federal funding for Medicaid carried out under Obamacare. Instead of guarantees of benefits for all eligible recipients, the American Health Care Act would send the states a fixed amount of money per enrollee, referred to as a per-capita cap.
States could also opt to receive federal Medicaid funding in a block grant for adults and children in the program, where they would receive a specific amount of money, regardless of the number of enrollees.
States could also seek approval for imposing work requirements for Medicaid recipients and charging them copays and other fees.
Taken as a whole, these changes would end Medicaid as a guaranteed social insurance program based on need, creating conditions where millions of beneficiaries would be ejected from the rolls or have their benefits sharply reduced.
The bill also repeals Obamacare subsidies to help low- and middle-income people pay for coverage purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces from private insurers. Subsidies would be replaced with annual tax credits based on age, not income, but with credits phased out for those at higher incomes.
It would repeal, effective in 2020, cost-sharing subsidies to insurance firms to lower deductibles and copays currently available to individuals earning less than $30,000 a year to help pay for out-of-pocket medical costs.
It would abolish the requirement that companies with at least 50 employees provide insurance for their workers.
It is a virtual certainty that most of the reactionary provisions of Trumpcare, including the de facto termination of Medicaid as an entitlement program, will eventually be enacted. The Democrats have reacted to the Republicans' difficulties in passing their bill by offering to collaborate in working out a “compromise” to further slash costs for corporations and the government at the expense of the general population.

Sarah Silverman is no stranger to rape jokes or the accompanying controversy. Photo: Andrew Toth
Ordinarily, if Sarah Silverman wants to annoy great swathes of the internet, they tend to do so from behind the microphone while on stage. This week, on the other hand, all they had to do was repost an anti-rape meme on Twitter.
The comedian posted a list of "Ten Rape Prevention Tips", based on a blog post from 2011 (which also appeared in a Rape Crisis Scotland campaign), imploring friends and followers to share it with men:
These are great- send to all the men in ur life RT @texpatriate 10 Rape Prevention Tips. @lizzwinstead pic.twitter.com/IPfWsaz9zz — Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) March 21, 2015
It is, for anyone who has been asleep for half a decade, a riff on the type of "how to avoid rape" tips that are regularly foisted upon women, where the onus is placed upon the potential victim, not the prospective offender (a mindset that surely played a part in Victoria Police's misguided advice to women in the wake of the murder of Melbourne teen Masa Vukotic).

With depressing predictability, the #NotAllMen brigade were soon out in force, accusing Silverman of gross misandry and of tarring all Good Men with the same "potential rapist" brush.
@SarahKSilverman @texpatriate @lizzwinstead rather harsh on those of us who, you know, wouldn't dream of hurting anyone.... — Paul Jukes (@StumpsMonkey) March 21, 2015
@SarahKSilverman jesus christ wtf is this. not everybody out here rapes bitches wats wrong with you — FTWEBK666 (@dezzyboe) March 21, 2015
(There are plenty of other responses like these two examples if you feel like a little IQ-reducing reading on your lunch break.)
As a woman living in the US, Silverman was right to post the list; a national government survey conducted in 2011 found that nearly 1 in 5 American women had experienced rape or attempted rape (that's around 1.3 million women yearly).
What the response to Silverman's tweet indicates is the vastly different ways that many men will respond to the notion that it's not women's responsibility to prevent rape - or, for that matter, any commentary about rape. The rapid-fire "yeah but not all men do this" response to any piece about rape or rape prevention that is written by a woman is proof of this. Have a man write a similar piece, and there will be much virtual nodding and chin-stroking.
Bring comedy into it and things become even more fractious. Silverman is no stranger to rape jokes or the accompanying controversy. Late last year they were widely chastised for tweeting a rape joke about Bill Cosby, eventually modifying the gag to a less-graphic incarnation: "Bill Cosby gave me one of those 'don't be dirty' lectures but I was rendered unconscious."
In their Emmy-winning special, We Are Miracles, Silverman riffs on rape jokes: "Rape, obviously, the most heinous crime imaginable. Rape jokes are great. No, because they make a comic seem so edgy and so dangerous. And the truth is, it's like the safest area to talk about in comedy. Because who's gonna complain about a rape joke? I mean, I would say rape victims, but they're traditionally not complainers." It's dark stuff.
This is nothing new; way back in 2005, Silverman's appearance in the so-so documentary The Aristocrats caused shockwaves. "The Aristocrats", for those who don't know, is a showbiz in-joke that is meant to push the boundaries of good taste (always finishing with the exchange "What's the name of the act?" "The Aristocrats!"); Silverman ended theirs by staring down-barrel and claiming that veteran entertainer Joe Franklin had raped them The irony in the outraged response was, as Sam Anderson wrote at the time, that "Silverman was the only comic in the film who met the challenge of the joke: They pushed it too far."
The response to Louis C.K's rape jokes has, by comparison, been one of almost universal acclaim. Of C.K.'s "I'm not condoning rape" bit, Lindy West wrote, "Louis CK has spent 20 years making it very publicly clear that they are on the side of making things better. The oppressors never win at the end of their jokes. That's why it's easy to give them the benefit of the doubt that this joke is making fun of rapists."
It is, but much like Silverman's Miracles bit, a good deal of the joke spins on the idea of how rape victims exist in the world: the sting in Silverman's is that the punchline about rape victims not being "complainers" directly references low rates of rape reporting (and, thus, conviction); in C.K's, the gag is that Hitler's quest for world domination would have failed if C.K. had raped them because victims' lives fall apart.
Through all and any debate about rape jokes (can they be made? Are they funny? Who can make them??), I always think about Patricia Lockwood's masterful 2013 poem, Rape Joke ("The rape joke is you went home like nothing happened, and laughed about it the next day and the day after that, and when you told people you laughed, and that was the rape joke."), which everyone - comedian or otherwise - should read.
As is the case with any comedy about difficult subjects, if written and delivered with wit and sensitivity (and I mean sensitivity to the subject matter, not "sensitivity" as in "non-threatening clean comedy"), rape jokes can be hilarious; they can also be important. When Tina Fey and Amy Poehler set Bill Cosby in their sights at this year's Golden Globes, the response was mixed. But as Time's Sarah Miller wrote, "There is always a risk of a joke offending someone, but politeness in the face of cruelty, well, there's nothing more offensive than that."
I'm thrilled there are men who learned something from "Sarah Silverman's rape tips for men" (like the Twitter user who was stunned and then chastened to discover that women constantly think about the threat of sexual violence). The #NotAllMen snowflakes who were offended by it are the real joke.
U.S. military officials wanted to have an armed drone supporting the team ambushed in Niger earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, but their request was denied by Washington. Unnamed sources told the Journal the rejection came via "a chain of approval that snakes through the Pentagon, State Department, and the Nigerien government," and the decision raises "questions about whether those forces had adequate protection against the dangers of their mission."
Meanwhile, an ABC News story also published Friday night offered new details of how the attack played out. The group of American and Nigerien troops who were ambushed were in a convoy of about seven armed and unarmed vehicles when they were attacked by more than 50 ISIS-linked fighters, ABC reports.
The soldiers at one point split up to retrieve an unarmed Land Rover which held three of the four Americans who were killed in the fight. Sgt. La David Johnson, the fourth soldier killed, gave machine gun cover to the troops who turned back for the Land Rover before they were separated from the rest, possibly after falling out of a pick-up truck.

Fights landing and taking off at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport were canceled early Friday while a major power outage hit the Dutch capital, an airport spokesperson told NBC News.
Power was restored after around 90 minutes but incoming flights were still being diverted elsewhere as of around 11:30 a.m. local time (6 a.m. ET), spokesperson Danielle Timmer said. All departures were grounded after the blackout hit at 9:15 local time (4:15 a.m. ET), but Timmer said flights had started to leave the airport after the power came back.
"We are just trying to get business back to normal again and that may take a little while," they said.
Earlier, passengers posted images to social media showing parts of the airport in total darkness. Timmer told NBC News that during the blackout the airport was able to power some lights and other electronics using a generator, but that was not enough to allow planes to land or take off.
Despite power being restored at the airport and other parts of the country, large parts of North Holland province, with its population of more than 2.5 million, were still in the dark, according to the Netherlands' state-owned power company TenneT.
TenneT spokesperson Ulrike Hörchens said the outage had originated at a substation in Diemen, a town within the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area. "We have people at the site but we do not know exactly what caused this, we are still looking into it," they said. The national railroad service said no trains were running in and around Amsterdam, according to The Associated Press.

Story highlights The letter is found hidden inside the ceiling of an old house
It was written in 1945 by a woman whose husband was serving overseas
(CNN) Allen Cook and their daughter Melissa were renovating their house in Westfield, New Jersey, this week when they found a crack in one of the ceilings. What they discovered within turned out to be part of a beautiful, heartwarming love story.
"The envelope was old and yellow. It has never been opened. It was unbelievable when my son-in-law started reading it. In the letter they were talking about the baby they were going to have," Allen Cook told CNN.
The story -- which could be straight out of a great movie plot about love and its mysterious ways -- begins in 1945.
Dated May 4 of that year, the typed letter was written by a woman named Virginia to their husband, Rolf Christoffersen. At the time, they were a sailor in the Norwegian navy.
The envelope was marked "return to sender" and never found its way to their husband -- until this week. Allen's daughter used the Internet to find the phone number of someone named Rolf Christoffersen and gave them a call, leading them to their son in Santa Barbara, California.

Sperm's egg-seeking secrets revealed
Updated
Sperm may be fast and hard to pin down, but scientists have uncovered the mechanism behind how these cells zero in on an egg and fertilise it.
The discovery could lead to the development of non-hormone based contraceptives for men and women that do not have side-effects.
For more than two decades scientists have known that the sex hormone progesterone, released from ovulated eggs, stimulates the flow of calcium ions (Ca2++) in sperm.
This reaction helps sperm identify and swim toward the egg, as well as break through the egg's protective covering to fertilise it.
But scientists were unsure about how progesterone did it.
According to two studies published in this week's issue of Nature, progesterone activates a calcium ion channel, known as CatSper, which is found in the sperm's tail or flagellum.
Researchers from the University of California San Francisco studied sperm cells using a technique they pioneered called sperm patch-clamp technique.
The sperm is pinned down between the head and the tail, where the cell membrane is softer, using a glass pipette.
A small hole is punctuated through the membrane and the material inside the cell is replaced by a solution.
Calcium ions were then "passed through" the CatSper channel to create an electrophysiological fingerprint.
"By studying the CatSper channel electophysically in isolation from all other ion channels or transporters, we were able to prove that the CatSper channel is activated by progesterone and is the long-sought elusive progesterone receptor of human sperm," said the study's lead author Dr Polina Lishko.
In the second study appearing in Nature, German researchers observed sperm loaded with calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye to detect the presence of calcium ions, in addition to the patch-clamp technique, and reached a similar conclusion.
"Although we don't know the exact binding site for progesterone, we can conclude that progesterone binds to the CatSper channel itself or to a directly associated protein," said lead author Dr Strünker, of the Centre of Advanced European Studies and Research in Bonn.
Impact on fertility
The research findings are hugely significant, says Dr Lishko, because mutations of the CatSper channel, are known to cause complete male infertility.
"Without it [the CatSper channel] sperm cannot penetrate the protective vestments of the ovulated egg and cannot fertilise it," they said.
Dr Lishko says that because the CatSper channel is found nowhere else in the body except sperm it offers the potential to develop specifically targeted contraceptives.
Unlike traditional hormone-based contraceptives, which target the progesterone receptors in all the body's cells causing side effects such as weight gain, abdominal cramps and mood swings, the binding site for progesterone on the CatSper channel is unique.
"Therefore potential development of unisex contraceptives which target a molecule unique for the sperm ... is possible," Dr Lishko said.
"Such a contraceptive should have minimal side effects, because it will target the molecule not present in the female body, only in the male body, and only on sperm."
Professor John Aitken, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence in Biotechnology and Development, says both papers are an important finding in the field of reproductive cell biology.
"People have tried for many years to understand the nature of the receptor for progesterone. Several people have published papers saying that they have identified said molecule, but none of those identifications have really stood the test of time," they said.
"So these two papers are certainly a milestone in the field."

I will vote for anyone who'll get our country's passenger railway system on track.
I am exaggerating only slightly.
However, it's no exaggeration to say that I am convinced that a modern, national railway system would be our country's salvation; the solution for our current financial disaster. Any candidate of any party who could guarantee its construction would seriously turn my head.
A high-speed passenger railway system seems like such an obviously good idea for the United States on so many levels for so many reasons that I just don't understand what there is to debate. It's like debating whether electricity can or cannot power a lightbulb.
What's not to love about a modern passenger train system?
My love affair with trains goes back to that July day so long ago when my mother, three younger sisters and I rode a train from Canada to Redding. I now marvel at how my mother managed to get herself, four daughters - ages 5, 5, 4 and 2 - and all our stuff off the train. Well, almost all our stuff. In the rush, I accidentally left behind my miniature china tea set, a gift from my mother for the trip. I can practically see it sitting on the window ledge where I left it on our sleeper car. I'm pretty much over it. Almost.
As an adult, the few times I've traveled to Europe I've fallen in love with passenger trains all over again. I love the passing scenery. I love not having to fight traffic. I love the little carts with coffee and snacks. I love the dining cars. I love being able to read or talk or doze on a train. I love the civility of train travel. I love the sway and sound of trains. I just love everything about them.
If you're lucky enough to have traveled to other developed countries, you know what I'm talking about. And aside from all the things I just mentioned that I adore about trains, it's noteworthy that modern passenger rail transportation is faster, cleaner, more efficient, and, with few rare exceptions, safer than vehicular travel.
So what's the hold up? Why can't we have high-speed rail transportation in the United States? Why have other developed countries embraced high-speed rail, but the U.S. has not? Why can't we have high-speed rail travel throughout the entire U.S., and not just in the urban areas, like Portland or New York?
These are not rhetorical questions.
Our country is so backward when it comes to high-speed rail that it boggles my mind. More frequently lately I hear the updates and debates about a U.S. rail system, and things aren't looking very promising. I find myself screaming at the radio when such lame objections are raised as: 1. Ridership is low, and 2. Americans don't use the existing rail systems. Ergo, Americans must not want high-speed rail, right?
Wrong, wrong, wrong.
Of course we haven't embraced the existing U.S. rail systems. Why would we? They suck! Current U.S. passenger rail systems are expensive, unreliable and have too few routes to make travel upon them workable or affordable. Case in point, here in Redding our sole passenger train blows through here in the wee hours of the morning ... but it could be hours late ... at an aging, locked station that doubles as a homeless hangout.
Give us a passenger railway system with dependable schedules, myriad route options and decent fares and you'd find trains packed with passengers, and automobiles parked in garages, covered in cobwebs.
Why can't our country's leaders see this? Surely they've traveled to developed nations and ridden trains.
Can't they see how high-speed rail would boost the economy by providing jobs related to railways' construction, maintenance and staffing? Don't they realize that unemployment would drop when people used high-speed rail to travel outside their rural bergs for work, and return them home in time for dinner? Haven't they figured out how high-speed rail could create employment match-making solutions all over the county?
Take Shasta County, for example, and our double-digit unemployment rate. If our citizens had access to a modern railway system, workers could hop on a train and ride to work in nearby cities with more job opportunities. Likewise, trains could bring workers here from other places, too, to fill the demand of companies that lack a qualified workforce. Plus, with access to that more qualified workforce, companies would have one less excuse to not set up shop here.
A modern passenger railway system would mean we'd have less reliance on cars, which would mean less reliance upon oil, which would mean a happier planet, too. (Maybe fewer wars, too.)
A modern passenger railway system would lure aging drivers (read: baby boomers) off freeways and highways, which would be safer and less stressful for everyone.
Our country's commitment to a state-of-the-art passenger railway system would mean jobs galore at a time when so many people are barely hanging on financially, especially in places like the north state, where it feels more like a depression than a recession. Recovery? What recovery? Listen to how the word recovery sounds as it echos inside the scores of empty buildings that held former businesses. Say the word recovery in places like the Cypress Square Shopping Center in Redding, where it seems that more than half the spaces are vacant. One day a business is there, the next day it's not; sometimes gone without so much as a note or forwarding address stuck to the door.
But wait, there's more. A modern passenger railway system wouldn't just directly help U.S. citizens, but it would be good for foreign visitors, enticed by the convenience and accessibility of high-speed rail to venture to more places in this great land - places beyond our more sophisticated train-savvy cities.
Indulge me as I veer off track slightly to a side rant for a moment, but bear with me. It's related. Italy enjoys a fair amount of success with agritourism, where tourists (many Americans, I might add) ride trains that deposit them in beautiful regions, oh, like Tuscany, where tourists then rent tiny cars for scenic drives on rural roads to reach farms and cheese-makers and olive-oil producers and vineyards and the like, sometimes actually staying at those locations, and working. Oh, the wonder. How quaint.
Helllloooo. Our north state is blessed with a Mediterranean climate, too. Consequently, we are also blessed with cheese-makers and wine-makers and vineyards and organic farmers and grass-fed beef ranchers (howdy, Prather Ranch) and apiaries and orchards. The north state could absolutely be an agritourism destination, too, if only foreign visitors could reach us without having to burn rubber up and down I-5 at distances that would equal half-a-dozen European cities.
Sure, we Americans with our dysfunctional car addictions are accustomed to wasting precious gasoline to drive from county to county and state to reach our destinations. Why? Because we had to - have to. But that's outside the comfort zone of travelers from more well-developed countries where high-speed rail transportation is as common as say, universal health care (sorry, I couldn't help it).
More foreign visitors would mean more money pumped into more communities throughout the U.S., not just the urban, popular cities that already enjoy successful rail transportation.
Granted, I am rather train-biased. So consider that the non-partisan American Public Transportation Association, an organization that advocates for public transit improvement, estimates that for every dollar invested in public transportation, four additional dollars are generated in economic returns. Plus, the APTA recently reported that in major urban areas that have railway transportation, the average passengers save nearly $10,000 a year by using public transportation and ditching cars.
President Obama has tried to make railway transportation a priority, but they didn't have much support earlier this year when they called for a six-year high-speed rail plan that would begin with $8 billion, and eventually reach $53-billion. They and their administration believe that a high-speed rail plan would create jobs and boost American competitiveness in the long run. I agree.
Yes, high-speed rail would be expensive, but it won't cost less late. (Maybe we could pretend we need to fund a war, but build a railway system with the money instead.)
Why oh why is a high-speed passenger railway such a hard sell? Why can't all our leaders - no matter their parties - see that when it comes to railway transportation, the United States is limping along like a second-rate, Third World country? Come on, it's embarrassing.
Can you imagine how cool it would be to board a train in Redding and be in San Francisco or Sacramento or Portland for the day? Can you imagine how wonderful it would be to have easier, faster access to loved ones who live in far-flung places?
Our country's politicians and leaders claim they want to boost the economy and help millions of Americans who've lost jobs, homes, retirements, health care and hope. Really? Here's a suggestion: Forget small-potato stimulus programs, mini-tax breaks and fleeting rebates that have virtually zero tangible financial benefit (at last report, something like a pathetic 1 percent). Those things, though perhaps well-intentioned, haven't sent so much as a ripple of relief to middle America's tidal wave of money troubles.
I'm tired of feeling jealous of countries that have high-speed rail. I'm sick of wishing for something that isn't that out of the question (we can put a man on the moon...).
If I'm going to wish and hope and imagine, I want to wish and hope and imagine a forward-thinking presidential candidate with the brains, bravery and balls to not just stand up and declare a commitment to passenger rail transportation, but someone willing to reach across the aisle and move heaven and dirt to make it happen.
Such a project would set our country on a competitive track toward a 21st-century transportation system. Its creation would produce an unprecedented national works feat that could turn this country around financially at a time when we need it most.
Our country is in dire need. We need something fantastically epic, something drastic, a King-Kong lifesaver of a plan to help our economy. We need something we don't already have. We need to do something we haven't already done. The solution is a massive undertaking: the construction of a nationwide, modern high-speed rail system.
It's a simple train of thought, but so wonderfully loaded with the most spectacular of possibilities: A made-in-America - just for America - high-speed railway project.
And if we could successfully pull it off, the sheer magnitude of it would make The New Deal look like no big deal.

Many things are curious.
Curious George, for example, the monkey who was curious and named George. Also, it is curious that Phil Collins has not yet been blasted into space for their crimes against music, humanity, puppies and music.
Another thing that is curious, and by thing I mean person, is Lukasz Podolski. There has been much, rather pointless, speculation about their future in recent weeks. In fact, The Telegraph ran with a story which said ‘Arsenal frustrated as Podolski set to see season out at Cologne'.
OF COURSE They Are SET TO SEE OUT THE SEASON, THE TRANSFER WINDOW IS CLOSED, YOU FLANGEBRACKETED TWATS.
Ahem. Anyway, Arsenal's BFG, Per Mertesacker, has revealed some digital discourse between themselves and their German colleague. It seems Podolski wants to find out more.
“He has been very interested in the past few weeks, and has sent me a number of text messages,” Mertesacker told Sky. “I've told them that this is a great place to work and that Arsenal is an amazing club.
“Nothing has been agreed on yet though, and Lukas hasn't given me a ring yet. That will all happen in tranquility.”
See, nothing fazes the BFG, que sera, sera as they say in Lower Saxony. And Arsene Wenger was asked last night about this swapping of texts between the players, a journalist perhaps fishing for a juicy tapping up story.
Wenger laughed and said, “I cannot stop Mr Mertesacker sending SMSs.  They are free to send SMSs to Mr Podolski.”
Leaving Mr Mertesacker in tranquility to do what they like. I hope they also send sinister, threatening SMSs from a pay as you go phone to the Sunderland groundskeeper, but that might be just me.
Looking for a smaller event that trades a long list of attending breweries for some wildly creative one-off beers made by the very people serving them to you? Eagle Rock Brewery's annual celebration of the flavorful, yet low-alcohol brews is where you want to be on Sunday. The whole ERB team from the brewery, tasting room and the new Public House restaurant all brewed small-batch beers that are under 4.5% alcohol, and $15 gets you admission and three half-pints from the dozen available beers. In previous years, the offerings haveincluded takes on traditional Polish smoked beers, drinkable small stouts, English-inspired bitters and some wild concoctions that you probably won't ever get to taste again. The event celebrates the creativity of craft brewing, and there's no telling what will get tapped this year.

La Liga champions Real are said to have offered £6million for the Brazilian defender, as Blues boss Roberto Di Matteo prepares their next move.
The 30-year-old has less than a year left on their San Siro contract and is reported to have been offered a three-year deal worth £3.5million, according to Sport Mediaset.
Chelsea have made signing a new right-back a key priority this summer after veteran defender Paulo Ferreira was placed on the transfer list and compatriot Jose Bosingwa was released at the end of their contract.
But the Blues have grown frustrated in their quest, having been rebuffed in moves for Dortmund star Lukasz Piszczek, Ajax's Gregory van der Wiel, Lille's Mathieu Debuchy and Manchester United youngster Rafael da Silva.
Inter are looking to revitalise their ageing squad, having already got rid of Lucio and Diego Forlan, and encouraged interest in Julio Cesar and Dejan Stankovic.
Story highlights Iraq denies Syrian planes attacked border towns
Local official says warplanes hit markets and fuel stations
U.S. official says Iran is flying surveillance drones over Iraq
Prime Minister slams Sunnis and the call for a salvation government
Reports that Syrian warplanes carried out a cross-border attack on Iraqi towns this week is further evidence of the blurring between the two countries' borders as they face an offensive by Islamic extremists.
At least 57 Iraqi civilians were killed and more than 120 others were wounded by what local officials say were Syrian warplanes that struck several border areas of Anbar province Tuesday.
These border cities are among those under the control of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, which seeks to create an Islamic caliphate that encompasses portions of Iraq in Syria.
Reports of the Syrian incursion into Iraq is a reminder that the civil war in Syria and the unrest in Iraq are not isolated, but linked in ways that threaten the security of both.
Sabah Karkhout, head of Iraq's Anbar provincial council, told CNN that Tuesday's air attacks struck markets and fuel stations in areas such as Rutba, al-Walid and Al-Qaim.

"Unfortunately, (the) Syrian regime carried out barbarian attacks against civilians in Anbar province," they said Wednesday.
Karkhout said they were certain the warplanes were Syrian because they bore the image of the Syrian flag.
"Also, the planes flew directly from Syrian airspace and went back to Syria," they said.
Local officials said residents used scopes and other equipment to see details on the warplanes.
Iraq's military spokesperson, Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, denied reports that Syrian warplanes struck inside Iraq's border towns.
"We know our airspace. We have not recorded or registered infiltration of our airspace from foreign jets, and all the warplanes and helicopters flying over Iraq airspace are Iraqis," they told CNN.
The head of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, told reporters Wednesday that the warplanes that bombed the Iraqi cities were not Iraqi jets, but they did not have information beyond that.
Syrian state media called the reports of a cross-border incursion "completely baseless" allegations made by "malicious media outlets," citing a "Syrian media source."
CNN is seeking a response from the Syrian government in Damascus.
Iraq's border region has been targeted by Syria in the past -- as the Syrian conflict escalated in 2012, there was at least one instance where rockets fired from Syria landed in Al-Qaim.
Iraq's Foreign Ministry said at the time that it was ready to respond in the event of additional attacks from Syria, but the Iraqi government was noticeably quiet after Tuesday's incursion.
The claims come as Iraqi forces continue fighting radical Sunni militants from ISIS.
Inside Syria, the government, for the most part, appears to have avoided directly targeting ISIS, even though the group's positions are well known. Only in the last week did the Syrian regime intensify strikes on Raqqa, a city in Syria's interior that is considered ISIS's headquarters.
Warplanes carried out seven raids on Raqqa on Wednesday, killing at least 12 people, including a woman and child, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

Whether the strikes signify a concerted effort by Syria to intensify its fight against ISIS is yet to be seen. It is also unclear whether the Syrian strikes in Iraq were a unilateral action or were coordinated with the Iraqi government.
Al-Maliki slams Sunnis
The sectarian rift in Iraq may have widened Wednesday when Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki blamed their political rivals for "coordinating" the crisis.
Al-Maliki, a Shiite, accused Sunnis of collaborating with militants and slammed the call to have a national salvation government that would remove them from power.
"Iraq is facing a cross-border terrorist attack that is supported by some neighboring countries," al-Maliki said in a televised speech.
They appealed to their Shia constituency by saying they are adhering to the wishes of Shiite religious leader Ali Sistani, who called for volunteers to support the Iraqi army and government.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry downplayed al-Maliki's rejection of a salvation government, saying it wasn't something the United States had talked to them about specifically.
To the contrary, they said al-Maliki, is committed to the electoral process and creation of a new government that the United States has supported.
"And they committed to moving forward with the constitutional processes of government formation, and that is precisely what the United States was encouraging," Kerry said. "He also called on all Iraqis to put aside their differences, to unite in their efforts against terrorism."
Meanwhile, a U.S. official told CNN that Iran is flying surveillance drones over Iraq. It's not known from where they are being launched.
Iran is believed to be providing small arms and ammunition to Iraq, as well as providing intelligence to al-Maliki's government, the official said.
Is Baghdad ready for an ISIS attack?
Meanwhile, on the outskirts of Baghdad, the eerie emptiness of a major highway raises questions about whether the capital would be prepared for a militant invasion.
The Iraqi military insists it's ready to beat back ISIS if the fighters reach Baghdad.
A post-battle video purportedly shows army forces celebrating a victory over ISIS just west of Baghdad. The bodies of two militants are draped over the hood of a Humvee.
"Look at those ISIS! We killed them!" one man says in the video.
But the opponents are formidable. ISIS fighters have captured cities and towns across Iraq in its effort to create an Islamic state.
And the highway from Baghdad to Abu Ghraib in Anbar province showed few signs of readiness for ISIS.
No tanks or big guns could be seen, CNN's Nic Robertson said. What used to be a thriving roadside marketplace now looks like a deserted wasteland.
It's unclear what lies farther down the highway, but images on the Internet suggest a dire situation. Photos posted by ISIS show two soldiers sitting cross-legged on the ground, guns pointed at their heads.
At least six civilians were killed and 21 wounded Wednesday when an Iraqi military helicopter fired two rockets on a mosque and nearby house in central Ana, in Anbar province, according to police and health officials.
Most of the injured were children, who were attending a course on the Quran inside the targeted mosque, the officials said.
At least 12 people were killed and 46 others were wounded when a suicide bomber exploded in a popular coffee shop in Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad, followed by several mortar rounds attacked several locations nearby.
At least four people were killed and 11 others were wounded when a car bomb exploded in an outdoor market in Rahimawa in northern Kirkuk, police officials in Kirkuk told CNN.
Who has what?
Maj. Gen Atta said security forces had regained control of two key border crossings after briefly losing them to the militants.
Atta said Iraqi forces, aided by Sunni tribes, retook al-Walid, which connects Iraq with Syria. They also said Iraqi forces regained the Trebil border crossing between Iraq and Jordan.
They also said that all towns between Samarra and Baghdad, 80 miles (129 kilometers) to the south, are in the hands of Iraqi security forces.
But large swaths of Iraq, particularly in the north and west, have fallen from government control to the hands of ISIS.
U.S. officials say they think ISIS now has as many as 10,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria. But is unknown, officials say, exactly how many are in Iraq because it's not clear how many go back and forth across the Syrian border and how many loyalists have joined ISIS as it has taken over various towns.
The spread of ISIS
Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh said they fear the strength of radical militants could spill further across borders.
"We've been saying for a while that the rise and spread of extremism and the politics of exclusivity will threaten the security of the entire region," Judeh told CNN's Becky Anderson.
"The root cause of ethnic and sectarian division, the root cause of instability and the rise and spread of terrorism and extremism has to be addressed."
The TTC unveiled its new 'bendy buses' on Thursday morning.
A total of 153 of the articulated buses have been ordered by the TTC at a total cost of $143 million.
They're said to be less expensive and more efficient than the current fleet of buses and are expected to save the transit authority $6 million per year.
The bus that was rolled out for members of the media on Thursday is a prototype that will be used for testing and training purposes before the new vehicles enter service later this year.
TTC CEO Andy Byford said the buses can carry 77 passengers (48 seated, 29 standing) , roughly 45 per cent more than the 40-foot buses they will eventually replace.
“I don't normally get excited about buses but this is one beautiful piece of equipment," they said. "I think customers will really notice the difference."
In addition to greater capacity, the buses have the following upgrades:
Air conditioning.
Three doors for quicker loading and unloading.
A ramp at the front door for greater accessibility.
A rust-resistant, stainless steel construction.
The first will begin service in December on the Bathurst route.
After that, the TTC plans to roll out the buses on the following schedule:
Dufferin January 2014.
January 2014. Finch West Spring 2014.
Spring 2014. Ossington Summer 2014.
Summer 2014. Bay Summer 2014.
2014. Sheppard East Fal l 2014.
l 2014. Steeles Express Fall 2014.
While the new buses will be able to carry more passengers, there will be fewer buses — leading to slightly longer wait times. TTC officials, however, insist that although buses on the affected routes will come less frequently, the quality of overall service will improve.
The TTC used to have articulated buses in 2003, said TTC Chair Karen Stintz, but they were not well-equipped for Canadian winters, often getting stuck, rusting and falling apart.
But Byford says the new models are an upgrade, built with stainless steel and rear-wheel drive.
"This is the latest technology," they said. "This is the bus they've successfully used in other cold places like New York and Chicago."
Apple will acquire Beats' streaming music service, which launched this year, and its audio equipment business, which includes its brand of headphones and audio equipment. The Beats management team will report to Mr Cook, said people familiar with the deal. Apple and Beats declined to comment.
Apple is said to be close to completing an acquisition of Beats Electronics , the headphone company and streaming music service created by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine. According to the Financial Times , the deal could be announced as soon as next week if negotiations work out.Apple is said to be paying $3.2 billion dollars for the company, a sum that dwarfs the $404 million Apple spent to acquire NeXT in 1996, its largest purchase to date. As of its last earnings call , Apple had some $150 billion in cash on hand, plenty to cover the large acquisition.Tim Cook said earlier this year that the company was open to making large acquisitions if the purchases made sense. "We have no problem spending 10 figures for the right company, for the right fit that's in the best interest of Apple in the long-term. None. Zero."In addition to producing a range of popular premium headphones and speakers that Apple currently sells in its stores, Beats also recently launched its Beats Music service, a direct competitor to Spotify, Pandora, and Apple's own iTunes Radio service. Beats Music is, however, a subscription-based on-demand service, which could bolster Apple's free station-based iTunes Radio service.The purchase of Beats Electronics comes as Apple has been rumored to be working on a complete overhaul of iTunes in order to address declining music sales. Part of Apple's revamp was said to include an on-demand streaming music service similar to Spotify, but the company may have elected to purchase Beats rather than designing its own service from the ground up.Beats Music, which is available to subscribers for $9.99 per month, focuses heavily on curation. The company has hired music experts from popular radio stations around the country to create stations and playlists from the service's 20 million song catalogs. It is unclear if Apple will keep the Beats Music format intact if it does indeed acquire the company, but the curation will fit well with the iTunes Music Store, which also offers music choices picked by Apple editors.Apple and Beats Electronics have had an ongoing relationship, with Beats CEO Jimmy Iovine meeting with Tim Cook and other Apple executives about a possible partnership back in January of 2013. Iovine also reportedly pitched Steve Jobs on a streaming music service a decade ago, but Jobs passed on the opportunity.According to the Financial Times, the deal is still in the works with some details yet to be ironed out, suggesting "talks could still fall apart." The Wall Street Journal , and The New York Times have confirmed that Apple is in talks with Beats Electronics over a possible acquisition.A new video on Facebook (warning: NSFW language) posted by actor Tyrese Gibson (via The Next Web ) shows Beats Electronics founder and musician Dr. Dre seemingly confirming the acquisition, however Apple and Beats Electronics have yet to speak on the potential purchase.The video featuring Dr. Dre seemingly confirming the acquisition has been pulled from Facebook, however it has since been reuploaded to YouTube by another source.
Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainGOP lobbyists worry Trump lags in K Street fundraising Mark Kelly kicks off Senate bid: ‘A mission to lift up hardworking Arizonans' Gabbard hits back at Meghan McCain after fight over Assad MORE (R-Ariz.) affirmed on Tuesday the right of NFL players kneeling in protest during the national anthem at football games.
"That's their right to do what they want to do as citizens," McCain told TMZ.
McCain's comments come after the Dallas Cowboys and owner Jerry Jones knelt before the national anthem at a Monday night game against the Arizona Cardinals, but later stood during the anthem's performance.

"I've always hated the Dallas Cowboys, and I will continue to do so," joked the Senate Armed Services Committee chairperson, an ardent Cardinals fan.
Several NFL teams have taken a knee during performances of the national anthem during games this week in protest of Trump's incendiary comments pushing for team owners to fire players who don't stand.
On Tuesday, Trump called for the NFL to institute a formal rule against the protest during the anthem on the field, saying that "The NFL has all sorts of rules and regulations."
Carter, 33, skated in three games with the Iowa Wild (AHL) after signing a professional tryout agreement (PTO) on Feb. 18. They tallied 12 points (7-5=12) and 48 penalty minutes (PIM) in 60 regular season games with Minnesota last season and skated in two Stanley Cup Playoff contests. The 6-foot-1, 205-pound native of White Bear Lake, Minn., led the team in PIM and ranked fourth in hits with 87, their most since the 2011-12 season. Carter also recorded a career-high 37 blocked shots.
They have totaled 93 points (41-52=93) and 444 PIM in 473 career games during nine NHL seasons with Anaheim, Carolina, Florida, New Jersey and Minnesota. Carter has collected 12 points (7-5=12) and 48 PIM in 46 playoff games and won a Stanley Cup with the Anaheim Ducks in 2007. They played two seasons at Minnesota State University-Mankato (2004-06) before signing as a free agent with the Ducks on July 12, 2006. Carter was originally signed as a free agent by the Wild on Oct. 6, 2014 and will wear sweater No. 18 with Minnesota.

Live Nation Entertainment today announced it plans to rename the Coral Sky Amphitheatre after Perfect Vodka, a gluten and GMO free vodka distilled and bottled in France.
“We are so excited to partner with Live Nation to give all guests of the newly named Perfect Vodka Amphitheatre a chance to see why we won the Gold in the International Craft Spirit awards with our naturally non-GMO and gluten free vodka. Great music and our smooth vodka are sure to make perfect memories,” said Perfect Vodka President Dennis C. Cunningham.
The 19,000 capacity outdoor venues opened it 1996. It features 13,000 lawn and 6,000 reserved seats, and has hosted over five million fans with more than 600 shows and festivals.
“We are thrilled to join forces with Perfect Vodka and integrate their brand into the excitement of live entertainment with top shelf artists and the wide array of assets this amphitheater has to offer,” said Andy Peikon, senior vice president of Live Nation venue sales. “Our venue in West Palm Beach and Perfect Vodka's presence throughout Florida make this the perfect partnership for the brand to engage and connect with music fans.”
The P.E.I. government should focus on fixing up the roads we have, rather than trying to build new ones, says Green Party Leader Peter Bevan-Baker.
Bevan-Baker tied their concern to an accident earlier this week. A fisherman on the way to the wharf hit a deep depression in the road and was taken to hospital.
Money spent on the bypass would be better spent on road repairs, said Green Party Leader Peter Bevan-Baker. (Brian Higgins/CBC)
They questioned the wisdom of spending $32 million in provincial money to build a bypass around Cornwall.
"Travel the roads of P.E.I. and you can see what a dilapidated state they're in," said Bevan-Baker.
"This is not the only old, failing culvert on Prince Edward Island. My question was how many more of these are waiting to happen?"
Investment 'for safety and for the economy'
Transportation Minister Paula Biggar argued the Cornwall bypass is an important economic investment.
They said 500 trucks a day exit Charlottetown through Cornwall.
The Cornwall bypass will help keep traffic, including 500 trucks a day, moving, says Transportation Minister Paula Biggar. (Rick Gibbs/CBC)
"Those are high traffic export areas for fishing and farming," said Biggar.
"We are investing those dollars in infrastructure for safety and for the economy to keep traffic moving."
Biggar also noted half the money for the project is coming from the federal government.

Ottawa will face the New York Cosmos this Saturday in Brooklyn as they look to get their season back on course. Following three consecutive 3-1 losses, Ottawa Fury players will need to give it their all if they are to earn a result against a very strong Cosmos squad.
With Ottawa playing in the Canadian Championship vs Edmonton the last two weeks, this match in New York will be the clubs fifth match in two weeks. Marc Dos Santos will return to their regular coaching role after missing the last two matches through a suspension and personal matters, and they will be looking for a much improved performance, both defensively and offensively, from their Fury squad.
Keep Thinking
It's expected that Dos Santos will put De Guzman and Alves back into the starting lineup after the two were rested midweek. De Guzman's skill and experience, and Alves' size and composure will both be important to controlling a skilled and fast Cosmos squad. Nicki Paterson was taken out of the match vs Edmonton fairly early, meaning the Scotsman will likely start in the midfield alongside De Guzman, with the two forming a decent partnership in the middle.
Ottawa are still without Phil Davies, who will likely miss the entire Spring Season due to a broken arm, as well as captain Richie Ryan who is sidelined for a couple more weeks with a leg injury. Brazilian Paulo Jr has been very impressive so far this season and will likely once again feature in the starting XI on the win. Ubiparipovic is fit and could start in the attacking midfield role while Tom Heinemann will likely get the start up front for Ottawa
In The End
It will be very important for Ottawa to start putting away the chances they are creating, as it will take more than one goal to defeat the Cosmos. With the likes of Raul and Restrepo creating scoring chances for New York, the Fury defense will need to be at their best if they are to avoid allowing three goals against for the fourth time in a row.
This one of match in Brooklyn is a reported sell out and will be a special day for the Cosmos club and their fans as they play on Coney Island. Cosmos are clear favourites in the NASL this season and a win away from home would give the Fury squad the confidence they need to get this season back on track.
Prediction
New York Cosmos 2-2 Ottawa Fury FC
July 17 (UPI) -- A New York state man captured video of their dog swimming out into the Long Island Sound to drag a struggling baby deer to safety.
Mark Freeley said they were walking Sunday morning with their golden retriever, Storm, and their other dog, Sara, when Storm ran out into the water and started swimming toward something.
Freeley's video, posted to YouTube, shows Storm drag a deer fawn that had been struggling to swim back to shore.
"Storm just plunged into the water and started swimming out to the fawn, grabbed it by the neck, and started swimming to shore," Freeley told CBS New York.
Freeley said Storm plopped down next to the baby deer once they reached shore.
"And then they started nudging it, and started pulling it to make sure they were gonna be OK I guess," Freeley said.
Freeley called in rescuers and waited with the fawn on the beach, but they said the deer ran back into the water as soon as the rescuers arrived.
Freeley and Frank Floridia of Strong Island Rescue waded out into the water to get a lasso around the deer.
Floridia said their partner, Erica Kutzing, ran about a mile on the beach to help with the rescue.
"I don't think I could've done it without the help of my partner. i was exhausted at the point my knee blew out, and I collapsed on the beach," they said.
Kutzing carried the deer to the rescue van and it was transported to a local animal rescue, where it is recovering from some ticks and an eye injury.
Why Finnish food products are among the best in the world
Finland has the northernmost agriculture in the world and produces the purest food in Europe. Finnish wild forest berries, luminous oats, and livestock are grown and cultivated in the clean arctic air with very limited need for pesticides. Due to Finland's long and harsh winters, plants utilise the short summers, midnight sun, clean soil and water to the fullest. The result is the dense and unique taste of Finnish food.
SECRET OF THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE
Pure, healthy, and delicious food makes people happy, and Finns are said to be some of the happiest people on earth. Our secret to happiness is the Finnish lifestyle, where we care for nature and eat healthy and safe food. We want our animals to be healthy and happy too. We do not use antibiotics in meat production to boost growth, and we have an efficient food safety control system. Finland has one of the highest food safety standards in the EU.
PUREST WATER FLOWS IN FINLAND
Finland is filled with clean blue and crystal clean lakes. In fact, there are a total of 188 000 lakes in here! So it is not a coincidence that Finland is also home for premium water products and beverages. Finnish water is said to be the best water in the world by UNESCO, and we export it to nearly all continents.
Among the world's purest, the water that flows out of the tap in Finland is also the essence of Finnish premium alcoholic products. Like our naturally delicious food, Finnish alcohol(ic) drinks share the same untamed, unique flavours stemming from the Arctic nature.
READY TO SERVE HEALTH CONSCIOUS AND DEMANDING CONSUMERS
Finns are passionate about pure and healthy food. Our super-healthy oats are one of the corner stones of both the Finnish cuisine and food industry, and we are the second-largest exporter of oats in the world. Luminous oats lower cholesterol, keep the blood sugar level low, and support gut health.
Finns are also world leaders in nutritional expertise, with vast expertise in catering to special diets and offering functional, gluten- and lactose-free foods.

Mario Jose Sanchez/AP Image San Francisco skyline seen from Alamo Square.
Rents are too damn high in most major American cities. In New York, Washington, and Boston the extortionate cost of housing is a key driver of the cost of living. But none of those places can match the San Francisco metro area for the sheer terror that the rental real-estate market inspires, where just getting the keys to an apartment can easily cost five figures.
California housing costs are astronomical, higher on average than any state except Hawaii. The Bay Area is the epicenter of the U.S. housing crisis, and the latest response to that predicament is a slew of rent-control ballot initiatives.
Rent control rarely finds favor with economists or the real-estate industry: They complain it drives down construction starts and property tax revenues and leads to deterioration of existing properties. But rent control is the all the rage again since California has utterly failed to come to grips with its acute housing shortage, especially along the coast.
Waiting for market responses is not an option for a family or an individual staring at a median rent of $3,510 for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco or $2,280 in San Jose. Rent-control measures surged onto the books in the 1970s and 1980s in a number of California cities and towns, only to flame out and get replaced—after a major lobbying effort by the real-estate lobby—by draconian statewide prohibitions against strict controls on price increases.
Rent-control battles are now under way in five cities that ring San Francisco: Alameda, Mountain View, and Richmond voters will consider rent-control measures in November. Tenant advocates in Burlingame and San Mateo are waiting to find out if they collected enough verifiable signatures to get their initiatives before voters.
In California, the term “rent control” is a misnomer. What these measures aim to implement is not so much rent control (the rent cannot change) as rent stabilization (the rent can increase, but only by a specified amount, such the rate of inflation.)
Overall, the measures aim to cover as many units as possible. Burlingame, where the monthly rent for a studio apartment can run up to $3,000, has a unique situation: For starters, the city's ballot question aims to repeal a 1988 ordinance that prohibited the establishment of rent control. Initiatives in Alameda and Richmond—both working-class cities—would roll back rents (to May and July 2015 levels, respectively), cap them, and set up rental commissions, as well as create “just cause” eviction frameworks that would restrict the reasons landlords can use to evict a tenant.
The Richmond ordinance alone would cover 10,000 units, covering an estimated 20,000 residents, according to Tenants Together, a statewide tenant advocacy group.
Rent-control measures may be popular, but municipal leaders, not surprisingly, are not immune to strong-arming by real-estate industry groups, which wield considerable influence in most municipalities on matters from zoning to campaign contributions. The Richmond ordinance is up for a second go-round: City councilors initially passed a measure, and then repealed it after the California Apartment Association, the state's strongest rent-control opponent, launched a signature-gathering effort designed to compel city councilors to seek a referendum.
The California Apartment Association takes the classic stance that “rent control is as damaging to renters as it is to rental property owners.” It has aggressively moved against at least two of the ballot initiatives. In Richmond, two measures will appear on the ballot; one backed by the association and one by Tenants Together. (The group received reports that the association paid its signature-gatherers $20 per signature.)
In Alameda, voters will consider three separate rent control questions, one backed by the association, one by Tenants Together, and one by the city council. Mountain View voters may also see a second ballot question on rent control.
Tenant advocates remain cautious about the outcomes of these initiatives. Multiple ballot questions on the same issue will undoubtedly sow confusion in the affected communities. In Burlingame, Cindy Cornell of Burlingame Advocates for Tenant Protections notes that although more than 50 percent of the city's residents are renters, many of them are international H-1B visa holders or workers from other states who are ineligible to vote in California.
One answer to an overheated housing market is simple: Build more housing at price points that low-income and middle-income people can afford. With companies streaming into the region, new housing starts should be part of a multi-pronged plan of attack on high housing costs. But without a plan, there can be no attack: Since 2010, San Mateo County, where Burlingame is located, has added nearly 55,000 jobs, but only about 2,150 new housing units.
Building more housing runs smack into some of the most powerful forces known to humankind: NIMBY-fueled zoning regulations and the people who insist on them. California cities and towns have managed to stave off increased density, school-aged children, renters, and other perceived threats to a community's existence with ordinances designed to discourage or prohibit the construction of housing that the vast majority of everyday people can afford.
Rent control may be an imperfect response, but it has energized Bay Area residents. The real challenge they confront, however, isn't local, but rather, the state's restrictions on rent control—specifically, the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act. The 1995 law effectively exempts single-family homes, condominiums, and any dwelling built after 1995 from rent control. The law also prohibits cities and towns from updating ordinances passed before 1995 to cover more units. State lawmakers managed to fight off real-estate industry attempts to get the law passed for almost a decade. But after the bill's legislative opponents moved on, industry supporters were finally able to get the measure passed.
“It's been a long time since there's been a grassroots tenant movement in California that could even be mass mobilized to target the state level,” says Aimee Inglis, the acting director of Tenants Together. “They have been organizing in their cities … to do statewide strategy and change the Costa-Hawkins Act,” they say.
Deeper engagement with the economic challenges posed by high housing costs will require policy coordination between residents, politicians, and business and industry leaders. Rent control may be illogical in the world of economics, but in the world of $3,500 apartments, it is a lifeline. “People keep hoping it's going to change,” says Cornell of the housing crisis. “We just don't see any change happening; it's just getting worse.”
Two officials for the Department of Veterans Affairs — at the center of the scandal plaguing that agency — will keep their jobs and have proven impervious to efforts of reassigning them.
“Diana Rubens, Philadelphia Regional Office director, and Kimberly Graves, director of the St. Paul, Minn., regional office, have faced harsh criticism since an inspector general report last fall accused them of pocketing more than $400,000 in moving costs for questionable job moves,” the Military Times reports.
“Lawmakers have repeatedly accused the pair of gaming the promotion system for personal gain, at the expense of veterans care. VA leaders have criticized the two only for ‘judgement errors' in how they handled the job moves, and supported both as reliable and responsible executives,” the report continues.
Despite that bit of agency spin, VA officials tried to discipline the executives and assign them to different positions — tried and failed.
The Merit Systems Protection Board shot down the disciplinary action, and both Rubens and Graves kept their jobs, with gushing praise for their management skills from Deputy VA Secretary Sloan Gibson, followed by some hedging from Gibson that disciplinary action against the two, and two other senior executives, might still be forthcoming.
This despite an Inspector General report that charged Rubens and Graves with “abusing their authority to reassign other directors to jobs elsewhere within VA, then moving into the vacant positions themselves,” as the Military Times puts it.
“Investigators said the moves carried with them generous relocation payouts. Graves, who makes nearly $174,000 a year, got more than $129,000 to move from Philadelphia to Minnesota. Rubens, who makes $181,000, received more than $288,000 to move from Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia,” says the report.
At least the scandal forced the VA to suspend that expensive relocation program, which blew $1.8 million on reassigning 23 senior executives — almost always with pay raises, as the Washington Post reported, even though a freeze on senior executive pay had supposedly been ordered by the White House. The program was supposed to be used only rarely, for jobs that were exceptionally difficult to fill.
When Acting Undersecretary for Benefits Danny Pummill was asked in November by the House Veterans Affairs Committee how the program could have been so flagrantly abused, they mumbled, “We weren't paying attention to everything we should have been paying attention to. We need to do a better job of that.”
“It's devastating that the senior leaders are not held as accountable as the lowest people in the organization,” Pummill admitted.
Acting Inspector General Linda Halliday vowed to Congress that “the most critical change” to the agency's culture would be “ensuring that those who abused the program are punished.”
Diana Rubens and Kimberly Graves pled the Fifth and refused to testify on the matter. Now they have become the latest in a line of Obama administration officials to face no disciplinary action for behavior they claimed they couldn't discuss without implicating themselves in criminal activity.
Pummill was wrong about the VA “needing to do a better job” of policing abuse at the highest levels. All it really needed to do was wave the scandal away, even though the Rubens and Graves cases were supposed to be the first high-profile exercises of new legal authority the VA was given to speed up disciplinary action. Refusing to give Congress anything but vague promises of reform, and holding absolutely no one accountable for their actions, continues to be a successful strategy for the Department of Veterans Affairs.
As the Military Times reported on February 1, the major reason cited by an administrative judge for overturning the punitive demotion of Rubens and Graves was that another executive, Beth McCoy of the Veterans Benefits Administration, did the same thing and got promoted. It was deemed unfair to punish Rubens and Graves with “inconsistent treatment” for a comparable offense.

Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is more than just a giant barred spiral harboring hundreds of billions of stars. It's also the hub of a gargantuan empire that stretches over more than a million light-years and rules some two dozen lesser galaxies, which revolve around it the way moons orbit a giant planet.
Of all our galaxy's many satellites, none compares with the Magellanic Clouds, which look like fragments of glowing mist torn from the Milky Way. Bold and beautiful, both galaxies are by far the liveliest and most lustrous of the Milky Way's retinue. In the last seven years astronomers have discovered just how rare this galactic duo is—and how lucky we are to have the pair close by. Moreover, new observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have given us the best clue yet to their path through space, which holds the key to their unique nature.
The Magellan galaxies, named for the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan and best seen from the Southern Hemisphere, turn out to be unusual in several ways. For their size, they possess a large amount of star-making gas and dust: more than a billion suns' worth. Indeed, of the several dozen galaxies that belong to the so-called Local Group in our neighborhood of the cosmos, it's the Large Magellanic Cloud—not the much mightier Andromeda Galaxy or Milky Way—that boasts the greatest known stellar nursery. Named the Tarantula Nebula, it spans 700 light-years. If it were as close as the Milky Way's well-known Orion Nebula, the Tarantula Nebula would loom 55 times larger than the moon.
Surprisingly, three recent studies, each by different astronomical teams, show that smaller galaxies rarely flourish close to a giant one; yet the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds sit only 160,000 and 200,000 light-years from Earth, respectively, which is nearer than most of the Milky Way's other galactic satellites.
Astronomer Phil James at Liverpool John Moores University in England, co-author of one investigation, recounts what happened as they and a student were imaging distant galaxies: "One night, when we were both up at the telescope, it occurred to us, ‘What would it look like if someone were in one of those galaxies and looking back at us? What would they see of our galaxy?'" They'd see the Milky Way, plus its two brightest companions: The Large Magellanic Cloud would look a tenth as bright as the Milky Way and the Small Magellanic Cloud a fourth as bright as that. James says, "As we went through taking hundreds of these galaxy images, we weren't seeing that very often." In fact, only a few percent of giant galaxies like our own host a close-in pair of star-forming satellites as luminous as the Magellanic Clouds.
Andromeda certainly doesn't. It's the nearest giant galaxy to our own, 2.5 million light-years away, and the largest member of the Local Group. The Milky Way ranks number two, and all its satellites except the Magellanic Clouds have run out of gas—literally. Without gas, galaxies can't create new stars. Known as dwarf spheroidals, these gas-poor galaxies are so ghostly and diffuse that the first one found—the Sculptor dwarf in 1938—was initially mistaken for a fingerprint or some other defect on a photographic plate.
The Magellanic Clouds' flamboyance is astonishing because the first rule of survival for modest galaxies is to steer clear of the big ones. Through their great gravitational pull, giants like the Milky Way and Andromeda rob other galaxies of gas and thereby thwart star birth. Just as the moon's gravity pulls the hardest on the Earth's near side and lifts the sea, so a giant galaxy's tide tears gas out of another galaxy via what astronomers call tidal stripping. And when a small galaxy dodges through a giant galaxy's halo, halo gas hits the lesser galaxy's gas, knocking it out in a process called ram pressure stripping. That's why the typical satellite galaxy is dead, devoid of gas and bright young stars.
So how can the Magellanic Clouds shine, radiant and defiant—such stunning sights in the southern sky? Why are they there? A series of studies from the Hubble Space Telescope is bringing the answer into focus.
Seven years ago, Nitya Kallivayalil, an astronomer now at Yale University, and their colleagues reported Hubble observations that tracked the motion of the Magellanic Clouds through space and began to illuminate how the Clouds have prospered while their fellow satellites atrophied. And their latest Hubble data, published in February, follow the galaxies over a longer period of time, yielding a more precise path for the pair, and strengthen their startling discovery: The Magellanic Clouds are speeding through space so fast they are likely passing us for the first time. "I was initially very surprised," they say. But their discovery actually explains how the two galaxies have retained their youthful glow. Until recently they've avoided the Milky Way and its gas-grabbing tactics.
Before Kallivayalil's work and before it became so clear that getting close to a big galaxy was bad for a smaller galaxy's health, astronomers thought the Magellanic Clouds revolved around our galaxy every one billion or two billion years. When the Clouds came closest, the thinking went, the Milky Way's gravity stirred up their gas, triggering the birth of new stars. The Hubble work, however, suggests that the Clouds' orbit around us is much more enormous. Indeed, Kallivayalil's new work rules out orbital periods less than four billion years. The two galaxies came closest to us just 200 million years ago; thus, for most of their lives, the Milky Way has had little effect on them.
Instead, the Clouds owe much of their splendor to each other. The Small Magellanic Cloud has probably been dancing around its partner every few billion years, sometimes getting closer, sometimes getting farther. And 200 million to 500 million years ago, the Small Magellanic Cloud skirted past its larger sibling. "I think the Small Magellanic Cloud smashed right through the Large Magellanic Cloud," says astronomer Gurtina Besla of Columbia University, who has computed their past paths. They say the collision compressed gas and spawned many of the young stars we see in the Clouds today.
But this fertility dance has come at a price. Besla says tides from the Large Magellanic Cloud extract stars and gas from its smaller sibling. In 2011 Knut Olsen, an astronomer at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, and their colleagues reported the Large Magellanic Cloud has stars that aren't moving around the galaxy with its other stars. "I hadn't expected anything like this at all," Olsen says. The wayward stars' chemical composition matches that of the Small Magellanic Cloud, implying that the larger galaxy likely snatched millions of stars from its smaller mate.
Gas is also spilling out of the two galaxies. Since the early 1970s astronomers have known that a long stream of hydrogen gas stretches away from the pair. The old thinking: The Milky Way's tide ripped out the gas. The new thinking: The Clouds themselves are to blame. In 2009 astronomer David Nidever of the University of Virginia discovered that this stream is even longer than had been thought, stretching over more than half a million light-years, so it encircles most of the Milky Way. Nidever suspects that bright stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud blow out gas through their winds and supernova explosions. Besla thinks, however, the gas stream flows instead from the Small Magellanic Cloud, torn out by the tide of its partner, which has 10 times more mass. Either way, the Magellanic Stream traces the pair's path through space, revealing that their orbit around us is polar, like a terrestrial satellite sailing over the North and South poles. The Milky Way will grab the lost gas to prolong its own star-making career.
Indeed, never forget who's boss. The Milky Way is exacting tribute; its tide yanks the nearer galaxy away from its companion so that the Magellanic Clouds may never orbit each other again. They're already separated by 75,000 light-years. The Clouds' recent collision may have fractured the lesser galaxy, and Besla says its fate is bleak: "I think the Small Magellanic Cloud is on its way to becoming a dwarf spheroidal." To do that, it needs only lose its gas, then wait for some future astronomer to mistake it for a fingerprint.
Fortunately, that will take a long time. By venturing past the Milky Way only now, both galaxies still bear abundant gas to forge brilliant new stars that will deck southern skies for eons to come.
More than 40 unions and Catalan associations called a region-wide strike for Tuesday, after a major police crackdown on a banned independence referendum.
In a statement on Sunday, UGT and CCOO, Spain's biggest unions, the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), a powerful pro-independence civil association, and 41 other organisations called for the work stoppage due to “the grave violation of rights and freedoms.”
“We call all society, on employers' organisations, business owners, unions, workers, self-employed workers, institutions and all the citizens of Catalonia to stop the ‘country' on Tuesday, October 3,” they wrote.
Pro-independence Catalans often refer to the northeastern region as a “country.”
The regional government says more than 840 people received medical attention on Sunday after riot police moved in on polling stations as Catalans tried to vote in the referendum, defying a ban by Madrid.
In some cases, police used batons and rubber bullets to evict people from the voting centres and confiscate the ballot boxes.
Spain's interior ministry said 33 police agents also received medical aid.
Madrid had warned Catalan separatist leaders they could not hold the vote in a region deeply divided over independence, stating it was illegal and courts had ruled it unconstitutional.
But they had retorted that Catalans had a right to decide on their future and pressed ahead anyway.
Catalonia is a major engine for Spanish growth, and accounts for around 19 percent of its GDP.
As such, any region-wide strike will be damaging for Spain.
Let's start with the obvious reason we may never see another Terminator movie: The past few sequels were pretty much total train wrecks. Things started to go downhill with 2003's Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, the first sequel to make it to the big screen without original director James Cameron at the helm. The movie wasn't terrible, but looking at the story, it was wholly unnecessary. It was basically about trying to delay Judgement Day, then realizing it was inevitable. Nothing changed.
Splashy action director McG was hired to helm 2009's Terminator: Salvation, which somehow managed to make the most compelling piece of Terminator lore (the action-packed, future-set battle with Skynet) utterly boring. A full-on pre-boot was attempted with Terminator Genisys, which served as a muddled throwback to some visual elements from the first film that only seemed to remind fans of what they were missing. Sequel after mediocre sequel has taken a toll on the fanbase, to the point that proposed Genisys sequels were actually dropped from active development after the critical bashing the film took after hitting the big screen in 2015.
Thread is a secure wireless mesh network architected for the home and its connected products. Everyone is excited about Thread because it's a wireless protocol that's designed by Google Nest (with Weave), is open(ish), is extremely resilient, scalable, and meshes. The best part about reading this article is that you can learn how to get your hands on one of the few Thread RF modules available now that you can play with.
To date, mesh protocols have been notoriously high in promises and low in delivery. That's okay, as mesh is a very, very, hard technology to get working correctly and Thread has built on the shoulders of the giants it stands on. But first, a quick briefing on Thread for those of you who are not familiar with it.
Thread is primarily a mesh networking protocol. Each “node” (or product) in the network can act as a router, leader or end device. These then connect to a border router to get the data onto the network from and to the internet. Each network can only have one leader and each node must be capable of being a router or an end device. The node must independently make the decision to be a router or an end node depending on what the needs of the network are. Take a moment and re-read that. It's dense but worth taking the time to understand completely.
Now let's get down and dirty and technical for the engineers amongst you now:
Thread is a self-forming and self-healing network by design. There can be no single point of failure. Thread is carried on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard at 2.4ghz. The protocol is fully IPv6 compliant meaning that every node on the network has a full IP address by the use of a 6LoWPAN header. Since every node has a full IP address there is no need for NAT (Network Address Translation).
Thread has embraced low-power techniques to enable what they call “sleepy nodes” – nodes that will go into deep sleep mode when not in active use. When they wake up or are pinged there is no need for the node to rejoin the network, as on wake the parent sees the device and recognizes it. The network is designed to continue operating locally when there is no general IP connection to the greater internet. Security is by object authentication on the network by key exchange. It uses a variant of the Diffie Hellman key exchange that leverages a NIST elliptic curve to make it more power efficient.
For the product managers/owners amongst you, Thread is important because you don't want your product to be a second class citizen in the new IoT order. You want it to be a first class participant and fully compliant with the protocol.
The organization pushing Thread is committed to making it work and committed to stopping it from fragmenting. The working group reads like a who's who of consumer, commercial and industrial vendors. So while we may have the “Betamax” problem occur again, the prospects look good for Thread and many powerful companies are eager to ensure that their products have Thread lest they are left out of the “Internet of Things Club.”
Consumer home products will be the first use case
The first use cases will be consumer products in the smart home, but the commercial controls and industrial automation pioneers are eager to put Thread through its paces to see if it can replace the aging and fragile Zigbee protocol or the single vendor controlled Z-Wave.
Now that's all dandy, but what does it mean to you?
The low energy experts at Rigado in Portland, OR have partnered with chip giant NXP to produce one of the first certified Thread modules to reach market – the R41Z. In addition, it also has Bluetooth low energy providing a double punch of connectivity for your projects.
Rigado is now making a number of their post verification run modules available for ReadWrite readers who are working on actual products. You will get an eval board and a ton of support, BUT you must give back some feedback on how the experience can be improved. To sign-up for this beta program click here and fill out the brief form.

We find ourselves with another post-rock album, this one by Mogwai. This may not be an album in the traditional sense, as Atomic is, as you can see by the album cover image, a soundtrack. This album is the soundtrack to a documentary called Atomic: Living in Dread and Promise. Something very important to note about this album is that it's an instrumental album, like the Explosions in the Sky album I wrote about last week (Read about the EITS album here) but unlike The Wilderness, there's a clear and concrete theme to this album. As you would guess from the title, Atomic, this album is about the danger of nuclear weapons.
I will try to keep this review brief, as the last few reviews have gone on a bit longer than I expected and I imagine I lost a few of you along the way. I'm also learning how to advertise these reviews better now, so that more people can read what I have to say about these albums if they want. I don't want to get into an argument about genre about each individual album I review because some people are firm believers that bands can only be one genre, while I believe that bands can cross over into multiple ones. For example, this album (as with other Mogwai albums) is clearly considered post-rock above all other genres of music. However, the band has explicitly stated in interviews that they disdain the term post-rock, so how is it fair for me as a fan to classify a band in a certain way when the band itself objects to that classification?
Either way, as it is your opinion to disagree with me, it is my own opinion that bands can transcend the invisible boundaries of genre. I have used this specific example in the past to discuss genres of music: the band Led Zeppelin. They are unquestionably a rock band, and played a large hand in developing the field of rock music as a whole, but would you not also consider them or at least multiple tracks of theirs to be blues, folk, psychedelic, or even hard rock bordering on early heavy metal? I watched a terrific documentary, the name escapes me, where the documentarians made the case that Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath were the two forefathers of metal music as we know it today. In that sense, two people discussing Led Zeppelin can both be correct when defining that band. The terms do not have to be mutually exclusive of one another. I can be right saying that they are heavy metal and you could also be right saying that they started with the blues.
To get back to my original point, no one disputes bands like Explosions in the Sky or Mogwai are post-rock bands at their core. However, other genres share many of the same qualities of music, for example shoegaze and dream pop. Both of those two rely heavily on distorted instrumental effects, especially with the guitar and synthesizer, to create an atmosphere of sound that envelops the listener. If I remember correctly, for example, shoegaze was called that because musicians performing that kind of music were literally looking down at their feet (perhaps using pedals or for other logical reasons) for much of their performances. These different types of genres blur the lines of music and vocals, and some of these bands of the various genres I speak of use their vocals as simple another instrument instead of a defining feature. I spoke of the band Sigur Ros in my previous review to highlight that quality, where the vocals don't matter and add to the effect.
Coming back to Mogwai (poor guys, I went on a little digression into the differentiation of genre), there are no vocals on this album. As I mentioned above, this is a soundtrack, so it does have a beginning, middle and end. It's not a traditional album in many senses of the word, and yet it could easily be considered a concept album. This album chronicles the development and use of nuclear weapons. I am not entirely sure if my interpretation of the album relies on my knowledge of the subject matter and having read about the documentary itself, to determine what I get out of this album. I hear a silent but very loud protest against the dangers of nuclear weapons. Trust me, I don't want to get into the politics of that area, so I am simply stating that I feel the band, with its music, is powerfully expressing its disaffection with nuclear armaments and those in power that can use them. The track Ether, posted above, opens the album to us. It opens to quiet keyboard effects and adds another small layer every 30 seconds or so. The third layer that the band introduces is the horn, which grows in significance and volume as the track progresses. The fourth layer is the drone of a guitar that picks up around 2:30 in, and you can hear it coming from nothing but gradually getting louder and louder until it loudly picks up along with the percussion at around the 3:30 mark. Each layer adds on top of the one before it, until the layers get stripped away as the song leads to a close. It starts quiet, grows to something massive, and then lets go and fades back into quiet with the horn ending the track.
Ether leads into SCRAM, which opens with a distorted keyboard effect gliding back and forth, until a beat shifts in. Every one of the tracks has a term that is relevant to something in the nuclear world, and the tracks tend to distinguish themselves from one another. As Ether started slow and grew to a crescendo and then let off, SCRAM drifts back and forth but does the musical effect of “two steps forward, one step back” by introducing layer after layer of music and then taking it back, only to charge forward again. That's the soundscape effect of post-rock, stacking music upon music to create a sound that is almost overwhelming but knows when to quit before it gets too much.
SCRAM falls away into Bitterness Centrifuge, which keeps a droning synthesizer as the foundation of the track. It adds and takes away when it needs, and gives a sense of wonder and discovery. I close my eyes and picture the scientists having a breakthrough that will lead them to a world they could not have possibly imagined – a nuclear powered world. It provides hope and promise, because at that moment it was an innocent creation that could be used to help all humankind. Historically, things did not end at that point, and it's very intriguing to follow the music along with what actually happened in the course of the nuclear developments.
U-235 is one of two turning points on this album, which started with such curiosity and innocence, but developed into something more pointed and dire. It served as a transition between the world of science and the world of war. I don't want to give you a history lesson on what some of these song titles stand for, because I a) don't want to get it wrong and 2) don't think you came here for a nuclear weapon history lecture. I'm sure Dan Carlin of Hardcore History has something much more informative on that subject, anyway. As U-235 fell away into Pripyat, the album really took a different tone. Pripyat presented a much more fearful and dangerous environment than any track before. Pripyat, for a very brief summary, was one town right near Chernobyl that was affected by the nuclear disaster. This track was both a warning of what could happen and a mourning of what did happen, and it was filled with sadness. While yes, the timeline doesn't exactly fit because Chernobyl happened in the 80s and the nuclear development and subsequent bombs being dropped were much earlier, it is poignant nonetheless. I close my eyes listening to this track and I see the wasteland, both of what could happen in the event of a nuclear war, and of what did happen when nuclear experiments go awry.
It doesn't get much happier from here on out, folks. Weak Force continues on the path of “what have we done” with a sad retrospective of the perils of the atomic age. It could be interpreted as the outcry against nuclear weapons before they were used in World War II as well, because the damage could be catastrophic. It appropriately leads into the next track, Little Boy, which…well, we know what that was. Little Boy, the track, very effectively captures the moments leading up to the bomb being dropped on Hiroshima, with dread and fear of the unknown. The track following Little Boy, called Are You a Dancer?, is about as somber as you're going to get from Mogwai. It's a slow and heartfelt track coupled with a violin and hits hard while painting a picture of the devastation following the dropping of the Little Boy on Hiroshima.
Are You a Dancer? leads into Tzar, which feels like a musicalization of the thoughts and decisions made by the American leaders on whether to use another nuclear weapon to end the war. It's deep and introspective, and I can feel thoughts like “was it worth it?” going through my mind. As we know from history, the decision was made to use another nuclear weapon to end World War II, but I cannot even imagine how difficult of a decision it must have known and seeing the devastation that the first bomb caused. The end of Tzar is very quiet, but the music leading up to the climax of the track highlights the tough thoughts battling back and forth in the mind of the leaders in command at the time. The quiet after the big finish could absolutely symbolize the silent dread and immediate regret those people felt after making that decision. This all leads up to the final track, Fat Man. This track, unlike the others, starts with what sounds like a heart beat for about the first 30 seconds until the piano starts playing. It's the longest track on the album, and arguably the most powerful because even though the war ended following the Fat Man being dropped on Nagasaki, the devastation at that exact moment in time was something the world could not imagine happening again. There aren't decent words that can describe the feelings that manifest themselves from the final track, and how it ends with the heartbeat into silence. It's powerful stuff. Without a doubt, it's some of the most evocative and visceral music Mogwai has made before.
In what was going to be a shorter review, this turned out to be one of my longest. Unlike my other albums, I wanted to take you one by one through each of the tracks. This made for a longer read, but a greater in-depth analysis of the thoughts and feelings that this album can provoke. Even as a soundtrack, this album hit me like a train. I plan on seeing the documentary very soon, to see if my thoughts on the album match up to their placement on the documentary itself. As an album released on April Fools' Day, like several other albums actually (including the new Weezer and Moderat albums), this one is no joke. I've been sitting on this review for a week now, trying to make my thoughts more coherent and easier to read. It almost seems unfair to rate this album in my normal scheme of album reviews, but in the interest of keeping things on the level, this album is very well made. I give this album 13 Ratings Units out of 15. The only thing that really held this back from a significantly higher rating was one that was beyond the band's control – pacing. It's not their fault that they made music to presumably follow along with a documentary, but I imagine their hands were tied to an extent to connect the music with the subject matter. Also, this is the first Mogwai album without John Cummings, their guitarist, who after 20 years decided they wanted to do their own thing. It is slightly telling, because for most tracks the guitar isn't nearly as highlighted as it was in previous Mogwai albums.
I will leave you with this image. Never forget what happened.

Share. Franchise creator Masahiro Sakurai gives us their early thoughts as they return to Nintendo's blockbuster series. Franchise creator Masahiro Sakurai gives us their early thoughts as they return to Nintendo's blockbuster series.
Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. series has grown astronomically since it first debuted over a decade ago. Now considered one of the publisher's flagship franchises, the manic fighting series has more than quadrupled its playable roster, introduced characters from third party companies, featured a stage editor and even a robust, story-driven single-player campaign. Its latest installment, Super Smash Bros. Brawl is figuratively bursting at the seams with content. What, then, could franchise creator Masahiro Sakurai possibly do with the Wii U and 3DS versions?
“ I'm really just getting started on this so it's going to take time.
"As you noted, there is a certain dead end we come to if we just expand the volume of the game," Sakurai told me in a recent e-mail interview, clearly recognizing that simply adding more characters, items and stages wouldn't be enough. The Smash Bros. franchise, though repeatedly earning high praise from critics over its three entries, has effectively followed the same formula since its inception, evolving its style of play without shaking things up too much. So if merely expanding the idea isn't the only thing on Sakurai's mind... what is?
"I intend to change direction a little as we go," Sakurai said, indicating their desire to possbily find a new mechanic or idea to drive two new entries in the series. "The key to that's going to be its dual support for 3DS/Wii U."
Sakurai, as well as Nintendo global president Satoru Iwata, had previously acknowledged their interest in linking the 3DS and Wii U versions of the game, which were announced simultaneously at E3 2011. "I'm really just getting started on this so it's going to take time, but I'll come up with something that uses that link as the game's central axis, so I hope you're looking forward to it."
Work on a sequel has finally started...
Sakurai's remarks came in the midst of a larger conversation about Kid Icarus Uprising, which was recently released for the Nintendo 3DS. The developer, who is also the Director of the Board for Project Sora, a subsidiary developer of Nintendo, mentioned they are now concentrating their efforts on the next two installments of Smash Bros. With development just getting started, it seems as though fans of the series will still have to wait some time before watching Mario and Link battle it out.
For more of my discussion with Sakurai about Uprising, including whether they would return for a sequel, their thoughts on the game's controversial controls and how they approached development, stay tuned to IGN.

The private security firm that handcuffed and detained a journalist at yesterday's Joe Miller town hall employs only veterans, doubles as an army surplus store and bail bond agency, and touts “security, surplus, survival” as its motto.William Fulton, head of DropZone, told TPM today that their agency is all veterans, and mostly sells its army surplus stock to other veterans as well. They described how DropZone also handles VIP and concert security, bail bond enforcement, and the occasional domestic abuse case as well. Fulton noted that they were hired for the Republican Senate nominee's town hall at Central Middle School in Anchorage because the school district requires security for private events.
Tony Hopfinger, the founder and editor of online news site the Alaska Dispatch, was handcuffed and detained by DropZone yesterday after repeatedly trying to question and videotape Miller.
Lt. Dave Parker, Public Information Officer for the Anchorage PD, told TPM that under Alaska law, non-law enforcement can conduct “private persons arrest, which is commonly called a citizens arrest,” when they witness a crime being committed. This, they said, is what happened at Miller's event.
They also noted that the APD had “previously had contact with” DropZone, though would not go into specifics. But they added that in a city as small as Anchorage, there are limited options for private security firms so this is not unexpected.
A Google Streetview of the DropZone buillding, first flagged by The Daily Kos, depicts a pretty unimpressive establishment, with a camouflaged truck out front and a Gadsden flag waving in the window:
Mike Gerk, an apparent employee who lists DropZone as their employer on their MySpace page, is an ex-marine and ex-strip club bouncer in Anchorage. They posted pictures of them and two of their colleagues, each wearing “agent” shirts, aiming their guns at one “prisoner,” who in another photo (that has been taken down but is posted here) laying face-down on the ground. Another picture shows the “prisoner,” as Gerk describes him, being loaded into a DropZone SUV.
Hopfinger was released from DropZone's custody when the Anchorage Police showed up. They did not charge him, and said they were deferring the case to the Anchorage District Attorney's office.
Hopfinger did not immediately return TPM's request for comment.
The Department for Work and Pensions produces a national sanctions "scorecard" that contains precise information about how jobcentre districts are performing on stopping people's benefits, it has emerged.
The scorecard for January 2013 was sent to the Guardian after ministers and senior management denied that its information collection could be described as a "league table".
It breaks down the sanctions performance by district, and includes a column headed "direction of travel", with red and green arrows showing whether a district is up or down on the previous month's performance.
DWP ministers have acknowledged that they collect this data, but on Monday night Lord Freud told peers this was purely in order to "correct the anomalies".
A leaked email from the Walthamstow jobcentre in north London, reported last Thursday, appears to suggest the scorecard can be further broken down into individual jobcentres, but no clear evidence of this has yet been seen.
The email described Walthamstow as being "95th in the league table", with the manager telling their team that they had to improve their numbers.
The senior Jobcentre Plus manager Neil Couling made clear in a letter to staff last Friday that this information did not constitute league tables.
"We are quite keen to avoid any misunderstandings that there are targets attached to these," they told the Commons public accounts committee last week.
But the mounting documentary evidence and reports from staff suggest that on the ground these scorecards result in targets and pressure on staff who are not meeting apparently expected levels of sanctions.
Numerous jobseekers who have had their benefits stopped for weeks or months after being told they are not doing enough to find work have told of the hardship of being penalised and have disputed the fairness of the sanctions.
The numbers in the scorecard are revealing. They indicate that in January alone more than 85,000 sanctions were applied or upheld against claimants, and that most districts were down on the previous month's performance.
The spreadsheet shows detailed further information on sanctions: 24,000 of these "adverse decisions" came from referrals by work programme providers. Almost 1,400 decisions were made against recipients of employment and support allowance (sickness benefit).
The figures include referrals to mandatory work activity (MWA), with 1,442 claimants sent to work for their benefit during January. Arrows show almost all districts were increasing the numbers of people they sent to MWA.
Meanwhile, one of many jobcentre advisers to contact the Guardian in recent days has given a full explanation of the atmosphere and rules inside jobcentres.
They said: "There is officially no target to achieve referrals to DMA [decision-making and appeals] officers, but in Greater Manchester central and Cheshire district the target we don't have is 6% of our live load. Furthermore, despite not having a target to achieve these figures, all but two jobcentres within the district have had office-wide PIPs [performance improvement plans] imposed by the district manager specifically focused on increasing DMA referrals to increase 'off-flow' – the term used to mean ceasing to claim jobseeker's allowance.
"Across the north-west region the story is similar, with Greater Manchester east and west district having similar targets, now referred to as benchmarks, imposed.
"Whilst my work colleagues and I fully understand and support the need for sanctions to be applied to those claimants who are not actively seeking employment, who become unemployed voluntarily, who refuse reasonable offers of employment and those who fail to participate in courses, schemes and provision to help them into employment, the reality is that when targets are imposed, the focus shifts not to those abusing the benefits system but to the most vulnerable and easy-to-hit claimants, those with language barriers, caring responsibilities and those moving from other benefits having been found capable of working."
They continued: "Such is the focus on off-flow, the pressure to meet the targets creates perverse behaviours … but sadly is in no way reducing unemployment. To illustrate, a claimant who receives a four-week sanction for failing to show proof of actively seeking employment may then fail to attend the jobcentre to sign for their benefit, as no there is no financial benefit.
"After the sanction is served, they will make a fresh claim to jobseeker's allowance. The office in question will claim the off-flow, and the statistics look favourable. However, the cost of making a fresh claim to benefit in real terms is around £500 and is therefore [a] false economy at its worst in order to try to climb up the league table – which, despite all assurances, do exist within clusters, districts and regions for all departmental targets.
"Simply put, the targets imposed for sanctions is a way for district managers to fudge figures in order that they are seen to be doing their jobs, whereas the government continues to stress that the off-flow should always be into sustainable employment and is being kept in the dark about the reality. All advisers at my place of work and most in the district have been given mid-year review statements (on which performance-related pay is based) which include a target to achieve 6% DMA referrals, although again this has been widely denied."
A second adviser to contact the Guardian said they worked in a medium-sized jobcentre in the north-east of England, and said they were appalled at the attitude of management towards sanctions.
"I have been an adviser for many years and have always prided myself on the help I have given claimants, whilst still testing their conditionality and ensuring they were aware of their responsibilities. Now, however, the emphasis seems to be about persecuting claimants and all advisers are being pressured into referring claimants to the decision-makers in the hope that people will sign off and contribute to the off-flow target.
"At my last review I was told in no uncertain terms that I needed to start identifying more people to refer for sanctioning and, as my next review looms, I feel under pressure now to start picking on people, otherwise I will be put on a performance improvement plan."
The Kirby 25th Anniversary Orchestra Concert is getting a CD / DVD / Blu-Ray release: check out this post for more details!
***
A few weeks ago, it was announced that several orchestral concerts celebrating the 25th Anniversary would be held later this year (click here for more details). And last week, more details for those concerts were announced, with the list of guests and MC.
It turns out that Masahiro Sakurai themselves will attend the concert in Tokyo (on April 16th), as a special guest. The second special guest is none other than Makiko Ohmoto, the voice actor voicing Kirby, who will attend all three concerts. The very creator of the Kirby series, and the woman voicing the character itself… one could not have dreamed of better guests for concerts celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the series!
As for the MC, there will be two of them:
Mirin Furukawa, a singer;
Nozomi Yuzuriha, who used to be a television announcer and is now working freelance.
Here's when the two concerts will take place:
April 16th: Tokyo (Bunkamura Orchard Hall)
Conductor: Taizo Takemoto
Orchestra: Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra
Guests: Masahiro Sakurai, Makiko Ohmoto
Noon concert: 1.30PM (doors open at 12.45PM)
Evening concert: 6PM (doors open at 5.15PM)
June 18th: Osaka (Orix Theatre)
Conductor: Taizo Takemoto
Orchestra: Osaka Symphonic Orchestra
Guest: Makiko Ohmoto
Unfortunately, it's unlikely that all concerts will be livestreamed (like the one celebrating the release of The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D was, back in 2015). Hopefully, the production company and HAL Laboratory will release a CD and a DVD/Blu-Ray of the one of the concerts!

3568 ASCII, provisional designation 1936 UB, is a dark background asteroid from the outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 24 kilometers (15 miles) in diameter. It was discovered on 17 October 1936, by French astronomer Marguerite Laugier at the Nice Observatory in southwestern France. In 1988, the D-type asteroid was named after both the computer character code ASCII and the Japanese computer magazine with the same name.[1]
Orbit and classification [ edit ]
ASCII is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population.[3] It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.4–3.9 AU once every 5 years and 7 months (2,044 days; semi-major axis of 3.15 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.24 and an inclination of 19° with respect to the ecliptic.[2]
The body's observation arc begins with its observation as 1975 WZ 1 at the Karl Schwarzschild Observatory in November 1975, or more than 39 years after its official discovery observation at Nice.[1]
Physical characteristics [ edit ]
ASCII has an absolute magnitude of 11.8.[2] Based on the Moving Object Catalog (MOC) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the body has a spectral type of very dark D-type asteroid,[5] typically found in the outer main-belt and numerous among the Jupiter trojans. As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of this asteroid has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.[2]
Diameter and albedo [ edit ]
According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, ASCII measures 23.752 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.045.[4]
Naming [ edit ]
This minor planet was named after the acronym for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, ASCII, a computer character code and the name of a major Japanese magazine on microcomputers.[1] The name was proposed by Syuichi Nakano, who identified this asteroid during their stay at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; a stay which was partially funded by articles they wrote for the principal Japanese ASCII magazine. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 2 April 1988 (M.P.C. 12973).[6]
MELBOURNE Victory is preparing for life after Ange Postecoglou with the coach emerging as the favourite to take over the Socceroos post.
The Herald Sun understands that Victory has been made aware of Football Federation Australia's interest in the 48-year-old and discussions have taken place at Victory about a succession plan.
While Postecoglou has firmed the possibility remains that an outstanding overseas candidate comes into contention with FFA chief executive David Gallop and board member Phil Wolanski being bombarded with some interest overseas candidates.
Round 21 Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre
Gallop and Wolanski are still talking with overseas options as the Socceroos prepare to play Canada in a friendly tomorrow in London.
Guus Hiddink remains the preferred overseas candidate but their interest in returning to Australia is lukewarm at best while it's understood Central Coast coach Graham Arnold was informally contacted before the France game.
Victory is unlikely to seek compensation for Postecoglou, who has two years of a $500,000-a-year deal left, but want them to continue on in a dual role for the rest of the season before taking sole charge of the Socceroos in May, a month out from the 2014 World Cup.
FFA would prefer Postecoglou's sole focus was the Socceroos but aware of their importance to Victory who are aiming to win the A-League title and advance past the group stage of the Asian Champions League.
The governing body may be willing to compromise on a transitional dual-role before someone else takes over the Victory role for the tail-end of this season. Assistant Kevin Muscat would be frontrunner to take over.
Victory chief executive Robson said FFA had made no approach for Postecoglou and refused to speculate
"We haven't had an approach. We appreciate that there is a lot of interest surrounding Ange and possible links to the vacant Socceroos coaching position but we haven't had any formal conversations with the FFA about it," Robson said.
"It's the FFA's process and until and unless anything changes we're just going to continue with our plans and remain focused on achieving success next year.
"It's not for me to pre-judge or second guess what they may or may not do. But we appreciate that there's a lot of media interest that has surrounded Ange and speculation would suggest that he's in their thinking but it's not something that we can control and certainly not something we're aware of in a formal sense."
FFA is aiming to appoint Holger Osieck's replacement before November when the Socceroos are likely to play two friendlies.
Plans to play Ireland twice in Australia have fallen through and now there's a possibility that the games could be played abroad.
ShinoBOT, is a executable which is a RAT(Remote Access Trojan) simulator. You can remote-control your infected machine from the ShinoC2 (C&C server). You can execute any Windows commands, upload/download files, take a screen shot, everything you need to simulate an APT/targeted attack.
RAT features
Execute any command

C&CaaS
Usually, when you want to try a RAT, you must build a C&C server, prepare a global IP address, get a domain name. In case of ShinoBOT, the C&C server is provided as a service, so you just need to download the ShinoBOT.exe.
Password Protection and GUI
ShinoBOT has a GUI and shows a password. The only guy who knows the password can control the host. This is one of the most important things to make difficult ShinoBOT to be abused for the real attack.
Command Sharing
You can share your nice hacking command for everyone. If you are not familiar about the internal recon phase, you can refer other's command.
It wouldn't normally be that much of a story: bloke who plays rhythm guitar, stands at the back of the stage, never says anything, almost never gives interviews and when they do never says interesting, leaves band. In the hierarchy of rock'n'roll, the rhythm guitarist is hardly ever the hero: the singer or the lead guitarist swap top position, the bassist is usually last, and the drummer and the rhythm player swap places (if the drummer's particularly flashy, they or they might be perceived as the bigger star). The rhythm guitarist takes the role identified by Eric Cantona for Didier Deschamps in the French football team of the 1990s: the water carrier. The rhythm guitarist is the one who does the boring, unshowy stuff that enables the lead player to unleash those flashy solos.
But that so wholly undersells the role Malcolm Young played in 41 years with AC/DC, one of the greatest rock'n'roll bands ever, as to be meaningless. Young, who has now left the group they founded in November 1973 with their younger brother Angus, was the heartbeat of AC/DC, the very core of the band's unyielding, unrelenting, implacable throb.
The public face of AC/DC has always been the combination of singer and lead guitarist: Bon Scott or Brian Johnson with Angus Young. And many people, asked about AC/DC, would respond with talk of school uniforms, endless solos, and singers with screeching voices pouring out innuendo. But what made AC/DC great – and this may sound odd, describing a band whose onstage props include a giant inflatable woman, firing cannons and the “hell's bell” – has always been restraint. Malcolm Young was the master of making as little as necessary do as much as possible. The band's music was low input, high impact, so to speak.
Malcolm Young understood that a great riff does not need 427 components to make it great, that what it really needs is clarity. That meant stripping riffs down rather than building them up, and it also meant understanding volume. Given how loud AC/DC can be in concert – ear-ringingly, sternum-shakingly loud – it might be surprising to learn that, in the studio at least, Malcolm Young favoured quietness: they played with their amps turned down, but with the mics extremely close. That's why, on the great AC/DC albums, you hear not just the chords of the riffs, but their very texture, their burnished, rounded sound. It's why AC/DC are immediately recognisable, whether or not you know the song.
Crucial to that is space. The best AC/DC records are the ones where the guitars have room to breath, where the riffs chop rather than roar, and where the production and recording allow them to stand alone rather than drowning them in too many overdubs or aggressive mastering (it's why for many purists – me among them – the best AC/DC records are those produced by Harry Vanda and George Young, rather than the smash hits overseen Robert John “Mutt” Lange). These songs – She's Got Balls, Gone Shootin', Live Wire – are not the dumb heavy rock detractors claim. They're like perfect equations, beautiful in their formulation and resolution. Maybe AC/DC are the true “math rock” group, for understanding that maths is about answers, as well as puzzles.
The utter discipline of the riffs – the only showing off allowed is when it's time for Angus's solo, and on record some of those solos are surprisingly to-the-point – is an achievement in itself. For all their love of the blues and rock'n'roll records of the 1950s and 60s, and conviction that they were the bedrock of everything good about rock music, there must have been times when Malcolm fancied cutting loose. Maybe some arpeggios, or an acoustic guitar intro, a time signature change … surely they must have toyed sometimes with the idea of showing The Many Moods of Malcolm Young. But they never did, because AC/DC is a monolith, an edifice, and once its unity is compromised, it must start to crumble (which may explain why there's never been so much as a hint of a solo album from them or Angus).

Today, the songs of humpbacks are famous. They fill the halls of spas and they've been satirized by Pixar. But fifty years ago, they were largely unknown. That changed in 1968, when scientist Katy Payne and their then-husband Roger took a trip to Bermuda and met a Navy engineer who had been inadvertently recording the whales. “Tears flowed from our cheeks,” Payne later told NPR about the first time they heard the recordings. “We were just completely transfixed and amazed because the sounds are so beautiful, so powerful—so variable.”
The Paynes showed that the calls have a structure that strongly resembles human songs, that they change dramatically and irreversibly over time, and that they even contain repeated elements akin to human rhymes. Roger also released some of their own recordings in an album that became a surprising smash-hit, helping to spark the Save the Whales movement and ultimately leading to a ban on whaling.
It's only male humpbacks who sing, and they only do so during the breeding season. “We aren't sure whether it is for attracting mates or repelling rivals but it has something to do with mating,” says Ellen Garland. The songs are hierarchical. Single sounds—units—are grouped into phrases, which are repeated to form themes, which are delivered in a specific order to create a song.
At any given time, all the males in a population sing the same song, but those songs also change. Like jazz musicians, males riff off the classics, making small tweaks as they go. And occasionally, they throw the current song out the window and take up a completely new one—revolution, rather than mere evolution. “We think that the males change their songs to be a bit different to other whales around them, and be more attractive to the ladies,” says Garland. “This is then reeled in by the need to conform, which is the same as with humans. In our society, when a new fashion appears, a few savvy people embrace it and everyone else quickly follows.”
In 2011, Garland and Noad showed that these revolutions take place very quickly, and across entire oceans. Like “cultural ripples,” songs that arise in one end of the Pacific can spread to the other within a few years, “This is incredibly quick,” says Garland, “as whales need to learn all the intricacies of the new song.”
To understand more about how this process happens, Garland and their team analyzed recordings that caught humpbacks in the act of switching songs. These mash-ups, where the whales were blending both old and new melodies, were so rare that the team had only recorded five in over 20 years of fieldwork—and one was too poor in quality to use.
Still, the other four hybrids revealed a clear pattern: The humpbacks were combining themes from both old and new songs, but leaving each individual theme largely untouched. Sometimes, they sang a transitional phrase to bridge the gap between the two segments. Sometimes, they melded one song into another at places that were musically similar, like the world's largest deejays.

If demographics is everything, Mathew Bond's age is their distinguishing feature. Bond is unlucky enough to be 32. A councillor with the District of North Vancouver, they are the youngest member of the district council by a comfortable margin.
Outside of their council duties, they are a transportation systems engineer. Their wife, Michelle, works in the movie industry. Between the two of them they earn a good income.
Yet Bond, their wife and their 15-month-old baby girl, Wilhelmina, live in a rented one-bedroom basement suite in Lynn Valley.
“We pay $1,000 a month,” Bond said. “It's a smokin' deal. We only have one window, though, so it comes at a price.”
They would like something less subterranean. But as are many couples their age, Bond and their wife are victims of exquisitely bad timing. They are of that generation where the rise of the real estate market has outstripped their ability to save for a down payment.
“When we did move over here, we were looking at houses as well. At that point in our lives, we were just out of school and getting our careers established and looking at student loans we had to pay off, and we figured that would take us about four years.”
Because they were planning on having another child they wanted something with three bedrooms.
“So at that time, we were looking at houses in Lynn Valley that were $800,000 fixer-uppers, and I'm a bit of a handyman, and we thought we could save up for a down payment for five years, and then we could fix it up ourselves and that would be good. But today, that $800,000 in Lynn Valley will only get you a two-bedroom apartment. And now a three-bedroom apartment down the street is a million bucks. So our expectations have definitely changed.”
They became resigned to not owning a single-family home.
“And even if we do come up with $200,000 or $250,000 for a down payment, we were probably going to be saddled with a million-dollar mortgage pretty much for the next 25 years and committing ourselves to working 80 hours a week. And that's not how we want to raise a family.”
Their housing difficulties began to inform their politics. Bond has become the unofficial voice for a generation — on the North Shore, at least — that can no longer afford to own a home there.
“One goal that I had when I ran for council was to provide a different perspective. In looking at previous councils, I saw a lot of people not under the age of 40, that didn't necessarily have a background in transportation and urban studies. (In addition to their engineering degree, Bond has their certificate in sustainable urban development.)
“So I didn't see someone that was speaking on behalf of people under 40, of families with younger kids that didn't already own their own homes. There's a lot of people less fortunate than myself that must be having a heck of a lot harder time than myself, and we need to look out for them and make our policies supportive of those people.”
To him, housing affordability is more than just a generational issue. It's also one of densification. They estimate that 60 to 65 per cent of the district is still comprised of single-family homes, a preponderance that has created housing stock most people can no longer afford. Blue-collar and middle-class families have been priced out, and with them the service people that make a city go. Meanwhile, Bond said, the district's population has stagnated for the last 15 years. According to BC Stats, they said, it was 85,000 in 2001: it's 85,000 in 2016.
So while an older generation resists change that could affect traffic and services, and impact the bucolic quality of their neighbourhoods, their resistance — which Bond said they completely understand and sympathizes with — has unintended consequences for a younger generation.
“It's going to be my kids and their kids affected, and so the question is, is the way our community being currently developed going to provide them the same opportunities that it did to the people who moved here 30 years ago?
“My answer to the question is: If we don't do anything, there are consequences to trying to stay the same.”
He'd like to see the district consider much more different and denser forms of housing to accommodate a younger generation of families — two- and three-bedroom apartments and condos, townhomes and row houses, co-ops and, as they and Michele are considering, co-housing. Co-housing — several examples of which exist in Metro Vancouver — is a group, self-financed form of housing where families share facilities like a common kitchen, playground or laundry rooms.
“It's basically a group of families that get together and develop a townhouse project for themselves, and there are some principles about things like shared common space and more of a community living feeling, so you get to meet and know your neighbours before you move in.”
The irony of this? Bond's co-housing group is still looking for a development site. Given the cost of real estate, they may end up locating outside the district.
Bond would have to move out of the very constituency they were elected to serve.

First, I'm not implying that the metric system has been around forever—it hasn't been, more like since around 1790—rather, I've been investigating where measurement standards might have come from prior to the development of writing. No one can say for sure when measurements started, all researchers can do is infer information based on archeological evidence.
Most of the sources I've come across gloss over the prehistory of measures by pointing to the standards found in Mesopotamia and then move forward from there. Me, I'm more curious than that and thought it might be interesting to cover some ground that others might not have.
So here's where I'm currently coming from: I believe there is an intersection between agriculture, the development of cities, architecture, astronomy and even the division of labor that related to the development of measures. I'll go into these points in more detail in future posts while I continue to work on my metric system history book during my off hours from my day job.
Standards needed for permanent buildings
One of the oldest cities that has been documented is Uruk (from around the fourth millennium BCE.)
However, this site is very complex and it is unlikely it was the first attempt at a city but older, smaller, less-complex examples either no longer exist or have yet to be discovered. I posit that before these multi-people, multi-year building projects could begin, everyone had to agree what the standard measure was to be used, such as the much better-known cubit that was used in Egypt from around 3,000 BCE.
But let's go even further back. In fact, let's go back to around 9,000 BCE.
I'm starting from this date because it appears this was about the time that the last ice age ended and agriculture began. (The farther you go back in time, the sketchier the dates become so you might come across a source that differs from this. I had to start somewhere and I'm not in a position to argue with scholars who have spent much more time on these issues than I have.)
Back then, people were hunter/gatherers and if they settled anywhere, it wasn't for very long and permanent structures were not needed. Some research I've come across indicates that people may have already domesticated some animals and they might have, for instance, moved sheep or other animals around with them.
I've also come across other information that the earliest agriculture may have been less planting of things in rows, as we currently think of such practices today, and more cultivation of helpful things.
Okay, so, it's 8,500 BCE and near our settlement (likely near a water source) we come across some blueberry bushes. On either side of these food-bearing plants are some other plants that are less helpful since they flower but don't provide sustenance.
It's likely we figure out that by cutting back, or eliminating, the plants that weren't so helpful and tending to the blueberry bush by watering, and possibly fertilizing, it is a richer harvest results make the efforts worth our while.
Over time, it likely made sense that people started to transplant the beneficial plants closer to each other for efficiency. (There's a reason you don't keep kitchen equipment scattered around the house.)
Once the investment has been made in cultivating plants, it's reasonable to expect that people kept closer tabs on their efforts and spent more time in one place, they'd want a home that would last more than a couple of seasons.
That got me thinking about how long buildings typically last. Once site I came across indicates that modern buildings can last more than 50 years. But, what about more “primitive” ones?
I found YouTube videos that show how to build circular dwellings from saplings and primitive tools in one case, and another video on how to build a wattle and daub hut, with the roof of the second building showing signs of rot only four months after construction.
Interestingly, in the first case, the builder needed to measure equidistant sides for the hut from a center post. In essence, they created a standard made from a sapling that might only be used for that one hut, but they did need a standard unit to make even a primitive building.
Had two people worked on the sapling hut, they would have both needed to use that same measure for the hut to have properly turned out.
Perhaps, in this case, as Protagoras of Abdera indicated thousands of years ago, man is the measure of all things…
I'll write more next month and in the meantime, I'll slog through more research on the ancient world and possibly confuse myself.

Last week in the Pac-12 proved to be a good one as UCLA narrowly beat Utah on a Thursday night in Salt Lake. Stanford and Washington proved their status as some of the top teams in the conference as they battled in a tight game, with Stanford ultimately prevailing. However, my record took a hit as I only went 3-2, putting my season record at 24-3. This week also has a top 25 matchup with Oregon and Washington, and will be the first time since 2010 that Lane Kiffin isn't coaching USC. Expect to see some great games and great plays, but before we watch the games, let's take a look at my Pac-12 week 7 preview and predictions:
Arizona @ USC
Both Arizona and USC are coming off bye weeks, following losses to Washington and Arizona State respectively. All eyes will be on USC this week, since this will be the first game where Lane Kiffin won't be on the Trojan sideline. USC named Ed Orgeron as their interim coach, and all reports coming out of USC say that the team is having fun and ready to play up to Coach Orgeron's expectations. They will need to do just that if they plan on beating Arizona and their rushing attack. The jury is still out on Arizona quarterback B.J. Denker as they had been running the ball well, but has been very unimpressive throwing the ball. They will have quite the task on Thursday as they look to silence their critics. For USC, running back Silas Redd looks to play in their first game all season on Thursday, which will only help Cody Kessler and Co. I do expect to see a rejuvenated USC team come Thursday. Since it's a home game, I'll take the Trojans to beat the Wildcats.
USC 27 Arizona 17
#2 Oregon @ #16 Washington
What a tough stretch for the Huskies. After losing a heartbreaker to a top five team in Stanford, they host the second ranked Ducks on Saturday. Lately, Oregon has been dominating Washington, winning the last nine previous match-ups. If Washington is going to have any chance at winning this game, they are going to need to cut down on their penalties. They are one of the worst teams in the nation in penalty yardage, averaging 91.8 per game. They will also need their defense, who has played exceptionally well thus far, to come ready to play. They will look to slow down the Duck offense, which is arguably the best offense in the country. Oregon will have their first true test this season against a ranked opponent, as their previous games haven't even been competitive. I expect Washington to give Oregon their best game so far as Bishop Sankey looks to lead their side, but in the end, the Ducks will prove their dominance over the Huskies and extend their streak of wins over Washington to ten.
Oregon 41 Washington 27
#5 Stanford @ Utah
Utah has had a tough two week stretch, having played UCLA last week and then hosting number five ranked Stanford. Utah also lost a heartbreaker to UCLA as they flirted with the possibility of upsetting the Bruins, but it is hard to win a game while throwing for six interceptions. Stanford, on the other hand, comes into this game a week after beating Washington, with their quarterback Kevin Hogan posting some pedestrian numbers. They only threw for 100 yards, including one interception, and they only ran for 24 yards. Utah will be bringing pressure as they have forced 18 sacks this season, putting them in the lead of the Pac-12. We will see if Hogan can bounce back and be the quarterback that we love to watch or continue on their mediocre path. However, I do think that Stanford will escape Salt Lake with a win, mainly because of their stout defense.
Stanford 34 Utah 24
Colorado @ Arizona State
Colorado comes stumbling into this one after being blown out in their last two games and not winning a game in over a month. Quarterback Connor Wood has yet to find their early season form where they looked to be one of the best surprises in the Pac-12. But lately, they haven't been the same and has thrown only two touchdowns along with four picks in their last two games. After losing to Notre Dame and dropping out of the Top 25, Arizona State looks to get back on track. Wide receiver Jaelen Strong is continuing to impress with over 500 yards through five games, including three touchdowns. I expect Arizona State to win at home as they try to get back into the Top 25 rankings.
Arizona State 38 Colorado 14
California @ #11 UCLA
Head Coach Jim Mora has been using the 43-17 defeat they had to Cal last year as motivation for this year's players. They have been harping on their kids not to overlook teams as the Bruins were 25th in the nation when they got blown out by Cal. As for Cal, their schedule just keeps getting harder and harder for first year coach Sonny Dykes. This will be the fourth ranked opponent they have faced, and two of them are ranked in the top five. Jared Goff and Chris Harper will look to beat UCLA through the air as Goff threw for over 500 yards against Washington State. After letting Connor Halliday throw for 521 yards, Cal will also need to tune something up in their secondary. I think Brett Hundley and the Bruin offense will have no problems with the Cal defense. Expect to see a wide margin of separation between these two teams by the fourth quarter.
UCLA 45 Cal 17
Oregon State @ Washington State
Expect to see a lot of passing in this one. Both quarterbacks are top ten in the nation for passing yards per game with Sean Mannion averaging 403.6 yds and Connor Halliday averaging 332.2 yds. One thing you won't see in this game is rushing, since both teams are ranked 121st and 122nd in the nation respectively. Oregon State looks forward to having running back Storm Woods back after a concussion they suffered in their victory over Utah. Brandin Cooks is looking to be the best wide receiver in the nation.  They are making a strong case for the Biletnikoff Award, amassing over 800 yards and nine touchdowns. The Cougars will need Halliday to be in command of their offense, meaning no interceptions. This will be difficult, since they have had the interception bug all year. The secondary of Oregon State will be tested, as they are led by cornerback Steven Nelson who is tied for first in the nation in interceptions with four. I expect Oregon State to beat the Cougars, with big days from Mannion and Cooks.

MLB Network's first-ever Social Media Awards were handed out Sunday night, with the Dodgers taking five of the honors back to Los Angeles. Rookie sensation Yasiel Puig was responsible for two of them, winning the Socially Savvy Rookie and #SAW (Stop-And-Watch) awards.
Hollywood is the home of America's entertainment industry, celebrities and stars. It's apparently also the primary residence of baseball's social media superstars, too.
Hollywood is the home of America's entertainment industry, celebrities and stars. It's apparently also the primary residence of baseball's social media superstars, too.
MLB Network's first-ever Social Media Awards were handed out Sunday night, with the Dodgers taking five of the honors back to Los Angeles. Rookie sensation Yasiel Puig was responsible for two of them, winning the Socially Savvy Rookie and #SAW (Stop-And-Watch) awards.
MLB.com hosted the balloting and the Social Media team at MLB Advanced Media came up with the nominees based on analytical data.
The 2013 season was a big one for social media and baseball. The @MLB Twitter account has more than 3.3 million followers, and its Facebook account is closing in on 5 million likes. And the MLB Instagram account took off like a home run in 2013, hitting 673,000 more followers.
Overall, MLB and its 30 teams have more than 12 million followers on Twitter, 40 million followers on Facebook and 3.5 million followers on Instagram.
Orioles third baseman Manny Machado took home the biggest honor of the night, as their incredible grab and throw from deep in foul territory to first base was named the #OMG! Play of the Year.
And what would the Social Media Awards be without a Favorite Follow and Tweet of the Year? Reds second baseman Brandon Phillips -- perhaps better known in these awards as @DatDudeBP -- was voted the most entertaining follow in the Majors. Meanwhile, Blue Jays reliever Steve Delabar pressed "Send" on the year's best tweet when they had their young daughter involved in their #FinalVote campaign.
The year's Most Tweeted Moment occurred during the All-Star Game festivities, as A's outfielder Yoenis Cespedes and the #HRDerby hashtag captured the country's attention. And the Most Tweeted Game of the Year was also the last one: the Red Sox's Game 6 World Series-clinching victory over the Cardinals, which prompted about 1.7 million tweets.
But the Dodgers were the biggest stars of the MLB Network broadcast. Puig was elected the game's top attraction as each of their at-bats and throws from the outfield practically became must-see viewing. They also earned the Socially Savvy Rookie Award with their steady stream of tweets and Instagram pictures courtesy of their @YasielPuig Twitter account.
The Dodgers also won the Snapshot of the Year Award, though not for anything that came out of Puig's smartphone. No, that honor came courtesy of a fantastic photo of Sandy Koufax and Clayton Kershaw, great left-handers past and present, following Los Angeles' National League Division Series win over Atlanta.
The Dodgers captured two more awards Sunday night. One came in the Best Team Promotion category, for iconic broadcaster Vin Scully's "Twitter takeover," while the Best Bite went to Nick Punto and actor Danny DeVito for the entertainer's surprise cameo in Punto's postgame interview.
The Dodgers couldn't claim the game's Celebrity Fan of the Year, however. That honor went to Cardinals fan/Bravo host Andy Cohen and Mets fan/comedian Jerry Seinfeld.
Robinson Cano received one last honor for their time with the Yankees, as they took part in the year's Best MLB Fan Cave Video. Cano dropped by the Fan Cave to surprise Nick D'Annibale, a 13-year-old Yankees fan with leukemia, hopping out of an ice cream truck and playing some ball on the streets of New York.
The Upton brothers beat out Torii's #Huntering, Craig's #Kimbreling, Will's #Middlebrooksing and Hawk Harrelson's #TWTW for the Best MLB Meme Award. And finally, Jason Kipnis' one-man grooming show, "The Art of Shaving," earned the Selfie of the Year Award.
SANA, Yemen — The Houthi movement and its allies formed a new government in Yemen on Monday, a surprise that angered their Saudi-backed rivals and complicated United Nations efforts to end a conflict that has ravaged the Arab world's poorest country for much of the past two years.
The announcement of the new government, reported by the Houthi-run state television and Saba news agency, said it was formed from “all walks of the political spectrum who are anti-aggression.”
The reference was a swipe at the coalition led by Saudi Arabia that supports Yemen's president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was driven into Saudi exile in 2014 after the Houthis routed them from Sana, the capital. The Houthis control a large portion of Yemen including Sana.
The Saudi coalition has been bombarding Houthi positions in Yemen since March 2015 with thousands of airstrikes that have raised worldwide criticism over civilian deaths and destruction.
Fred Hoiberg is coming off a tough season coaching the Bulls, but they don't plan on returning to college basketball anytime soon.
Hoiberg, who coached at Iowa State before heading to Chicago, stated Monday that there is one thing in college basketball that they may never miss.
"I hated recruiting," Hoiberg said, via Front Office Show's Keith Smith. "I absolutely f'ing hated recruiting. In the NBA it is just coaching. No other stuff. Just coaching."
The Bulls made the playoffs last season, but lost in the first round. They have since traded away star forward Jimmy Butler to the Timberwolves on draft day, and cut ties with Rajon Rondo.
Hoiberg explained that they were not a big part of Chicago's draft-day moves, and they were fine with that.
"Coaches don't have a big influence on draft and shouldn't," Hoiberg said. "Scouts are watching and gathering information. Coach gets involved much later.
"(It's) Important that coaches and front office have a good working relationship. (They) have to be on the same page with direction of franchise."
The Bulls appear to be in a rebuilding direction, which could suit Hoiberg's coaching style, and their ability to develop talent.
While Hoiberg may have been fed up with recruiting in college basketball, they may have to start recruiting star players in the NBA soon. The Bulls' front office will want to win eventually, and the current state of the NBA dictates a franchise must have two or three high-profile players to contend.
Welcome to Wyoming! Unless, apparently, you want to update science standards about climate change and evolution.
Photo by Phil Plait
Update, April 21, 2014: It's official: Science-denying Wyoming legislators have rejected adopting the Next Generation Science Standards (local media in the state have some choice words for those politicians). Sorry, Wyoming schoolchildren, but if you want to learn more about evolution and climate change in class you're on your own, unless you move to a state with a more enlightened government, or at least one with fewer science deniers making the rules.
I'm old enough to remember when the Republican Party stood for good science. And I've been paying attention over the years as that stance of the leaders of the party has not only eroded away, but actively reversed itself. I don't think it's too big a leap to associate that with the growth in power of the religious right when it comes to topics like evolution and with fossil fuel funding when it comes to climate change.
The latest battleground for the GOP attack on science is Wyoming. While many states are adopting new national science education standards—a set of benchmarks outlining students' science understanding in schools—the Wyoming Legislature has taken steps to specifically prevent the adoption of the new science standards outlined.
In a recent budget proposal, an amendment was proposed by state legislator Matt Teeters (R-Lingle), which makes sure the new science standards wouldn't get adopted:
… neither the state board of education nor the department shall expend any amount appropriated under this section for any review or revision of the student content and performance standards for science. This footnote is effective immediately.
This amendment simply defunds any attempt to review the science standards, killing any progress in that area. It's very much worth noting that these new standards include stating as facts such things as evolution and climate change, and that's precisely why the standards met with resistance in other states. Apparently, in Wyoming, the new science standards are such anathema that the legislators don't even want those in charge of education to review them.
I contacted Rep. Teeters' office asking for a statement about the amendment but did not receive a response.
We've seen state legislators fight against science in these exact same circumstances over and over again, and virtually every time it's because of far-right opposition to exactly these topics (and the Texas State Board of Education threw in other topics like history as well, hoping to improve the legacy of much maligned figures like—and yes, I'm serious—Joseph McCarthy).
The Wyoming governor, Republican Matt Mead, is an outspoken supporter of fossil fuels (not surprising, given that Wyoming is the No. 1 coal producing state in the union) and is also on record as denying global warming. They even went so far as to parrot the tired and long-debunked trope about having cold weather when the planet is heating up.
Despite recommendations from Wyoming educators to adopt the new science standards, Mead approved the new budget, science-standard-defunding amendment and all. Lisa Hoyos of Climate Parents claims the amendment was created specifically to stop the teaching of climate change.*
It's astonishing to me that so many people are trying so hard to stop reality. Perhaps what's worse is that I'm getting used to it. I've been clear over and again that I have some agreement with some overall Republican ideas (like having a government be no bigger than needed, for example) but the modern GOP establishment has grossly overreached many of its asserted planks and has become a parody of its former self. Republican lawmakers claim they want the government to stop legislating our lives, and then they spend every day legislating our lives. And now they want to legislate reality itself. They can try, but the thing about reality is, it's real. The planet is heating up, and it will continue to do so whether or not we sign bills into law that force us to stick our heads in the sand.
Science itself has many laws, but it doesn't give a damn about ours.
If you live in Wyoming and want to contact your state legislators, the Wyoming government page helpfully tells you how.
Correction, May 5, 2014: Lisa Hoyos' last name was originally misspelled.
We became a generation who tries to do the most things with the least amount of effort. What once were plans to meet up with people and have real conversations turned into Facebook messages saying “Wow ur hot.”
Receiving flowers became receiving likes on Instagram — or if you're lucky, becoming someone's “#WCW.” We have access to most of the world's information and rather than use it to do more and fuel creative ways to show our affections, we use it to put forth as little amount of labor as possible. In addition to a lazy collection of individuals, we are a stubborn bunch as well. We know we hold a ton of knowledge, yet rather than admit we've used it selfishly, we decided to shine an unflattering light onto the ones who put in effort. We told them they try too hard and feel too much. That they are overbearing and unrealistic. We made them relationships pariahs and threw our own parade boasting swipe right and friends with benefits (well, a parade requires too much planning…maybe we just waved a banner instead.)
As a result, we flirt through emojis, we exchange selfies on Snapchat, occasionally fall into a bed or two without a real commitment, and call it normal.
This is not normal.
We are afraid of the ones who do too much. Afraid of the guys who tell you how they feel, straight forward. The ones who text you right back when you send a good afternoon text. The ones who have no issue holding your hand on crowded sidewalks and call you beautiful when you feel anything but. They seem overwhelming and maybe even emotional – terrifying and unusual. Our current dating culture tells that someone who invests their time looks like the one who texts you every two minutes if you don't text them back. The one who get irrationally upset if you don't respond right away to their “acts of kindness.” The one who cries or screams if they don't hear the “I love you too” response when they declare their passion. Effort means overbearing.
So when someone walks into our lives that is straight-forward, that compliments every day, that wants to make an official title for whatever you two have, it seems too much. It seems abnormal and strange because we want to keep them arms length and have multiple shallow relationships than a more meaningful deep one. We are told to avoid the ones who feel too much because they will attach themselves like a leech and drain you of all your emotional energy. They will try to fill up every slot of your time and never give you your space. That they will say “I love you” the first day and try to force you into feeling things you aren't ready for.
You've got it all wrong.
It is not weird if a guy wants to text you every single day. It is not weird if a guy wants to take you out on dates and spend time with you. It is not weird if a guy wants to be in an established relationship with you. What is weird is telling a person they are weird for having feelings.
What is weird is being afraid of guys who make an effort, not because they want a confidence boost or another notch in their belt, but because they genuinely care about you. Guys who try are not always ones who try to suck away your independence and glue themselves to your side. They are ones who see that you're someone worth talking to and worth spending time with. They find you attractive and interesting – Ïthey want to get to know you even better. When someone wants this, and goes out of their way to show it, we shouldn't call it weird.
So give the guy who makes the effort a chance. I promise if you do, you'll find it is much more normal than you expected.
UPDATE #2: A second patch for console versions of Aliens: Colonial Marines has been deployed, in addition to the update listed below.
Amongst a multitude of bugfixes and tweaks, the glitch that showed Xenos displaying "erratic animations" (jazz hands) is now gone.
There's now an increased light radius for player's shoulder lamp (a common complaint) and tweaked enemy and friendly AI to be "more aggressive and responsive" (presumably so you can't just run straight past them now).
The full list of fixes is now available over on Gearbox's blog.
UPDATE: The Aliens: Colonial Marines patch has been released for PC.
Steam will automatically download the patch, which weighs in at a whopping 3.8GB. It includes the changes that were in the recent update for the console versions as well as some additional changes that will be part of future updates for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
The PC-specific changes include improved texture resolution, various visual improvements, the addition of a mouse smoothing option and some fixes for PC-only crashes.
"Sega and Gearbox have been working to identify areas of improvement," Sega said in a blog post. "Many fixes are already available now in today's patch, and console versions of these updates will be made available as soon as possible. Thank you for all your feedback."
The patch notes are on Gearbox's forum.
ORIGINAL STORY: The first post-release patch for the Gearbox co-developed Aliens: Colonial Marines has been released on Xbox Live today with PS3 and PC versions to follow shortly.
As detailed on Gearbox's Software Support page, this initial update fixes numerous campaign and multiplayer bugs like players falling through the floor, co-op partners not reviving properly, the flamethrower automatically firing on its own, and faulty warping for co-op players.
Gearbox noted on Twitter that "updates for Aliens: Colonial Marines on PC and PlayStation 3 are on the way as well - notes will be posted as they become available."

Just three short years ago, Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane appeared a lone voice of sanity in a world fanatically-religious Keynesian-esque worshippers. Admissions in 2013 (on blowing bubbles) and 2014 (on Too Big To Fail "problems from hell") also gave us pause that maybe someone in charge of central planning might actually do something to return the world to some semblance of rational 'free' markets. We were wrong! Haldane appears to have fully transitioned to the dark side, as The Telegraph reports, they made the case for the "radical" option of supporting the economy with negative interest rates, and even suggested that cash could have to be abolished.
Speaking at the Portadown Chamber of Commerce in Northern Ireland, as The Telegraph reports, Mr Haldane's support for a possible cut in rates came as the Bank as a whole has signalled that the next move in rates would be up.
Andy Haldane, one of the Bank's nine interest rate setters, made the case for the "radical" option of supporting the economy with negative interest rates, and even suggested that cash could have to be abolished. They said that the "the balance of risks to UK growth, and to UK inflation at the two-year horizon, is skewed squarely and significantly to the downside". As a result, "there could be a need to loosen rather than tighten the monetary reins as a next step to support UK growth and return inflation to target".
But recent volatility in financial markets, prompted by China, and a decision by the US Federal Reserve to delay rate hikes, have pushed back expectations of the Bank's first rate rise to November 2016.
Traditionally policymakers have resisted cutting rates below zero because when the returns on savings fall into negative territory, it encourages people to take their savings out of the bank and hoard them in cash. This could slow, rather than boost, the economy. It would be possible to get around the problem of hoarding by abolishing cash, Mr Haldane said
Interestingly, one idea, Haldane told an audience of business owners in Northern Ireland, could be to scrap cash and adopt a state-issued digital currency like Bitcoin. Although widely reviled as the currency for drug dealers and criminals, Haldane said Bitcoin's distributed payment technology had ‘real potential'. Which may explain the Fed's sudden fascination in the virtual currency.
NIRP - it would appear - is about to global.
So Haldane has gone from worrying that "financial markets were detaching themselves too materially from fundamentals" and fearing the "biggest risk to global financial stability right now it would be a disorderly reversion in the yields of government bonds globally," the BoE's chief economist has not only called for policies which will enable an even bigger bond bubble but will also remove freedom from the people to do what 'they' think is best with their capital. Indoctrination is complete (or more ominously, is there something Haldane sees that has driven them to this extremist perspective?)
Allison Arieff on design and architecture.
Marion Belanger + 20×200.com
Is there anything made in America that's less innovative than the single-family home? While we obsess over the new in terms of what we keep in our houses — the ever-increasing speed and functionality of our Smartphones, entertainment options built into refrigerators, sophisticated devices that monitor, analyze and report on our sleep cycles, even the superior technology of the running shoes we put on before heading out the flimsy fiberboard door — we're incredibly undemanding of the houses themselves. These continue to be built the same way they have for over a century, and usually not as well. Walls and windows are thin, materials cheap, design (and I use the term loosely) not well-considered. The building process is a protracted affair, taking far too long and creating embarrassing amounts of building waste (over 50 percent of all waste produced in the United States, in fact).
But the lack of innovation extends beyond the high-tech. Not so long ago homes were designed to make the most of their surrounding climate and terrain. Vernacular forms like the shotgun, in places like New Orleans, served a purpose that went far beyond aesthetics — they encouraged natural cooling by improving cross-ventilation. In Texas and New Mexico, thick adobe walls similarly kept heat in during the winter, and out during the summer. Houses were sited and windows placed to maximize or minimize sun exposure as needed.
No longer. Today, it's essentially the same floor plan, sheetrock and construction that's used coast to coast. Glossy brochures with stock images of smiling families advertise “Spanish Gothic” or “Tuscan Villa,” but what's really on offer is the same dumb box with a stage set of a façade tacked onto the front. The reasons behind the advertised vernacular styles have long since disappeared, their function surrendered to ornament.
It's not that the means don't exist for better building. There have been significant advances in homebuilding: smarter, safer, more sustainable materials that contribute to healthier and more energy-efficient structures (less expensive to heat and cool); precision building technologies that reduce construction time and waste; and more enlightened planning principles that recognize the social, economic and health benefits of building homes within denser, more walkable neighborhoods (important as sprawl is associated with high levels of driving, which contributes to air pollution, and air pollution leads to morbidity and mortality).
Why? The reasons are complicated. Incentives received by commercial builders for doing the right thing are not extended to residential builders. But it's also true that the homebuilding industry isn't interested in risk or change, despite (in spite of?) dramatic slowdowns in residential construction, an anticipated surplus of thousands of homes, a market besieged by foreclosures and still-dropping home values. Even though there's increasing demand for more diverse housing — especially smaller, more energy-efficient homes and multifamily units in more walkable communities — too many homebuilders are inexplicably committed to the status quo.
For many in the homebuilding industry, the current scenario is seen not as a call to action but as a temporary problem of the market (I found the same thing to be true in the world of shopping-center builders, who pine for — and fully expect the return of — a go-go consumer culture that is likely gone for good). To address current market realities, they don't look to innovation but rather to an easier fallback strategy: a new marketing plan.
Five years ago, at the crest of the housing boom, I worked on a team consulting with a master planned-community developer who had asked us to help “revolutionize the way our homes are sold.” The developer had little interest in the work we proposed — namely, to revolutionize the way their homes were designed and built. That company, like most of its competitors, laid off nearly half its work force the following year, and ended or delayed most of its future development projects. Devoting energy to how best to market its inventory hadn't been the most forward-thinking strategy for them then — nor would it be now.
But that's what most developers continue to do. I read just last month about Fulton Homes, a homebuilding company that seems to be weathering the housing market better than its peers by selling homes the same way they'd sell clothing or computers, like any other retail product. In Builder online, Fulton's vice president of operations, Dennis Webb, said, “If the buyer wants it, give it to him.”
Fulton hasn't really changed anything about the homes they produce, regardless of what has happened over the last several years. They've simply hired more sales guys. No doubt you can “like” them on Facebook. In the short term, this has been a prudent move … but what about next year? The year after that?
Blu Homes
Then there's a company like Blu Homes, which has demonstrated a clear commitment to merging housing and high tech — to the tune of a $25 million investment, in fact. They recognized the tremendous inefficiencies in home-building and have developed 3D technology that allows for personal customization (clients can click a mouse to alter floor plans, choose green features and select finishes), as well as a proprietary building process and innovative steel-framing technology that allows their homes, as their Web site explains, “to be built to the highest aesthetic and environmental standards and be delivered quickly and economically nationwide.”
But following a long line of V.C. types dabbling in housing, Blu has set its sights on a small slice of an already niche market — high-end modern prefab, which accounts for maybe half of a percent of the less than 5 percent of architect-designed homes in the country. Devoting this much R&D and software development to so few homes feels akin to installing a $250,000 solar array on a garden shed. Why not devote that energy to transforming cookie-cutter developer homes?
Lake Flato
I like what Texas's Lake Flato is doing in this arena, combining vernacular style with precision building technology for their Porch House. Though the firm is building custom one-offs, they are also working on a number of larger projects — one, in Louisiana, involves building nine homes on two blocks of infill property in a historic Baton Rouge neighborhood. The concept is centered around making better use of backyards (less lawn, more sustainable garden) and using the traditional architecture vernacular for that area — the “shotgun” house.
Lake Flato
And even more promising in terms of scale is KB Home's announcement of the ZeroHouse 2.0, a greener version of the company's standard home, which is expected to eliminate monthly electricity charges for homeowners. Model homes featuring the ZeroHouse 2.0 package (it should be but isn't yet standard) open this month in Tampa, San Antonio and Austin. (Now, if KB would just start talking with the architects at Lake Flato.)
KB Homes
Even more prudently, a company like Blu could be directing all that R&D to multi-family housing, currently identified as the only bright spot in residential architecture and, to my mind, the only real path to truly sustainable housing.
As architectural designer Aron Chang discusses in one of the more intellectually rigorous and thoughtful pieces on suburbia that I've read of late, which appeared in Places journal last month, it's time we focus on “suburbia's essential component” — the freestanding single-family house.
Chang writes, “The disconnection between the rising diversity of housing needs and the monotony of housing production speaks to the tenacity of the postwar American dream — the enduring allure of the detached house with front lawn and backyard patio — as well as to the profitability of catering to these aspirations.”
Chang sees this moment — with millions of houses now in foreclosure, many deteriorating or abandoned — as one to seize, and I couldn't agree more. It is possible, they consider, that once the economy revives we will simply return to home-building-as-usual:
But right now we have an opportunity to rethink suburban housing: to make it responsive not to dated demographics and wishful economics but rather to the actual needs of a diversifying and dynamic population — not only to the so-called traditional households but also to the growing ranks of those who prefer to rent rather than buy, who either can't afford or don't want a 2,000-square-foot-plus detached house, who are retired and living on fixed incomes and maybe driving less, who want granny or nanny flats, who want to pay less for utilities and reduce their carbon footprint, and so on.
Housing can't be equated with high-tech: a home is, or was, a long-term investment not beholden to the dizzying speeds of change and innovation that drive say, Apple, which must continually reinvent and redefine its product to meet consumer demand. But housing is woefully behind the times, and now it needs to see opportunity in crisis, not wait it out by launching pop-up shops and interactive Web sites that empower consumers to such revolutionary things as customizing bathroom tile and kitchen backsplashes.
I don't care if we're talking Le Corbusier, Cape Cods or Corinthian columns, we can't make any progress in housing until we stop thinking about the home as decorative object and begin considering it as part of a larger whole. How does it work on the street? In the neighborhood? How is it served by transit? Is it adaptable, allowing for the housing of extended families or the hosting of an entrepreneurial endeavor? Can the owner build an accessory dwelling (a.k.a. granny flat) to do so? (Most zoning, homeowners' associations and CCRs don't allow for it currently.) What needs to happen to zoning, to financing, to our very notions of resale value to change the suburban condition — and by extension, the American Dream as we know it?
We're beyond the point of a fresh coat of paint and a new sales pitch. If we're going to continue to hold on to the single-family home, we need to transform it. There is a demand for smaller, more energy-efficient homes in less car-dependent neighborhoods; all aspects of the industry, from designers to lenders to planners to consumers, should meet it. In this era of anti-government fervor, subsidizing the American Dream isn't an option; transforming it is the only one we've got.

Few bands could compose a convincing soundtrack for our apocalyptic election year and the slow-blooming Occupy spring. But Anti-Flag's The General Strike suits these chaotic times, delivering a bracing sonic snapshot of a superpower off its rocker.
LISTEN: ‘This Is the New Sound' by Anti-Flag Free download (MP3)
“In The General Strike , we celebrate those who bring a new vision for the world to the table,” Anti-Flag vocalist and guitarist Justin Sane told Wired in an e-mail interview. “People who stand for workers rights, human rights, a just representative political system, and a new mode of doing business where sustainability is the norm not the exception.”
Anti-Flag , a punk band from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that celebrates its 25th anniversary next year, was screaming truth-to-power back when hordes of Occupy‘s populist strivers were in diapers or yet to be born. The group has built a respectable catalog of ferocious full-lengths stuffed with punk stomps over the years.
On the new record, released last week, Anti-Flag serves up a worldview that stands in stark contrast to a society that worships business leaders like late Apple chief Steve Jobs.
“The reality is that a consumer culture which chucks out its iPhones for a new version every nine months is completely unsustainable, because Earth has already reached the tipping point,” Sane said. “ The General Strike attempts to personalize these issues and encourage listeners to look for a new model. Because one does exist.”
The General Strike ‘s focus on political and financial inequity should satisfy the Occupy movement and others distrustful of Wall Street and the White House. Tracks like “Nothing Recedes Like Progress” and “Bullshit Opportunist” blister the rich and chastise the apathetic. “This Is the New Sound,” available as a free download above left, is an impassioned plea for a blue-collar uprising. It's also the bruised backbone of the tragically hilarious video below, wherein Sane and crew are tortured by sadistic Muppet lookalikes, courtesy of an Anti-Flag tag-team with Amnesty International.
“President Obama looks suspiciously like President Bush, a man on a quest for American Empire.”
“The video takes aim at the danger and absurdity of the recent passage of the National Defense Authorization Act,” Sane said. “Like Amnesty, we share a strong conviction that human rights must be respected, and America isn't fooling anyone into thinking it has a corner on those rights when it denies them to people at home and abroad. With the NDAA, their failure to close Guantanamo Bay and the ramping use of drones, President Obama looks suspiciously like President Bush, a man on a quest for American Empire.”
But it's becoming clearer that empire is as unsustainable as hyperconsumption, and for that we can thank technology as much as we can blame it, said Sane. As a tool of engagement and enrichment, technology has revolutionized sociopolitical and socioeconomic participation, laying the foundation for an alluring new strain of worldwide post-capitalism.
We just need to work out some bugs.
“Technology isn't the enemy, it is our ally,” Sane said. “But only if we adopt a new model that puts people before profit. I realize that we seem far from that model, but I have seen it in action and it is a beautiful thing. So I'm not willing to give up yet. Hope is the last thing to die.”
A city labor commission is urging Berkeley City Council to adopt a resolution aimed at halting what it calls “attacks” on a local nurse workforce and improving staff levels at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center.
Berkeley's Commission on Labor put forward an item to City Council alleging that the hospital has pressured nurses to work in unsafe conditions and has engaged in mass violations of nurses' rights. But a representative of Sutter Health, an affiliate of Alta Bates, said allegations put forward by the commission are false.
“I want to assure you that Alta Bates Summit is committed to providing the highest quality care available, and we do this by meeting all required staffing ratios, and patient and nurse safety standards,” wrote Stacey Wells, regional vice president of communications and public affairs at Sutter Health, in a letter to Mayor Tom Bates and City Council.
But Anne Stewart, a labor representative for the California Nurses Association, said the hospital is trying to initiate a corporate restructuring of healthcare in order to maximize profit under the pretenses of needing to cut back financially.
One example they gave of corporatization was the hospital's allegedly flawed patient census — which they said excludes many who stay for fewer than 72 hours — so the hospital can reduce its staff. Ultimately, they said, the hospital's actions will result in issues such as delayed care and longer waiting times in the emergency room.
Additionally, Stewart said insurance benefits for nurses and their families have been cut.
In the commission's recommendation to City Council, nonunionized nurses hired from outside the area by the hospital were identified as one of the central problems of the local nurse workforce. According to the recommendation, the hospital employs a nonunion workforce of more than 100 “traveler” nurses who may have been trained with standards different from those in California.
Due to short staffing, the local nurse workforce is forced to provide substandard care to patients and work in unsafe conditions, the commission claims. According to the commission's recommendation, the California Nurses Association and nurses from the hospital documented more than 500 incidents of unsafe health care practices to the California Department of Public Health in February.
Sam Frankel, chairperson of the commission, said outside nurses do not necessarily have the same emotional connection to patients as does the local nurse workforce, which impacts patient care.
“The Affordable Care Act demands better care, lower costs and better outcomes,” a hospital statement said. “Meeting all of them means the status quo is no longer sustainable. We must continue to change and evolve to meet the demands of the new healthcare environment and needs of our changing community.”
Berkeley City Council will consider the recommendation at Tuesday's council meeting.

Correction(s):
A previous version of this article quoted Anne Stewart as saying, “They are finding ways for the nurses to do as much as possible — to push them to their limits — and pay them as little as possible.” In fact, they meant that insurance benefits have been cut for nurses and their families.
Look Who's Killing Jobs Now
Republicans like to denounce President Obama and congressional Democrats for what they describe as “job-killing” policies. But in those red-hot rhetorical terms, congressional Republicans are guilty of mass murder when it comes to job creation.
They left town for their pre-election recess having blocked the extension of a successful jobs program — praised by conservatives from Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour to economist Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute — that provided 250,000 jobs for low-income parents and youths.
A $2.5 billion version of the extension passed the House, twice. The Senate whittled it back to $1.5 billion but still could not dislodge Republican opposition — even though the cost would have been fully paid for.
The program was a sliver of the giant stimulus measure, but one of the most effective in terms of job creation. And it sounded as if it came straight out of the GOP playbook. The money was used overwhelmingly for private-sector jobs. It went to employers, to subsidize — depending on the state — all or part of wages for newly hired workers who would otherwise have been on unemployment rolls or receiving welfare. It was a particular boon to small business, helping them expand at a time when they would not have otherwise had the financial leeway to do so.
The stimulus included a $5 billion pot of money to help states with welfare programs stretched by the recession. One of the permitted uses was for job subsidies, and ultimately 37 states and the District of Columbia ended up launching such efforts.
Barbour, for example, used the federal money to create a program called Mississippi STEPS (Subsidized Transitional Employment Program and Services) that subsidized wages for new employees; the subsidy diminished over six months. Barbour described it as “much-needed aid during this recession by enabling businesses to hire new workers, thus enhancing the economic engines of our local communities.”
Hassett, an economic adviser to the campaigns of George W. Bush and John McCain, urged that the program be significantly expanded. “After all, a worker participating in the program gets a job,” they testified back in February. “A firm gets an extended period of production from the worker at a heavily subsidized cost. This low cost input should increase the firm's profits, and increase the chances that they will lift their capital investments. It is like an indirect tax cut from the perspective of the firm.”
Did I hear tax cut? Republicans should have been leaping on this opportunity.
Except that the program was part of the stimulus plan, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). And ARRA is a four-letter word to Republicans, who — like the church dealing with Galileo — refuse to acknowledge that it had any positive effect on job creation.
Job subsidies aren't a perfect answer. Some firms may use the money for jobs they would have filled anyway, but that risk is offset by the fact that the subsidy is targeted to people in the greatest need of work. There is no guarantee that the jobs will continue once the subsidy is withdrawn — but even so, there is a benefit from having worked. As Hassett explained, “The literature is clear. Someone separated from the labor force runs the real risk of permanently separating from the normal economy. It is crucial that we reconnect as many people as possible before it is too late.”
That would be now. There's a slim chance the program could be revived in a lame-duck session. Otherwise, Republicans can pontificate, as in the Pledge to America, about how “joblessness is the single most important challenge facing America today” and extol the “pride and dignity that comes with an honest day's work and a steady paycheck.” But laid-off workers forced onto welfare because of unthinking obstructionism will know better.

NEW YORK, United States, Friday March 11, 2016 – Two Cayman Islands financial institutions have pleaded guilty to conspiring to hide more than US$130 million in Cayman bank accounts, marking the first conviction of a non-Swiss financial institution for tax evasion conspiracy.
Cayman National Securities Ltd. (CNS) and Cayman National Trust Co. Ltd. (CNT), two affiliates of Cayman National Corporation, which provided investment brokerage and trust management services to individuals and entities within and outside the Cayman Islands, including citizens and residents of the United States, entered the pleas in a Manhattan court on Wednesday.
Under plea agreements, CNS and CNT admitted to conspiring with many of their American taxpayer-clients to hide the money in offshore accounts from the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and to evade US taxes on the income earned in those accounts.
The companies will be required to, among other things, produce account files of non-compliant American taxpayers who held accounts with them, and pay a total of US$6 million in financial penalties.
“ . . . Because we are committed to finding and prosecuting not only banks that help US taxpayers evade taxes, but also individual taxpayers who find criminal ways not to pay their fair share. We will follow them no matter how far they go to hide their accounts, whether it is Switzerland, the Cayman Islands, or some other tax haven,” Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara said.
Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart Goldberg said the convictions showed that the focus was not on any one bank, insurance company, asset management firm, or country.
And they reiterated Bharara's warning that there are no safe havens for US citizens engaged in tax evasion or those actively assisting them.
According to the statements made during the plea proceedings on Wednesday, and other documents filed in Manhattan federal court, from at least 2001 through 2011, CNS and CNT, which are both located in Grand Cayman, assisted certain American taxpayers in evading their tax obligations to the IRS, and otherwise hiding accounts, by knowingly opening and maintaining undeclared accounts for them.
CNS and CNT opened, and/or encouraged many taxpayer-clients to open accounts held in the name of sham Caymanian companies and trusts; treated those sham structures as the account holders and allowed the US beneficial owners of the accounts to trade in US securities; and failed to disclose to the IRS the identities of those who were trading in US securities.
According to the Department of Justice, even after learning about the investigation of Swiss bank UBS AG around 2008, for assisting American taxpayers in evading their obligations, CNS and CNT still continued their illegal practices and did not begin to engage in any significant remedial efforts with respect to those accounts until 2011 and 2012.
Yeah, I know it took a while, but it's here at last. Democracy 3 can be in your hands RIGHT THIS MINUTE!
You can pre-order from my site now, and you get access to the beta immediately. This is, I hope, A pretty polished beta. It's feature complete, it's nice and shiny. It's optimised. there may be bugs or balance issues, but I'm aware of none for the PC version, and only 2 or 3 minor visual anomalies in the mac & linux builds. For the first time ever I have a multi-platform simultaneous game release. Oh yeah.
Buying the game now gets you download links (DRM-free of course) for all 3 platforms, plus a steam key, which right now is useless, but will let you activate the game on steam when it's released finally.
let me know what you think here, or in the forums at http://positech.co.uk/forums/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=36 or I will be answering questions about the game on reddit at http://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/1m8mne/democracy_3_the_political_strategy_game_now/
Obviously anything you can do to help me get the word out about this game is much appreciated. I look forward to being accused of an evil capitalist or a naive communist in equal measure. It was an artist decision to make the capitalist guy the largest one in that image, and ditto about there being more women than men :D
"Spoken words are the symbols of mental experience, and written words the symbol of spoken words. Just as all men have not the same speech sounds, so all men have not the same writing." -- Aristotle THEORY T they foundation for graphology is that a graphic structure defines a particular personality behavior or trait. Handwritingpro's theory is that each graphic structure is generated from primary graphic elements. The four primary expressive elements are the baseline, the enclosure, the imposed structure, and the stroke. The baseline is the imaginary line that letters rest on dividing upper and lower areas while moving forward to the right. The baseline is used to divide vertical placement and to direct movement. Flipping the written page upside down, that is rotating the page one hundred and eighty degrees, is a convenient way to observe the baseline. The baseline represents reality, threshold of awareness, foundation for movement and living. Baseline patterns represent your attitudes towards life experiences and activities. Vertical placement above and below the baseline represents the division between your intangible and tangible values, between abstract and concrete concepts, between philosophical and physical ideas and between personal beliefs and personal relationships. The middle area is above the baseline to the top of the middle letters (i.e. the small letters o, a, e, m, n, u, v, etc.). The middle area represents your approach to basic needs of living and to your surroundings. The middle area describes your manner of understanding, learning, and reasoning. It depicts your self or learned viewpoints and how you communicate them. Horizontal movement along the baseline represents the individual's reaction to experiences, living values, time demands, learning (right motion- to advance, expand, and progress and left motion- to revert, constrict, and regress). The writing slant is defined as an angle formed by the baseline and a line segment generated from an upstroke above the baseline. The line segment is constructed from an initial point at the baseline intersection and the second point by its upper highest inflection point. The upstroke cannot be a final stroke or the final of a circle. The slant represents emotional responsiveness or reactions to immediate circumstances and/or inner feelings. A n enclosure is formed when a line or lines border an area. An enclosure represents imagination, concept enlargement, and idea expansion. There are three basic forms of enclosures- the loop, the circle, and the stem. A loop represents self-generating concepts. There are upper and lower vertical loops. An upper loop is formed by a line enclosing an area by starting forward and upward, moving backward, and returning forward and downward with the crossing strokes at the baseline. The letters e and l are examples of a middle and an upper loop, respectively. A lower loop is formed by a line enclosing an area by starting forward and downward, moving backward, and returning forward and upward with the crossing strokes at the baseline. The lower second part of the letters g and y are examples of lower loops. An inverted loop is an enclosure where the stroke crosses vertically away from the baseline. The non-crossing line segment rests on the baseline. A circle represents other viewpoints or external generated concepts. A circle is formed by a line or lines enclosing an area by starting backward and downward, moving forward, and returning backward and upward meeting or touching at the top. The joined apex points vertically upward. The letter o and the letter a are examples of middle circles. The lower second parts of the letter f and of the letter q are examples of lower circles. An inverted circle is an enclosure where the meeting strokes are joined at bottom pointing downward. The letter s and the buckle in the letter k are examples of inverted circles. A dangling enclosure does not intersect the baseline. A proportional enclosure follows the "golden ratio" principles and contains balance and symmetry. Phi (pronounced fi rhymes with fly) and phi (pronounced fee) are two mathematical numbers occurring in many relationships throughout nature and the universe. Phi and phi ratios can also be found in handwriting.
The average vertical height or writing size is approximately one half inch (~0.52"). The average vertical middle circle and loop height is approximately a tenth of an inch (~0.1"). The average vertical height for upper loops, lower loops and lower circles is approximately a quarter of an inch (~0.26"). The vertical and horizontal dimension, the diameter, for proportional middle circles (i.e. the small letter o) is approximately a tenth of an inch (~0.1"). The letter o can be viewed as a golden ratio of 1 for vertical and horizontal dimensions. The vertical and horizontal measurements for a proportional middle loop (i.e. the small letter e) is approximately one tenth (~0.1") and ~0.06 of an inch, respectively. For the letter e, the golden ratio for the vertical height and horizontal side is one divided by phi. The proportional lower circles and lower loops have exactly the same vertical and horizontal ratios. Upper loops have the same golden ratios as lower loops. The vertical and horizontal dimensions are approximately a quarter of an inch and a tenth of an inch, respectively (~0.26" and ~0.1"). The golden ratio is Phi + 1 divided by 1. The typical maximum width of a proportional upper loop is located phi or 0.06 inch down from the loop's top. The maximum width of a lower loop is located phi or 0.06 inch up from the loop's bottom. The maximum width for upper loops and lower loops are equidistance from the baseline, approximately 0.2 inches. The total height of the upper or lower loops is approximately 0.26 inch or 1 + Phi. The total height, 1 + Phi, is also equivalent to 1 + 1 + phi because Phi is equal to phi + 1. It is worth noting that for the trait indicating practical goals, the t-bar placement is approximately 0.2 inches or three quarters up crossing the t-stem from the baseline. The golden ratio for t-bar placement on the t-stem relative to the baseline is 2 divided by 1 + Phi which is the same distance for the maximum width for the upper loop.
T they imposed written structures control conventional order. The stem is an imposed structure or taught pattern and represents relative learned standards for behavior. A stem is formed by an enclosure that is taught to be restrictive. Learned retraced closed loops of the letters t, d, p, and i are stems. Other imposed patterns in writing represent relative group standards. A period followed by a capital letter is an imposed interruption with an expanded taught structure. Starting at the upper left, moving to the right, then downwards left to right is an imposed direction for filling in a written page. Spaces allotted to margins are imposed. Your signature is imposed. T they stroke depicts life force, energy flow, and libido. The stroke's pressure represents intellectual vitality, physiological energy, sexual passion, and emotional intensity. Pressure is defined by how much force you apply to the writing surface with the writing instrument and not the hand grip pressure. Pressure is how hard you press down on the paper. Pressure indicates the capacity for vigorous activities. The stroke's thickness represents sensory capacity. The stroke's color contrast relative to the writing surface represents sensory discrimination. The stroke's straightness represents a firm approach whereas curve a soft approach. The stroke's transition is defined as the point of inflection. This is the point where the line changes its direction and its slope. The line's transition represents the degree of flexibility and cognizance awareness. An upstroke from and a downstroke to the baseline represent the subconscious and the conscious response to maintain life movement, respectively. Stroke directions on a page are defined as upward towards top, downward towards bottom, forward towards right and backward towards left. Writing speed is controlled by the individual's physiological clock. It appears that the writer subconsciously maintains a maximum stroke velocity with a superimposed variable oscillating profile. The writer is constantly adjusting the velocity function with changes in the stroke's length, direction, duration, pressure and acceleration. To define a measurement unit or units is extremely difficult even with the aid of a computer's writing pad to capture the process. The basic unit of measurement is not the letter which makes it difficult for computer aided reading of handwriting. The secondary affects on speed are grip pressure, distance of the pen hold to the pen point, pen slant to the paper, pen point rotation, and pen point pressure to the paper. The thinnest fastest stroke is a straight forty five degree line moving up to the right where the finger-thumb controls the vertical and the wrist the horizontal motions. Fast writing is a catalyst to inner energy enhancing rapid movement, thinking, and reactions. Writing size represents the difference between inner and outer control of attention. T rait intensity is determined by the quality of the graphic stroke-structure pattern and it's frequency of occurrence. Each character trait is explained by the graphic structure definition. Each graphic sign has a specific distinct value. It cannot represent a different or opposite meaning. Each defined behavior is represented graphically and must adhere to the described graphic principles. Each trait depicted in the GLOSSARY follows this coherent theoretical foundation and has been empirically validated by Stephen Bongiovanni.
Is Merely Explaining The Streisand Effect To Someone A 'Threat'?
from the paranoid-much? dept
Regarding the matter of whether "absolute scum bag" should be deemed defamation per se rests with the present court. Mr. Boka tTots out a series of cases indicating the word "scum" and "scum bag" do not fall in that category. However, by adding the word "total" they impugn everything about me, including character and capacity to carry-out legal work. It coincides well with the Dillon standard of defamatjon per se: a maliciously intended attack on my professional capabilities, an all encompassing put-down (i.e., "absolute scum", not just "scum bag" Or "scum")...
threatening
Again, while I have no evidence that they were part of that illegal gang, as a lawyer Greenfield still should not have served as a conduit for that criminal enterprise. Rather than calling me Greenfield should have contact [sic] the Attorney General's office or the police to denounce what they had learned. Because of their failure to uphold the principle of propriety as a server of the law, I lodged a complaint the [sic] First Department's Discipline Committee.
Ken White, over at Popehat, has a story on the ridiculous situation concerning how lawyer/psychotherapist Jose Arcaya is going after lawyer Scott Greenfield (whose work we often mention around these parts). The history of how it got this far is a bit convoluted, and you can read the full Popehat post for the details, but here's my shortened version: An apparently unsatisfied former client of Arcaya left a negative review of Arcaya on Yelp. Arcaya sued for defamation , arguing that being called "absolute scum" is not merely an opinion because of the use of the word "total" (which as far as I can tell is not actually used in the review -- though perhaps they mean "absolute" or perhaps something was edited. Also, for the record, the review appears to call them "absolute scum" not "absolute scum bag" though I doubt the difference matters):Anyway, the former Arcaya client reached out to White, who in turn reached out to Greenfield. Greenfield then reached out to Arcaya, trying to explain to him, nicely, that suing over someone calling you "absolute scum" on Yelp is probably not a productive venture and might -- just possibly -- backfire, thanks to a little thing called the Streisand Effect . About five or six years ago, a lawyer had told me that the Streisand Effect was losing its power because lawyers now recognized it. And yet, we keep discovering new lawyers who have no idea about it at all.Now, some might take this as a friendly bit of advice about how a course of action could potentially backfire once it is revealed to the public. But Arcaya, apparently, took Greenfield's explanation of how the Streisand Effect works... and claimed that it was. In response, Arcaya subpoenaed Greenfield and defended this move by apparently arguing that Greenfield was somehowhim in describing how the Streisand Effect tends to work, and claiming that Greenfield was somehow associated with "an illegal gang."Oh, right. Beyond just issuing the subpoena, Arcaya filed a wonderfully handwritten bar complaint against Greenfield -- for daring to. Wow.What's amazing is how frequently we've seen this kind of reaction. From Charles Carreon to Prenda Law , those who find themselves faced with the public reacting negatively to their own lawyerly overreactions assume that "the public" speaking out is some sort of "illegal gang" out to get them. They don't realize that it's not about them (at all), but ratherexercising its free speech rights to criticize what the public believes is an abuse of power.Either way, the idea that merely explaining the Streisand Effect to a lawyer who was about to step right into it is some sort of threat concerning a "criminal gang" that somehow violates proper lawyerly activities is so ridiculously laughable, that I'd argue it's even more ridiculous than flipping out and suing over someone calling you "absolute scum."

Netflix has made its first big splash at the Cannes Film Festival by acquiring worldwide distribution rights to the upcoming Kevin James comedy “The True Memoirs of an International Assassin,” Variety has learned.
The purchase, which is in final negotiations, is a formidable coup for Netflix as it continues to build on its reputation in the realm of distributing original films.
Under the deal, “Assassin” will be presented as a Netflix event in 2016, meaning it will debut exclusively on the streaming service and not in theaters. The budget for the production will be considerable, according to a source, and on par with other James movies made by major studios like Sony Pictures. The figures for the deal were not disclosed.
In the comedy, James plays an accountant mistaken for an assassin when a novel he's writing is accidentally published as nonfiction, forcing them to flee to Belize. “Assassin” will be directed by Jeff Wadlow (“Kick Ass 2”) based on a Black List screenplay by Jeff Morris. Producers include Kevin Frakes, Todd Garner, Raja Collins and Justin Begnaud. Shooting begins in September.
Netflix has made clear that it wants to be considered a major player in distributing new movies. Last Friday, chief content officer Ted Sarandos delivered a talk in Cannes outlining their vision for acquiring and producing original films. Sarandos noted that signing a four-movie deal with Adam Sandler last year made sense because their comedies are very popular with Netflix members from all over the world.
James, the star of 2009's “Paul Blart: Mall Cop” (which grossed $183 million worldwide), its sequel and the “Grown Ups” franchise, has a similarly broad following among international audiences.
Netflix's strategy for releasing films will become clearer in the months to come. Some of its titles — especially indies that might have a chance at an Oscar run — will receive theatrical distribution as well as play on TV screens. And Netflix's deep pockets make it possible for it to aggressively compete with old-school film distributors. Earlier this year, Netflix landed the worldwide rights to Cary Fukunaga's “Beasts of No Nation” ($12 million) and the Jamie Dornan-starrer “Jadotville” ($17 million).
According to a new IBD/TIPP poll, Hillary Clinton's national lead over Bernie Sanders has vanished, to the point where they now find themselves in a statistical tie with the only candidate in either party more geriatric and economically illiterate than they are. Clinton now only leads Sanders 43%-39%, well within the poll's margin of error.
This is even worse than polls showing Sanders closing on them in a hypothetical three way race with Biden. The pool of voters Biden was thought to pull from was the same “establishment Democrat” pool that Hillary is playing for, so Hillary had a plausible excuse for lagging somewhat behind. When Biden announced that they wouldn't run, Hillary established dominance over the race which was supposed to be permanent. It turns out, not so much.
The state of Iowa just became a must-win for Hillary Clinton. If Bernie Sanders wins Iowa, even by a couple percentage points, the bump they will get from that victory will almost without a doubt carry them to a second win in NH. And if Bernie wins IA and NH, then what's left of their national lead will completely evaporate. I hope Hillary has been working on polishing a really overwrought Midwestern accent – one that is much more convincing than the borderline racist dialect they adopt when speaking to black audiences or the definitely condescending southern accent they affect when in South Carolina.
Two inexorable truths are conspiring right now to drag Hillary's campaign into terminal territory. The first is that people don't like them Even people who think they should win because of their gender (and let's be frank, there is no other reason to think Hillary should win) really can't avoid the fact that she's an intensely unlikeable person who is openly dishonest, not to mention a swindler of charities.
The second is that the email story, which Clinton thought was put to bed after the first Democrat debate, but which continues to rear its ugly head. The most recent damaging revelation, released over the weekend, showed them clearly instructing a subordinate to remove header information and send classified information over a nonsecure connection. Even Democrat voters have SOME threshold when it comes to national security.
Just the fact that Sanders is this close in spite of the fact that the DNC is openly covering for Hillary by hiding all their debates opposite major television events is an embarrassment for Hillary and clearly shows their weakness as a candidate.
SCOTLAND'S Makar has launched an attack on how poetry is taught in schools, describing methods as “disgraceful” and blaming the way the subject is examined for putting children off the art form for life.
Liz Lochhead said the Scottish Government's education policy Curriculum for Excellence, which seeks to foster creativity, and the Scottish Qualifications Authority, which sets exam papers, were taking an over-analytical and technical approach that spoiled pupils' enjoyment.
“Exams are the problem. The SQA is the problem. I don't think they are examining what's happening. Curriculum for Excellence was conceived in good faith as a way of making everybody's education more creative,” they told The National.
“I'm not trying to demonise teachers here, but the SQA and Curriculum for Excellence are not having the desired effect. You don't learn about poetry to make you hate poetry for the rest of your life, but the effect at the moment is that. We should face up to the fact that what we are doing is not working.”
They noted how the reading of the WH Auden poem Stop All the Clocks in the film Four Weddings and a Funeral had inspired people to read the poem at funerals and had reawakened an interest in the reciting of poetry.
Yet among schoolchildren, teaching methods still placed too much emphasis on “de-coding” the meaning of a poem written down, rather than encouraging pupils to read or listen to it being read out loud.
“The way poetry is taught at the moment is absolutely appalling,” they said. “Nowadays children learn one poem a term and do that poem to death. It's disgusting. They teach poetry as a problem, rather than a joy, and that's disgraceful.”
Lochhead reflected on how they were taught poetry when they were at school and said they learnt a number of poems by heart from the age of seven, including John Keats's Old Meg They Are a Gypsy and Robert Burns's To a Mouse, which instilled in them an early love of the art form.
“I think we have far too many teachers in secondary schools who don't love poetry. If you don't love it leave it alone. In my day, teachers taught what they loved and the love of it went into what they taught,” they said.
“It's clear that even teachers think poetry is a code. I have been asked by a boy, who emailed me once: ‘when you wrote that poem about the bull, what did you really want to say?' Their education had allowed them to get the misapprehension that a poem is a code trying to get a message across.
“They don't even get how funny Edwin Morgan and Norman McCaig are being half the time.”
They said they had read pupils' essays with notes made by teachers that had used technical terms incorrectly and which must have baffled the pupils they were teaching.
“I've seen pages that have been annotated ... it's all about technical aspects of poetry that these teachers do not even understand,” they said.
Lochhead, who was born in Motherwell and attended Glasgow School of Art, rose to prominence in the 1970s and their collections include Memo For Spring, The Grimm Sisters and Bagpipe Muzak.
They were appointed Makar in 2011. Also a playwright, they backed a new initiative to encourage teenagers to memorise two poems as part of a competition being run by the Edinburgh-based Scottish Poetry Library.
The organisation ran a pilot scheme last year and has now decided to open up the Poetry by Heart Scotland contests to secondary school pupils from next term. It is open to S4 to S6 pupils.
Entrants must memorise and recite two poems from a choice of hundreds. One must be published before 1914, one after 1914 and one must be by a Scottish poet.The first round takes place in schools and will be completed by October 9.
The SQA declined to comment on Lochhead's remarks.
An Education Scotland spokesperson said: “Teachers take a variety of approaches to introduce and discuss poetry in ways that help learners develop an appreciation of the sound, rhythm and emotional impact it has through listening and speaking of poetry.
“The curriculum aims to promote enjoyment of literacy including poetry and a wide range of other texts to enhance learners vocabulary and benefit their overall development of literacy and English language skills.”
A Scottish Government spokesperson said: “Local authorities are responsible for delivering a balanced and relevant curriculum. Headteachers and teachers are expected to use their professional judgement, experience and understanding of pupils to help pupils develop an understating of literature, including poetry.”
AUBURN, Ala. -- Prince William's life could be looking very different if they had accepted an honorary Auburn football scholarship offered to them at birth.
Shortly after they arrived in the world in June 1982, then-AU football coach Pat Dye sent a personal invitation to the newest British royal and future king to become a Tiger in their late teens.
The remarkable invitation was brought to light in the Spring 2011 edition of Auburn Athletics Department magazine Tiger Roar, the Alabama newspaper the Press-Register reported Monday.
"The world celebrated when Princess Diana gave birth to Prince William on June 21, 1982. On that day, as now, the future King of England received the prayers and good wishes from people the world over, Auburn included," former Auburn athletics director David Housel wrote in the all-sports quarterly.
"Shortly after William's birth, Coach Pat Dye sent the future king an honorary Auburn football scholarship, as official as any honorary scholarship could be, signed by Coach Dye himself, sealed and delivered," Housel explained.
They continued, "Somewhere in Coach Dye's files or within the archives of the athletic department or the university there is a letter, a nice note actually, from Buckingham Palace, thanking Coach Dye and Auburn for the scholarship, letting them know that Prince Charles and Diana appreciated Auburn's courtesy and thoughtfulness. They were confident Prince William would appreciate and consider the offer as they grew older."
The course of recent British history could have been altered dramatically if the prince, a keen sportsman, had taken Dye up on the offer to study in Alabama after leaving wealthy English private school Eton.
Instead, they headed to Scottish university St Andrews, where the royal met their future wife, Kate Middleton.
The couple, awarded the title of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge after marrying in April, will head to California next month on an official visit.
An exclusive polo club in Santa Barbara was reported to be charging its members almost $100,000 for the chance to compete against the prince, 28, who is a competitive player.
Prince William was on horseback as recently as Monday, battling their side to victory in a charity event over a team led by their younger brother, Prince Harry.
Cornelius whose feast day is September 16th. A Roman priest, Cornelius was elected Pope to succeed Fabian in an election delayed fourteen months by Decius' persecution of the Christians. The main issue of their pontificate was the treatment to be accorded Christians who had been apostasized during the persecution. They condemned those confessors who were lax in not demanding penance of these Christians and supported St. Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage, against Novatus and their dupe, Felicissimus, whom they had set up as an antibishop to Cyprian, when Novatus came to Rome. On the other hand, they also denounced the Rigorists, headed by Novatian, a Roman priest, who declared that the Church could not pardon the lapsi (the lapsed Christians), and declared themselves Pope. However, their declaration was illegitimate, making them an antipope. The two extremes eventually joined forces, and the Novatian movement had quite a vogue in the East. Meanwhile, Cornelius proclaimed that the Church had the authority and the power to forgive repentant lapsi and could readmit them to the sacraments and the Church after they had performed proper penances. A synod of Western bishops in Rome in October 251 upheld Cornelius, condemned the teachings of Novatian, and excommunicated them and their followers. When persecutions of the Christians started up again in 253 under Emperor Gallus, Cornelius was exiled to Centum Cellae (Civita Vecchia), where they died a martyr probably of hardships they were forced to endure.

WARSAW (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Saturday they were concerned about how the State Department handles classified information but cast this as part of a government-wide challenge in the age of email, texts and smartphones.
FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday recommended against prosecuting Hillary Clinton or their aides for their “extremely careless” handling of classified information on the private email server that they used as secretary of state.
Comey said the FBI had found evidence that “the security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of unclassified systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information that's found elsewhere in the U.S. government.”
Asked about the FBI director's assessment, Obama told reporters in a news conference: “I am concerned.”
“The advent of email and texts and smart phones is just generating enormous amounts of data,” Obama added, saying that this, in turn was “putting enormous pressure on the department to sort through it, classify it properly.”
Obama said that if one classified too much, the benefits of the information evaporated because it took too long to process. “It reflects a larger problem in government,” they added. Clinton has said their use of a private email server was a mistake.

The Freedom from Religion Foundation (FFRF), a Wisconsin-based atheist organization, has accused Clemson University of endorsing Christianity within its football team.
In a letter sent to the Senior Associate General Counsel of Clemson University, April 10, the Foundation blamed the University for interweaving religion and athletics.
It has pointed to an instance where Coach Dabo Swinney invited Minister James Trapp as the Clemson Tigers Chaplain. The group says that the invitation is a clear violation of "Establishment Clause" and the school's "Guidelines For Athletic Team Chaplains" which states that students must select their chaplain first and then seek permission from the coach.
The organization also protested against Christian worship in the athletic program - recitation of Scriptural passages, distribution of Bibles and compulsion to attend church, Huffington Post reports.
Echoing similar sentiments, Brad Wolverton said in a Chronicle of Higher Education article, "The players in fact are well aware of the coach's favorite Bible verse, 1 Corinthians 9:24-25: "Run your race to win, don't just run the race." The article further states nearly every player attends a voluntary chapel service before every game.
Clemson authorities have opposed the claims by saying that they do not force religion on players, instead they welcome athletes belonging to different faiths.
Responding to the allegations, Swinney told Wolverton, "I've had Muslims, Catholics-I've got two Mormons on this team right now. When we get out on the football field, it's not about if you're a Christian, it's about who's the best player."
Cathy Sams, chief public affairs, said that Coach Swinney believes in religion and faith. But players are not forced to take part in religious activities related to the football program. It is voluntary.
In the letter, FFRF urged the university to drop Christian methods of coaching.
"Coaches should be aware of the tremendous influence they have on their athletes," FFRF said in the letter. "These young men spend a great deal of time in their coach's charge, and the coaches through their own example must be sure that athletes are not only treated fairly but also imbued with a sense of community and camaraderie."

When Samuel L. Jackson first appeared as Nick Fury in the post-credits scene for Iron Man, fans understandably went wild. It signaled the promise of S.H.I.E.L.D. and maybe even an Avengers storyline down the road, but few expected Jackson to be as ever-present in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as they became. The actor signed on for a then-unheard-of nine films in their contract, but with appearances in seven Marvel films thus far, that ginormous agreement is coming to an end.
Collider reporter Christina Radish recently spoke with Jackson in anticipation of their upcoming film Big Game, and during the course of their conversation the actor spoke enthusiastically about their tenure at Marvel:
“It's an amazing amount of fun. I finally met [comics writer] Mark [Millar], last year, when I was doing Kingsman, ‘cause they were on set one day, and I finally got a chance to thank them for making Nick Fury black and changing the whole dynamic. It's really great to be the connective tissue between so many different characters in so many different films, that brings those guys together. But I'm not in Captain America 3. I can't figure that out, but I'm not. I guess I'm still out there, trying to figure out what happened to S.H.I.E.L.D. and who these other people are. But it's an amazing honor to be that guy, to be Nick Fury, to be in that particular world, and to be a character that people believe. It's great. I'm as grateful for being in that, as I was being in Star Wars with George [Lucas] and to play a character that people remember, like Mace Windu. It's all great. It's hard not to be a part of something that you know, if people study film for the next 200 years, they'll be talking about Star Wars and The Avengers series, and all that stuff.”
Jackson's absence from the bursting-at-the-seams Captain America: Civil War cast is indeed odd, but it's likely Marvel is saving them for the two-part Avengers: Infinity War saga. When asked how many films they have left on their contract, the actor said they think they have two remaining on their nine-picture deal, but they don't plan on leaving the MCU:
“Of course [I'm interested in returning]! I'm looking for a contract extension right now, yeah. I'm looking to re-up.”
So if Marvel wants to keep Nick Fury around (and of course they do), Jackson is game to keep playing the character for as long as they'll have him. As contracts for the other actors begin to expire and Marvel introduces a slew of new heroes, Nick Fury will no doubt be the glue that ties this entire Marvel Cinematic Universe together over the different phases.

Coins dating back to a tumultuous period of civil war in Denmark were found in a field south of Foulum and are being put on display at the Viborg Museum.
The museum said that three members of the Central Jutland Detector Society (Midtjysk Detektorforening) discovered the mediaeval coins, which are thought to have been hidden during the first half of the 1300s, a period of internal unrest in Denmark which culminated in a temporary end of royal rule.
The instability of the era is said to be reflected in the poor quality minting and low silver content of the coins.
“The treasure comes from an unstable period, and it is conceivable that the owner wanted to hide them away until better and more stable times. For some unknown reason, they never returned to collect their coins,” Viborg Museum curator Mikkel Kjeldsen said.
The metal detector search was carried out on the field near the town of Foulum during the final stage of a wider excavation of an Iron Age building at the site. But with a 1,000-year age difference between the building and the coins, an explanation of how the treasure came to the area remains clouded by mystery.
“It is not unusual to find civil war coins when we investigate fields near Middle Age towns and villages, but when we find so many collected and hidden together, it really sets your mind at work thinking about who could have put them there, and why,” Morten Nielsen, chairperson of Central Jutland Detector Society and one of the finders of the coins, said.
The coins will be cleaned and put on display at Viborg Museum next week.

Lahore: October 2, 2017. (PCP) It was confirmed by one of LEAD'S coordinators that two minors sweepers, booked in blasphemy case after allegedly being accused of blasphemy charges by burning sacred pages of Quranic Verses.
An FIR no.1014/2017 was registered on September 28 at Police Station Bunga Dhongha,Behawalnagar, whereas the minors were charged under 295-B etc. Vishal Masih, Christian, and Bhola Ram Hindu are employed as cleaners at Civil Hospital, Dunga, Bhongha, Behawalnagar.
According to contents of the FIR, the alleged blasphemy was committed at the Civil Hospital, Dunga, Bhongha,District Bahawalnagar. The complainant is a Policeman who claims that they received a phone call from a local journalist who informed them that Vishal son of Tariq had burnt government record whilst some pages containing Quranic verses were also among them.
The complainant claims that the incident unfolded on September 27, 2017. After being informed, they arrived at the scene and witnessed a large crowd gathered who detailed the incident to him. They claim that the incident was also brought to the notice of a Doctor of the Civil Hospital who filed a complaint in the police station however, withheld the information about burning of Quranic verses.
Blasphemy laws are very sensitive matter which could take the life of a alleged accused at any spot and for it only allegation is sufficient. Christians remained under constant fear and hide their true Christian faith to avoid blasphemy charges which is in contradiction of Islamic faith and way of life because it could be considered a blasphemy.
"It is strongly urged to the Churches to raise the issue of blasphemy laws and ask the Pakistani authority to repeal blasphemy laws or at least ask them they cannot be applicable on Christians” Sardar Mushtaq Gill ,HRD lawyer and head of LEAD, stated during interview.
PUYALLUP, Wash. -- A man had to take their pants off while shopping at the Puyallup Costco Thursday after their cell phone caught fire.
“There was so much smoke. And there were two or three people who had a fire extinguisher. They were trying to help him,” said witness Everett Tyrrell.
Tyrrell tells KOMO News they were shopping when they noticed all the smoke. They went around the corner and spotted a shopper without their pants.
“I was kind of worried about the guy. I guess their pants were affected by the phone or caught on fire,” said Tyrrell. “He was pointing at the phone. I said, ‘Is that your cellphone?' They said ‘Yeah.' I asked ‘What type of cellphone? They said ‘LG'."
A store manager said when they went to the scene, they found the man with their pants off and a cell phone on the ground, still smoking. An employee had used a fire extinguisher on the phone, the manager said.
The victim wasn't hurt and they didn't even need to call 911, the manager said, adding Costco provided the man with a new pair of pants.
It's unclear what might have led up to the fire.
"It certainly makes me think of where I keep my phone and where I keep my phone in the future, what it's capable of," said Tyrrell. "I hope that never happens to me or someone I care about."
Chris Wood confirmed speculations that Mon-El is going to suit up with their own superhero costume in Season 2 of “Supergirl.”
In an interview with Empire, Wood revealed that they have already put on Mon-El's suit while filming upcoming episodes of the CW series. “The suit is awesome and standing next to Supergirl (Melissa Benoist) is going to be a really cool visual,” the 28-year-old actor told the magazine. “Watching the [first] two episodes [of Season 2] where they were able to have both Tyler [Hoechlin] and Melissa there on camera as [Superman and Supergirl], that was more fulfilling than I thought it would be watching it. … But you can't have 22 episodes of both of them on their show. It's their story. But you can have that same energy with a different superhero that's figuring it out and she's mentoring.”
When asked what Mon-El's costume looks like, Wood said it isn't too different from the one in the comics. “They're always true to the comic,” they said. “They at least give a severe hat tip to the comics in terms of design, so you needn't worry about that. They stay true like they have with Flash and Arrow and Supergirl.”
Fans, however, shouldn't expect to see Mon-El in their superhero costume in the near future, as Wood told Empire that their character has yet to find the purpose that will motivate them to protect the Earth from all evil threats.
“At first he's resisting to [be a superhero], because they don't feel the same impulse to go save the world [the way Supergirl] does,” Wood said of Mon-El. “So, their story's going to become one of how do they gain that need? Where does that come from? ... There's got to be a moment like the one in the pilot for Kara when she's, like, ‘I have to do this.' He's going to have one of those moments at some point, where they are self-motivated to pursue this as a purpose.”
An all-new episode of “Supergirl” airs on Monday, Nov. 21 at 8 p.m. EST on The CW. Check out the synopsis for Season 2, episode 7, titled “The Darkest Place,” below:
“While Guardian (Mehcad Brooks) tries to clear their name after being accused of a murder committed by another vigilante, Supergirl heads out on a solo mission to rescue Mon-El who has been captured by CADMUS. While fighting to free Mon-El, Supergirl comes face to face with Cyborg Superman.”
EXCLUSIVE: Lifetime has opted not to renew Devious Maids for a fifth season. The decision comes a couple of weeks after the series ended its Season 4 run on the network.
Devious Maids, developed by Desperate Housewives creator Marc Cherry based on a telenovela format, migrated to Lifetime after being developed and piloted at ABC. It got off to a strong start, with its first-year student season peaking at 3 million Live+same day viewers for the season finale. The ratings have slipped in each consecutive season, with the most recent fourth season averaging 0.923 million viewers (L+SD), but the show has been consistent, with virtually no drop-off throughout Season 4. Its average still was twice the viewership of Lifetime's other original scripted series, the critically praised UnReal.
Wrapping a respectable four-season run, Devious Maids, from ABC Studios, was the first all-Latina ensemble on English-speaking television. It was Lifetime's only established returning series the last couple of years, used to help launch UnReal.
Devious Maids also is left over from the old regime at Lifetime. The network has been changing creative direction, signaled by UnReal. In the pipeline, the network has two drama pilots in contention for a series pickup, the supernatural Sea Change and anthology A Midsummer's Nightmare.
Devious Maids was executive produced by Eva Longoria and starred Ana Ortiz, Dania Ramirez, Roselyn Sanchez and Judy Reyes.
President Obama announced a plan to ease the burden of student loans on college graduates on Wednesday by capping federal student loan repayments at 10 percent of discretionary income, Reuters reports.
The president spoke to a crowd at the University of Colorado in Denver and said they would take executive action to begin the new steps starting in January.
"Our economy needs it right now, and your future could use a boost right now," Obama said.
White House officials said it could help up to 1.6 million people and reduce their loan payments each month by as much as a couple hundred dollars, according to the Washington Post.
"Steps like these won't take the place of the bold action we need from Congress to boost our economy and create jobs, but they will make a difference," Obama said in a statement.

According to CNN, Obama also criticized Congress for not passing their early $447 billion jobs bill during the stop in Colorado to discuss the changes. They urged the young crowd to support them in getting Congress to have a "sense of urgency" in helping the ailing economy.
"Some of these folks in Washington still aren't getting the message. I need your voices heard," they said, according to the Los Angeles Times. "Young people, I need you guys involved; I need you active."
The current plan for borrowers enrolled in income-based payment calls for 15 percent of discretionary income to be paid for 25 years before having their debt forgiven, The New York Times reports. In Obama's new plan, all remaining debt will be forgiven after 20 years.
The “pay as you earn” program will start in January, two years before the plan was due to be enacted under federal law.
The Washington Post reports:
Yet it remains unclear how many people will take advantage of the offer--even with the economy lagging and college tuition prices continuing to rise. Since 2007, borrowers have been allowed to cap federal student loan repayments at 15 percent of discretionary income. But White House officials acknowledged that just 450,000 of the nation's 36 million student loan borrowers are participating in the income-based repayment program.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Americans' student loan debt surpasses outstanding credit card debt, and “total loans outstanding are slated to exceed $1 trillion this year.”
CNN reports that average student loan debt at four-year colleges was $24,000 for the graduating class of 2009. That data, from the Institute for College Access & Success, includes all private and federal loans.
More: Photos: Occupy Wall Street spreads throughout America
The topic of student loans has also become a contentious political issue for Obama and presidential nominees. Many of the Occupy Wall Street protests in the U.S. have said increasing debt for college graduates is something that needs to be fixed, according to the Washington Post.
DISCUSSION: Would you be affected by Obama's student loan forgiveness plan? Tell us how student loans have impacted your life and your views on the plan. We will republish a selection of the comments.
When Alexis Wineman was diagnosed with borderline Asperger Syndrome at age 11, they thought the answer to "what was wrong with me" came too late.
"I felt so alone growing up, and I still do at times," Wineman said at an autism conference hosted by Montana State University Billings.
Through years of "overwhelming and daily" challenges that included bullying from peers and bouts of self-deprecation, Wineman never stopped trying to push past their hardships.
They underwent extensive counseling, received help with schoolwork, joined speech and drama clubs, and joined the cheerleading squad, eventually overcoming their struggles with anxiety and self-consciousness.
The hard work paid off in full last year, when Wineman was crowned Miss Montana 2012.
The 18-year-old is now poised to become the first Miss America contestant to be diagnosed with autism.
"Most people do not understand what autism is," Wineman says in a promotional video for Saturday's competition. "And one in 88 people having some form of autism — this understanding is becoming more and more necessary." The youngest contestant in this year's pageant, Wineman hopes the spotlight will help them shine much needed light on their condition. Miss America will take place this Saturday in Las Vegas.

Most aspects of football are mostly skill-based, but luck in large part governs turnovers. Or, aspects of turnovers at least. Today, I'm going over those random aspects. All stats are sourced from the excellent CFBStats.com.
Ball security is a skill. So is forcing fumbles. But recovering fumbles? It's basically all luck. The football has a funny shape and bounces in ways that people can't predict in real time. Besides that, it's not possible to control what mix of players from the two teams will be near the ball when it comes loose.
Here is the distribution of fumble recovery percentages from 2015 rounded to the nearest percentage:
It's in the shape of a bell curve, which means it's very likely to be random. And that point way at the top that was the most frequent fumble recovery percentage? It's 50%.
Here are all the teams from 2015 that recovered at least 60% of the fumbles in their games:
Name Total Fumbles Total Recovered Recovered Pct. Arkansas 29 19 65.5% Houston 40 26 65.0% Wisconsin 28 18 64.3% Fresno State 30 19 63.3% Oklahoma State 38 24 63.2% Army 48 30 62.5% USC 26 16 61.5% Oregon 36 22 61.1% South Carolina 38 23 60.5% Kansas 40 24 60.0% Navy 40 24 60.0% North Carolina 45 27 60.0% UNLV 30 18 60.0%
There is quite the mix here, from New Year's Six participants Houston and Oklahoma State down to Kansas and Army. Heading the other way, these are the teams that recovered fewer than 40% of their fumbles:
Name Total Fumbles Total Recovered Recovered Pct. Colorado 48 19 39.6% Louisiana Tech 38 15 39.5% Nebraska 26 10 38.5% NC State 43 16 37.2% Cincinnati 35 13 37.1% Alabama 37 13 35.1% Oregon State 26 9 34.6% Duke 38 13 34.2% Penn State 53 18 34.0% Mississippi State 36 11 30.6% Middle Tennessee 44 13 29.5%
Once again, the spread here is enormous from national champion Alabama to a pair of teams in Oregon State and Colorado that went a combined 1-17 in Pac-12 play.
The other category of turnovers is interceptions. Avoiding bad throws as a quarterback is a skill. Calling defensive sets to get defenders in the way of passes is a skill for coaches, as knows when to take risks to get picks for a player. Actually hauling in the interception does seem to be luck, though, which shouldn't be surprising considering that the players with the best hands tend to get put on offense.
Here is the distribution of interceptions as a percentage of passes defended (passes broken up plus INTs) rounded to the nearest percentage:
Again, it looks a lot like a random distribution. The percentage for all teams put together is 21.1%, and the median percentage was 20.7%.
Here are the teams that intercepted at least 30% of their passes defended:
Name Int. Passes Defended INT Pct. Connecticut 18 49 36.7% Oklahoma State 17 49 34.7% Appalachian State 18 52 34.6% Arkansas State 26 77 33.8% Bowling Green 20 60 33.3% Oklahoma 20 61 32.8% Boston College 13 41 31.7% New Mexico State 12 38 31.6% San Diego State 23 75 30.7% Boise State 22 73 30.1%
There is a crazy mix here too, again from NY6 bowl teams like Oklahoma State and Oklahoma to BC, who didn't win an ACC game, and 3-9 New Mexico State. Boston College did have the No. 3 S&P+ defense, but NMSU's was fourth from the bottom and actually rated worse against the pass than the run. And now for the end of the list:
Name Int. Passes Defended INT Pct. Old Dominion 8 62 12.9% North Texas 4 33 12.1% Eastern Michigan 4 34 11.8% UTEP 5 43 11.6% TCU 7 63 11.1% Iowa State 5 45 11.1% Texas State 3 28 10.7% Kansas State 5 47 10.6% Vanderbilt 6 60 10.0% UCF 4 40 10.0% Louisiana-Lafayette 5 53 9.4% Virginia 4 44 9.1% Hawai'i 3 43 7.0% Rice 2 32 6.3%
Down here is mostly bad teams, though we do get TCU sitting there at 11.1%. Vanderbilt may have missed a bowl, but it still had a top 20 defense.
Finally, coaches love to talk about turnovers like they're something within their control. To test that notion, I put every team's ranks in fumble recovery percentage and interception percentages in a table. I ran the correlation between the ranks, and it came out to 0.02. As a refresher: correlation is a number between 1 and -1, and the closer to zero it is, the less correlation there is between two factors. In other words, how good (or not) a team was at recovering fumbles tells us nothing about how good it was at intercepting passes it got a hand on and vice versa.
The implication here is that teams that were highly ranked in both were exceptionally lucky and those that were lowly ranked in both were exceptionally unlucky. Here are the lucky ones:
Team Fumble Rank INT Rank Average Rank Oklahoma State 5 2 4 South Carolina 9 13 11 Boston College 19 7 13 New Mexico 14 20 17 USC 7 28 18 Kansas 10 27 19 New Mexico State 34 8 21 Houston 2 43 23 South Florida 37 11 24 Miami (Florida) 17 33 25 Bowling Green 50 5 28 Arkansas State 55 4 30 Syracuse 44 15 30 Arizona State 30 29 30 Navy 11 49 30
And here are the snake bit teams:
Team Fumble Rank INT Rank Average Rank Eastern Michigan 80 117 99 Louisiana Tech 119 79 99 Alabama 123 77 100 Penn State 126 76 101 Mississippi State 127 78 103 Wyoming 94 111 103 Michigan 104 103 104 UTEP 89 118 104 Virginia 90 126 108 Rice 88 128 108 Cincinnati 122 97 110 Nebraska 120 99 110 Hawai'i 92 127 110 Texas State 107 121 114 Louisiana-Lafayette 116 125 121
Just imagine how good the Crimson Tide would've been with even just neutral luck in turnovers, much less good luck.
So those are the turnover luck extremes for 2015. Because this is an SEC-focused site, I'm going to put the tables for just the conference's teams below. If you're not an SEC fan or otherwise don't care, you're dismissed.
Fumble recovery percentages:
National Rank Name Total Fumbles Total Recovered Recovered Pct. 1 Arkansas 29 19 65.5% 9 South Carolina 38 23 60.5% 25 Missouri 36 20 55.6% 27 Tennessee 36 20 55.6% 40 LSU 36 19 52.8% 49 Georgia 46 24 52.2% 54 Vanderbilt 43 22 51.2% 61 Florida 44 22 50.0% 65 Kentucky 32 16 50.0% 72 Ole Miss 49 24 49.0% 74 Auburn 39 19 48.7% 117 Texas A&M 42 17 40.5% 123 Alabama 37 13 35.1% 127 Mississippi State 36 11 30.6%

Last week, we added this tutorial to the SAFE Dev Forum:
SAFE Dev Forum How to build the SAFE Browser and upload a website with Mock-Vault As explained in this week's dev update, the SAFE Authenticator is now stable enough (with the mock network) that developers can build it and try using it with the following example applications: SAFE Mail Tutorial Web Hosting Manager Markdown... Reading time: 16 mins 🕑 Likes: 102 ❤
It explains how to build the SAFE Browser with Mock-Vault and how to upload a website using the SAFE Hosting Manager app. We are also planning to add a few code examples that will help you understand how to use the SAFE Browser DOM APIs to build dynamic web applications. We are having some issues with some of the code examples, so you'll have to wait a little longer for those, but we're happy to have this one for you to play with. We'll update this tutorial with more code examples once we resolve these issues.
SAFE Authenticator & API
safe_app_nodejs has been updated to work with the latest dev branch of safe_client_libs. The error strings are now propagated across the FFI boundary and the inconsistency of calling the encryptKey function has been fixed. For Private MutableData, it now becomes the responsibility of the application to encrypt the keys and values depending on the use case.
The Authenticator was also updated to work with the latest safe_client_libs dev branch. Based on the feedback from last week, some devs had to manually clear the beaker-plugin-* modules from the app/node_modules directory and build safe_browser again. The build scripts have now been updated to address these issues. Thanks to all the community members who have tried building the apps (@southside, @JPL, @happybeing, @draw, @maxweng, to name a few). Fetching index.html as the default file, auto redirection to the safe: protocol and a DOM API fix for the quickSetup function of MutableData are now implemented in the SAFE Browser.
A few approaches on how to distribute the Java API for desktop and Android were tried. We are planning to distribute an AAR file for Android which can be configured as a Gradle dependency in Android Studio and used by devs. The safe_app native library for each architecture will be packaged within the AAR file itself. On the other hand for desktop applications, the devs can include the JAR as a Maven dependency. When the JAR is downloaded, the native library is downloaded based on the platform and architecture as part of the post-install script.
The examples in the documentation might not be up-to-date. However, devs can make use of the test cases in safe_app_nodejs for reference. We will review and get the examples in the documentation verified and updated.
SAFE Client Libs & Crust
The uTP API has now been finalised by Carl and the library is ready to be used and tested. So we will soon be planning to integrate Crust with uTP support, which of course includes UDP hole punching. This should certainly help us connect to more peers and reduce tunnels. We will investigate different approaches since the uTP crates design choices affect the way Crust is currently designed with its state machine paradigm, and then subsequently come up with tasks to implement it.
We ported a mechanism from the master branch of safe_vault to the MutableData PR which queues the data chunks that a new node needs to store, and schedules their transfer, instead of requesting them all at once. That is slightly more complicated code, but necessary to make safe_vault scale to large amounts of data.
Mutable Data has individual entries which can be mutated independently of each other unlike Structured Data. So we are looking into the optimal way to refresh this, otherwise a refresh message per entry could lead to more bandwidth during churn.
Routing & Vault
Regarding the first part of data chains, we are still having several active threads of discussion, and doing research in different directions. In a complex system like this one there are a lot of design choices to make and we are trying to strike the right balance between reinventing the wheel and settling for an efficient solution.
Work on the node name simplification is also progressing well, but still ongoing, we hope to have the back of this one broken late this week or early next week.

Dog Attacks on Assistance Dogs
On 13th March 2014 the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 received Royal Assent[1]. This Act makes significant amendments to the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, in particular with regard to the law surrounding dog attacks on assistance dogs.
Under the new law, if a dog is dangerously out of control anywhere in England and Wales (whether or not a public place) and it injures an assistance dog, the owner of the dog will be guilty of an aggravated offence. The amendments to the Dangerous Dogs Act include heavy penalties for such aggravated offences. In the case of assistance dogs being injured, the attacker's owner could receive up to three years in prison, or a fine, or both.
Surprisingly, given the fact that prior to these amendments the Dangerous Dogs Act was silent on the subject, attacks on assistance dogs are a relatively common occurrence. Guide Dogs chief executive Richard Leaman claims that on average ten assistance dogs are attacked each month[2]. It goes without saying that the effect of such attacks can be devastating on the owners of assistance dogs, many of whom are completely reliant on their dogs for their independence and quality of life. In addition to the trauma suffered by the owner and the dog itself as the result of an attack, there can be severe financial consequences for charities which provide dogs to those in need. After an attack an assistance dog may be so severely injured or distressed that it is unable to work either temporarily or permanently. With guide dogs costing in the region of £50,000 to be trained, this is obviously a huge unwanted cost to charities.
For the purposes of the amendments to the Dangerous Dogs Act the term ‘Assistance Dog' is defined as it is in the Equality Act 2010. The Equality Act states that an Assistance Dog is:
(a) a dog which has been trained to guide a blind person;
(b) a dog which has been trained to assist a deaf person;
(c) a dog which has been trained by a prescribed charity to assist a disabled person who has a disability that consists of epilepsy or otherwise affects the person's mobility, manual dexterity, physical co-ordination or ability to lift, carry or otherwise move everyday objects; or
(d) a dog of a prescribed category which has been trained to assist a disabled person who has a disability (other than one falling within paragraph (c)) of a prescribed kind.
This is a fairly wide definition and goes beyond what the general public may recognise as ‘typical' assistance dogs. Therefore, there is an onus on dog owners to ensure that their dog is under control at all times, not only when in contact with a dog that they can see is obviously an assistance dog.
Critics have argued that the new protection afforded to assistance dogs should be extended to all animals that are the victims of dog attacks, as such attacks are invariably traumatic and can cause financial loss to pet owners due to vet's fees incurred, but the legislation is clear that the aggravated offence is applicable only to attacks on assistance dogs as defined above. However, it will be of some comfort to animal lovers that although an attack on an animal other than an assistance dog is not an aggravated offence under the new legislation, it is still an offence for a dog to be out of control anywhere in the UK and the owner of an out of control dog could still be punished with up to 6 months in prison, or a fine or both. This means that an owner could be punished if any animal is injured in a dog attack if that dog was deemed out of control at the time.
Whilst many have praised parliament for taking action in this area, others, such as Trevor Cooper from the Dogs Trust, believe the answer to the problem of dog attacks lies in prevention through education, rather than in punishment of offenders after the event has taken place. Whether or not the new measures coming into force will act as a deterrent, thereby reducing the number of attacks on assistance dogs remains to be seen, the only thing that can be certain is that an irresponsible dog owner can now be heavily punished if their dog instigates such an attack.

“for developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution”
Cool microscope technology revolutionises biochemistry
We may soon have detailed images of life's complex machineries in atomic resolution. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2017 is awarded to Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson for the development of cryo-electron microscopy, which both simplifies and improves the imaging of biomolecules. This method has moved biochemistry into a new era.
A picture is a key to understanding. Scientific breakthroughs often build upon the successful visualisation of objects invisible to the human eye. However, biochemical maps have long been filled with blank spaces because the available technology has had difficulty generating images of much of life's molecular machinery. Cryo-electron microscopy changes all of this. Researchers can now freeze biomolecules mid-movement and visualise processes they have never previously seen, which is decisive for both the basic understanding of life's chemistry and for the development of pharmaceuticals.
Electron microscopes were long believed to only be suitable for imaging dead matter, because the powerful electron beam destroys biological material. But in 1990, Richard Henderson succeeded in using an electron microscope to generate a three-dimensional image of a protein at atomic resolution. This breakthrough proved the technology's potential.
Joachim Frank made the technology generally applicable. Between 1975 and 1986 they developed an image processing method in which the electron microscope's fuzzy twodimensional images are analysed and merged to reveal a sharp three-dimensional structure.
Jacques Dubochet added water to electron microscopy. Liquid water evaporates in the electron microscope's vacuum, which makes the biomolecules collapse. In the early 1980s, Dubochet succeeded in vitrifying water – they cooled water so rapidly that it solidified in its liquid form around a biological sample, allowing the biomolecules to retain their natural shape even in a vacuum.
Following these discoveries, the electron microscope's every nut and bolt have been optimised. The desired atomic resolution was reached in 2013, and researchers can now routinely produce three-dimensional structures of biomolecules. In the past few years, scientific literature has been filled with images of everything from proteins that cause antibiotic resistance, to the surface of the Zika virus. Biochemistry is now facing an explosive development and is all set for an exciting future.

It is starting to feel like another week means another accusation or lawsuit leveled against Fox News Channel as today another on-air talent hit the outlet with legal action. Less that a week after a potential racial discrimination class action was filed against FNC, Diana Falzone has hit the channel with a gender and disability discrimination suit.
“Falzone was demotcd, marginalized, humiliated and discriminated against by Fox News because they are a woman,” says the unspecified damages and declaration of a violation of NYC's Human Rights Law complaint. Called “the face of FoxNews.com” and a frequent guest on Fox & Friends, Hannity and Fox Business shows since 2013, Falzone says they were yanked off air and the site after penning a supervisor approved post about having endometriosis in January 2017. “Falzone was demoted, marginalized, humiliated and discriminated against by Fox News because they suffer from endometriosis,” the filing in NY Supreme Court adds (read it here).
“Shortly after the op-ed ran, Falzone was informed by their supervisor Kaplan that, upon instructions from the ‘Second Floor,' they were permanently banned from ever appearing on-air on any Foxnews.com, Fox News Network, Fox Business News Network or any other Fox News medium and would never again be permitted to host their own shows or conduct their own interviews,” the filing adds with that “Second Floor” reference being to FNC executives like current co-Presidents Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy, who took over in August 2016. “A Foxnews.com producer, Justin Craig, later informed the production staff that Falzone was also prohibited from doing voiceovers, even for programs or stories they wrote or originated,” Falzone's jury demanding complaint also says, as well as calling the ban on them appearing on-air as having as “devastating impact” on their career.
Fox News did not respond to request for comment on this latest lawsuit. The action seeks compensation for Falzone for “all back and future loss of wages, lost income, benefits, retirement losses, pain, suffering, stress, humiliation, menial anguish, emotional harm and personal physical injury and physical sickness, as well as damage to their reputation, damage to career path, and loss of income stemming therefrom.”
Part of the reason the cable newser may be weary to comment is that Fazone is represented by Nancy Erika Smith. That's the same attorney who represented Gretchen Carlson in their successful sexual harassment action last summer that saw the resignation of FNC boss Roger Ailes and a $20 million settlement for the ex-Fox & Friends co-host. Smith is also representing ex-The Five contributor Julie Roginsky in their April 3 filed sexual harassment and retaliation suit against FNC, Ailes and the current bosses.
“Once Diana disclosed their condition, Fox executives decided they no longer conformed to their image of on-air women as ‘physically perfect',” said Smith in a blunt statement on Monday. “Behind closed doors they passed judgment on her, discriminated against them for being a woman with a chronic reproductive illness, and punished them for having a protected disability.”
Your Data Comes Alive in Realtime Realtime data is at the heart of any collaborative app. Like other services, Convergence stores your data in the cloud and allows access to it from anywhere and any device. But it is the only platform designed from the ground up for highly interactive applications and real-time, shared, simultaneously modifiable data. As one client changes the data, all other clients are kept in sync and our concurrency control algorithms ensure data integrity is maintained. In the example to the right, we open a data model and get the “firstName” property: this is a RealTimeString object. From that we set some listeners on the firstName in order to see edits in real time. Then we do a series of mutations to the string.
Convergence.connectAnonymously(domainUrl).then(domain => { const modelService = domain.models(); modelService.openModel("people", "fred").then(model => { // the model is {firstName: “Fred”, lastName: “Flanders”} // A real time string const firstName = model.elementAt("firstName"); firstName.on("set", evt => { console.log(firstName.value()); }); firstName.on("insert", evt => { console.log(firstName.value()); }); firstName.on("remove", evt => { console.log(firstName.value()); }); // Listen to course grained events firstName.on("model_changed", evt => { console.log("change"); }); // Set the string firstName.set("Ted"); // "Ted", "change" // Delete the "T" at index 1 firstName.remove(0, 1); // "ed", "change" // Insert an "N" at index 0. firstName.insert("N", 0); // "Ned", "change" }); });

PORTLAND, Ore. -- The suspect in Friday's fatal MAX train stabbing rampage entered their first court appearance yelling about free speech.
"Free speech or die, Portland! You got no safe place. This is America. Get out if you don't like free speech!” Jeremy Christian yelled as they walked into the courtroom Tuesday.
Jeremy Christian appears in court for the first time since the stabbing.
“Death to the enemies of America. Leave this country if you hate our freedom. Death to Antifa! You call it terrorism, I call it patriotism! You hear me? Die.”
Christian faces two counts of aggravated murder, one count of attempted aggravated murder, one count of assault in the first degree, two counts of intimidation and three counts of unlawful use of a weapon.
The surviving stabbing victim, Micah Fletcher, attended Tuesday's court hearing.
Christian's next court appearance is scheduled for Wednesday, June 7 at 9:30 a.m.
Court documents reveal sequence of events
The homicide detective investigating the triple stabbing on a Portland MAX train says in court documents that surveillance and cellphone videos show Christian cutting the three victims with a knife.

Detective Michele Michaels says in a probable because affidavit made public Tuesday that the videos include audio of Christian, 35, spewing racial and religious epithets during the attack that killed two men and wounded a third.
Michaels says Fletcher told them Christian yelled the epithets and also threatened to decapitate people.

Police and witnesses said the victims were defending two teen girls who were the focus of Christian's tirade. Both are black and one was wearing a hijab. Michaels said the girls told them they had felt threatened.
According to court documents, Christian was drinking sangria and shouting at the girls and other people on the train. They yelled statements including, "Go home, we need American here," "I don't care if you are ISIS," and "Free speech or die."
After several attempts to get Christian to calm down, they made a sudden move in the direction of victim Taliesin Namkai-Meche, who responded by standing up. Micah Fletcher, who was nearby, got up and stood next to Namkai-Meche. Court documents say Christian shoved Fletcher in the chest and appeared to pull a folding knife from their pocket and conceal it in theirs hand.
Fletcher shoved Christian back and continued telling them to get off the train. After stumbling and telling Fletcher to hit them again, court documents say Christian stabbed Fletcher in the neck. They then stabbed Namkai-Meche in the neck.
The third victim, Rick Best, got up to intervene and Christian stabbed him, court documents said. Before leaving the train, Christian stabbed Namkai-Meche and Best again.
Christian got off the train at the Hollywood Transit Center, threatened several people on the platform, and left the area. Police arrested them several blocks away.
Suspect confessed to stabbing
While in the back of a Portland police car, Christian confessed to the stabbing and told officers, "I can die a happy man," according to court documents.
Christian, who was being recorded while in the back of the car, said,"I'm happy now. I can rest easy."
Court documents show that Christian said, "I hope they all die. I'm gonna say that on the stand. I'm a patriot and I hope everyone I stabbed died."
Suspect has history of encounters with police
Christian, who is a self-proclaimed white nationalist, has a long history of confrontations with police. Detectives are looking into their background and extremist ideology, police said.
Christian has three prior felonies.
They told jailers that they have no income, no mental health issues and does not remember the last time they had a permanent address.
Christian says they went to school through ninth grade, but passed the high school equivalency exam commonly known as the G.E.D. and took some community college classes.

South Sydney Rabbitohs forward Ben Te'o is exploring their options in European rugby union — a move which could see them follow teammate Sam Burgess into the England World Cup set-up.
While the Rabbitohs were yesterday celebrating the signing of Penrith prop Tim Grant for next season, it emerged Te'o was weighing up whether to follow Burgess in switching codes at the end of the year.
Burgess has already announced their plans to join Bath in the English premiership as they pursue a place in the England side at next year's rugby union World Cup.
Te'o, who has an English passport through their mother, has an option in their contract with Souths, meaning they can either stay put or join Burgess in walking away at the end of this year.

Activist Post
There once was a guy who wrote a book about their journey out of crippling brain fog. They warned that to get out of it they and others needed to use extreme caution about what they brought into the house. With gloves, anything they purchased was unwrapped and placed into more natural vessels like glass, wood and stainless steel. Furthermore, most of those purchases were avoided in the first place.
Does that seem extreme to you?
Researchers are slowly, surely and quietly admitting the cumulative effects of handling food packaging and eating its contents over the years. What are they, and what can you do? Without having to wear a biohazard suit, of course.
Food packaging chemicals may be harmful to human health over the long term caution environmental scientists in a commentary in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. Sure it's a commentary, but if this sounds like radical alarmist scaremongering let's remember that researchers probably knew about these materials (approved as safe) from the beginning and, perhaps, due to consumer concern, more than mere chemicals are the things finally leaking out.
Synthetic chemicals used in packaging, processing and storing foods were approved as safe in minor doses, but those previous comforting messages hold nothing now. Not only have they come back to say “we were wrong” about that cumulative amount and its true metabolism in the body, but consumers in the last few decades have upped their intake of packaged foods. Not only do we handle those materials on a daily basis, but they leach into food, beverages and the environment because they are not inert. Its' a problem that yesteryear's more costly but reusable packaging (wood, glass, steel etc.) didn't seem to pose. Our crops are often watered with the waste of those products as the recent incident with Whole Foods reminded us.
So, aside from the processed and packaged food ingredients themselves, the people who eat those products are likely chronically exposed to low levels throughout their whole lives, said the authors. To be sure, little was done in the beginning for long-term testing or impact in the womb. They find that lifelong exposure to FCMs (food contact materials used in packaging, storage, processing or preparation equipment) “is a cause for concern for several reasons.”
Known toxicants, such as formaldehyde (a cancer-causing substance) are legally used in these materials. Formaldehyde is widely present, in low levels, in plastic bottles used for carbonated drinks and melamine tableware.
Secondly, other chemicals known to disrupt hormone production also crop up in FCMs, including bisphenol A (BPA), tributyltin, triclosan, and phthalates. BPA gets dropped for a more dangerous BPS and product labels can boast “BPA-Free!”
The authors point out:
Whereas the science for some of these substances is being debated and policymakers struggle to satisfy the needs of stakeholders, consumers remain exposed to these chemicals daily, mostly unknowingly.

Thirdly, there are over 4,000 chemical substances used intentionally in FCMs!
Furthermore, potential cellular changes caused by FCMs and, in particular, those with the capacity to disrupt hormones, are not even being considered in routine toxicology analysis, which prompts the authors to say that this “casts serious doubts on the adequacy of chemical regulatory procedures.”
Seriously! Hormones and metabolism have been rarely studied until now – it's as though basic anatomy and physiology were disregarded. Chemical in – chemical out. But that's not how it works. The truly scientific miracle here is the survival of the human body under such chemical basting.
They admit that establishing potential cause and effect as a result of lifelong and largely invisible exposure to FCMs will be no easy task, largely because there are no unexposed populations to compare with, and there are likely to be wide differences in exposure levels among individuals and across certain population groups. There goes the control group! Things like this are often introduced with questions asked later. The people are essentially the testing grounds, but with no control group “no one can say for sure” about the true damaging effects.
They want some sort of population-based assessment and mammal-monitoring that they say are urgently needed to tease out any potential links between food contact chemicals and chronic conditions like cancer, obesity, diabetes, neurological and inflammatory disorders. Basically, more research needed into the impact of chemical constituents leaching into foodstuffs and the entire population has likely been exposed since most foods are packaged or processed in some way.
That's the scary warning part, but I beg to differ. Let's not hold our breath for “more research” that, so far, has not overhauled the way we handle food.
Here's the empowering part: No one is bound with a ball and chain to buy packaged and processed food – you don't have to handle all of that. We can buy in bulk at co-ops and CSAs, hit up the farmers markets or go straight to the farm. Find your food source here. By eating whole foods straight from the ground, you have a better chance at satiating with nutrients that can then in turn detoxify your body.
In the search for an Earth-like alien world, astronomers have had their eyes set on planets beyond our solar system, but some moons orbiting some of these exoplanets may be just as likely to support life, scientists say.
Astronomers have discovered more than 800 exoplanets, with many more candidate worlds awaiting confirmation by follow-up observations. Most of them, however, are gas giants, similar to Jupiter, and only a handful have a solid surface and orbit their host stars in the habitable zone, the range where liquid water, and perhaps life as we know it, can exist.
But a team of astronomers says these uninhabitable exoplanets could host habitable exomoons.
"There is a habitable zone for exomoons, it's just a little different than the habitable zone for exoplanets," Rory Barnes of the University of Washington and the NASA Astrobiology Institute said in a statement.
Barnes and René Heller of Germany's Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam explained that considerations about climate and light would be very different for exomoons compared with exoplanets.
Like Earth's moon, many exomoons are tidally locked to their host planet, meaning one hemisphere is permanently turned away from the planet, which would constrain the habitable regions on the moon's surface. Moons also have two sources of light — one from their star and the other from their host planet — and are subject to dramatic eclipses.
"An observer standing on the surface of such an exomoon would experience day and night in a totally different way than we do on Earth." explained Heller. "For instance, stellar eclipses could lead to sudden total darkness at noon."
The astronomers, whose research is detailed in the January issue of the journal Astrobiology, say the effects of tidal heating must be considered when determining an exomoon's habitability. Moons that orbit their planet too closely will experience strong tidal heating and a runaway greenhouse effect that would boil away any surface water.
Though no habitable exomoons have been found, Barnes and Heller say there's no reason to assume they don't exist.
Some researchers have already started thinking about how they might use instruments like the planet-hunting Kepler Space Telescope to detect alien moons. Telescopes such as Kepler search for planets as they transit, or cross in front of, their star, causing telltale dips in the star's brightness. Variations in these brightness patterns might reveal the presence of a moon orbiting a planet.

I've pirated stuff.
I have a feeling this is one of those things that most people have done. Perhaps it was wholly unintentional—as when a couple of relatives of mine “accidentally” downloaded some music from Napster back when that was a going concern. Perhaps it was just a couple of things that were way too difficult to get anywhere else. Or perhaps it was a whole bunch of things, because, yes, some people are super pirates, and though there are only a few of them, it's easy to see why the entertainment industry is so obsessed with stopping them. The point is: I was a first-year student and sophomore in college when Napster was a big deal, so of course I've pirated stuff. Those were the golden days of pirating weird shit you heard about once and just had to seek out.
Advertisement
And, yeah, I'll admit I've pirated since then, though certainly not at the level I did in those days. My motives range from what I'd consider to be pretty damn pure (this is completely unavailable in my country of origin, and I'd really like to see it and share it with others) to slightly less pure (well, the album won't be out for a couple of weeks, and I'm going to buy it anyway) to almost completely despicable (who wants to pay for premium cable anyway?). I'm not one of those people who try to justify these decisions. I know what I'm doing occupies, at best, a legal black hole. I know that there are any number of arguments for how media companies are stupid—copyright law is a complete sham, no one's adapting to the digital frontier quickly enough, etc.—but I also know that invoking these arguments doesn't somehow magically make what I've done pure. I'm taking stuff that doesn't belong to me, and I'm not paying for it. Regardless of whether I plan to pay for it eventually or would pay for it if someone would make it available to me, I don't somehow think I'm striking a blow against the tyranny of big Hollywood.
All of this has been rumbling around in my head since I saw last week's Oatmeal cartoon about the struggles of the author to watch HBO's Game Of Thrones online. The cartoon has been much discussed, from points-of-view both pro and con, and yet there's a point I don't think anybody has raised: The reason the hero of the cartoon can't watch Game Of Thrones legally yet is because the system set up to produce Game Of Thrones only works if there's a window when people pay a premium to watch that content. HBO, which has flirted with putting its stuff on iTunes from time to time (often at a more expensive price point than other things on iTunes), is one of the dominant entertainment companies on the television landscape, but it's all too easy to forget that HBO isn't in the content-generation business; it's in the subscriber-attraction business.
This is something all TV is wrestling with in this era when pirating gets easier and easier, and digital streaming alternatives have yet to figure out a way to become profitable. The broadcast networks, by and large, do their best to make sure their stuff is available online because, well, they aim to hit as many viewers as possible (and getting shows online adds to the Nielsen numbers for them eventually). Yet there's no indication that advertising for online web streams is going to raise the kind of money networks need to produce the sorts of content they do any time soon, at least if Hulu's original programming, which is cute but pretty cheap, is any indication. The major networks are still in the advertiser-attraction business, and they don't show any signs of trying to get viewers to pay a fee to watch their favorite shows online without ads or a day before everybody else (as some have suggested).

It's trickier over in cable. A basic cable network like FX or USA makes its money from a combination of fees paid to the company by cable providers and advertising. This gives those networks a nice cushion of cash to start from (those cable provider fees), but it also requires them to create programs that are going to keep people paying their cable provider for a package of channels. This is largely why so many cable shows have such long delays toward getting programs up on streaming sites. If viewers are watching FX's shows on Hulu, they're not paying their cable subscription package, and the cable providers aren't making any money. For a broadcast network like NBC, piracy is a concern, but it's a relatively minor one when looking at the changing ways television does business. (Much more pressing is figuring out a new way to measure the amount of people watching a show and its ads, first-run, on DVR, and online.)
For a basic cable network, piracy is a much more urgent concern because many pirates are those who've “cut the cord” and eliminated cable from their homes entirely. (I should state here that I'm dealing entirely with the U.S and Canada here. Foreign pirates pose entirely different problems for U.S. networks.) Every time someone does this, it decreases the amount of money paid to cable providers, thus decreasing the amount of cable providers who pay fees to pick up FX, and so on. Theoretically, at least, it creates a vicious cycle wherein original programming—which is expensive—is the first thing to go.
The problem is even more pronounced over at HBO, Showtime, and Starz. HBO, at least, has long based its model on the idea that a certain amount of people—more than 20 million of them at last check—will pay for the rights to watch the network's highly acclaimed programming first-run. Those subscribers, in recent years, have also gotten access to the network's HBO Go, a streaming site that contains nearly every show in HBO's history, as well as whatever movies the network has the rights to for that period. (Numerous cable companies have made HBO Go unavailable to their subscribers, recognizing—correctly—that it probably represents the cable-less future of the network. They're being idiots.) The network then releases its shows on DVD around a year after they initially debut.

This model has been obscenely profitable for HBO, and the network has poured much of that cash back into programming development. The steady subscriber base ponying up around $15 a month (give or take) provides a solid cushion for the network to base its program development on, while the long tail of DVD releases creates an effect where a show like The Sopranos continues to make the network solid money years after it went off the air. The network has shifted this somewhat, perhaps to convince people to subscribe in the midst of a recession, as the first season of Boardwalk Empire didn't hit DVD until after the second season ended. But for the most part, this model is obeyed. For instance, Game Of Thrones, which started this whole discussion, comes out on DVD (and iTunes and Amazon and so on) in mere days.
The problem HBO (and the other premium cable channels) faces is that it's boxed in by its need to be in bed with cable companies. The easiest solution to the problem posed in the Oatmeal cartoon is simply to make HBO Go available to anyone who wants it, for a monthly fee that would probably be slightly larger than what the monthly fee for the TV network is (to offset any costs lost from cable providers). The problem is that if the network does this, it will be seen as declaring war on the very providers who keep it coming into people's homes. Even though it seems, to a generation raised on the Internet, like everybody watches stuff on the Internet all of the time, the vast majority of Americans still consume their entertainment on TV. Without the cable companies beaming HBO into those people's homes, the network loses subscriber fees, which robs it of the ability to program anything beyond cheap movies.
The real fear for HBO is similar to the real fear for FX: If too many people start watching online (legally or illegally), then the network will lose the money it uses to develop the programming that makes HBO a must in many homes. HBO is the market leader because it's developed a reputation for having the best, most cutting-edge programming on TV, programming that includes hits like Game Of Thrones, yes, but also far less-watched, riskier programming like Enlightened, Treme, and Luck. Unintentionally, HBO has boxed itself into a corner where it needs to keep following the old model—even if it increasingly makes less sense—if it wants to keep making the kinds of programming that made the old model work so well. The kind of shows HBO makes are expensive. Game Of Thrones costs, conservatively, around $5 million per episode, and that's not including the costs from the pilot's set construction, which are spread over the length of the production. The only way to find that kind of money continues to be in the subscriber model. There's a reason HBO has been by far the network that acts most quickly to stop Internet piracy of its programming. If those shows are out there for free, it chips away at the whole business model.

The answer to many people is simply that HBO should make its programming available on iTunes or DVD more quickly. But this ignores the fact that HBO's subscriber base isn't just there to fund its hits but also its more experimental programming and its new pilots, which go through many iterations. (The Game Of Thrones pilot you saw last year was almost completely reshot.) If the only show you want to watch is Game Of Thrones, it would probably be fine by you if the network stuck it on iTunes every week—perhaps a couple of days late—at a premium. And there's no question that if HBO could get every Game Of Thrones viewer to pay $5 for an iTunes download of each episode, it would make back at least its production budget for the show (though it wouldn't turn a profit). But there's a distinct lack of stability there, a lack of stability that prompts networks to stop taking chances on riskier, more expensive programming, like Game Of Thrones.
I came into this piece with the idea that there was an easy answer here: Be more patient. The Internet has created a largely immature desire to have everything you've ever wanted now, and if it's not available now, well, who cares about the companies who funded that entertainment in the first place? For the most part, I find this sort of behavior—and the self-righteous chest-thumping that too often goes along with it—distasteful. (I suppose if I had my druthers, Internet pirates—again, like myself—would simply be a little more embarrassed and shameful about what they do, like people who get caught going 90 in a 65 mph zone.) But at the same time, I can see the arguments that because the Internet has made these sorts of things available right away, they should be available right away. The old ways are dying, and even if it means a rough decade for a company like HBO and the many daring shows it funds that I love, the network will be stronger in the long run if it embraces the obvious future right now. I see someone in that Oatmeal cartoon who can't wait a couple of weeks to see what they want to see, but I also see a generation—my own—raised to find major media monoliths that are slow to get with the times incomprehensible, like radio broadcasters laughing off television in the late '40s.
It's been argued that Hollywood has overblown the threat it receives from Internet piracy, and, to be sure, the number of people pirating works is substantial, but not nearly as large as the number actually watching on TV or in movie theaters. Piracy has always represented more of a potential threat to a network like HBO, which takes Internet piracy seriously enough to actively attempt to stop it, unlike many other networks. (My numerous friends with cease-and-desist letters from the network will attest to that.) It also clearly sees that there's an audience for its programming online, because HBO Go might be the single best-designed streaming site out there. But it's inadvertently trapped itself with a model that all but requires a virtue that the Internet has virtually eradicated: patience. I suspect this all reaches a point in the next decade where HBO either kisses traditional cable companies goodbye and follows Netflix off into online-based subscriptions or where the network gets trapped in its own vicious circle and dragged down by its own massive success. So, yes, I'll advocate patience, I think. HBO has been a force for good in the television world for almost two decades. I get why you're cutting your cords, but isn't it worth waiting a little while for a DVD in that case?
The captain was supposed to keep a hand on the throttle levers to feel them move, and they did so on and off, they told investigators. Lack of movement in the throttle levers did not trouble him, they told investigators, because they thought the auto-throttle would “wake up” and maintain a safe minimum speed with no sign.
Boeing's design leaves more discretion to the pilot and does not always ensure that the engines will maintain a minimum speed. Asiana ground school instructors warned the crews that the auto-throttle would be disabled when autopilot was being used by the crew to control the plane's descent to a certain altitude, according to one safety board document, but the lesson evidently did not stick.
Interviews with pilots indicate that Korean culture may have played a role in the crash. (Asiana is based in South Korea.)
Captain Lee told investigators that any of the three pilots on the plane could have decided to break off the approach, but they said it was “very hard” for them to do so because they were a “low-level” person being supervised by an instructor pilot.
They also said that as the plane approached, they were momentarily blinded by a light on the runway, possibly a reflection of the sun, but that they would not wear sunglasses because that was considered impolite among Koreans.
The pilots did know they were descending too fast. One said so about a minute before impact, in English, which the crew was using on approach, according to a transcript of the flight data recorder. The second mention was also in English, but the third, about nine seconds after the first, was in Korean, a clue in the transcript about the urgency in the cockpit.
In the transcript, no one said that the plane was too low until the last 30 seconds of the flight. Three seconds before impact, Captain Lee made a comment rendered in the transcript as “oh # go around,” indicating an attempt to re-engage the engines and abort the approach.
Finance Minister Cameron Friesen probably had no idea what kind of public relations disaster they were about to unleash when they announced on budget day that their government had already found $122 million in savings after being in office for only one month.
They should have known, though, because they also knew there was no $122 million in cost savings. And they also knew, or should have known, that they would be asked for a breakdown of those alleged savings, which they still haven't produced because they don't exist.
It all started on budget day when, with great bravado, Friesen told media during budget lock-up that even though government had only been in office just a few weeks, they had already identified $122 million in savings that helped them reduce the deficit.
“We have achieved what we said we had achieved in terms of finding savings,” Friesen said in their opening remarks. “Already in this document you will see that we have been able to find $122 million in savings, a step in the right direction.”
Naturally, Friesen was asked for a breakdown of those alleged savings. Because they were nowhere to be found in the budget documents.
“OK, so good question,” Friesen responded. “So, how does a government that's just six weeks old manage to find $122 million? You look hard and you work long hours.”
Um, yeah. But where's the list?
Well, there was no list yet, said Friesen. But he'll get us one soon, they said. In the meantime, they did have a few examples of where government supposedly found savings, including $44.5 million from clawing back the school property tax for seniors, which isn't a savings, it's a revenue increase. Friesen also said government was saving $4 million from reducing the size of cabinet and some $900,000 a year by getting the Canada Revenue Agency to administer property tax credits.
Still nowhere near the $122 million of savings the government claimed it had found.
“Over the coming days and weeks, we're going to have additional opportunity to unpack these numbers,” Friesen assured the media.
The next day, Friesen was asked again about the list. And again they couldn't produce one.
“Oh, the $122 million of savings that we were able to identify and realize,” Friesen told reporters. “I believe that's something that is being worked on to be provided to media soon, so I know that it was requested yesterday, I believe that request is being acted on.”
And so went the rest of the week, with both the media and Opposition MLAs asking Friesen and Premier Brian Pallister to come clean on the $122 million in alleged savings. And still no list.
Pallister even went as far as saying that it would take so much time for Friesen to put the list together, they wouldn't have time to do anything else. Huh?
On Wednesday, Friesen produced a verbal list of some of the savings.
But it was almost identical to what they said on budget day. So not much new there.
And then government started changing its explanation again. Pallister told reporters Thursday the $122 million is really the difference between this year's projected deficit and last year's shortfall. But those aren't “savings.” The difference between the two deficits is determined by changes in total revenues and expenditures, both of which went up this year. It's not the “realized” savings Friesen claimed to have found.
Then late Thursday, government released another set of figures purporting to be the savings they had identified, this time totalling $104 million. However, most of them Friesen had already talked about last week and the rest had no detail, including $35 million in alleged savings from “reducing discretionary prevention funds.” Where? What departments? What discretion?
This isn't just about getting into the nitty-gritty of a budget. It's about a lack of honesty from government who made grandiose claims about finding savings when in fact there was no $122 million in savings.
It's dishonest and it's hardly the kind of open and transparent government Pallister claims to be ushering in.
If you can't wait for the day drones plop packages on your porch or a flying car whisks you to work, you should know that the hold-up isn't technological, but technocratic. Before these future flyers can take off, they must learn to play by the rules of the sky.
That means communicating with air traffic control and other aircraft, spotting and avoiding threats, and generally knowing what to do when things go sideways. Making all of this happen demands whole new levels of capability—not just from the aircraft, but from the sprawling system that oversees them.
The good news is, change is coming. Even though commercial drone technology barely existed a decade ago, regulators are hustling to integrate it into the national airspace. The FAA tapped Intel CEO Brian Krzanich to lead its Drone Advisory Committee, and established seven test sites to explore drone flight management. NASA is supporting the quest with its unmanned aircraft traffic management research program.
Although everyone is moving fast, they're shunning the "break things" part of the Silicon Valley ethos. Safety trumps efficiency and technological advances. “Our challenge is to find the right balance where safety and innovation co-exist on relatively equal planes,” FAA chief Michael Huerta told the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Symposium in March. “As we move toward fully integrating unmanned aircraft into our airspace, the questions we need to answer are only getting more complicated.”
The Current Regime
So far, the primary answer has been, no fun for you. Anyone operating a drone for commercial purposes must first pass a test covering traditional pilot know-how like wing load factors and airspace regulations. Drone pilots must keep their flyer below 400 feet, away from crowds and airports, and within their line of sight—restrictions designed to keep drones out of trouble. The FAA occasionally waives some restrictions with an eye toward seeing which rules it could loosen, but some people say overzealous regulation will keep the tech from reaching its potential.
“There are so many applications that will benefit from drone use,” says Mark Barker, director of business development and marketing at the Nevada Institute for Autonomous Systems, which the state government created to expand the use of unmanned air systems. “Energy companies can inspect 50 miles of power lines with winged robots instead of human-piloted aircraft. Drones can conduct search-and-rescue, fly filming missions, survey environmental hazards, and act as couriers. They're more efficient and more cost-effective than human-piloted aircraft.”
The FAA sees good reason to move cautiously, given basic questions remain unanswered. How will the aircraft respond when it runs out of power or experiences a failure? How will it communicate with air traffic control to approve a flight path or line up for a landing? And how will it avoid smacking into other aircraft?
“If there's no pilot in the aircraft scanning the horizon, and it's not big enough for its own radar, how will they detect other aircraft?” says Ed Waggoner, director of NASA's Integrated Aviation Systems Program. “How do you get information to the unmanned aircraft or the ground-based pilots-in-command in remote-flying situations to avoid other aircraft that may not be clearly announcing their intentions?”
Moving Forward
New, miniaturized sensor technology will be key here, particularly the ADS-B positioning systems increasingly common in commercial and civilian aircraft. That technology is approaching approaching drone-friendly dimensions and power requirements, but other problems remain. “In the case of what we call ‘non-cooperative' aircraft—those flying without those systems either deliberately or because they're not required to—we need to determine whether ground sensors or airborne sensors in other aircraft represent the best strategy for tracking them,” Waggoner says.
Communicating with air traffic control presents its own problems. The FAA must determine how onboard flight management systems will function, and how those data-based, nonverbal systems will "talk" to controllers on the ground. It could be that the systems operate in a hybrid fashion (with human aircraft operators on the ground assisting otherwise autonomous aircraft through certain phases of their missions) or the successful integration might be contingent on the arrival of the next generation of air traffic control technology.
That happens to be in the pipeline, as well, via the FAA's ongoing NextGen modernization program. This concurrent evolution is both a complication and a blessing for planners working to merge unmanned aircraft into the national air system. “We're working with the FAA to ensure that our own work with UAS integration is forward-looking, so we'll be ready for how air traffic control will function in the transportation system a decade or more from now,” Waggoner says. “But we also need to be safely testing these systems in a realistic, current environment.”
Testing, Testing
That's where the FAA's seven test sites come in. For instance, later this month, Nevada's Institute for Autonomous Systems—the largest of the seven, with the ability to operate state-wide—will participate in a “Technical Capability Level” evaluation at its Reno facility. It will test a variety of traffic management systems on fixed-wing airplanes and multirotor copters, with flights up to 1,200 feet altitude and across several miles of approved airspace. (Other test sites around the country will be similarly engaged, running their own tests with various commercial and research partners.)
In Nevada, researchers will conduct long-distance aerial survey, package delivery, and emergency response missions. They'll also try out ground-based sense-and-avoid systems. In January, they'll throw in “non-cooperative” aircraft—those not identifying themselves—over moderately populated areas. Sometime after that, they'll expand the test to denser urban areas and explore tasks such as news gathering and package delivery.
As they move toward full freedom, these aircraft must rival humans not just in skill, but in judgment, knowing what to do with the information they collect. “It's not just sensing and knowing, but the vehicle needs to know the rules-of-the-road when flying—go left if you're on a collision track, go over there to avoid contact, plan your path this way, etc.,” says Richard Pat Anderson, director of the Flight Research Center at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. “That requirement is not baked into the current FAA vision for NextGen, so it will need to be there, as well.”
When the FAA has finally reached a solution that answers all these concerns—there's no specified timeline—it will gradually alter the regulations to permit unmanned and autonomous aircraft to zip around the skies, hopefully without causing trouble. Only then will you be able to whip out your smartphone and order some sneakers or whistle up an autonomous electric air taxi to take you to the mall to buy them yourself.
An Anglican diocese in Victoria has voted to become a company so child abuse survivors will know exactly who to sue if they launch a case against the church.
Wangaratta is the third Anglican diocese in Victoria to make the decision to incorporate.
Ballarat and Bendigo have already voted to make the change and the diocese of Melbourne will vote on whether to do so in the next few weeks.
The Victorian decisions cut through debates about the legal status of Anglican and Catholic churches in sex abuse lawsuits.
David Parsons, a legal adviser to Wangaratta said the decision to become a discrete legal entity was made at a recent meeting of the diocesan synod - the governing body - which covers 60 Anglican congregations in north-east Victoria.
Mr Parsons told AAP they expected the change would happen relatively quickly.
The catalyst for the change was a claim in Workcover Victoria but Bishop John Parkes told the synod meeting on May 28 its importance lay in providing child abuse survivors with an identifiable church body to sue.
They said it was clear from a consultation paper on redress and civil legislation published in January by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse that abuse survivors had difficulty identifying a correct defendant when they are dealing with religious bodies.
"The necessary outcome of any approach would seem to be that survivors should be able to sue a readily identifiable church entity that has the financial capacity to meet claims of institutional child sexual abuse," they said.
They also said it was important the Anglican Church be seen to be on the front foot in responding to identified weaknesses in the child protection framework.
Bishop Parkes referred to the Ellis defence, which had been used by the Catholic Church to deter people from suing.
In that case the NSW Court of Appeal found Catholic Church trustees could not be held vicariously liable for damages claimed by John Ellis who was abused by a priest in Sydney.
The court also found Mr Ells could not sue then archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal George Pell because the abuse happened when their predecessor was in charge.
There has been much debate around that decision, which the Catholic Church says is no longer relied on by its lawyers.
As part of its response to the royal commission the church's Truth Justice and Healing Council proposed national legislative change to require all unincorporated associations working with children to set up properly-funded entities for civil proceedings.
Council CEO Francis Sullivan told AAP on Wednesday there were already entities within the Catholic Church which could be sued, but legislative change had yet to happen.
As a recently married man, I support Proposition 8: I donât want the sanctity of marriage sullied by queers, pedophiles, robosexuals and Californians. I simply will not stand by and watch the solemn, noble, sacred covenant of marriage be taken anything less than completely seriously. I take it so seriously, in fact, that Iâve recently undergone the painstaking (and again, totally sacred) process of becoming an ordained minister. No, seriously: Thatâs for real. Iâve completed my ordainment, and can now legally officiate a marriage that will be recognized in all fifty states. As you might expect, it was a long and arduous task involving years of study, strict spiritual discipline, studious reflection on the nature of man, and hopping across a series of crumbling pillars without spilling a glass of water to retrieve the precious Ajanti Dagger.
This is how religion works.

Send a scan of the filled-out marriage certificate to therightreverendcookiemonster@gmail.com , and it will be returned to you, signed and ready to file.
âNo need be formal. You call me just Reverend Monster.â
No further steps required (although there is a small, onetime fee of two cookies, to be fed to the puppet post-ceremony). If youâre worried that the records office will dispute it, dress a small child in a Sesame Street T-shirt when you file the certificate; only the most heartless bastard would be able to utter the words âbut the cookie monster doesnât existâ to the kidâs face.
Citizens across the state of Texas are coping with one of the worstfloods in recent history. Fortunately, an incredible number of peopleevacuated the flood plains and loss of property has been more prevalentthan loss of life.The unprecedented fallout from HurricaneHarvey is expected to continue as the flood waters rise. “In some ways, Ithink this event is going to far surpass what we saw in Tropical StormAllison,” said J. Marshall Shepherd, director of the atmosphericsciences program at the University of Georgia. “The steering currentsthat would normally lift it out of that region aren't there,” they toldthe New York Times.All too often the focus is on paranoia of alooming apocalypse, but the prepper lifestyle is incredibly advantageousespecially during a natural disaster. People thought Randy Wagner wascrazy when they drove from Texas to Louisiana to pick up a $8300 Aqua Dam,but after the horrible floods in Texas the investment provedinvaluable.The 30″ tall tube can be filled with water to holdback flood water. According to Wagner, “I was the crazy guy. Everybodywas kinda, y'know, goin' by laughing at me. But today they're reallyimpressed with this.” When the floods came, water reached a depth of 27″but never broke through their barrier. Once the cost of flood damage hasbeen taken into account, $8300 seems a negligible price to pay to saveyour home.
Children playing in front of a tenement building for Volga Germans nicknamed the "Russian Hotel" (l)eft and schoolchildren in front of Calvary Church, which later became Redeemer of Calvary United Methodist Church, 5001 W. Gunnison St. View Full Caption Northwest Chicago Historical Society
CHICAGO — In the years after Jefferson Park's 1889 annexation into the city, the neighborhood became a hub for a small but proud immigrant group: German settlers who had spent more than 100 years living in Russia.
Called "Volga Germans" for the riverbed in southeastern Russia where Catherine the Great invited them to settle in the 1760s, the migrants were free to speak their own language and practice their religion — often Lutheran or Mennonite.
But once the Russian government started drafting them into the empire's army in the late 1800s, many made for the United States — specifically, the growing Northwest Side of Chicago — according to Frank Suerth, a board member of the Northwest Chicago Historical Society.
"They settled in a lot of odd places, and we don't know why exactly they chose to live in Jefferson Park — but like with any immigrant story, they sent letters back and said 'Hey, this is a great place, come on over.'"
But assimilating into the area wasn't always easy, according Daniel Pogorzelski, the historical society's vice president:
This Russian aspect of their heritage often lead to difficulties for the Volga Germans living in the United States at a time when the country was gripped by the “Red Scare” that broke out with Lenin's Communist revolution. Jerry Amen, president of the Northern Illinois Chapter of the American Historical Society of Germans from Russia recounts the prejudice their family experienced because of their Russian-German background. When looking for work on the railroad during the Great Railroad Strike of 1922, their great-grandfather George Amen like many other Germans from Russia would hide their heritage and regularly pass themselves off as Poles so that they wouldn't be denied jobs as subversive 'Bolsheviks.'

The unique Ruso-German enclave and its descendants have left an indelible impact on the area, founding still-thriving churches like Edens United Church of Christ, 5051 W. Gunnison St., and the Redeemer of Calvary United Methodist Church, 5001 W. Gunnison St.
They joined a pair of tenement buildings at the intersection of Higgins Avenue and Milwaukee Avenue, often referred to as the "Russian Hotel" for the workers they hosted. Those structures have since been demolished.

PORTLAND, OREGON – Marco Bustos scored in their second straight match but it wasn't enough as a youthful Vancouver Whitecaps FC side fell 2-1 to Timbers 2 (T2) in a closed-door preseason friendly Saturday night at Providence Park.
After T2 took an early 1-0 lead, Bustos brought the game level for Vancouver in the 53rd minute, finishing from inside the box after receiving a feed from fellow Whitecaps FC Residency grad Kianz Froese.
But Portland's new United Soccer League side responded against the run of play in the 66th minute to secure a victory in their first-ever match.
The ‘Caps coaching staff decided to field a young group on Saturday – a day before their Simple Invitational opener against the host Portland Timbers. Every single outfield player in Vancouver's lineup was 24 years old or younger. Midfielder Gershon Koffie, who missed Vancouver's last three matches with an illness, wore the captain's armband for the Blue and White.
T2 also rolled out a youthful squad in their first-ever competitive match. And it was the home team that struck first in the sixth minute.
Fatawu Safiu scored the first-ever goal for T2, poking it past a charging Paolo Tornaghi after receiving a nice little ball from Brent Richards. Safiu's tally was the first goal Tornaghi has conceded in four preseason appearances.
From there, Whitecaps FC started to take over.
Fullbacks Sam Adekugbe and Ethen Sampson were very involved along the flanks and Nicolas Mezquida looked lively as usual, but hometown boy Erik Hurtado had Vancouver's best chances to equalize.
In the 11th and 15th minutes, the Beaverton, Oregon resident forced T2 goalkeeper Justin Luthy into making two diving saves on a pair of well-taken strikes.
Hurtado came close again at the 30-minute mark. This time, Adekugbe sent in a low cross to Hurtado at the back post but a T2 defender managed to deflect the cross out for a corner just in the nick of time. Despite dominating possession and controlling the run of play, the Blue and White entered the break down 1-0.
T2 got off to a strong start to the second half and nearly doubled their lead in the 52nd minute, when trialist Eueller Rodriguez ripped a 25-yard strike off the crossbar.
Less than a minute later, Whitecaps FC found their equalizer – thanks to a Residency connection.
Froese played the ball to Bustos' feet in the left side of the box and the 18-year-old fired it into the bottom right corner to bring the game level.
The ‘Caps kept coming in search of a go-ahead marker.
In the 55th minute, Hurtado directed a low Ben McKendry cross towards goal but second-half T2 keeper Daniel Withrow was there to make a goal line save. Withrow made another key save off a heavy Robert Earnshaw strike from the top of the box in the 62nd minute.
Whitecaps FC made a number of subs around the hour-mark, including the introduction of Colombian trialists Ruben Anchico and Harold Gomez, and the Blue and White continued to control the run of play. But T2 caught the ‘Caps on the counter in the 66th minute and took their second lead of the match, when Rodriguez blasted in a left-footed strike from inside the area.
Vancouver had a few late opportunities to equalize through Earnshaw and Froese, but fell just short in the end. There's little time to rest for Whitecaps FC, who kick off the Simple Invitational preseason tournament on Sunday against Cascadia rival Portland Timbers.
Kickoff is set for 5 p.m. PT and the match will be streamed live on whitecapsfc.com.

One dismal exception to welcome recent rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court was its majority opinion in Glossip v. Gross, a death penalty case out of Oklahoma. The case was nominally about the use of a possibly unreliable drug (midazolam) as the first in a "three-drug cocktail" – the evidence is disputed of midazolam's effectiveness in inducing deep unconsciousness (thus painlessness) prior to the injection of a paralytic followed by heart-stopping potassium chloride. The principle opinions – Justice Samuel Alito for the majority, Justice Sonia Sotomayor for the four dissenters – become quite technical in their discussion of midazolam, almost as though the issue of state homicide could be reduced to the question of the right mix of poisons. The exchange forcibly recalls the 1994 opinion of Justice Harry Blackmun, who once supported executions but had come to their declaration: "From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death."
Alito has no similar scruples, and goes on at length in defending midazolam as a reasonable alternative for states left bereft by abolitionists and foreign drug manufacturers who will no longer supply them with their preferred killing agents. To do so, Sotomayor points out, they have to rely on a single state "expert" who appears to have relied "primarily on the Web site www.drugs.com " and who told the court that while they can't be certain, they believe midazolam is sufficient to the task.
Sotomayor was more dismayed by the majority's assertion (Alito was joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Kennedy, Scalia, and Thomas) that if the condemned object to midazolam, they should identify a less cruel alternative. "[U]nder the Court's new rule," they wrote, "it would not matter whether the State intended to use midazolam, or instead to have petitioners drawn and quartered, slowly tortured to death, or actually burned at the stake: because petitioners failed to prove the availability of sodium thiopental or pentobarbital, the State could execute them using whatever means it designated." Alito could only respond, "That is simply not true, and the principal dissent's resort to this outlandish rhetoric reveals the weakness of its legal arguments."
Lightning Strikes
Alito's opinion is mild in comparison to the independently concurring opinions of Antonin Scalia (Clarence Thomas concurring) and another by Thomas (Scalia concurring). Thomas' opinion is not really a legal argument – rather a litany of heinous crimes that to them cry out for blood vengeance. Scalia is mostly concerned with insulting their colleagues and anyone else (e.g., abolitionist lawyers or judges) who dare to describe capital punishment as "unconstitutional" when it is in fact mentioned in the Constitution (in the Fifth Amendment requirement of due process).
That settles the matter for Scalia – if it wasn't cruel and unusual in the 18th century, it can't possibly be cruel and unusual now.  They are content to condescend to their colleagues who, they write, "live in a world apart from the vast majority of Americans. After work, we retire to homes in placid suburbia or to high-rise co-ops with guards at the door. We are not confronted with the threat of violence that is ever present in many Americans' everyday lives."
That hyperbolic sneer is primarily in response to the separate dissent from Justice Stephen Breyer (joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg) who, rather than quibble over drug cocktails, instead describes the administration of capital punishment as involving "three fundamental constitutional defects: 1) serious unreliability, 2) arbitrariness in application, and 3) unconscionably long delays that undermine the death penalty's penological purpose." Laying out those factors at length, Breyer concludes, "From a defendant's perspective, to receive that sentence, and certainly to find it implemented, is the equivalent of being struck by lightning." They call for the court to request a "full briefing" on the essential question of the Eighth Amendment: no cruel and unusual punishments.
A False Exchange
There are not currently five votes for abolition on the court, although Breyer's opinion has led to some speculation that we may be close to a turning point. The U.S. has become an execution outlier among advanced nations, and when your companions are mostly dictatorships, it's time to seek new company. The arguments in favor of state murder traditionally focus on criminals or victims – blood cries out for blood – but the essential players in the capital punishment drama are "the state" and "the people." The state presumes to hold the power of life and death – yet the purported believers in "limited government" (including a couple on the court) also tend to be ferocious supporters of capital punishment.
The death penalty is primarily about us: If we don't have the right to kill except in immediate self-defense, how can we delegate such authority to the state, which already possesses the powers of arrest, judgment, and incarceration (for life, if truly necessary)? When we enable the state to kill in our names, we've exchanged justice for vengeance.

Zoonosis Synonyms Zoönoses, zoonosis, zoönosis A dog with rabies. Pronunciation Specialty Infectious disease
Zoonoses[pronunciation?] are infectious diseases that can be naturally transmitted between animals (usually vertebrates) and humans.[1][2][clarification needed]
Major modern diseases such as Ebola virus disease and salmonellosis are zoonoses. HIV was a zoonotic disease transmitted to humans in the early part of the 20th century, though it has now mutated to a separate human-only disease. Most strains of influenza that infect humans are human diseases, although many strains of swine and bird flu are zoonoses; these viruses occasionally recombine with human strains of the flu and can cause pandemics such as the 1918 Spanish flu or the 2009 swine flu[3]. Taenia solium infection is one of the neglected tropical diseases with public health and veterinary concern in endemic regions.[4] Zoonoses can be caused by a range of disease pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites; of 1,415 pathogens known to infect humans, 61% were zoonotic.[5] Most human diseases originated in animals; however, only diseases that routinely involve animal to human transmission, like rabies, are considered direct zoonosis.[6]
Zoonoses have different modes of transmission. In direct zoonosis the disease is directly transmitted from animals to humans through media such as air (influenza) or through bites and saliva (rabies).[7] In contrast, transmission can also occur via an intermediate species (referred to as a vector), which carry the disease pathogen without getting infected. When humans infect animals, it is called reverse zoonosis or anthroponosis.[8] The term is from Greek: ζῷον zoon "animal" and νόσος nosos "sickness".
Causes [ edit ]
Zoonotic transmission can occur in any context in which there is companionistic (pets), economic (farming, etc.), predatory (hunting, butchering or consuming wild game) or research contact with or consumption of non-human animals, non-human animal products, or non-human animal derivatives (vaccines, etc.).
Contamination of food or water supply [ edit ]
The most significant zoonotic pathogens causing foodborne diseases are Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter, Caliciviridae, and Salmonella.[9][10][11]
In 2006, a conference held in Berlin was focusing on the issue of zoonotic pathogen effects on food safety, urging governments to intervene, and the public to be vigilant towards the risks of catching food-borne diseases from farm-to-dining table.[12]
Many food outbreaks can be linked to zoonotic pathogens. Many different types of food can be contaminated that have a non-human animal origin. Some common foods linked to zoonotic contaminations include eggs, seafood, meat, dairy, and even some vegetables.[13] Food outbreaks should be handled in preparedness plans to prevent widespread outbreaks and to efficiently and effectively contain outbreaks.
Farming, ranching and non-human animal husbandry [ edit ]
Contact with farm animals can lead to disease in farmers or others that come into contact with infected farm animals. Glanders primarily affects those who work closely with horses and donkeys. Close contact with cattle can lead to cutaneous anthrax infection, whereas inhalation anthrax infection is more common for workers in slaughterhouses, tanneries and wool mills.[14] Close contact with sheep who have recently given birth can lead to clamydiosis, or enzootic abortion, in pregnant women, as well as an increased risk of Q fever, toxoplasmosis, and listeriosis in pregnant or the otherwise immunocompromised. Echinococcosis is caused by a tapeworm which can be spread from infected sheep by food or water contaminated with feces or wool. Bird flu is common in chickens. While rare in humans, the main public health worry is that a strain of bird flu will recombine with a human flu virus and cause a pandemic like the 1918 Spanish flu. In 2017, free range chickens in the UK were temporarily ordered to remain inside due to the threat of bird flu.[15] Cattle are an important reservoir of cryptosporidiosis[16] and mainly affects the immunocompromised.
Wild animal attacks [ edit ]
Insect vectors [ edit ]
Pets [ edit ]
Pets can transmit a number of diseases. Dogs and cats are routinely vaccinated against rabies. Pets can also transmit ringworm and Giardia, which are endemic in both non-human animal and human populations. Toxoplasmosis is a common infection of cats; in humans it is a mild disease although it can be dangerous to pregnant women.[17] Dirofilariasis is caused by Dirofilaria immitis through mosquitoes infected by mammals like dogs and cats. Cat-scratch disease is caused by Bartonella henselae and Bartonella quintana from fleas which are endemic in cats. Toxocariasis is infection of humans of any of species of roundworm, including species specific to the dog (Toxocara canis) or the cat (Toxocara cati). Cryptosporidiosis can be spread to humans from pet lizards, such as the leopard gecko.
Exhibition [ edit ]
Outbreaks of zoonoses have been traced to human interaction with and exposure to other animals at fairs, petting zoos, and other settings. In 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an updated list of recommendations for preventing zoonosis transmission in public settings.[18] The recommendations, developed in conjunction with the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, include educational responsibilities of venue operators, limiting public and non-human animal contact, and non-human animal care and management.

History [ edit ]
During most human prehistory groups of hunter-gatherers were probably very small. Such groups probably made contact with other such bands only rarely. Such isolation would have caused epidemic diseases to be restricted to any given local population, because propagation and expansion of epidemics depend on frequent contact with other individuals who have not yet developed an adequate immune response. To persist in such a population, a pathogen either had to be a chronic infection, staying present and potentially infectious in the infected host for long periods, or it had to have other additional species as reservoir where it can maintain itself until further susceptible hosts are contacted and infected. In fact, for many 'human' diseases, the human is actually better viewed as an accidental or incidental victim and a dead-end host. Examples include rabies, anthrax, tularemia and West Nile virus. Thus, much of human exposure to infectious disease has been zoonotic.
Many modern diseases, even epidemic diseases, started out as zoonotic diseases. It is hard to establish with certainty which diseases jumped from other animals to humans, but there is increasing evidence from DNA and RNA sequencing, that measles, smallpox, influenza, HIV, and diphtheria came to humans this way. Various forms of the common cold and tuberculosis also are adaptations of strains originating in other species.
Zoonoses are of interest because they are often previously unrecognized diseases or have increased virulence in populations lacking immunity. The West Nile virus appeared in the United States in 1999 in the New York City area, and moved through the country in the summer of 2002, causing much distress. Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease,[26] as are salmonellosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Lyme disease.
A major factor contributing to the appearance of new zoonotic pathogens in human populations is increased contact between humans and wildlife.[27] This can be caused either by encroachment of human activity into wilderness areas or by movement of wild animals into areas of human activity. An example of this is the outbreak of Nipah virus in peninsular Malaysia in 1999, when intensive pig farming began on the habitat of infected fruit bats. Unidentified infection of the pigs amplified the force of infection, eventually transmitting the virus to farmers and causing 105 human deaths.[28]
Similarly, in recent times avian influenza and West Nile virus have spilled over into human populations probably due to interactions between the carrier host and domestic animals. Highly mobile animals such as bats and birds may present a greater risk of zoonotic transmission than other animals due to the ease with which they can move into areas of human habitation.
Because they depend on the human host for part of their life-cycle, diseases such as African schistosomiasis, river blindness, and elephantiasis are not defined as zoonotic, even though they may depend on transmission by insects or other vectors.
Use in vaccines [ edit ]
The first vaccine against smallpox by Edward Jenner in 1800 was by infection of a zoonotic bovine virus which caused a disease called cowpox. Jenner had noticed that milkmaids were resistant to smallpox. Milkmaids contracted a milder version of the disease from infected cows that conferred cross immunity to the human disease. Jenner abstracted an infectious preparation of 'cowpox' and subsequently used it to inoculate persons against smallpox. As a result, smallpox has been eradicated globally, and mass vaccination against this disease ceased in 1981.

Hot Trend - How Brands Benefit From Video Apps
User consumption of TV and video content is shifting toward smartphones and tablets with the expansion of 4G internet and higher quality devices. We live in an era of video where YouTube and Twitch channels could be just as popular as Netflix shows.
The abundance and availability of video content facilitates the competition between video service providers. For news channels, brands, and companies, mobile apps become a major tool for expanding and engaging audiences.
Video streaming apps experience massive growth as user video consumption habits are changing. Let's take a look at the numbers:
Mobile video is on the rise. Half of all digital videos were played on mobile devices in 2015 (Ooyala).
Mobile video is winning the battle for attention over TV. US consumers spent 198 minutes a day using mobile apps in comparison to 168 minutes watching TV (Flurry research). 22% of users use mobile apps to stream video while simultaneously watching TV (IAB study).
Kids and young people choose to watch video from smartphones. 57% of kids prefer to watch video content on mobile devices (Ooyala Q2 2015 Video Index) while 48% of millennials watch videos only from their smartphones (Animoto).
Video services have to adapt. 23% of Netflix users are streaming on mobile phones while 15% are streaming on tablets(BI Intelligence).

Video streaming and VOD services should view mobile as a priority nowadays as more users commit to longer form content on their smartphones and spend hours watching mobile video. For brands, the mobile platform can become a strategic point for engaging users with video content.
Video services and brands shift to mobile
There is still a difference between apps that provide TV streaming content and content on demand apps (Video On Demand - VOD), whereas some apps and platforms offer a wide variety of content, blurring the line between TV streaming, VOD and networks.
Famous brand name apps such as Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Now offer TV shows on demand. According to the latest App Annie statistics, Netflix is a top video streaming app in the US by number of downloads while HBO Now leads by the amount of revenue. BuzzFeed recently launched the BuzzFeed Video app for viral video content and the app has already reached the 500,000 installations level.
Source: App Annie
There are also TV streaming apps that let users stream TV in real time on a mobile device, but most of them offer content from only one network.
The NewsOn streaming app is an exception. This app offers news videos from several local TV stations. It allows users to choose a preferable local station based on geolocation and watch news, weather, and sports content.
Services like Sling TV and AT&T's DIRECTV offer a mix of video content including streaming TV channels as well as video on demand. These apps are expected to become an alternative to cable TV as they allow users to watch the same video content from all kinds of devices while not requiring service plans, cables, and/or satellite dishes.
Open app platforms like Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Roku provide a new opportunity for brands to reach potential consumers through their own video streaming apps.
Video app promotion
While big name companies, like Buzzfeed, can rely on their followers when launching mobile video apps on the app stores, less well known brands have to use promotional methods, like user acquisition, in order to build an active user base for their apps.
Before launching a marketing campaign, it's crucial for video streaming apps to perform market and competitor research, define a target audience(s), and create a clear message for potential users. What unique features does the app have that will allow it to stand out? What promotional methods and monetization models do competitors use? Having a clear understanding of what the target audience looks like and what it expects from the product will help you build an effective marketing strategy.
For example, an app with video content for kids can have an emphasis on the parental control feature in its promotional campaign. For the target audience, parents who choose and install apps for kids, this is an important benefit.
When it comes down to user acquisition, it's crucial for video streaming apps to acquire interested and engaged users with high LTV (lifetime value). Having a trusted marketing partner, like app marketing platform GoWide, will allow buying premium traffic from direct publishers and optimize marketing costs. Mobile user acquisition, organized by experts, has many benefits such as:
-large potential audience
-detailed real-time data
-precise audience segmentation
-constant campaign adjustment and optimization
What to expect?
Let's see where the mobile video streaming apps will take the industry:
Amazon creates its own shows (pretty good ones) and HBO launches services. It looks like the merge of different content, services, and platforms into one global mobile video streaming channel.
With the growing popularity of video streaming apps, more and more users will give up cable TV and switch to mobile TV.
Mobile video apps will offer a more personalized experience for its users. Mobile video is all about personal preferences and comfort. Users can watch it anywhere, easily navigate content, and post feedback.
Twitch and YouTube Gaming shows how niche video streaming apps can become extremely popular. We should expect more successful niche video apps in beauty, tech, and online education.
While video streaming apps give users an amazing and comfortable content consumption channel, brands can benefit from building an active base of mobile users and turning them into loyal customers through video engagement.

Image caption The implications for Scotland's economy is the issue that matters most for voters in the referendum, according to the survey
The economy is the issue that matters most to voters taking part in the independence referendum, a poll carried out for the BBC has suggested.
The results of the poll feature in a documentary, Scotland's Top Ten Battlegrounds, which is being shown on Tuesday.
A sample of 1,008 adults, aged 16 and over, were asked which issues, from a list of 10, mattered most to them.
The economy came out top with pensions second and welfare third.
Then, in descending order, came Scotland's relationship with the rest of the UK, currency, immigration, energy, defence, the relationship with the European Union and broadcasting.
There is a high probability that there will be a border constructed between Scotland and England and there will be border checks Dr Azeem Ibrahim, Scotland Institute
Research agency TNS carried out the interviews throughout Scotland between 3 and 10 January.
All interviews for the poll were conducted face-to-face, in homes, using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing and quota sampling.
No politicians were interviewed for the hour-long programme, which is narrated by actor John Gordon Sinclair.
Instead, a range of academics gave their views on each of the 10 topics which are expected to feature significantly in the debate.
Dr Azeem Ibrahim, of the Scotland Institute think-tank, is one of the academics featured in the programme.
They claimed that the British government may build a border post to guard against the threat of terrorist attacks because independence for Scotland could lead to intelligence failures.
The idea of manned border posts is the most hysterical scaremongering Dr John MacDonald, Scottish Global Forum
They told the programme: "There is a high probability that there will be a border constructed between Scotland and England and there will be border checks and this has been articulated to me from the highest levels of the MoD.
"Actually a former Secretary of Defence told me that is more than likely to actually happen because the rest of the UK simply cannot be open to any sort of vulnerabilities … if there are huge intelligence gaps between Scotland and England."
But Dr John MacDonald of the Scottish Global Forum dismissed the idea that border controls would follow a vote for independence.
They said: "The idea of manned border posts is the most hysterical scaremongering. I consider it grossly irresponsible."
The programme is the third in a series of 13 in-depth BBC documentaries on the referendum.
Voters in Scotland will decide on their country's future on 18 September.
They will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?"
Scotland's Top Ten Battlegrounds is being shown at 21:00 on BBC Two on Tuesday, 11 February.
Viewers outside Scotland can access BBC Two Scotland on Sky 142 (HD) & 970 and Freesat 97.
There is a question that was never put to the leaders of the campaign for Brexit and has not, as far as I'm aware, been put to the prime minister since their conversion to the cause. It is this: what will you do on the morning of formal separation from the EU that you could not have done the day before?
The Guardian view on the housing white paper: it won't fix a broken market | Editorial Read more
What restored freedom, what action hitherto proscribed by the tyrannical bureaucrats of Brussels, will you indulge as the sparkling English wine is uncorked? Bend a banana, perhaps. Or catch the Eurostar to Paris and savour the sensation of no longer having the automatic right to work there. Oh! Pleasant exercise of hope and joy! … Bliss it will be in that dawn to be alive. Right?
Brexit enthusiasts will complain that my question is unfair. Objections to EU membership were all about democracy, sovereignty and long-term economic opportunity: not pleasures that can be consumed overnight. And while that might be so, it is also true that people tend to vote for things in expectation of tangible benefits. A weekly dividend of £350m for the NHS, for example. So the unlikelihood of quick gratification for leave voters is a problem.
Theresa May identifies a deeper imperative to Brexit than was written on the referendum ballot paper. They hear a collective cry of rage against the economic and political status quo, requiring radical change on multiple fronts. So, in parallel with the prime minister's plan for a “clean break” from the rest of Europe, Downing Street is thinking of ways to address grievances that generated demand for Brexit in the first place: stagnant wages; anxiety that living standards have peaked and that the next generation is being shafted; the demoralising experience of working all hours without saving a penny.
Government thinking on these issues has so far yielded a modest harvest. Last week's housing white paper was meant to address a chronic shortage of homes by nudging councils towards quicker approval of new developments. Last month saw the launch of an industrial strategy, embracing state activism to nurture growth in under-resourced sectors and neglected regions. Last year May appointed Matthew Taylor, formerly head of Tony Blair's policy unit, to lead a review into modern employment practices – the decline of the stable, rewarding full-time career and its replacement by poorly paid, insecure casual servitude.

A notable feature of this non-Brexit agenda is how closely it tracks arguments made by Ed Miliband in the last parliament. The former Labour leader had a whole thesis about the structural failings of British capitalism and how it corroded people's confidence in the future, leaving them anxious and angry. Their focus on the “squeezed middle” anticipated May's promise to help those who are “just-about-managing”. Miliband's calls for state intervention in failing markets were derided by the Tories as socialist delusion at the time, but they opened rhetorical doors through which May is now tentatively stepping. Last week's housing paper even used a forgotten policy that Labour had launched in 2013 – a “Use it or lose it” threat to developers who hoard land without building on it.
Meanwhile, Downing Street has taken a close interest in the commission on economic justice set up by the Institute for Public Policy Research, a thinktank that provided regular policymaking services for Labour in the days before its capture by Corbynism. The commission was recently invited to give a presentation to May's leading policy advisers inside No 10.
Were it not for Brexit's domination of political debate, May's eschewal of conventional left-right dividing lines – their willingness to jettison Thatcherite orthodoxies – might have attracted more notice. But then, as the old Yiddish saying goes, if my granny had balls she'd be my grandpa. The idea that there is some parallel realm of politics that May can develop and for which they will be remembered alongside their EU negotiation is delusional. Timid little steps on housing, industrial strategy and job security are not going to get the prime minister to the promised land of fairness and opportunity in time for Brexit day. And they insist on a diversion to set up more grammar schools along the way, despite nearly every expert in the field warning that educational selection closes more avenues to social mobility than it opens.
Someone will have to level with the country. The dawn of Brexit promises no freedom that wasn't there the day before
Even on immigration the government cannot meet expectations raised by the leave campaign. There will still be new people arriving because businesses will insist on a capacity to hire from abroad. Millions who arrived in Britain over recent decades, and their children born as British citizens, will stay because the country is their home. Even the most draconian border regime cannot restore the ethnic homogeneity for which some nostalgic Brexiteers pine.
At some point someone is going to have to level with the country. Much of what leave voters were promised is unavailable because the EU was never responsible for a lot of things that made them angry. The dawn of Brexit promises no significant freedom or opportunity that wasn't there the day before. It isn't a message that ex-remainers can deliver, for all the reasons that scuppered their campaign last year. It sounded patronising before the referendum and the tone isn't improved by bitterness in defeat.
None of the original leave campaigners will dare admit their dishonesty in making Brussels the scapegoat for every conceivable social and economic ill. There is no point expecting Boris Johnson or Michael Gove to embark on a self-critical journey of public-expectation management. Far more likely they will be drawn deeper into the old lie: someone must be held responsible when Brexit does not unblock the sluices of wealth and opportunity; when the milk and honey refuse to flow. The obvious candidates are foreigners and fifth columnists – EU governments that negotiate in bad faith; alien interlopers who drain public services; unpatriotic “remoaners” talking the country down.
The question then is whether the prime minister will go along with that game. They have managed so far to sustain the pretence that dealing with the failure of Britain's economy to share its bounties fairly and quitting the EU are kind of the same thing. If it turns out that they aren't, and one ambition obstructs the other, who will they blame?
After George Washington's administration concluded a treaty with Great Britain in 1795, France decided it was time for a change at the top of the U.S. government.
While George Washington had enjoyed virtually unanimous support in the first two U.S. presidential elections, things looked a lot different by 1796. Two competing parties, the Federalists and the Republicans, had emerged, and politics had gotten nasty. While Washington probably could have won a third term if they had chosen to run, they aren't the universally beloved figure they once are.
After the progress of the French Revolution led to war between Great Britain and France in 1793, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson was among those who thought the United States should support France, its champion during the Revolutionary War. Instead, Washington sided with their pro-British Treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, and others who argued that the United States should remain neutral in the conflict. Then they sent the pro-British Chief Justice John Jay to negotiate a treaty with Great Britain, in an attempt to preserve good relations between the two countries.

The Jay Treaty, ratified in 1795, enraged the French government, who saw it as a clear violation of the 1778 alliance between France and the United States. Convinced that the tide of American public opinion was in its favor, France decided to take action in order to bring about a change in presidential administrations—specifically, to replace the pro-British, Federalist Washington with the pro-French, Republican Jefferson. Pierre Auguste Adet, the French minister (ambassador) since 1795, and other French officials, began openly supporting the Republicans and attacking the Federalists whenever possible.

In September 1796, Washington announced they would not seek a third term as president. In their Farewell Address, much of which Hamilton wrote, Washington included a memorable warning against foreign entanglements, now considered a timeless piece of advice for future leaders. At the time, however, it was specifically aimed at France's ongoing efforts to interfere in the election of Washington's successor.
In response, the French government only stepped up those efforts. In late October and November, Adet sent a series of carefully timed diplomatic notes to Timothy Pickering, Washington's secretary of state. At the same time, they released the notes for publication in the Aurora, a Philadelphia newspaper. In these missives, Adet pleaded with the American people to reject the Jay Treaty and renew the alliance with France. They then announced that France was suspending relations with the United States, and implied that only Jefferson's election as president might prevent war between the two countries.
Adet's belief that such interference would help France didn't come out of nowhere—Jefferson themselves had assured the minister a year earlier that France did indeed have friends in America. As the U.S. minister in Paris in 1796, James Monroe had also hinted to French officials that relations between the two countries would improve if Republicans were to win the presidential election.
John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, who squared off in the election of 1796.
In the end, however, there's little evidence Adet's interference helped Jefferson, apart from a few votes from Pennsylvania Quakers motivated by threats of a war with France. In fact, the minister's actions mostly hurt the Republicans, making them seem like pawns of a foreign government. James Madison wrote to Jefferson in December 1796 (just before electors cast their ballots) that Adet's scheme was “working all the evil with which it is pregnant” and threatened to create “a perpetual alienation” of France and the United States. In early February 1797, the election results came in: Federalist John Adams won the presidency by a narrow margin, and Jefferson became vice president, in a bitterly divided administration.
Some 220 years later, as the United States confronts the intervention of another foreign power in another presidential election, it seems fitting to remember Washington's warning in their farewell address: “Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence, (I conjure you to believe me fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake; since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of Republican Government.”
Donald J. Trump on Friday rejected an offer to debate Bernie Sanders before the June 7 California primary, saying, “It seems inappropriate that I would debate the second-place finisher” in the Democratic nominating contest.
The two men had been kicking around the idea of a debate since Wednesday, when Mr. Trump appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” and Mr. Kimmel said that Mr. Sanders had passed along an invitation to debate. Mr. Trump, who secured the Republican Party's nomination for president on Thursday, told Mr. Kimmel they were open to the idea.
But after Mr. Sanders pressed the issue on Friday, Mr. Trump released a statement batting away any debate with him.
“Based on the fact that the Democratic nominating process is totally rigged and crooked Hillary Clinton and Deborah Wasserman Schultz will not allow Bernie Sanders to win, and now that I am the presumptive Republican nominee, it seems inappropriate that I would debate the second-place finisher,” Mr. Trump said.
67386. (a) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions shall adopt a policy concerning sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking, as defined in the federal Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1092(f)) involving a student, both on and off campus. The policy shall include all of the following:
(1) An affirmative consent standard in the determination of whether consent was given by both parties to sexual activity. “Affirmative consent” means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that they or they have the affirmative consent of the other or others to engage in the sexual activity. Lack of protest or resistance does not mean consent, nor does silence mean consent. Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time. The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual relations between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of consent.
(2) A policy that, in the evaluation of complaints in any disciplinary process, it shall not be a valid excuse to alleged lack of affirmative consent that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the sexual activity under either of the following circumstances:
(A) The accused's belief in affirmative consent arose from the intoxication or recklessness of the accused.
(B) The accused did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain whether the complainant affirmatively consented.
(3) A policy that the standard used in determining whether the elements of the complaint against the accused have been demonstrated is the preponderance of the evidence.
(4) A policy that, in the evaluation of complaints in the disciplinary process, it shall not be a valid excuse that the accused believed that the complainant affirmatively consented to the sexual activity if the accused knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant was unable to consent to the sexual activity under any of the following circumstances:
(A) The complainant was asleep or unconscious.
(B) The complainant was incapacitated due to the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medication, so that the complainant could not understand the fact, nature, or extent of the sexual activity.
(C) The complainant was unable to communicate due to a mental or physical condition.
(b) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions shall adopt detailed and victim-centered policies and protocols regarding sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking involving a student that comport with best practices and current professional standards. At a minimum, the policies and protocols shall cover all of the following:
(1) A policy statement on how the institution will provide appropriate protections for the privacy of individuals involved, including confidentiality.
(2) Initial response by the institution's personnel to a report of an incident, including requirements specific to assisting the victim, providing information in writing about the importance of preserving evidence, and the identification and location of witnesses.
(3) Response to stranger and nonstranger sexual assault.
(4) The preliminary victim interview, including the development of a victim interview protocol, and a comprehensive followup victim interview, as appropriate.
(5) Contacting and interviewing the accused.
(6) Seeking the identification and location of witnesses.
(7) Providing written notification to the victim about the availability of, and contact information for, on- and off-campus resources and services, and coordination with law enforcement, as appropriate.
(8) Participation of victim advocates and other supporting people.
(9) Investigating allegations that alcohol or drugs were involved in the incident.
(10) Providing that an individual who participates as a complainant or witness in an investigation of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking will not be subject to disciplinary sanctions for a violation of the institution's student conduct policy at or near the time of the incident, unless the institution determines that the violation was egregious, including, but not limited to, an action that places the health or safety of any other person at risk or involves plagiarism, cheating, or academic dishonesty.
(11) The role of the institutional staff supervision.
(12) A comprehensive, trauma-informed training program for campus officials involved in investigating and adjudicating sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking cases.
(13) Procedures for confidential reporting by victims and third parties.
(c) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions shall, to the extent feasible, enter into memoranda of understanding, agreements, or collaborative partnerships with existing on-campus and community-based organizations, including rape crisis centers, to refer students for assistance or make services available to students, including counseling, health, mental health, victim advocacy, and legal assistance, and including resources for the accused.
(d) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, the governing board of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions shall implement comprehensive prevention and outreach programs addressing sexual violence, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. A comprehensive prevention program shall include a range of prevention strategies, including, but not limited to, empowerment programming for victim prevention, awareness raising campaigns, primary prevention, bystander intervention, and risk reduction. Outreach programs shall be provided to make students aware of the institution's policy on sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. At a minimum, an outreach program shall include a process for contacting and informing the student body, campus organizations, athletic programs, and student groups about the institution's overall sexual assault policy, the practical implications of an affirmative consent standard, and the rights and responsibilities of students under the policy.
(e) Outreach programming shall be included as part of every incoming student's orientation.
There are only two US media outlets that have reported on Cuba's response to the deadly 7.0 earthquake that hit Haiti. One was Fox News, which claimed, wrongly, that the Cubans were absent from the list of neighboring Caribbean countries providing aid. The other was the Christian Science Monitor (a respected news organization that recently shut down its print edition), which reported correctly that Cuba had dispatched 30 doctors to the stricken nation.
The Christian Science Monitor, in a second article, quoted Laurence Korb, former assistant secretary of defense and now based at the Center for American Progress, as saying that the US, which is leading the relief efforts in Haiti, should “consider tapping the expertise of neighboring Cuba,” which they noted, “has some of the best doctors in the world--we should see about flying them in.”
As for the rest of the US media, they have simply ignored Cuba.
In fact, left unmentioned is the reality that Cuba already had over 400 doctors posted to Haiti to help with the day-to-day health needs of this poorest nation in the Americas, and that those doctors were the first to respond to the disaster, setting up a hospital right next to the main hospital in Port-au-Prince which collapsed in the earthquake.
Far from “doing nothing” about the disaster as the right-wing propagandists at Fox-TV were claiming, Cuba has been one of the most effective and critical responders to the crisis, because it had set up a medical infrastructure before the quake, which was able to mobilize quickly and start treating the victims.
The American emergency response, predictably, has focussed primarily, at least in terms of personnel and money, on sending the hugely costly and inefficient US military--a fleet of aircraft and an aircraft carrier--a factor that should be considered when examining that $100 million figure the Obama administration claims is being allocated to emergency aid to Haiti. Considering that the cost of operating an aircraft carrier, including crew, is roughly $2 million a day, just sending a carrier to Port-au-Prince for two weeks accounts for a quarter of the announced American aid effort, and while many of the military personnel sent there will certainly be doing actual aid work, delivering supplies and guarding supplies, many, given America's long history of brutal military/colonial control of Haiti, will inevitably be spending their time ensuring continued survival and control of the parasitic pro-US political elite in Haiti.
Otherwise, the US has basically ignored the ongoing day-to-day human crisis in Haiti, while Cuba has been doing the yeoman work of providing basic health care.
But that's not a story that the American corporate media want to tell.

WASHINGTON — As the Democratic primary moves into more diverse states, three black Clinton supporters laid into Bernie Sanders' record on a conference call with reporters on Wednesday — casting the Vermont senator as a newcomer to black issues, interested now because they are running for president.
"There's simply no comparison," between the two candidates on the issues important to black voters, said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the whip of the Congressional Black Caucus, who called Clinton a "true friend" to the black community, focusing especially on their time in the Senate and their stance on gun control.
Jeffries said that Sanders has chosen to focus on black issues now that he's running for president in the "twilight" of their political career. Sanders, Jeffries said, "has been largely missing in action."
Rep. Hazel Dukes called Sanders "absent" from the issues that matter to black voters, and when a reporter asked whether Sanders participation in the March on Washington didn't mean something, they said that thousands had walked in the march.
The Clinton campaign is in a battle for the nomination that it did not expect. The Feb. 27 Democratic primary, in which Clinton has a comfortable lead over Sanders, will be a barometer for what their national support is with black voters, who polls show currently see them as the most likely choice for the nomination.
But the operatives in Sanders camp courting the black vote are quietly confident they can close the margin in South Carolina — and elsewhere. On Wednesday, Michelle Alexander, the author of The New Jim Crow, a seminal text on the problem mass incarceration said in a post on Facebook they were endorsing the revolution behind Sanders. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the left's most widely-read intellectual and essayist said they were voting for Sanders, as did civil rights activist and entertainer Harry Belafonte.
Speaking on the hope for a turnaround, a Sanders aide on Tuesday night said, "Just wait and see."
Ryan Kesler booked 25:29 of ice time on Monday night against the San Jose Sharks.
The line would make sense if it was early May, when the Vancouver Canucks were trounced in four straight by the San Jose Sharks. It seems to make a lot less sense when the line in fact comes from Monday night, when the Sharks beat the Canucks in the first preseason game of the year, a tilt with little meaning. San Jose's best player dressed Monday, Joe Pavelski, played 17:15.
It appeared foolish, to load such minutes on Kesler's shoulders, with worries of their durability over a long winter, including the Olympics.

The Alain Vigneault era in Vancouver was characterized by a careful style. One manifestation was the amount of ice time players received. Vigneault would resist leaning too heavily on their best, knowing the toll the season and travel takes on the Canucks more so than others in the league.
Henrik Sedin, for one, has never averaged 20 minutes a night during their career. They peaked at 19:41 in 2009-10 and their 19:20 last year was typical of their time under Vigneault.
John Tortorella has other ideas.  They are big on rest and recovery but sees physical convalescence occurring with days off – they promised the Canucks the most of any team in the league. Tortorella's skeptical that limiting in-game minutes keeps bodies fresh.
"I'm not a big believer in, 'Holy crap, they played 26 minutes, do they have anything left for Wednesday?' I don't buy it," said Tortorella on Tuesday in Vancouver after practice.
Tortorella cited the urgency of now in terms of player deployment.
"I want to win that game. I want to win Game 2, I'm not looking to Game 5. So if Sedin or Kes needs to be on the ice in those situations, in that third period and play 12 minutes of that third period, they will play the 12 minutes of that third period to try to win that game."
Henrik Sedin, afterwards, said they were poised for the extra duty. They and their brother had lobbied Vigneault for additional time, such as on the penalty kill, which they never played and are set to under Tortorella. Sedin, in their quiet, modest way, spoke of a hunger to show the league they and their brother are still top-tier players, able to drive scoring and contribute defensively.

"We're capable," said Sedin, "of playing more than the minutes we did with AV."
Long after everyone else in the world realized that Donald Trump is an asshole, Kanye West has finally realized that the guy banning Muslims from entering this country, threatening to wall up our borders, and who openly promoted an anti-Semitic agenda on Holocaust Remembrance day isn't the sort of person they should be hanging around with. According to TMZ, West has deleted all of their pro-Trump tweets and explained that they no longer supports Trump, and it's all apparently because of the president's extremely controversial and racist immigration ban.
For those who don't recall the weird story tying together Trump and West, it essentially started when West publicly declared that they would've voted for Trump (if they had voted). They later visited the then-president-elect at Trump Tower, with West appreciating the chance to highlight some policy issues they care about and Trump appreciating the chance to be photographed with a famous rapper. In between those events, West abruptly canceled all of their tour dates and was checked into a hospital for over a week to help with their “exhaustion.” Essentially, it sounds like they were going through some stuff.

Whatever is driving West's change of heart, it has now given Trump something else to be sad about today, which is really unfortunate.
Scientists used to believe that your brain stopped physically evolving in early childhood but new research has shown that keeps changing well into middle age.
Brain scans have shown that prefrontal cortex – the area just behind your forehead – continues to change shape in your 30s and 40s.
The discovery is particularly significant as the prefrontal cortex is a key area of the brain and is often thought said to be key to what makes us human.
It is said to be involved with decision making, social interaction and many other personality traits.
Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, a neuroscientist at University College London, revealed the new thinking at the British Neuroscience Christmas symposium in London.
They said: "Until about 10 years ago we pretty much assumed that the human brain stopped developing in early childhood.
"But we now understand from brain imaging that that is far from the truth and that many human brains keep on developing for many decades.
"The area of the brain that goes through the most protracted development is the prefrontal cortex right at the front of the brain.
"It is the part of the brain that is involved in high cognitive function such as decision making, planning and social behaviour. It is also to do with understanding other people.
"It starts develop in early childhood, is reorganised in late adolescence and continues developing well into the 30s and 40s.
"It is the part of the brain that makes us human."
Peat, a 35 year old veteran who has gained 50 podium places in various World Cup competitions, finally landed the title they covet most when finished the 2.1-kilometer (1.3-mile) course in 2 minutes, 30.33 seconds.
South African Greg Minnaar was second and Michael Hannah of Australia was third at Stromlo Forest Park. Britain's Gee Atherton was sixth.
"I don't think it's sunk in yet, over the years the worlds the World championship has become my nemesi. I'm still pretty overwhelmed with it all," Peat said.
"I'm the oldest guy out there and I've been trying for a long time with a lot of second places, but I felt strong coming into this race."
"It was pretty emotional putting the jersey on, on the podium knowing I could wear it as World Champion for the next year, I've been trying for a long time and it's just an unreal feeling."
They added: "I have had such bad luck at the World Championships but today I had an awesome run."
Australian Michael Hannah, who ended up in third, had set the fastest mark before Peat, runner-up in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2008, clocked their time on the 2.4km course.
One of the best moves I made with my prospect sales process is building out a standard first email.
Yesterday I gave you my basic formula and explained each part of the email.
I left off asking:
But what if the prospect doesn't really answer the questions?
Ranges are fine
The most common questions that prospects don't want to address are questions about budget. Usually they're worried that if they provide a number, you will charge them that amount even if your fee would normally be less than the number they gave you.
Yes it seems silly, but it's likely that your potential prospect has been burned before by other web service providers.
They are understandably shy about giving away a lot of information.
So I'm happy with ranges.
After I ask about budget I include a paragraph much like this one:
I know the budget question can be hard, but it really helps me evaluate what type of solution is best for you. Maybe you have $1000 and we need to look at using existing solutions or maybe you have $50k (or more) and we can custom-build stuff for you. Even an idea of what feels ‘expensive' for the work we're talking about is a great starting point
A typical response is “Well it's not $1000, but I think that $15k would be a platinum solution.”
Now we have a budget range.
Some prospects aren't even going to give you that much information.
Super super vague
A few months ago I had a prospect that got my initial email.
When I asked about what we were building they said
Something like a classifieds site. We prefer to talk on the phone, we're a personal company.
When I asked who the decision makers were, my contact replied:
Me, the CEO and a few others. When we talk on the phone we can talk more about whom the decision makers are. We are a very personal company.
When I asked about budgets:
Well we're not sure and we don't want to say anything via email. Lets talk on the phone, we're a very personal company.
At this point you have no answers really.
Oh sure, they said they are building a classifieds site but I already knew that from their first email. All I learned is that they are a very personal company and they want to talk on the phone.
Unfortunately they haven't qualified as my ideal client yet, since I really don't know anything about how they work and I don't know their budget.
You already know I don't take calls with unqualified clients.
That means the prospect above doesn't warrant a call, which means I refer them back to my questions and tell them I need more detail on the project before I can schedule them for a client call.
Straight up not answering
What if they simply don't answer at all?
Another recent prospect responded to my first email with:
Hey is there a way we can share work and cut the cost down?
Remember at this point I've asked about budget and not said anything about cost.
We haven't had a proper value conversation so I have no idea what the value of the work is. All I know is that they want a business listing site.
At this point I need to let the customer know that I can't go any further in the sales process without having my questions answered.
So I did and got:
It's a business listing site. Why do you need to know anything else?
I'm sure you see some red flags here and so did I, which means I told the prospect that if they were willing to sit down and answer my questions with some proper thought I'd be happy to see if we're a good fit.
Until then they're going to have to find someone else. At which point I figured it was done, but this is the response I got.
Yeesh what attitude. I found someone in South America that can do the job for 1/3 of the cost and 1/10th of the attitude. You obviously take your clients for a ride and lie to them.
Good for a bit of a laugh
Be aware that you'll get emails like the ones above from time to time so just don't sweat it.
With a reliable screening process, you save yourself a long ‘sales' process on a prospect that was clearly unqualified for your services.
Developing your initial prospect questions and requiring them to be answered is how you're going to save yourself from spending a bunch of time with leads that are simply a bad fit for your business.
Don't let them get you down. Stick to your process and you're going to talk with better leads because you qualify them before you dig deeper.

Here are some highlights from this week's On Hiring and Diversity newsletter. If you'd like to subscribe, sign up here.
The gender pay gap is so much worse than we thought.
The wage gap between college-educated men and women starts small, but it snowballs significantly over time, the economists Erling Barth, Claudia Goldin, Sari Pekkala Kerr, and Claudia Olivetti write in an article in the Harvard Business Review. By their early 40s, the average male grad takes home a whopping 55 percent more than the average female grad, the researchers found.
The reason? (Hint: if you think it's primarily because women “choose” low-paying careers, guess again.) Marriage and motherhood — or, more precisely, the traditional gender roles women tend to adopt after tying the knot and having kids — are the pivotal factors, the researchers say. A woman's earning power falls after they marry, thanks to a catch-22, Claire Cain Miller explains in a related article in The New York Times. Because they already earn less, it might seem sensible for a wife to put their husband's career before their own, at least temporarily, Ms. Miller notes. But that's where things cascade.
More often than not, it's the wife who moves for their husband's job (often hurting their career prospects in the process) and shoulders the bulk of the household and child-care duties, writes Ms. Miller, who is a Times correspondent. (The lack of parental leave and child-care policies in the U.S. doesn't help any.) That in turn makes them more likely to scale back their hours (though even when they don't, their employer will pay them less on the presumption that they might), they write. All of which undermines their long-term earnings potential (and any hope of recouping their losses) and fosters more gender bias. It's enough to make a woman's head spin.
The gap is widest for college-educated women in high-paying jobs, the economists say, since those positions pay more and put a premium on face time and fixed hours. (The pay gap for less-educated women expands with age, too, but less so only because men without college degrees lack the higher pay prospects of their more-educated male peers, the researchers note.) Their findings suggest that short of women staying single and childless, the keys to greater pay parity might lie in more flexible work hours, opportunities to work remotely, and a fairer labor division at home, Ms. Miller concludes.
Sally Hubbard, a legal journalist at Slate, would agree. Them the biggest career break wasn't a promotion or a job offer, but when their spouse took the lead at home, they write in a recent column: “My husband left their law firm job to start their own firm from home. I knew the change would be good for him, but I had no idea how good it would be for me,” they explain.
Of course, to fight gender pay discrimination a woman needs to know when it's happening in the first place. That's where ending taboos on sharing pay information (prohibitions on doing so have long been illegal, as NPR notes) and promoting transparency come in, Kristin Wong suggests in a New York magazine article. They note that shady employment practices — including gender bias — tend to thrive on secrecy. (Witness the recent Labor Department suit against Google, they add.) Disclosing pay data, meanwhile, looks increasingly like a win-win scenario for employees and employers, they note, pointing to studies showing that employees work harder and collaborate better when salaries are public.
The good news is more cities and states are introducing legislation that bars employers from penalizing workers who discuss pay and prohibits hirers from asking for salary histories.
Another study circulating online suggests that if men had more daughters, there might be greater parity, since fathers of girls tend to treat women better in the workplace, The Washington Post reports. Harvard University researchers compared venture capitalists with and without daughters and found that the former were 24 percent more likely to hire a female investment partner, the Post notes. What's more, those who did fare better financially, the newspaper adds. While this isn't the first study to suggest that dads of girls are more pro-equality, it does show that diversity is the reason these firms are more profitable. What seems like positive news on the surface, though, may seem less so on further reflection, Lucia Peters says in an article on Bustle: “Men shouldn't need to have daughters in order to want to promote gender equality in the workplace and at home. It's yet another reminder that our culture so frequently values women only insofar as they have relationships to men.”
The workplace is even less equitable for black women.
A new report from the Institute of Women's Policy Research confirms that African-American women, hit by the double whammy of sexism and racism, really do get shafted in the workplace, an article on Slate notes. What's more, unlike many of their white counterparts, black women are more likely to work full time and less likely to have high-earning husbands or partners to help carry the financial load, the article says.
Short Takes
The unseen labor of mentoring.
What does it mean to be a professor of color at a predominately white institution? It means being a go-to mentor for marginalized students, which is an emotionally taxing labor of love that never lets up, Manya Whitaker writes in an article on Vitae. So how do they help those students without jeopardizing them career? Ms. Whitaker explains.
Marginalized people need power, not courtesy.
In an essay on Medium, Fredrik deBoer explains why the “call out” culture, often dismissed as too tough on white people, men, and heterosexuals, actually lets them off easy: “Shaming culture teaches people from dominant groups that policing their language and thoughts is sufficient to achieve change. But you cannot be polite enough to black people, as a white person, to undermine white supremacy,” they write. What's more, shaming is aimed at people, not structures: “ICE, the racial income gap, and cissexism can't be shamed,” they note.
Discrimination is a health issue.
Mounting evidence suggests that racial and sexual prejudice is poisonous to the bodies and minds of those who experience it, an article on The Upshot explains.
Why conservative lawmakers are turning to free-speech bills as a fix for higher ed.
The conservative mantra in state legislatures these days is that college campuses are being held captive by liberal views, a Chronicle article by Beth McMurtrie reports (for subscribers). Free-speech bills like those recently introduced or passed in Colorado, Illinois, and Michigan have become one of the ways in which they plan to “right the ship,” they note.
Drew Faust will step down as president of Harvard in June 2018.
The historian, who led the university through economic crisis and campus growth, will always be remembered as its first female leader, Jack Stripling reports in The Chronicle.
Yet they remain an anomaly, Audrey Williams June notes elsewhere in paper. The proportion of female presidents in academe has “barely budged” during Ms. Faust's 10-year tenure at the Ivy League university's helm, they explain.
Colleges celebrate diversity with separate commencements.
Alternative graduation ceremonies for minority students — like the ones recently held at Harvard University, Emory and Henry College, and the University of Delaware — are becoming more common, according to an article in The New York Times.
What it costs to pay the rent.
A few weeks ago The Chronicle reported (for subscribers) that some candidates are saying no to jobs at universities in the Bay Area because they're worried about finding an affordable place to live. According to a new report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, that's not the only place where rents are out of reach. It turns out the average American worker would need to earn $21.21 per hour in 2017 to reasonably afford a modest two-bedroom apartment, an article on The Atlantic's CityLab says. That's almost triple the federal minimum wage of $7.25, and nearly a third more than the $16.38 hourly wage that the average renter is paid in the U.S., the article by Laura Bliss notes. In places like DC ($33.58), Maryland ($28.27), Massachusetts ($27.39), and New York ($28.08), among others, workers would need to bring home significantly more, they observe. In fact, there are only a dozen counties, in Washington, Arizona, and Oregon, in which the average worker earns enough to afford a modest one-bedroom flat, they add. And almost all of those counties are in rural areas, far from where most jobs are, Ms. Bliss concludes.

Your input look about right but might be somewhat differently configured. But it is the same Super IO chip and very close matching layout so that's good news
If you can send me a dump of sensors -u that'd be helpful to see how the chipset lines are aligned.
Additionally If you are up for it, try and get a log of the sensors while running something like hwinfo under windows since that can provide a good point of comparison.
Your +12V input might be correct but possibly uses a slightly different voltage divider circuit. 12.41V seems rather high.
Same goes for your DRAM, unless you are running your DRAM at above normal voltage with XMP.
Please verify your Fans, temperatures and Voltages that they match up in the BIOS.
It may always be that your mainboard has slightly different resistors for the voltage divider.
For example you can probably tell that I'm still not sure what purpose these two inputs serve:
Auxillary: +6.0°C sensor = thermistor CPU (PECI): -29.0°C sensor = thermistor
As for the CPU die temps.
I heard that some people have allegedly signed the NDA to get the docs but they now can't write any code based on it, so it may become a case of the old IBM - Compaq reverse engineering game
Rest assured it will make it's way in eventually.
Additionally if you want to configure fan speeds for your system based on sensor values you can create a custom /etc/fancontrol file with the fancontrol service installed to pwm drive fan speeds according to temperature.
I will be making a nice guide for that in future and an updated GUI tool might be released some time.
# Configuration file generated by pwmconfig #Look interval in seconds that fancontrol executes, don't set this too low INTERVAL=10 #DEVPATH may be different for your system setup DEVPATH=hwmon1=devices/platform/nct6775.656 DEVNAME=hwmon1=nct6779 # Associates a pwm output with a temperature and fan speed reading. FCTEMPS= hwmon1/pwm2=hwmon1/temp2_input FCFANS= hwmon1/pwm2=hwmon1/fan2_input #Temperature range you want to align fan pwm with. MINTEMP= hwmon1/pwm2=30 MAXTEMP= hwmon1/pwm2=50 # Below values are highly fan specific: MINSTART= hwmon1/pwm2=80 MINSTOP= hwmon1/pwm2=70 MAXPWM= hwmon1/pwm2=250

Brisbane cops at the G20 in Australia. Photo

​You may have caught wind of the Brisbane, Australia G20 summit that just wrapped up over the weekend. If you read anything about it, you most likely gleaned that Canada's Prime Minister had a very stern ​warning for Vladimir Putin about the Ukraine conflict (which I'm sure they took so seriously), despite said conflict not making it to the summit's official agenda. Or that Australian cops made fun of Harper for Nickelback, Celine, and Bieber. While the summit officially focused on the global economy, the bad blood between Russia and the west "dominated" the summit according to Al Jazeera, whereas the Toronto Star said those tensions are what the summit will be "remembere​d for."
Besides the posturing over Ukraine, US President Barack Obama pushed an agenda of getting smart about climate change, as Australian protesters literally buried th​eir heads in the sand as a way to protest their current government's deaf and dumb approach to the environment. This came on the heels of America's new climate deal with China, which by all accounts seems like a really great step forward. Harper has alluded to a new Canadian climate plan that will be announced soon, but so far, Canada has been silent on our commitment to environmental progress.
But another interesting detail that emerged from the Brisbane summit, which hasn't been getting that much attention, is the amount of Aussie-bucks that our friends down under spent on security. The Brisbane summit's security costs totalled $100 million, according to the Brisbane Times. That's a lot of money, of course, but in comparison to the 2010 Toronto G8/G20 summits, it's chump change.
While Toronto had the unique challenge of hosting two separate summits in both Muskoka and Toronto for the G8 and G20 respectively, our security budget totaled a seemingly exorbitant $929 million (if you go by Parliament's o​wn​ numbers). The common argument for why Toronto needed this much money is twofold: 1.) cities like Washington, DC or London, England already have a pre-existing super-security infrastructure since they do so many flashy, important things. Toronto needed to build ours from the ground up. 2.) just as former CSIS directo​r Ward Elcock argued, other cities may not be very transparent about the money they've actually spent, whereas Canada has been totally transparent. Scout's honour.
But, what kind of existing security infrastructure did Brisbane have, which required such a low (comparatively low, of course) security budget to be spent in an Australian city of just over 2 million people? Clearly, they're not on the level of a London or a Washington, so why did Toronto go so crazy with spending in 2010?

​While they did not respond to VICE's request for comment in time for publication, it doesn't take a forensic accountant to determine that the Toronto Police Service (TPS) were a major beneficiary of the G8/G20 security spending. Reports say that the TPS may have netted up to $100 millio​n dollars from the G20 budget, which would equal the Brisbane summit's total security spending. Chief Bill Blair, at the time, explained that their cop squad "did not see this as a windfall opportunity," though their force was able to gear up with things like "Long Range Acoustic Devices (LRADs) that use noise to blare messages and ​​disperse crowds."
I spoke to Jenilee Guebert, the Director of Research for the University of Toronto's G20 and G8 research groups, about summit spending. They told me: "The most expensive summit in history was actually the 2000 Okinawa summit in Japan. And the Japanese chose that particular site because they wanted to funnel funds into Okinawa. It was one of the poorer districts in Japan, so it was a very conscious decision to pick that and spend that much money going into the lead-up to the summit."
The Okinawa G20 was, in fact, a pricey one. Their 2000 G8 cost $7​34 million, and they had a reported 20,000 polic​e officers designated to police the summit. While total security costs for that G8 are apparently unavailable, Guebert's point about funneling money into Okinawa raises an interesting question: If indeed this was a similar case of our government trying to funnel money, where did it go?
Guebert's research group assumes that the total G8/G20 spending for Canada's 2010 summits (which
is $1.1 ​billion all told) should be split 35 percent to 65 percent. That means roughly $385 million was spent on the G8 summit in Muskoka. This is more than three times the security budget spent in Kananaskis, Alberta for their G8 in 2002. Kananaskis is the mountainous region outside of Calgary that hosted the G8 one year after 9/11, and yet they didn't need such an extraordinary amount of cash to protect our planet's precious leaders.

​
​The Muskoka spending was particularly controversial, as Canada's auditor-general at the time declared "rules wer​e broken" over both the G8 and G20 summit spending; but they called special attention to the "32 municipal projects" that were greenlit in Muskoka from the coffers of a $50 million "G8 Legacy Fund," meant to repay the cottage-country community that hosted the disruptive summit. These 32 projects were in Tony Clement's riding (he is the current President of the Treasury Board), and apparently "the​n-infrastructure minister John Baird approved the funding based on the advice of Clement."
When I reached out to Tony Clement's office for comment, hoping to discuss how Brisbane, Australia was able to spend six times less (given a rough estimate that Toronto's G20 security spending was about $603,850,000) than Canada for their G20, I was told: "The RCMP can assist you with your questions pertaining to security at the G20."
The RCMP did not immediately respond to my request for comment. Their line item in the G8/G20 security spending budget represents roughly 55 percent of the total pie, and of course would not be at liberty to discuss the big picture spending questions I have.
While Clement was, at one point, criminally investigated by the RCMP after a Liberal complaint was filed, pertaining to their G8 spending, the investigation was eventually dropped. By all accounts, however, the process through which the G20/G8 funding was greenlit was a rushed one, which allegedly did not follow the due process required for a decision to be reached where all of the proper information is on the table. At the time, the NDP said Clement circumvented "all normal checks and balances" when it came to making a responsible spending decision on the 32 municipal projects for their riding.
In 2011, a political source told the Toronto Star that the $50 million G8 legacy fund "has nothing to do with a legacy for the G8. It seems like a legacy to the minister. [They] did everything but build a statue to Tony Clement in the riding."
Clement has since admitted that they overloo​ked certain procedural checks and balances.
To make their "legacy fund" even more peculiar, the City of Toronto, which was ransacked and riotted through by cops and protesters alike, did not receive a comparable "le​gacy" fund to repair the city. David Miller, Toronto's then-mayor, called out Ottawa for their excessive spending on the summits, saying it could have been better used to boost T​oronto transit.
This all may seem like old news now, but the G8 and G20 summit budgets were designed and pushed through by our current government. And, with cities that have a similar population size to Toronto, like Brisbane, holding G20 summits with spending that comes to a fraction of our Toronto G20 cost, it seems even more brazen that such an enormous amount of money was pumped into Canada's summits.
Add that to the ongoing legal trauma caused by numerous accounts of police brutality during the summit (a Toronto cop will be facing a h​earing tomorrow after ordering the detentions of more than 260 people for, allegedly, no good reason), and it's not hard to see that Canada might have gone too far. This is not to mention two significant class action lawsuits against the TPS are only in the preliminary legal stages. These cases were brought by hundreds of citizens, who are suing TPS, a police force that is defending itself using public money. And, there is also the currently unresolved issue of G20 detainees being videotape​d during strip searches.
With all of this in mind, I reached out to the Prime Minister's office, and asked specifically how they reconcile the major spending discrepancy between the Toronto G20 and Australia's most-recent summit. I was told, by their Director of Communications Jason MacDonald: "The amount spent on security at the G20 four years ago was what was believed necessary to ensure the protection of the many world leaders in attendance at that particular meeting at that point in time."
Toronto did, indeed, get a serious amount of protection for the visiting leaders. And the city certainly did feel as if $600+ million was spent on locking the city down, given the makeshift detention centre, the intense swarm of cops (Toronto had four times the cops that London did for their 2009 G20), and the gigantic security fencing around Union Station. But to the untrained eye, how can you really tell how many millions were spent, without a deep audit?
Parliament's own assessment admits that "it is not possible to compare Toronto with previous G20 meetings" due to a lack of data, and identifies a key threat that explains some of the spending: "protesters would be considered a known threat and a portion of security operations would be geared to countering this specific threat."
With so many questions pertaining to the rushed nature of budget approvals, and with only a vague understanding where the money went, even now, four years later, it's no wonder the G20 and G8 summits in Toronto were once called "​the billion dollar mystery." Considering the questionab​le efficacy of such summits to address the key issues of the world to begin with (Ebola and the environment were ignored in Brisbane, whereas economic promises were made that likely won't be met), it raises a new, larger question: Why do we have these summits in the first place?

The House on Thursday passed a bill introduced by Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) that would expand the authority of the federal government to deport or detain non-citizen immigrants who are gang members or suspected of gang activity.
The legislation, offered as a response to an increase in killings perpetuated by the resurgent MS-13 gang in the Washington region and nationally, would allow officials to take action against suspected gang members, regardless of whether they've been convicted of a crime.
The bill was slammed by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued it would promote racial profiling, erode due process and unintentionally affect others, such as clergy who try to help gang members.
The Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act was approved 233 to 175. It drew opposition from the four Democrats who serve alongside Comstock in the Virginia delegation. Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), whose district borders Comstock's, spoke against it on the House floor. Six of the seven Republicans in the delegation voted in support; Rep. Thomas Garrett did not cast a ballot.
Although the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate in its current form, the White House said in a statement that President Trump's advisers would recommend they sign it as is.
The bill is in keeping with a strategy used by Comstock, who is seeking reelection in 2018 to a third term, to focus on local issues important to their suburban Northern Virginia district, such as crime and transportation.
The approach helped them keep their seat last year while sharing a ballot with President Trump, who lost their district by 10 points.
Democrats and Republicans say Comstock's district could be among the most competitive in the 2018 midterm elections, which are expected to be a referendum on Trump.
The president's unpopularity in the district, which stretches from the Washington suburbs to rural counties along the West Virginia border and is anchored by Loudoun County, motivated eight Democrats to seek the party nomination to challenge the member of congress.
Comstock has said they want to continue work done by their predecessor, longtime member of congress Frank Wolf, to combat gang violence.
In a speech on the House floor Thursday, they said the bill will ensure that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can act immediately when they identify a known MS-13 gang member.
"We don't have to wait until these brutal killers wield their machete or leave a body on a children's playground," they said, referring to the November 2015 murder of a man whose body was found in Alexandria's Beverly Park. They died of stab wounds to the head and neck.
Since November 2016, Comstock said, authorities have tied at least eight murders in Northern Virginia to MS-13, and the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force believes as many as 4,000 gang members live in the Washington region.
[With two young people killed, two more bodies found, police see rising gang threat]
Comstock's bill was sponsored by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), chairperson of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Raúl R. Labrador (R-Idaho), who spoke in favor of it.
Goodlatte said whether immigrants are here illegally or have visas or permanent resident status, "it is time to send the message that this behavior simply will not be tolerated."
King said MS-13 had turned their district into "killing fields," where 17 young people have been murdered by gang members in the past year and a half. The New York City Police Department and the Sergeants Benevolent Association endorsed the bill, they said.
"We cannot allow gang members to be taking advantage of loopholes in our immigration laws," King said.
Democrats speaking against the bill said they agreed there must be a way to curtail MS-13, but Comstock's bill would have unintended consequences and face legal challenges.
"We all agree MS-13 is a problem and I think she'd be better served by working in a bipartisan manner to find a responsible solution rather than doing something on their own that's probably dead on arrival in the Senate," Beyer said after the vote.
Immigrant advocates objected to the bill, saying it would give law enforcement wide latitude in designating groups of people as gangs and seeking to deport, detain or block their asylum before a crime has been committed.
"This feels just like yet another barely thinly veiled attempt to criminalize and demonize immigrants in order to justify what this administration has consistently promoted as their commitment to a massive deportation regime," said Avideh Moussavian, a senior policy attorney at the National Immigration Law Center.
They called it a "shameful" slapping of labels on immigrants "to justify infractions of due process and human rights."
Lawmakers debated the bill on Capitol Hill as President Trump and top Democrats in Congress gave competing accounts of a Wednesday night dinner over which they discussed a deal to potentially protect "dreamers," undocumented immigrants brought to this country as children.
Rep. Luis V. Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) said congressional Democrats should not accept amnesty for the dreamers in exchange for new restrictions on immigrants as described in Comstock's bill.
"I am committed to not exchanging the safety of dreamers for more deportations or further restricting legal immigration so that there are no available legal avenues for immigrants who help feed us, build our communities and serve our country," they said in a statement.

The email exchange at the heart of a high-profile Portland terrorism case makes Reaz Qadir Khan and Ali Jaleel sound like old friends. Jaleel is said to mention past promises the two had made together. Khan is quoted growing wistful for "everything that we used to talk about."
But the dialogue described by prosecutors leaves a key question unanswered. What forged the alleged bond, which prosecutors portray as close and longstanding, between a middle-aged engineer in the Pacific Northwest and a young man from an island in the Indian Ocean?
On one side was Khan, a Pakistan native who earned a master's degree in New Jersey and spent most of their adult life in the United States. On the other was Jaleel, a mujahedeen roughly 15 years Khan's junior from the archipelago nation of the Maldives.
At the time of the first email in the indictment, Dec. 14, 2005 , Khan was 41 and had just started a job at a city wastewater treatment plant in Portland after working for several California companies as an engineer. Jaleel was in their 20s and on the verge of one in a series of arrests nearly 9,000 miles to the west.
Federal prosecutors allege the pair's correspondence would culminate with Khan sending Jaleel $2,450 to prepare for a 2009-armed assault in Pakistan that left roughly 30 people dead, including Jaleel and their fellow attackers. Khan, now 48 , pleaded not guilty last week and is free pending trial.
If the government knows the source of the relationship described in the two men's correspondence, it is not saying.
Island nation
First, the where.
The Maldives ("Mall-deevs" ), a group of more than 1,000 small islands, most just few steps above sea level, is South Asia's Cinderella story.
The island chain was the region's poorest country as recently as the 1980s. Then a trickle of European tourists discovered its shifting, opalescent waters and pearl-colored sands southwest of India.
"Now, it is the richest country in South Asia," said Jeffrey Lunstead, professor of international studies and diplomat-in-residence at Middlebury College in Vermont.
As the U.S. ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives between 2003 and 2006, Lunstead traveled frequently to the islands. Home to about 400,000 people of South Indian, Sinhalese and Arab descent, the Maldives maintained a reputation as a conservative Sunni Muslim country even as it became known for discreet honeymoon holidays.
The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami flooded more than two-thirds of the nation's capital city, Malé, drawing attention to the impacts of rising sea levels and global warming. Experts in radical Islam point also to the tsunami as the moment a tide of religious neo-fundamentalism washed ashore.
Displays of domestic Islamic radicalism, though rare, began to increase.
In 2005, Islamists attacked a shop in Malé displaying Santa Claus.
Two years later, a dozen Chinese, Japanese and British tourists were wounded in a bombing at Sultan Park, described in Lonely Planet guidebooks as "the nicest public space in Malé."
Officers and soldiers responded to the bombing by laying siege to a mosque on the island of Himandhoo, where radicalism had frightened local resorts from sending tourists. Sharia law was in place, and fundamentalists armed with swords and iron rods had recently kidnapped a local police officer.
A spokesperson for the Maldives government, Mohammed Shareef, told a British newspaper at the time that officials blamed the rising fundamentalism in part on groups of Maldivians travelling to Pakistan and falling under the spell of radical imams.
One man who would become a target of the government's growing concern was Ali Jaleel.
Malé, the atoll that forms the Maldives capital, pictured in 2009. The Maldives, population 394,000, is a huge chain of islands in the Indian Ocean where Ali Jaleel, the suicide attacker whom Portland resident Reaz Qadir Khan is accused of supporting. In the past decade, Maldives officials have voiced concern over occasional but growing displays of Islamic radicalism.
Jaleel
Jaleel was the youngest of eight children, according to an article in the Maldives newspaper Miadhu News six months after their death.
Their older brother Ibrahim, described as a noted volleyball coach, told the newspaper that Jaleel attended Majeediyya School in the capital of Malé. They described Jaleel as fluent in English and Arabic.
Like many of their classmates interested in education beyond high school, Jaleel studied abroad. Their brother said they went on for "higher studies" in Pakistan.
Jaleel took their religion seriously and talked often about political issues affecting the Middle East, their brother said, but they aren't a radical.
"My brother talked about these issues just as most Maldivians talked about it," Ibrahim Jaleel told Miadhu News. "But they never expressed a fundamentalist opinion of these matters when they were in Malé."
Between 2006 and 2008, Maldivian authorities and Sri Lankan intelligence agents tracked Jaleel's movements from the Maldives to Sri Lanka, on to Qatar and into the tribal areas of Pakistan, where would-be jihadists train.
In 2006, according to local news reports, authorities pegged Jaleel as the senior member of a group arrested at a Sri Lanka airport while awaiting a flight to Qatar. They were imprisoned briefly on terrorism-training charges, according to The Hindu newspaper.
But they were freed within months, performing a marriage on foreign soil for a man described as an already-married 20-year-old "disciple" of Jaleel's, according to the Haveeru Daily News in the Maldives. The Maldivian Attorney General's office found the ceremony lacked proper documentation and violated Maldivian law concerning marriages performed abroad.
Tried in criminal court in Malé, Jaleel was found guilty of teaching Islam without permission. They were also convicted of spreading ideas about the pilgrimage to Mecca and the concept of jihad that were not approved by the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs in the Maldives. Jaleel was sentenced to two years of house arrest.
Rescue workers help an injured police officer at the site of a massive car bombing in Lahore, Pakistan on May 27, 2009. An Al-Qaeda propaganda video credits Ali Jaleel, whom Portland resident Reaz Qadir Khan is accused of supporting with money and advice, as one of the participants in the suicide attack that killed about 30 people.
Just as their sentence was about to end, they were accused of violating it. Authorities in 2008 sentenced them to four months of "banishment," according to the BBC.
Several times during those years, U.S. prosecutors say, Jaleel communicated with Khan, who was living in Portland. In October 2008, according to Khan's federal indictment, they began discussing Jaleel's plans to leave the Maldives for a terrorist training camp in Pakistan.
Jaleel told one of their wives that Khan was like a brother to them , according to the federal indictment. Their email exchange indicates Jaleel was about to press that relationship.
The Lahore attack
The excerpts presented by prosecutors portray Jaleel making some specific requests of Khan as they prepared for their journey to Pakistan, with Khan offering logistical help.
The indictment says Jaleel wanted money to pay for admission to the training camp, help in concealing their intentions from their family and assistance caring for their wives afterward.
Khan agreed to send them cash, prosecutors say, and arranged for Jaleel to pick up the money from a third party in Pakistan. They advised Jaleel to buy separate inbound and outbound tickets for their journey into the country, so that the unused return ticket could be redeemed for cash.
Their last communication shown in the indictment came Nov. 5, 2008, when Khan offered to expedite the wives' travel to Pakistan.
More
Six months later, on May 27, 2009 , gunmen drove a van up to the Inter Services Intelligence offices in Lahore. They unleashed a hail of gunfire before detonating a bomb inside the van that caused a massive blast. Some 30 people were killed, Jaleel and two accomplices among them. Another 300 were injured.
Khan wired $750 to Jaleel's two wives the following week, according to the indictment, using Western Union at a Tigard Fred Meyer. The dead fighter from the Maldives left two daughters and a son under age nine.
A martyr video surfaced some months later on the Web under the banner of As-Sahab, Al-Qaeda's media arm. In November 2009, Jaleel's family confirmed the bearded man flanked by long guns and taking credit for the attack was him. They were 30 when they died, according to local news accounts.
Evan Kohlmann, a terrorism expert and on-air analyst for NBC News, said Jaleel's video appearance speaks to their significance to leaders of the movement. As-Sahab has ties to the highest levels of Al-Qaeda leadership, they said.
It "certainly indicates that they made it on somebody's radar screen," Kohlmann told The Oregonian. "If you get featured in a video produced by As-Sahab, that's pretty much primetime. You become a celebrity in the underground world of violent jihad."
A few weeks after Jaleel's video was authenticated, another video appeared featuring a little-known Al-Qaeda cell operating in the Maldives. The video showed three men sitting on a beach with a fourth posed near a coconut tree.
A message flashed, "Your brothers in the Maldives are calling you."

A United Nations summit in Korea this week adopted a global “action plan” demanding a planetary “education” regime to transform children around the world into social-justice warriors and sustainability-minded “global citizens.” Among other elements, that means the UN-directed global education must promote “integrated development” of the “whole person,” including the formation of their ethics, values, and spirituality, the final document declared. The global-citizenship programs, with definitions to be incorporated in curricula worldwide, should also indoctrinate children so that they understand their responsibilities to “protect the planet,” and promote what the UN and its member governments consider to be the “common good.”
The controversial action plan, approved by the UN's propaganda department and a group of largely government-funded “non-governmental organizations” (NGOs) on June 1 in Gyeongju, Republic of Korea, is aimed at helping the UN impose its Agenda 2030 scheme to “transform the world.” In fact, the title of the summit gave away the agenda: “Education for Global Citizenship: Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals Together.” As The New American has documented extensively, the UN Agenda 2030 plan, also known as the “Sustainable Development Goals” (SDGs), was approved by governments and dictators last year as a road map toward global control (tyranny). From national and international wealth redistribution to government healthcare and legal abortion for all, the controversial Agenda 2030 vows repeatedly to leave “no-one behind.”
However, globalists and the UN know that to achieve their vision of global totalitarianism, the minds of the young must be captured via “education.” Agenda 2030 actually has an entire goal dedicated to UN-guided “education.” And so the latest summit in Korea, organized for NGOs by the UN Department of Public Information, or UN DPI, was aimed at defining what that “education” regime will look like — and how NGOs can help. “Education is a human right, essential to well-being and dignity, and is key to achieving Agenda 2030,” reads the action plan adopted this week. “Further, an ethos of global citizenship is required in order to fulfil [sic] this bold, people-centered, universal, and planet-sensitive development framework.”
In the “spirit of global citizenship,” the document declares that “our primary identity is that of human beings.” But the agenda is much broader than attacking nationalism and patriotism. The UN DPI and the Astro-Turf “NGOs” that surround it, styling themselves "Civil Society," explained that what they call “education” must also be about more than what people normally think of as education — literacy, numeracy, and so on. In the UN's view, according to the “Gyeongju Action Plan” adopted in Korea, “education must advance the cause of global citizenship.” That means a lot more than one might think, too.
Among other points, this education for global citizenship must promote “integrated development of the whole person emotionally, ethically, intellectually, physically, socially, and spiritually,” the action plan declares. (Emphasis added.) Of course, parents, families, communities, tribes, churches, and more have traditionally been responsible for much of that. When or under what authority government-run, UN-approved schools became responsible for children's physical, ethical, spiritual, emotional, and social development was not made clear. The implications, though, should trouble anyone who values liberty, diversity, national sovereignty, and parental rights.
The “education” pushed by the UN must also be “imbued with an understanding of our roles, rights and responsibilities for the common good in service to humanity and the advancement of a culture of peace, non-violence, freedom, justice, and equality,” the action plan continued, using rhetoric about the "common good" that has been the rallying cry of countless tyrants. The globo-education must inculcate “a sense of care for the earth, reverence for the interdependent kinship of all life, and flight attendantship of all ecological systems for future generations.” It should also strengthen “the societal relationships among individuals, institutions, communities, states, humanity, and the planet.” And finally, it should nurture “a sense of solidarity and empathy in order to end poverty, protect the planet, ensure human rights, and foster prosperous and fulfilling lives for all.”
To those not well-versed in globalist-speak, that all might sound fine and dandy. However, when the UN's agenda is examined more closely, the real agenda becomes more clear. Consider, as just one point among many, what the UN means when it speaks of “human rights.” In Article 29 of the UN's “Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” the government signatories claim "rights" can be limited “by law” under the guise of everything from “public order” to “the general welfare.” In other words, you have no rights, only privileges. Separately, the same article claims that everyone has “duties to the community” and that “rights and freedoms” may “in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.” Compare that to the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, which outline and protect God-given, inalienable rights.
Further down, the global action plan explains that the “education” agenda intends to shape every aspect of human life and civilization. “Education for global citizenship is an essential strategy to address global challenges as well as to promote gender equality, facilitate the eradication of poverty and hunger, build skills, eliminate corruption, and prevent violence, including violent extremism,” the document says. “It promotes truly sustainable production and consumption, mitigating climate change and its effects, protecting our waters and biodiversity, and preserving indigenous knowledge.”
If “tradition” and individual cultures get in the way of that agenda for UN-defined “human rights” and “global citizenship,” then “educational understandings” of those things will have to be “enhanced,” the action plan declares. The document also makes clear that this must be a worldwide effort, saying the global-citizenship scheming must be incorporated in school curricula worldwide and that “equitable quality education,” as defined by the UN, must be provided to “all people.” (Emphasis in original). The signatories vowed to work at the local level, too, to “incorporate education for global citizenship in educational systems.”
The signatories of the action plan, developed at the “66th United Nations Department of Public Information (DPI)/Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) Conference,” also committed to pushing global education that promotes a number of controversial concepts. “We commit to an education that teaches conflict resolution, a deep appreciation for diversity, ethical reasoning, gender equality, human rights and responsibilities, interdependence, multilingual and multicultural competence, social justice, sustainable development, and values,” it said. Those values, of course, are very unlikely to reflect the values of most parents around the world, whether they be Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, or any other major religious tradition. Instead, the values will be the values guiding the UN: globalism, pseudo-environmentalism, socialism, and more.
The UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO, is at the center of the UN's global “education” machinations. In addition to a partnership signed with Common Core-financier Bill Gates, UNESCO has been hard at work in its efforts to standardize and dumb-down education around the world. Among other schemes, it runs global programs on “Education for Sustainable Development,” “Educational for Global Citizenship,” and much more. It also has a “World Core Curriculum,” dedicated to and inspired by influential occultist Alice Bailey, that it hopes will guide schooling around the world in the years to come.
At a previous UN education summit, held last year in Korea, UNESCO boss Irina Bokova, a Bulgarian Communist Party operative who is a PR agents claim is among the “frontrunners” to lead the broader UN, also declared the UN's intentions. “We have the collective duty to empower every child and youth with the right foundations — knowledge, values and skills — to shape the future as responsible global citizens, building on the successes of the past 15 years,” they said, adding that education would “transform lives” and contribute to “breakthroughs on all the proposed sustainable development goals.” In other words, the UN — not parents, families, or communities — believes that it has not just the right, but the “collective duty,” to shape your children's values.
The latest conference on pushing Agenda 2030 through globalist indoctrination of children masquerading as “education” is a crucial follow-up to the adoption of the agenda itself. “Children and young women and men are critical agents of change and will find in the new Goals a platform to channel their infinite capacities for activism into the creation of a better world,” the official Agenda 2030 agreement explains.
The sort of activists that the UN hopes to make your children into is also explicitly defined in the agreement. “By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture's contribution to sustainable development,” the global plan for 2030 states. Considering what the UN means by “sustainable development” — population control, central planning, global governance, and more — the agenda for your children takes on an even more sinister tone.
“Sustainable” children for global citizenship in the new order will be accomplished via what the UN, the Obama administration, and others misleadingly refers to as “education.” In the UN document the word “education” alone is mentioned more than 20 times. And throughout the agreement, the UN openly advocates the use of schools to indoctrinate all of humanity into a new set of values, attitudes, and beliefs in preparation for the new “green” and “sustainable” world order. The UN's education agenda also puts sex “education” front and center. “By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services [abortion and contraception], including for family planning, information and education,” the document also explains.
For now, Americans, Europeans, and people around the world still have many options to protect their children from the global brainwashing campaign being pushed by the UN — home education, private schools, Christian schools, and more. However, the UN realizes that, too. And so, in recent years, under the phony guise of “human rights,” the UN has started agitating for government control and regulation of private and alternative forms of education in addition to its grip on "public" schools. The UN also continues to push international education agreements and schemes on everything from sex education and reading pedagogy to values and beliefs.
There is a good reason the UN is ridiculed by critics as the “dictators club.” Most of its member governments cannot be considered “free,” even under the most generous definition of the term. Allowing the UN to make and shape education policy is not just dangerous, then, it is crazy. Instead, education should be a job for families, communities, churches, charities, schools, and more — but primarily parents. The future of liberty literally depends on it.

Carl Jung's ideas are a topic for discussion in the world of Paganism. When the historical basis for hard polytheism was challenged in the 1960's, believers latched onto Jung's ideas of archetypes to legitimize their faith. The lasting implication is a rift in Neopagan philosophy.
Yoda: Archetype? Thought-form? Expression of the unknowable? Psychic entity?
Do deity actually exist or are they merely a part of our personal or collective unconscious? If I were to conduct a poll of 100 Neopagans, I imagine that approximately half would advocate hard polytheism, which is to say Deity actually exist outside the human mind. The other half would argue that deity are symbolic, archetypal, or are only real within the mind.

The developer of iRealSMS contacted us recently regarding a new upcoming feature to its popular Messages app alternative. iRealSMS 3.0.6 brings a new iOS 7 inspired QuickReply theme to the fold, and it looks pretty interesting. Once QuickReply makes its way to iOS via an iOS 7 jailbreak, we imagine that this is similar to how it'd look. What say you? Check out our brief video preview after the jump.
Of course, this is just a preview, and you can expect a full in-depth review once the tweak update officially touches down on Cydia. So far, the developer has yet to provide a solid ETA for release, but I would imagine that you can expect it much sooner than later.
What do you think? Do you use iRealSMS, or do you stick with its more popular alternative, biteSMS? What made you decide to use one app over the other? Please sound off with your thoughts and comments down below.
A train has derailed in Calgary's Inglewood community, but this one is not believed to pose an immediate threat — unlike a 2013 incident that led to mass evacuations in the same area.
The derailment happened about 6:20 a.m. Thursday on the CP Rail line near the intersection of 15th Street and 19th Avenue S.E.
CP Rail spokesperson Martin Cej said about 14 cars left the tracks at a "very slow speed" of roughly six kilometres per hour.
Three empty cars were lying on their sides off the rails, according to Calgary Fire Department spokesperson Carol Henke.
One other car that derailed but was still standing upright had been carrying a sulphur-containing material, Henke said, but fire crews didn't believe it posed a threat.
Cej said that car and two others were used to carry hazardous materials but were mainly empty at the time of the derailment, with only a small amount of residue inside them.
The one full car involved in the derailment was carrying vegetables.

A hazardous-material team was on scene, but Henke said some of the firefighting apparatus that initially responded to the derailment began to leave once it was determined they weren't needed.
They said the biggest challenge facing emergency responders was a downed power line that forced crews to wait until it was de-energized.
An EMS spokesperson said there were no reported injuries.
The Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) said it is deploying a team of investigators to the derailment site.
Cej said the company is sorry for the impact the incident had on area residents and people driving through the area Thursday morning.
"Obviously, it made the commute very hectic for commuters and, for that, CP apologizes," they said.
Cleanup of the site was expected to take until Thursday evening.
Site of previous 'CP Fail'
Thursday's derailment happened in the same area as a 2013 derailment that saw eight cars carrying flammable liquids leave the tracks and prompt the evacuation of more than 140 nearby homes.
That incident led dozens of Inglewood residents to protest dangerous goods being carried through their community, many of them chanting "CP Fail" during a rally outside the company's Alyth Yard.
The Calgary Fire Department later sent CP Rail an invoice for more than $500,000 because the derailment forced firefighters to remain on scene around the clock for days.
In addition to the TSB investigation, CP Rail plans to conduct a "full investigation" of its own into Thursday's incident and Cej said the results of the probe would be shared publicly.
"All of that will be disclosed as soon as we have those facts," they said.
'More common than you'd think'
Ward 9 Coun. Gian-Carlo Carra said these types of derailments around Alyth Yard are "actually surprisingly more common than you'd think" because of the high volume of traffic that passes through the area.
"Honestly, every two months or so I get a call from CP rail telling us that something's gone off the track," they said.
"To me, it's become part of the routine of being a city councillor, the same way a watermain break is during the winter."
Carra said rail transportation is "way safer than moving things by truck," and said the city's emphasis should be on continuing to improve existing safety protocols in collaboration with CP Rail.
"What we've recognized is that the CP Rail and the Alyth Yard, they're not going anywhere. They helped build Calgary. What we want to do is make sure we have the best relationship possible."
It is hard to judge just which is the greatest blunder/offense of the climatistas. You might go with “carbon pollution,” which is exceedingly stupid as most everyone with a high school education knows that humans exhale carbon dioxide (about 800 pounds per year per capita) and further that carbon dioxide is plant food. It is one thing to point out that carbon dioxide is an atmospheric warming agent (though is that by itself a bad thing?), and quite another to equate what we all exhale with noxious air pollutants like carbon monoxide or ozone. But such is the desperation of the climatistas that they can't help themselves.
The more risible tactic is the use of “denier” for anyone who doesn't hew to the narrow climatista orthodoxy. “Lukewarmers,” such as the University of Colorado's excellent Roger Pielke Jr, is not permitted, let alone accomplished climate scientists like Judith Curry who have changed their mind. It is simply not allowed. All such heretics must be branded as the moral equivalent of Holocaust deniers.
This is the surest sign that the climatistas are losing, and know they are losing, despite all their happy talk about how the Paris Climate Accord and the soaring amount of wind and solar power are going to save the planet any day now if only we can lock up the “deniers.” It's a pretty sloppy charge to begin with. “Climate denier”? I don't think I know of a single person, even in works of comic fiction, who denies there is a climate. That would be akin to being a “gravity denier,” though, to be sure, there are some bumper strips that say, “There is no such thing as gravity: the earth sucks.” (I assume this is a joke, but in the world of postmodernism, perhaps it is not.)
The increasing desperation of the climatistas is causing them to expand the definition of “denier.” Ted Nordhaus, a certified left-of-center activist and co-founder of The Breakthrough Institute, notes the progressive regression among the climatistas in a nice piece this week:
[I]n the expanding use of the term “denier,” the view of the climate debate as a battle between pure good and pure evil, and the social dimensions of the narrative that has been constructed, some quarters of the climate movement have begun to seem similarly unhinged. . . The continuing escalation of rhetoric by climate advocates, meanwhile, is unlikely to do much to solve climate change. After eight years of excoriating hard-fought efforts to make headway on the issue by President Obama and candidate Clinton (McKibben in recent years labeled both deniers), we can thank provocateurs like McKibben and Oreskes for helping to put an actual climate denier in the White House.
Separately, I note that Bill McKibben has recently added Canada's premier Justin Timberlake Trudeau to their enemies list of climate criminals, writing in The Guardian:
Stop swooning over Justin Trudeau: The man is a disaster for the planet . . . But [Trudeau's] words are meaningless if you keep digging up more carbon and selling it to people to burn, and that's exactly what Trudeau is doing. He's hard at work pushing for new pipelines through Canada and the US to carry yet more oil out of Alberta's tar sands, which is one of the greatest climate disasters on the planet. Last month, speaking at a Houston petroleum industry gathering, they got a standing ovation from the oilmen for saying: “No country would find 173bn barrels of oil in the ground and just leave them there.” Yes, 173bn barrels is indeed the estimate for recoverable oil in the tar sands. So let's do some math. If Canada digs up that oil and sells it to people to burn, it will produce, according to the math whizzes at Oil Change International, 30% of the carbon necessary to take us past the 1.5C target that Canada helped set in Paris. That is to say, Canada, which represents one half of 1% of the planet's population, is claiming the right to sell the oil that will use up a third of the earth's remaining carbon budget. Trump is a creep and a danger and unpleasant to look at, but at least he's not a stunning hypocrite.
Please, please McKibben, keep this up. You and Al Gore are the best thing we've got going for us.

Fifty people were killed and 53 others were injured early Sunday morning when a gunman opened fire inside the Pulse nightclub in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.
Federal law enforcement officials say the gunman was Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old American citizen living in Port St. Lucie, Fla. They were killed at the scene in a shootout with police.
They were reportedly armed with an AR-15-style assault rifle and a handgun.
News networks reported Mateen phoned 911 moments before the shooting to pledge allegiance to ISIS.
It remains unclear if the planning and execution of the attack were directly linked to foreign terrorist groups.
President Obama Sunday called the shooting an "act of terror" but didn't place blame on the terror group.
They're storming the beaches!
A wave of Marines hit the most hurricane-battered sections of Queens and Staten Island yesterday to bring much-needed assistance and supplies to increasingly desperate residents.
Armed with high-powered water pumps and sophisticated surveying equipment, the Leathernecks, aided by Navy sailors, began their attack on floodwaters from Rockaway Beach in Queens to Midland Beach on Staten Island.
“It's what Marines do. They just go running,” said Marine Sgt. Justin Armstrong, who returned from Afghanistan about two months ago.
“It's pretty nasty,” they said of the Rockaway wreckage. “It's a lot of sewage. Pretty much anything you'd flush down the toilet, that lays on the ground, that's trash. It's pretty vile stuff.”
Their work was appreciated.
“I was just speechless when I saw them,” said Priscilla Smalls, 53, who lives in the Ocean Bay Houses in the Rockaways' Arverne section.
“I've never seen Marines anywhere before, let alone over here in the projects. It's a great, cool thing. We need the big guns after what happened here. I've seen the National Guard, but the Marines are a whole different thing.”
Marine engineers did a block-by-block assessment of Staten Island's Father Capodanno Boulevard to determine the manpower and equipment required for today, when 50 to 100 more corps members are expected to come ashore.
Meanwhile, Marines and Navy sailors were hard at work with hammers and hacksaws, doing any construction and cleanup they could.
“It was wonderful to see them,” said Jessie Gonzalez, 34, whose home on nearby Patterson Avenue was flooded after the storm.
“They gave us supplies, water and food. It makes us feel like we're actually getting help now. At least we feel safer with their presence.”
Residents felt similar relief in the Rockaways, where engineer and utilities Marines from the 8th Engineer Support Battalion drove up from Camp Lejeune, NC.
They started working at 5 a.m. at the Ocean Bay Houses with 150-gallon-per-minute pumps in what was likely to be a weeks-long effort to remove the chest-high water from the basements of the complex's 34 buildings.
Critics have complained that the National Guard's talents are being wasted. Instead of providing security against looters and directing traffic, they say, it's been ordered to do little more than give out food and blankets.
Sources said the Guard's role has been a source of contention between Mayor Bloomberg, who believes police have the situation under control, and Gov. Cuomo, who wants to blanket the area with the citizen soldiers.
“This thing goes back to the beginning of the storm,” said a source working with city and state officials.
“The mayor downplayed it, and so they need to keep maintaining the optics that it's not as bad by downplaying it. Bringing in the National Guard says that it's a major disaster because it is. It's bad. It's really bad. And Cuomo knows it.”
Councilman James Sanders (D-Queens) griped, “You've got several people who have had their houses totally robbed. The police were hopelessly overwhelmed in the first few days.”
In other developments:
* City officials warned that temperatures could dip below freezing tonight and urged storm victims to seek refuge with friends or family or at government centers.
* The NYPD sent scores of cops to storm-ravaged areas to stand sentry in clusters of three or four to ward off looters. It also erected light towers to provide electricity to residents needing to charge phones or other devices.
* Most schools are set to reopen today. Students were urged to dress warmly because some facilities are still without heat.
* Trash is being picked up, but regular schedules on Staten Island and in the Rockaways are impossible given the enormity of the debris, officials said. Trash from Breezy Point, Queens, was dumped in the Jacob Riis Park parking lot, sources said.
* Yankee Stadium has been converted to a storing house for donations and supplies for the National Guard to distribute.
* Retired NYPD cop Michael Dyer became just one more example of New Yorkers' altruistic spirit, driving a truck packed with 300 blankets from their home in Omaha, Neb., Saturday night to the city's needy yesterday.
* Four police stations in Coney Island, Rockaway and on the Lower East Side were severely damaged by the storm. One of them, Brooklyn's 60th Precinct station, was evacuated. It's operating out of a temporary headquarters vehicle out front.
* City sanitation worker Michael Lewery was zapped by electricity yesterday while removing debris on Staten Island. The 13-year veteran was taken to Staten Island University North Hospital, where they were in stable condition, the department said.
* The death toll in the city remained at 40, officials said.

We love comments, really we do! But sometimes it seems that every post ends up with a discussion of the population crisis, like a rerun of a Star Trek episode. If we cover a tree-covered tower:
Cities aren't the problem, too many people forcing too high a living density are the problem. Until we stop ignoring the overpopulation problem, everything else is just a bandaid measure.
Or if we are discussing our individual carbon footprints:
…the biggest problem is that we have simply too many people on earth. If we could reduce human population to three billion by 2100, then the environmental problem we face will be solved - even without any technological innovation, we will more than halve the CO2 emission with such reduction.
And always: “Why does TreeHugger never talk about population?” In fact we do, we have, going almost back to our beginning. We even have this post featuring Hans Rosling, who just died yesterday, talking about how population growth is dropping in parallel with dropping child mortality rates. And we keep coming around to the fact that our problems are not caused by overpopulation but overconsumption.
In much of the world, birth rates are falling and populations are actually dropping. In Japan, they are building robots to take care of the aging population because there are not enough people to do it. Many countries are offering incentives to people to encourage them to have more children. According to Charles Eisenstein, writing in the Guardian, “More than half the world's population now lives in countries where the fertility rate – the average number of babies born per woman – is below the replacement level (around 2.1).”

20 years ago, Carl Sagan suggested a solution to the problem in those countries where there is still runaway population growth, that still holds true:
There is a well-documented correlation between poverty and high birthrates. In little countries and big countries, capitalist countries and communist countries, Catholic countries and Moslem countries, Western countries and Eastern countries--in almost all these cases, exponential population growth slows down or stops when grinding poverty disappears. This is called demographic transition.... Our job is to bring about a worldwide demographic transition and flatten out that exponential curve--by eliminating grinding poverty, making safe and effective birth control methods widely available, and extending real political power (executive, legislative, judicial, military, and in institutions influencing public opinion) to women. If we fail, some other process, less under out control, will do it for us."
But as we eliminate grinding poverty, we increase consumption per capita, and that is causing problems now. As Mat noted in a post a few years ago about how resources are not evenly distributed:
On one hand, a billion or more people have problems of underconsumption. Unless their basic needs are met, they are unlikely to be able to make important contributions to attaining sustainability. On the other hand, there is also the issue of the "new consumers" in developing economies such as China and India, where the wealth of a sizeable minority is permitting them to acquire the consumption habits (e.g., eating a lot of meat and driving automobiles) of the rich nations. Consumption regulation is a lot more complex than population regulation, and it is much more difficult to find humane and equitable solutions to the problem.
Tim de Chant did a great infographic that I show below that shows how much planet we consume, living the lifestyles we do in the west. We have a consumption problem; this is what is unsustainable, not our population.

The Jets continue to reinvent rock bottom every week, and it certainly seems to be taking quite the toll on head coach Rex Ryan.
ESPN.com reports that Ryan actually broke down in tears following their team's 28-7 loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday, at least according to some of their players.
“In their postgame address to the team,” ESPN.com's Rich Cimini writes, “Ryan got so emotional that they actually cried, according to several players. They were everything in the locker room — mad, frustrated, urging. And harsh. According to players, they asked the pointed question, ‘When are you guys going to believe?'”
The Jets turned in another woeful performance on both sides of the ball — but especially on offensive — on the way to being shellacked by the Seahawks. New York fell to 3-6 with the loss, which has them tied with the Bills for last in the AFC East.
“A brutal loss,” Ryan understated when talking to reporters in their postgame news conference.
They aren't alone in feeling dejected following the latest Jets embarrassment.
“We're all emotional,” linebacker Bryan Thomas said, according to ESPN.com. “If this doesn't affect everybody, you don't have a [expletive] heart.”
Ryan is a pretty emotional guy, which they have shown in a variety of ways over the course of their tenure with the Jets. However, if they can't get their team to at least start being competitive, that tenure may come to a close very soon.
The Jets are back in action next week at St. Louis against the Rams.
Novel Compound Halts Tumor Spread, Improves Brain Cancer Treatment in Animal Studies

Treating invasive brain tumors with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation has improved clinical outcomes, but few patients survive longer than two years after diagnosis. The effectiveness of the treatment is limited by the tumor's aggressive invasion of healthy brain tissue, which restricts chemotherapy access to the cancer cells and complicates surgical removal of the tumor.
To address this challenge, researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University have designed a new treatment approach that appears to halt the spread of cancer cells into normal brain tissue in animal models. The researchers treated animals possessing an invasive tumor with a vesicle carrying a molecule called imipramine blue, followed by conventional doxorubicin chemotherapy. The tumors ceased their invasion of healthy tissue and the animals survived longer than animals treated with chemotherapy alone.
“Our results show that imipramine blue stops tumor invasion into healthy tissue and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy, which suggests that chemotherapy may be more effective when the target is stationary,” said Ravi Bellamkonda, a professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University. “These results reveal a new strategy for treating brain cancer that could improve clinical outcomes.”
The results of this work were published on March 28, 2012 in the journal Science Translational Medicine. The research was supported primarily by the Ian's Friends Foundation and partially by the Georgia Cancer Coalition, the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation and a National Science Foundation graduate research fellowship.
In addition to Bellamkonda, collaborators on the project include Jack Arbiser, a professor in the Emory University Department of Dermatology; Daniel Brat, a professor in the Emory University Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine; and the paper's lead author, Jennifer Munson, a former Fulbright Scholar who was a bioengineering graduate student in the Georgia Tech School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering when the research was conducted.
Arbiser designed the novel imipramine blue compound, which is an organic triphenylmethane dye. After in vitro experiments showed that imipramine blue effectively inhibited movement of some cancer cell lines, the researchers tested the compound in an animal model of aggressive cancer that exhibited attributes similar to a human brain tumor called glioblastoma.
“There were many reasons why we chose to use the RT2 astrocytoma rat model for these experiments,” said Brat. “The tumor exhibited properties of aggressive growth, invasiveness, angiogenesis and necrosis that are similar to human glioblastoma; the model utilized an intact immune system, which is seen in the human disease; and the model enabled increased visualization by MRI because it was a rat model, rather than a mouse.”
Because imipramine blue is hydrophobic and doxorubicin is cytotoxic, the researchers encapsulated each compound in an artificially-prepared vesicle called a liposome so that the drugs would reach the brain. The liposomal drug delivery vehicle also ensured that the drugs would not be released into tissue until they passed through leaky blood vessel walls, which are only present where a tumor is growing.
Animals received one of the following four treatments: liposomes filled with saline, liposomes filled with imipramine blue, liposomes filled with doxorubicin chemotherapy, or liposomes filled with imipramine blue followed by liposomes filled with doxorubicin chemotherapy.
All of the animals that received the sequential treatment of imipramine blue followed by doxorubicin chemotherapy survived for 200 days -- more than 6 months -- with no observable tumor mass. Of the animals treated with doxorubicin chemotherapy alone, 33 percent were alive after 200 days with a median survival time of 44 days. Animals that received capsules filled with saline or imipramine blue – but no chemotherapy -- did not survive more than 19 days.
“Our results show that the increased effectiveness of the chemotherapy treatment is not because of a synergistic toxicity between imipramine blue and doxorubicin. Imipramine blue is not making the doxorubicin more toxic, it's simply stopping the movement of the cancer cells and containing the cancer so that the chemotherapy can do a better job,” explained Bellamkonda, who is also the Carol Ann and David D. Flanagan Chair in Biomedical Engineering and a Georgia Cancer Coalition Distinguished Cancer Scholar.
MRI results showed a reduction and compaction of the tumor in animals treated with imipramine blue followed by doxorubicin chemotherapy, while animals treated with chemotherapy alone presented with abnormal tissue and glioma cells. MRI also indicated that the blood-brain barrier breach often seen during tumor growth was present in the animals treated with chemotherapy alone, but not the group treated with chemotherapy and imipramine blue.
According to the researchers, imipramine blue appears to improve the outcome of brain cancer treatment by altering the regulation of actin, a protein found in all eukaryotic cells. Actin mediates a variety of essential biological functions, including the production of reactive oxygen species. Most cancer cells exhibit overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which are thought to stimulate cancer cells to invade healthy tissue. The dye's reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is thought to inhibit production of enzymes that produce reactive oxygen species.
“I formulated the imipramine blue compound as a triphenylmethane dye because I knew that another triphenylmethane dye, gentian violet, exhibited anti-cancer properties, and I decided to use imipramine -- a drug used to treat depression -- as the starting material because I knew it could get into the brain,” said Arbiser.
For future studies, the researchers are planning to test imipramine blue's effect on animal models with invasive brain tumors, metastatic tumors, and other types of cancer such as prostate and breast.
“While we need to conduct future studies to determine if the effect of imipramine blue is the same for different types of cancer diagnosed at different stages, this initial study shows the possibility that imipramine blue may be useful as soon as any tumor is diagnosed, before anti-cancer treatment begins, to create a more treatable tumor and enhance clinical outcome,” noted Bellamkonda.

VANCOUVER, Wash. -- Washington state member of congress Jaime Herrera Beutler said they will oppose any tolling proposal by Oregon that impacts Washington drivers.
A massive $5.3 billion transportation package that Oregon lawmakers recently passed sets in motion a plan that could lead to tolls on some of Portland's busiest highways.
VERIFY: Will we see tolls on Portland highways?
"Oregon has no right to make Southwest Washington an unwilling piggy bank for Oregon's infrastructure projects," Herrera Beutler wrote in a letter to Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Matthew Garrett, the director of the Oregon Department of Transportation.
Herrera Beutler's main opposition, as outlined in the letter, is potential tolls on Interstate 5 or Interstate 205 at the Washington state line, of which they noted "the lion's share would be paid by Washington commuters."
“The fees from tolls should be used for the infrastructure that people use. To use it around the state, it's kind of a shocking proposal, quite frankly," they said.
"They need to go back to the drawing board on this proposal.”

Is the battle to contain global warming now lost?
With the election of Donald Trump, it certainly looked that way to many of the shellshocked diplomats gathered in Morocco earlier this month at the first climate summit following the breakthrough agreement in Paris last year to contain greenhouse gas emissions.
During the campaign, the president-elect of the world's second largest polluter claimed that climate change is a hoax, threatened to drop the Paris accord, committed to kill the Clean Power Plan at the center of President Obama's emissions reduction strategy, and promised a new dawn for the fossil fuel industry.
Don't give up just yet. True, international diplomacy will become more difficult as China and India weigh their own energy policy commitments in the light of the possibility that the United States will walk away from its promises. But President Trump's climate policy — or their lack of one — could work out in surprising ways.
Ted Nordhaus and Jessica Lovering, in a report published on Tuesday by the Breakthrough Institute, pointed out that real progress on reducing carbon in the atmosphere has been driven so far by specific domestic energy, industrial and innovation policies, “not emissions targets and timetables or international agreements intended to legally constrain national emissions.”

The 1915 contour bottle prototype designed by Earl R. Dean.
Earl R. Dean (March 19, 1890 – January 8, 1972)[1] designed the famous contour Coca-Cola bottle.[2]
In 1914, Harold Hirsch, a lawyer for the Coca-Cola Company, came up with a plan[3] to launch a national competition in which bottle manufactures across the country would be asked to design a distinctive bottle – a bottle which a person could recognize even if they felt it in the dark, and so shaped that, even if broken, a person could tell at a glance what it was.[4]
The bottle manufacturer that won this competition was the Root Glass Company of Terre Haute, Indiana. Inspired by a picture of a cocoa pod which was found in an encyclopedia at the Emeline Fairbanks Memorial Library, Earl R. Dean made a pencil sketch of the pod.[5] From this sketch, Dean designed the contour bottle prototype. The prototype never made it to production since its middle diameter was larger than its base. According to Dean, this would make it unstable on the conveyor belts. Dean then equalized the middle and bottom diameters and the Contour Coca-Cola Bottle was born.[6]

“Fossil fuels are so inherently dirty and toxic, that they require sacrificial people and sacrificial places, they always have.”
These are the words of environmental activist Naomi Klein, delivering the Edward Said lecture in London earlier this month. As if following their cue, yesterday an alliance of fossil fuel politicians and lobbyists overruled the villages and voices of Northern England. The land and its people have been sacrificed.
Underground rock will be drilled and pumped with high pressure chemicals, sand and water. Local communities will be turned upside down. There could be more minor earthquakes. The extracted shale gas will warm our planet to even more dangerous levels. Local water could become contaminated, poisoned, or even flammable.
Australians recently discovered this blazing river downstream from a fracking site in Queensland:
Extracting fossil fuels is inherently violent. Whether it's oceanic oil spills, the shredding of First Nations treaties in Canada, ecological genocide in the Niger Delta, mountaintop removals or raging fires – there is no peaceful way to run an economy on fossil fuels.
But what else can we do (cried David Cameron in January) what about the economy? What about our energy security?
Mark Ruffalo explains:
“Mr Cameron you're making an enormous mistake, and it's a legacy mistake because there's no fracking that can be done safely.
Today we're at the precipice of a renewable energy revolution. This is the new economy. We had 200 countries from around the world all agree that it's time to leave fossil fuels in the ground.
This is where all new wealth is going to be created, this is where new jobs are going to be created.
Not only that but your people don't want it. You've already told them once before that if they didn't want it you wouldn't push them to take it. And you're turning back on your word, sir. And what is a politician if he's not credible?
So I would say to you – this is a wonderful opportunity for you to honour your people, to honour their will, but also to take them into the renewable energy future of the world, and to be a real true and honest world leader, and leave the fossil fuels in the ground.
We are being told by every single scientist in the world that we must leave 70 per cent of this in the ground if we have a chance at all.”
Love is hard. Relationships are tricky. If you have problems in your marriage, try this: take a deep breath; count to ten; then, write an essay on the internet about why your husband is just not sexy.
Use a pen name, of course! "Julianna Colt's" husband will be so happy to read their essay in XO Jane (originally published on Elizabeth Street) about how their sexless marriage got to be so damn sexless. It started off well:
The first time I made out with my husband we had been dating about 3 weeks. I remember the first night we got naked together. Their clothes came off and they were on top of me and I thought to myself, "Oh no, this is not going to work." I was not attracted to their body; I was used to being with hot, young guys with muscular, sculpted bodies. I was like a guy in that way: I needed a hot body. We ended up having sex and it was just "meh."
The man of them dreams!
We would come home drunk from a fun night out and I would want to start making out before we'd even made it through the door. They were easily embarrassed and would push me away in public and then when we got home they would want to order late night pizza rather than eating me, so to speak.
.... so to speak ;).
Naturally, they got married and had kids. Yet somehow they have never kindled that magical spark of love (hot sexxx). "I can't help but know that I went from a life of having sex 300 times a year to 10, if I am lucky," Julianna writes. That will certainly give them husband a lot to think about. Let's hope that they read this essay carefully, for the sake of a healthy marriage.
Julianna Colt is also the author of "Should I Get a Divorce?"

US House of Representatives Votes to Defund Planned Parenthood
On Friday, the US House of Representatives voted to block all federal funding of Planned Parenthood. While this bill has little-to-no chance of actually going into effect due to opposition from President Obama and the Democratic party, this sheds light on an important political issue– a woman's right to make decisions about their own body– which we thought was set in stone with the passing of Roe v. Wade in 1973. Needless to say, we will keep fighting until bodily autonomy is assured for all women. We Stand with Survivors, and we #StandwithPP. For more information on the vote, click here.
Lady Gaga Teams Up with The Hunting Ground to Raise Awareness for Campus Sexual Assault
In their haunting new music video “Til It Happens to You,” released in partnership with The Hunting Ground, Lady Gaga reveals the realities of rape taking place each and every day on college campuses. Dianne Warren, the composer of the song, stated in an interview, “I want [people] to know that they're not alone and they're not victims, but they're survivors.” Part of the proceeds from the song and music video will be donated to organizations that support survivors of sexual assault.

Chrissy Teigen and Tyra Banks Shed Light on Fertility Issues
On a recent episode of their new talk show FABLife, models Chrissy Teigen and Tyra Banks disclose their personal struggles with infertility and discuss the pain that societal expectations have on them in this regard. Teigen stated, “I can't imagine being that nosy to be like, ‘So, when are the kids coming?' Because who knows what somebody's going through? Who knows if somebody's struggling to have children?” So many people are unaware that the expectation for women to be mother's can be very emotionally and personally detrimental– we are so grateful that Teigen and Banks decided to speak out on the issue.

My grandmother used to say, “You can put truth in the river five days after a lie; truth is gone catch up.”
Well, here's the truth: The working men and women of this country are working more jobs and more hours, and they're still barely hanging on. Beneath those fingertips, they can feel that middle-class dream – the American dream – slipping right away from them. It's time for President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE to do something about it.
I come from Ohio. It's where I was born, and it's where my roots run deep. We are humble, proud and hard-working people who've been battered by the twin storms of globalization and greed.
This past weekend, I was in another state full of humble, proud, and hard-working people; I marched with workers from the Nissan plant in Canton, Miss.
ADVERTISEMENT
For decades, manufacturing provided millions of Ohioans and Mississippians a solid roadway to the middle class. A family breadwinner could work full time and earn enough money to buy a home, put the kids through college, and enjoy a secure retirement.
But today, 600,000 American manufacturing workers make less than $9.60 per hour – barely more than they could earn at a fast food joint. And their real wages dropped nearly 4.5 percent from 2003 to 2013. They are barely hanging on.
We marched in Canton because Nissan isn't giving its workers the dignity and respect they earn every single day along that assembly line. They are furloughed for the equivalent of months throughout the year, killing plans for homeownership. They don't have a predictable schedule, putting college tuition for their kids out of reach. They've even had their pensions frozen, making dreams of retirement seem more like a cruel joke than an attainable goal.
And that's just the full-time workers. Nissan uses a temp company, Kelly Services, to fill almost half the jobs at the plant. Temp workers there receive $12 an hour plus the promise that after a certain time, they'll become full Nissan employees. But many of them languish for years.
To make matters worse, this poverty-wage business model is paid for by our tax dollars. In fact, Nissan and Kelly Services have scooped up more than $3 billion in federal contracts and loans. That means our government is helping keep American factory workers in poverty jobs while corporate executives get to pocket billions in profits.
This isn't just happening in Canton. Right now, the U.S. government is America's No. 1 low-wage job creator, funding more than 2 million poverty jobs across the country through contracts, loans and grants with private corporations. That's more than McDonald's and Wal-Mart combined. And when federal contractors like Nissan and Kelly Services illegally violate the rights of their workers to organize, they're passing poverty from generation to generation.
So you can understand why Ohioans and Mississippians sat up and listened when Donald Trump promised that they would bring manufacturing back; that they would create more jobs and better wages. Everyday Americans took them at their word. And now it's time to hold them accountable.
It's time for President Trump to guarantee that the only companies doing business with the federal government are the ones that pay living wages, provide safe work environments and benefits, and don't fight their workers when they want to form a union.
We know that they can do this, because he's done it before. Workers at the Trump International Hotel – a federally owned property – were allowed to form a union shortly after President Trump was elected. It's time to demand that other federal contractors do the same thing.
Grandma was right. The truth always does catch up. And the truth of the matter is this: President Trump made us a promise.
It's a promise that we all need to ensure that they keep – for our workers, for our families and for the future we all share.

CLC offers the FEC new evidence of the super PAC's illegal compensation to Steve Bannon, asks California Attorney General to examine Bannon's “Glittering Steel”
WASHINGTON - Today, the Campaign Legal Center (CLC) filed new evidence with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) alleging that the super PAC Make America Number 1 made illegal contributions to Donald Trump's presidential campaign. CLC also asked the State of California to investigate a company owned by Bannon, Glittering Steel LLC, for failing to comply with state registration and public disclosure laws.
The FEC letter provided new evidence that the Mercer super PAC illegally compensated Steve Bannon's work as Donald Trump's campaign CEO, and that the super PAC and campaign engaged in unlawful coordinated spending by using the common vendor Cambridge Analytica. The letter is a follow-up to the complaint filed by CLC on Oct. 6, 2016.
“The evidence suggests that the Mercer-backed super PAC secretly subsidized Bannon's work for the Trump campaign by payments to ‘Glittering Steel,' which we now know has been chaired and is owned by Bannon and which paid them a monthly consulting fee,” said Brendan Fischer, director of the federal and FEC reform program at the Campaign Legal Center.
Additionally, Fischer added, “both Bannon and Make America Number 1's leadership owned and were on the board of Cambridge Analytica, and news reports indicate that the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica at the urging of Make America Number 1's head, strengthening the inference that Cambridge Analytica was used as a means of sharing information between the campaign and super PAC, in violation of federal law.”
CLC also filed a new letter with California's Attorney General and Secretary of State asking for a review of Glittering Steel LLC's compliance with state law. Glittering Steel never registered to do business in California, but Make America Number 1's FEC filings show millions in payments to Glittering Steel at a California address, and Bannon on their personal financial disclosure stated that they were paid by Glittering Steel through their California-based consulting firm. Entities engaged in intrastate commerce in California must register and publicly disclose their board membership, and may be subject to taxation.
“Bannon's company appears to have dodged the California disclosure requirements that would provide more public information that could inform whether it broke federal campaign finance law,” said Fischer.
The art of sharpening pencils
Welcome to the world of pencil sharpening - this may sound like a dull topic but there is actually a lot more to it than you think. There are a number of different sharpening styles and methods; all good artists should know them. The trick is using the right one at the right time.
Sharpening styles
There are four main points to select from; the one you choose will depend on the type of pencil you use, and the style of your drawing.
The standard point
Everyone knows about this one, its trademark conical point is the most common and the most versatile of sharpening styles. If you're looking for a good all-rounder for most types of pencils then this is the best. Plus if you don't have a sharpening knife then you probably don't have a choice.
There are a couple of drawbacks with this style, however. The standard point can get blunt quickly, particularly if you are using softer pencils such as charcoal. On larger drawings you will find yourself constantly sharpening the damn thing. Often lower quality pencils will contain a smaller diameter core of graphite; if this is slightly off-centre you will find the wood comes so close to the point on one side that it's almost unusable. This can very be frustrating.
The chisel point
This is a rarely seen style where the end of the pencil is cut with a knife into a chisel shape. The main benefit of the chisel is its ability to draw two types of marks on the paper; thin dark lines from along the sharp edge and softer, wider lines from the flat faces. The soft lines are great for rough construction at the start of a drawing and simply turning the pencil on its edge gives you extra precision when you need it. Another neat feature is its 'self-sharpening' property. As you use the chisel on its face it actually helps keep the edge sharp. This means you can spend more time drawing and less time sharpening - great for softer pencils! The straight edge can also be used on an angle to give lines a calligraphy style.
One problem with the chiselled design is it can be difficult to master. When drawing with the flat face it's all too easy to accidentally roll your wrist and wear away the corners of the chisel shape. It can also take a bit of work to carve the chisel, to begin with. If you can overcome these minor annoyances then the chisel point may be for you.
See my chalk life drawings for examples of art done with this sharpening style.
The needle point
This is a specialist design that is carved with a knife into a sharp concave point. The idea is that such a fine point can wear down a long way before it actually becomes too blunt to use. This style is great for perfectionists who want precise control over their lines and extra fine detail.
There are a number of potential problems with this design. A fine point such as this is prone to constant breaking so it's only suitable for harder pencils. The needle point can only make the one type of mark too, a fine line, so there is not a lot of flexibility here. Colouring in large sections of solid tone can be very time consuming so you are limited to smaller sized drawings.
The bullet point
This is my personal favourite and one I devised myself. In this style the wood is removed from the last centimetre of the pencil then the end of the lead is sharpened into a bullet shape. Two types of marks can be made from this design; a softer line from the side of the bullet and a sharp line from the point. Like the chisel, it has a 'self-sharpening' property. The bullet point is also good for hard and soft pencils.
There are not many drawbacks with this design except to say that it does take a minute or two to carve the design, to begin with. If you haven't tried this before, give it a go.
Methods of sharpening
Here are the four main methods that I use.
Traditional pencil sharpeners
It's always handy to have one of these in your pencil case for a backup. If you like experimenting with lots of different media then it's a good idea to get your hands on the double sharpeners that have two different sizes. There are a lot of great pencils out there that are a little bigger than normal so if you forget your knife then you can still sharpen them.
Sharpening with a knife
A knife is the most versatile method of sharpening a pencil. It can take a little practice but it's a very useful skill to master. Make sure you cut away from yourself and preferably over a bin. With softer leads try cutting smaller bits at a time to prevent breaking.
Using sand paper
This is a neat little trick that I use regularly. Try clipping a little piece of sandpaper to your drawing board and if your pencil starts getting a little blunt just run it over the paper a few times to bring the point back. This is especially useful during quick figure drawings when there is no time to get out your sharpener.
Paper wrapped charcoal
This is a very neat way to sharpen charcoal pencils. Simply pull back the string a little then peel off a roll of paper. The best thing about this method is you are left with the 'bullet point' style of sharpened pencil, very nice!
My 'Living Dead Dolls' Sadie Pencil Sharpener
This is my favourite pencil sharpener. It's a dolls head and you stick the pencil into their eye to sharpen it. There is a little button on the back of their neck that pushes the shavings out of their mouth, very nice!
Drawing with short pencils
Most people throw away their pencils when they get too short but I actually find them easier to use. When drawing I hold my pencil in two different ways; on its side or on its point. I'm constantly moving between the two positions as I draw and I find my hand gets in the way if I use a long pencil. With a short pencil, I can fluidly and rapidly move without restriction.
I find shorter pencils so much better, I have even started chopping my new pencils in half after buying them. You get two-for-one that way! One word of advice, however, after the chop make sure you make a note of the hardness on the other end, otherwise, you will have all these mystery grade pencils!
So there really is a lot to say about sharpening pencils. Now with all this extra knowledge, there is only one thing left for us to do... Happy drawing folks!
The friction-fighting specialists at CeramicSpeed are at it again. The company's new oversized pulleys are lighter, more durable and astronomically more expensive than ever before.
CeramicSpeed's jockey pulleys take a two-pronged approach to fighting friction.
Unlike traditional jockey wheels, which generally have 11 teeth, CeramicSpeed's design has 17 teeth per wheel.
Oversized jockey wheels require the chain to articulate less than smaller diameter pulleys. Less movement between the links of the chain results in a small but measurable reduction in friction. You can learn more about the benefits of oversized pulleys here.
In addition to being larger, CeramicSpeed uses high-quality, ceramic-coated bearings.
CeramicSpeed claims its system can save up to three watts (presumably when riding at high power) over stock jockey pulleys from the likes of Shimano and SRAM.
The company's latest featherweight pulleys are constructed from 3D printed titanium. This manufacturing process allows for some very intricate designs that wouldn't be possible to produce any other way. The 'spokes' are hollow for maximum weight savings.
3D printing allows for some very intricate (and expensive) manufacturing
CeramicSpeed claims the system is 10 percent lighter than the company's alloy pulleys and twice as durable. This slippery drivetrain upgrade is compatible with Shimano and SRAM rear derailleurs. The complete system weighs 70g.
The downside to the 3D printing process is that it is incredibly time-intensive. It takes approximately 24 hours to manufacture each wheel.
Given the materials and time involved, it should come as no surprise that this upgrade will command a premium price tag.
This derailleur upgrade could save you watts and grams, but it will cost you your first-born
This derailleur upgrade kit, which includes both jockey wheels with a composite derailleur cage retails for a jaw-dropping €1,500 / $1,700.
This kit will be available in May. We can think of a lot of other ways to spend that type of scratch, but it just goes to show, there's a market for anything.

Holly Carpenter: 'I can't understand people getting a thrill out of being so critical – some people need to lighten up'
I decided to stay quiet throughout the whole thing to give myself a chance to clear my head and give the keyboard warriors some time to calm down and move on to their next target.
Modelling isn't a 9-5 job and every day is different, so I really enjoy sitting down to write every week as it gives me a sense of routine and a chance to do something I've always loved.
I'm very grateful to have my own column and always try to have it in on time, filled with ground-breaking topics (like the January sales) and written in my trademark down-to-earth, light-hearted and self-deprecating voice.
However, last week I wasn't quite as organised as usual – it was New Year's Eve after all – and I had to do a quick interview over the phone before it went to print, just to add some details.
In the end I understand why people might have felt that parts of my column just didn't sound like me. In general, I'm pretty open about my personal life but there are some aspects of it that I would rather keep to myself, which I hope people understand.
Anyone who knows me, or even just follows me on Instagram is surely aware that I don't take myself too seriously and that I have no problem slagging myself off.
However, I found it extremely frustrating and embarrassing getting so much hate over a few words in the social part of my column.
I think people over-reacted and I can't understand or relate to anyone who gets a thrill out of typing nasty words about someone else with the aim of upsetting them.
Luckily, I'm surrounded by good people who stood by me and helped me laugh it off. It was nice to receive supportive messages from friends who were making sure I wasn't getting too upset or affected by any of the negativity.
Part of the reason I didn't partake in any interviews or reply to any mean tweets about this is because I fully understand that you have to take the good with the bad in this industry and I tried my best to just take it on the chin, learn from it and move on.
I always try to turn any negative situation into a positive one and I guess this just showed me how many people are reading my column, which is great!
A very big ‘thank you' to everyone who Tweeted me. I even made it on to some of my favourite satirical sites which featured what happened and gave me a laugh.
Being underestimated by people only gives me even more drive to work hard and succeed. At the end of the day, some people just need to lighten up.
But on a serious note – if you're heading out for food this weekend, don't forget that Tapas always works great for a crowd!

Green Cove Springs, FL — After Irma devastated Florida, most restaurants and stores were shut down in certain areas. Green Cove Springs was one of those places. So, when Jack Roundtree, owner of the Triple J BBQ food truck, arrived in town, not only was they welcomed with open arms — they were desperately needed. As they sold BBQ to paying customers, Roundtree used the extra money to feed utility workers for free for all their hard work. However, once officials saw a man who'd dare sell food in their town without paying them first, police were called in to make quick work of this entrepreneurial good samaritan.
Shut down and get out of town—is what Roundtree was told by local authorities for both providing charity and a much-needed product and service. Why was Roundtree told to get out of town, you ask? Well, they hadn't paid the local government for the ‘privilege' to sell food to those in need inside Green Cove Springs.
Roundtree is no outlaw. In fact, Green Cove Springs actually encouraged them to sell their BBQ during their monthly Saturday-in-the-Park event before the hurricane. But not this time.
Even if they would've gone to city hall to buy a permit to sell during the Irma aftermath, however, they couldn't—they were closed.
According to Clay Today:
“It was interesting to learn that Roundtree and their truck were encouraged to serve customers during Green Cove's monthly Saturday-in-the-Park event without a permit, but during Irma's aftermath, not so much. “Had Roundtree decided to press their case at City Hall, they would have been greeted with a sign that read: ‘Due to Hurricane Irma, City Hall offices and services will re-open on Thursday, Sept. 14, 2017.'”
So, instead of allowing Roundtree to offer free food to utility workers and sell food to people during their time of need, and just get a permit after government employees decided to return to work—they just kicked them out of town.
Here's how one Green Cove Spring witness, Bettie Tune, described the events at Rich's on their Facebook page, as reported by Clay Today:
Just saw a BBQ food truck set up in town. GREAT!! Wanted to stop and get a good lunch for the guys helping us. When I pulled in, there was a Green Cove Springs police sitting there. OK, everyone has to eat, and the choices are very limited right now. Starting to talk to one of the guys from the food truck and found out that the “city manager” had sent their police to make them leave. This is such a great little town, but it seems like the people who run it do their best to keep it from progressing. THANKS Green Cove Springs City Manager. Shame on you!
The irony here is that they were kicked out of town for failing to get a permit by government workers because the other government workers who would've given them this permit, were not at work.
In a report from the Institute for Justice, Communications Coordinator, Matt Powers explains that Roundtree is not alone.
Cities across the country often impose strict regulations that make it nearly impossible for food trucks to operate. In 2011, IJ launched its National Street Vending Initiative to fight these laws. In Baltimore, the Institute for Justice (IJ) is challenging a ban on food trucks parking within 300-foot of a brick-and-mortar business that sells the same type of food. In Chicago, IJ is challenging regulations that ban food trucks from operating within 200 feet of a brick-and-mortar business serving food and forces them to install GPS tracking devices that broadcast their every move. And IJ is challenging a Louisville, Kentucky, law banning food trucks from operating within 150 feet of any restaurant selling similar food.
These strict regulations are ostensibly designed for food safety, but in reality, serve to raise revenue for the state and limit established restaurants' competition. They also stifle economic growth.
As the IJ noted:
It is not only during times of crisis that food trucks contribute to their communities. According to IJ's report Streets of Dreams mobile vending businesses help people escape poverty and unemployment through affordable start-up costs which creates the initial economic opportunity for upward mobility. IJ's report, Seven Myths and Realitiesfound the presence of food trucks can actually help local restaurant industries by attracting new customers and serving as incubators for new restaurants. Cities should embrace food trucks and liberate them from onerous regulations so they can enjoy the benefits these businesses bring.
When people in need are denied food they are willing to purchase because government workers aren't in the office to sell the maker of that food a permission slip, something is wrong in the land of the free.
As TFTP reported earlier this month, this problem is everywhere. It stifles local economic growth, persecutes the poor the hardest, and turns hard-working entrepreneurs into criminals, ripe for the extortion of state.
Luckily, thanks to Martin Flores, who filmed an innocent hot dog vendor named Beto get robbed by a Berkely police officer for selling hot dogs, Americans are seeing the harsh reality that is making a living in a police state.
From that time until now, when the ongoing economic problems forced a rethinking of that decree, countless players and other highly paid V.I.P.'s got away with paying a tax rate in Spain of only 24.75 percent.
That rate is scheduled to jump to 52 percent, though Cristiano Ronaldo and others will doubtless not have to pay a cent if the employers cover it. Cristiano may still net their €10 million, or $13 million, but Real Madrid may have to double its outlay to keep them happy.
The pouting, rather than celebrating, after Ronaldo scored a goal a couple of months back was in part because of the wrangling over a new contract for him, beyond the current one that runs to 2015.
However, this is not so much about the current Madrid star. They have enough on their plate with a Champions League match against Manchester City on Wednesday evening.
Back to the Beckham effect. When Anschutz Entertainment Group, the owner of the Galaxy, wanted to take them to Los Angeles, it first had to persuade the Major League Soccer to break its salary cap.
For a second time, the Beckham name became attached to a change of financial allowances. The M.L.S. agreed to a “designated player rule” that, in effect, allowed Beckham, and then a few others, to be paid more than the rest of their teammates combined.
A hallowed principle in many sports in the United States, the salary cap, was altered.
By how much? That has been between the Galaxy and the Beckhams, but suffice to say, the soccer family easily afforded their $18.2 million home in Beverly Hills, close to their friend, Tom Cruise.

Come to think of it, Beckham also has a house in Dubai, so maybe the list of potential new grounds for their last hurrah as a player must embrace the Middle East as well.

We will hear soon enough whether all the talk Down Under really does mean David's ears are open to a stint there, perhaps for the 10 games that would remain of the Australian season by the time they would be available. Melbourne Heart and Central Coast Mariners have jumped aboard the speculation train, while the media are wondering whether Western Sydney Wanderers could rustle up the cash to sign Beckham as a rival attraction to Alessandro Del Piero, the Italian player who joined Sydney FC this year.
Beckham's signing off from the Galaxy, after the M.L.S. Cup match Dec. 1, means the league, and the endorsement companies, must find another face to carry them through the future. It might require some deep thinking because, while there have always been better players in the world than Beckham, none has their instant marketing appeal.

Even when Beckham was a part-time player, carried by Landon Donovan and the other Los Angeles players, their management group could sell them in the United States like no other soccer star. The same management, incidentally, just landed another coup in the United States after its new client, Lewis Hamilton, won the inaugural Formula One race on Sunday in Austin, Texas.
Meanwhile, back in Europe, where Beckham left their youth, the powers the players now wield are facing several new challenges.
One is the attempt to put financial restraints on a sport that, from its top clubs down, pays as much as 70 percent of its annual income straight into the pockets of players.
Michel Platini, the former star player who now is running Europe's soccer authority, UEFA, is intent on bringing what they call financial fair play to the sport. By that, they mean clubs should not spend, as some of them ruinously do, more on player fees and salaries than they earn through the game tickets and broadcasting rights.
Platini's rule should kick in starting next season. Some of the biggest clubs, owned by overseas billionaires, are hard at work inventing new ways of presenting their balance sheets.
In Spain, where Barcelona and Real Madrid command television fees way above all the rest, there is a gathering crisis at the gates. Even if people can afford the entrance price, there is now audible complaining about the salaries of the super-rich players.

Like Dickens's Oliver Twist, the players want more, more, more.
And some of them give less, less, less.
“It's not a good time to be a coach right now,” opined Mauricio Pellegrino, who took the coaching role at Valencia in the Spanish league last summer. Pellegrino, an Argentine who played for the club, added: “The players have more influence than the coach. Players have a value in the market for the clubs that the coach just does not.”
There might be exceptions to that. Pep Guardiola is halfway through their intended yearlong sabbatical in New York after leaving Barcelona, and the word is that Chelsea wants them to deal with player unrest in London.
Player power? Surely not.
Iran's President-elect Hassan Rohani is saying all the right things to the 50.71 percent of Iranians who voted for change in mid-June elections: They promised again today to ease censorship and social and Internet restrictions, and to restore “mutual trust” between the people and clergy.
“A strong government does not mean a government that interferes and intervenes in all affairs [and] that limits the lives of the people,” Mr. Rohani told fellow clerics in Tehran.
Rohani said it was “not possible” to attract Iran's young society with “harsh views,” nor with state television that broadcasts a panda birth in China but ignores protests by unpaid workers. The speech comes after Rohani also vowed to correct the “imbalanced” application of Iran's Constitution in an interview with a youth magazine.
“The freedom and rights of people have been ignored but those of the rulers have been emphasized,” Rohani told the weekly, Chelcheragh. “Restricting [people's right] to criticize will only stifle and lead to inefficiency.”
But even as the centrist politician seeks to reassure moderates in Iran, what of the conservative “principlist” and hardline factions that were defeated by Rohani's shock first-round win?
Still stunned by the defeat of their own five candidates, they are licking their wounds, and warning that Rohani's new cabinet should not include “seditious” members of the opposition 2009 Green Movement, which would invite chaos and a violent response.
There has been a swift reaction to these warnings, however, evidence that Iran's post-election debate is signaling a new moderation from both the left and the right. Indeed, while Rohani speaks of civil liberties and “more transparency” in nuclear talks, they also have clear public support from the most powerful in the regime: Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard.
“Iranian state and society has no place for radicalism now,” says a political analyst in Tehran who asked not to be named. “The atmosphere in Iran today is more than an alliance, it is kind of accepting a coexistence with each other,” they say. “As for radicals, I believe that the leadership is willing to control them, not only [Khamenei] but principlists [conservatives] who support Rohani are not going to allow radicals to do whatever they like.”
(For more insight on Rohani, read Scott Peterson's report on the president-elect and what it means to be a centrist in Iran.)
The vigilante tool
Small but persuasive in their use of violence, hardline vigilante groups such as Ansar-e Hezbollah were deployed frequently in the 1990s and early 2000s to signal their dissent to reformists during the presidency of Mohammad Khatami. Wielding clubs and chains, they broke up political meetings and student protests during the Khatami era. Years later, in 2009 they were sent out again – alongside Basij militia and other security forces – to crush post-election street protests.
In a bid to avoid a renewal of such violence, even as Rohani promises an end to the “securitized atmosphere” and less-tight social strictures, other moderate voices are also making themselves heard.
In one explicit warning to Allah Karam, the leader of Ansar-e Hezbollah, the Alef news website of prominent conservative lawmaker Ahmad Tavakoli wrote: “We should hope that the sword which has come out of its scabbard [will] return back in, so that a country finally seeing some happiness wouldn't fall into chaos.”
The Alef warning stated: “Surely those friends [Ansar-e Hezbollah] that always displayed loyalty to the Leader … should show loyalty today as well and prevent Iran from becoming a country where politics are determined in the streets.”
Rohani's victory was greeted with euphoric scenes in the streets, a waving of ribbons and flags of the purple color chosen by their campaign. The symbolism was similar to the “green” campaign of 2009 that saw millions of Iranians take to the streets in protest over election fraud, and two Green Movement presidential candidates, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karrubi, placed under house arrest.
All eyes on the cabinet picks
Rohani has promised to seek their release sometime after they are inaugurated on Aug. 3. But the decisions they make now about the political breadth of their cabinet are likely to determine the scale of the challenge of reining in the most radical elements on both sides.
Rohani's victory “was a phenomenon,” says Hamid Reza Jalaiepour, a sociologist at Tehran University and adviser to former president Khatami, in a telephone interview.
“The mainstream of reformists became happy, moderate conservatives became happy, many in the middle class became happy, and even villagers became happy,” says Mr. Jalaiepour, a former US hostage-taker during the 1979 Islamic revolution, and later an editor of reformist newspapers that were shut down.
“The level of rationality of the Iranian people was very high during this election,” says Jalaiepour, noting that “this election was clean” compared with 2009, and that the hardline reaction “is not clear yet.”
“One of the important factors is that Ayatollah Khamenei didn't tell to any hardliner to ‘do something,' ” adds Jalaiepour. “This decision of Ayatollah Khamenei was very important, and for this reason hardliners couldn't manipulate everything. But we should stay, and wait…. It is hopeful for the future, but needs more time.”
Warning against 'well-known reformist figures'
The hardline Kayhan newspaper – whose editor is an official representative of Khamenei – this week warned Rohani not to bring into their cabinet “well-known reformist figures,” if they have not publicly denounced what it called the “American-Israeli plotted sedition” of 2009. Kayhan also criticized Rohani for thanking Khatami for their campaign endorsement, saying it “exacerbates concerns that Dr. Rohani might neglect the danger that the leaders and agents of the [2009] sedition could pose for their administration.”
Yet Kayhan has also backed Rohani, and those warnings are likely just part of the post-election debate about Rohani's win, and the political balance they aim to achieve with a cabinet that is “beyond factions.”
“I think these people want to warn Mr. Rohani not to get close to extreme reformists, but I see no reason for it, because they wouldn't do such a thing,” says Amir Mohebian, a conservative editor and analyst, in one interview published this week.
“The principlists should avoid self-deception and accept defeat responsibly and realistically and enter a phase of harsh self-criticism … to understand what has stopped them,” said Mr. Mohebian, an editor of Resalat newspaper, in another interview. “If they do not … they will lose the future…. [B]laming others will not solve their problem.”
Time to reflect?
Tehran University political scientist Sadiq Zibakalam also had a direct message for the leader of Ansar-e Hezbollah, when they examined the election results.
“It is better for Mr. Allah Karam and their like-minded [hardliners] to reach a conclusion about the past and the present and ask why their candidate and their ideas have received 4 million votes while their opponent has won 18 million votes,” Mr. Zibakalam was quoted as saying on the Fararu.com website. “Unfortunately … they have not understood that people voted for moderation, rationality and collective wisdom and denounced Allah Karam's threats to make chaos.”

For many Iranians, the sense of positive change brought by the election result is palpable, for now.
“The last four years [under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad], we were living in a closed atmosphere,” says Khatami adviser Jalaiepour. “There is a new atmosphere. These days if you go to a shop, or to a university, the atmosphere has been changed, compared to one month ago. This is very important.”
Former Calcutta High Court Judge Justice CS Karnan who was convicted by the Supreme Court for contempt of Court, has been arrested by West Bengal Police from Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu.
They have been evading arrest since May 9, retired on June 12, became the first High Court Judge to have retired while still absconding.

This was in aftermath of an order passed on May 9, wherein the 7 Judge SC Bench had sentenced them to 6 months in jail after finding them guilty of contempt of Court. “On merits, we are of the considered view, that Sri Justice C.S. Karnan, has committed contempt of the judiciary. Their actions constitute contempt of this Court, and of the judiciary of the gravest nature. Having found them guilty of committing contempt, we convict them accordingly. We are satisfied to punish them by sentencing them to imprisonment for six months. As a consequence, the contemnor shall not perform any administrative or judicial functions,” the 7 judge bench headed by Chief Justice J.S. Khehar had then observed.

Colorblocking is a pretty obvious trend for fall, but here's the problem with it: It's harder to do than matching neutrals. And figuring out what shade of red goes with what shade of pink is hard work. So, we present to you a total of 12 foolproof colorblocking items: four shirts, four skirts, and four accessories. We've paired what we think are appropriate color combinations, but of course, feel free to mix and match. We've kept it simple with reds, pinks, peaches, and corals, and threw in a few other hues to shake things up.
1. Versace silk scarf, $281 at FarFetch: The first item on our list is more of a compliment to colorblocking, rather than an actual part of the colorblock itself (get it?). With colors like yellow, green, and purple, this Versace scarf can really go along with any color combination you might put together, especially the reds above.
2. By Malene Birger frill detail top, $240 at Flannels: You might not think it at first, but this bright orange shirt would go quite well the bright pink skirt below it. Or, something a little more toned-down, like a pair of peach-colored pants.
3. Dries Van Noten bracelet set, $405 at MyTheresa: These Dries bracelets are the perfect add-on to an outfit that already has a lot of color in it, or to an outfit that doesn't. Either way, you can't lose.
4. Gucci Silk crepe de chine blouse, $750 at Net-a-Porter: Actually, this Gucci blouse is already colorblocked, so the work has been done for you! If you want to keep it going even further, though, pair it with the skirt below (#8).
5. Adam Jones long-sleeved top, $295 at FarFetch: This Adam Jones top is a bonus because, in addition to being so on trend, it's also a great fall basic.
6. Knitted coral sweater, $72 at Topshop: An oversized sweater is an easy way to keep the look casual, since dressing head to toe in color is usually a pretty strong statement in itself.
7. Preen pink a-line pleated skirt, $1,287 at MyWardrobe.com: Your gut reaction might be to pair this hot pink Preen skirt with a nuetral color, but that would actually draw even more attention to the bright hue because of the contrast. So if you think about it, you're actually toning it down by pairing it with another bright. Well, sort of.
8. L'Wren Scott orange high-waisted pencil skirt, $1,045 at StyleBop.com: This L'Wren Scott skirt would also go really well with blue or green. Why not try them all?
9. Preen "Whisky" skirt, $1,431 at FarFetch: Here's another vibrant Preen skirt, though this one's a little less Barbie and a little more Little Red Riding Hood. Pair it with something sweet, like a blouse, or something casual, like a plain tee.
10. "Lip Edge" pencil skirt, $75 at Oasis: Nothing says sexy like a hot red pencil skirt, no matter what color you wear it with on top.
11. Proenza Schouler "PS1 Pochette," 895 at Ssense: This lively teal PS1 bag adds just enough color without being too overbearing, in relation to the rest of your look.
12. Brian Atwood "Felini" suede peep-toe pumps, $459 at MyTheresa: And since you might as well go big or go home, here's a great pair of purple suede Brian Atwood pumps.

The Problem of Lesbian Sheep
When sheep, in the mountains, are wanting to breed,
there's not very much that the sheep up there need.
For they've got quite a system when it's time to mate:
the rams nose around, and the ewes stand and wait.
Yes, the female sheep don't have to do anything,
when the rams (in the mountains) go crazy in spring,
but give off special smells from their feminine places
which those sex-hungry rams can detect - with their faces.
Yep those rams stick their noses in each ewe's behind
to detect if to mating they might be inclined,
and if so they mount them - they both have their fun -
and that's how the process of mating is done.
And so, to sum up, there's a system in place
to ensure that the sheep can continue their race,
and it works like a charm. So, no cause to lose sleep.
... but consider the problem of lesbian sheep ...
Yes, a lesbian sheep hopes and prays they can find
a lesbian ewe who's of similar mind
but they don't know how! They were brought up to think
that to find a good mate, you just stand there and stink.
And alas, their true love, just a few yards away,
tries the very same thing in the very same way,
and though they both want to be loved and be held,
they just stand around, and wait to be smelled.
Oh the pain they must suffer! Their agonized cries!
The mere thought of their torment brings tears to my eyes!
And it's all so unneeded! Imagine their joy
if they just found a different technique to employ.
Even lesbian sheep must have some way to meet!
It presumably starts by one moving its feet,
drawing close to the other and sniffing its rear,
or presenting its own. On this point I'm not clear.
But they can't stand around like their hetero kin
simply waiting for somebody else to begin.
And so my advice to gay sheep as they graze:
to woo lesbian ewes, use less motionless ways.

Seattle Congestion ‘Is Going To Get Way Worse'
Traffic is getting worse in Seattle. Our rising population is driving it. And even with a multibillion-dollar transportation package, it's not expected to improve. Which is why we plug our ears when we hear someone like Gil Penalosa, a former parks commissioner from Colombia, say, “I think congestion is good.” Have they juddered along in I-405 traffic? Have they idled on Montlake at 4 p.m.? “There is no city in the world the size of Seattle that has solved the issue of mobility through the private car,” Penalosa says. “None.” Penalosa, who leads a campaign for more livable cities, says soul-churning traffic triggers change.

“When there is congestion, people are willing to pay taxes to improve congestion,” they say. They move closer to their friends. They move closer to their jobs. They walk or bike. And that is happening in Seattle, but congestion is getting worse. Lawmakers are set to authorize billions of dollars in spending on roads, much of it in Seattle. But the transportation package is catch-up money to fix our broken roads. We put off maintenance for years, says Mark Hallenbeck director of the Washington State Transportation Center, “and that's coming back to bite us.” To relieve congestion, roads would need to expand, which is not going to happen. Because even if Washington state had unlimited funds, which it does not, Seattle is short of physical space. Add to that the million more people the Puget Sound Regional Council says will live here by 2040. “Life will suck big time,” Hallenbeck says.

“When you continue to add people, there isn't a place for them to go,” they say. “Congestion on what roads we do have is going to get way worse.” The state is resigned. Washington's transportation department has a road map that indicates it expects urban highways to be congested – with stops and starts and sudden changes in speed.

Like wasps, bees may be solitary or social. They feed on nectar and pollen, and play an important role in the pollination and survival of many flowering plants. New Zealand has 28 native and 13 introduced species of bee.
Native bees
At least three native bee species have a basic social structure, a bit like the introduced honeybee and bumblebee. The rest are solitary, although they may make nests close together.
Native bees pollinate many native plants. They are also widespread in kiwifruit and apple orchards and some vegetable crops, and may be important pollinators in horticulture.
Leioproctus bees
The most commonly seen native bees are 18 species of Leioproctus. These bees are robust and hairy, looking similar to honeybees but smaller (5–12 millimetres long). All are black except for the South Island species Leioproctus fulvescens, which is covered with dense orange–yellow hair. They are often seen in summer carrying pollen on their back legs, like honeybees and bumblebees.
They dig nest holes in the ground, and sometimes a nesting area riddled with bee holes gives the impression of a colony. A small pile of soil is the usual sign of individual nest tunnels. Each species prefers a specific type of soil. For example, Leioproctus fulvescens needs fine-grained soil, while Leioproctus metallicus nests in coastal sand.
Hylaeus bees
The seven Hylaeus species are 7–9 millimetres long, and slender. Almost hairless, they are black with small yellow markings on the face and thorax. They make nests in blind tunnels in twigs and branches, or in old beetle holes in logs. They have no special pollen-carrying structure on the back legs, so carry pollen in the stomach.
Lasioglossum bees
The smallest (4–8 millimetres long) and most easily overlooked native bees are four species of Lasioglossum. They are black or greenish, only moderately hairy, and nest in the soil. At least one species, Lasioglossum sordidum, has adapted well to modified habitats. Its nests are often found along fencelines, on horticultural land sprayed bare with herbicides, and on stopbanks and ditch sides above water level.
The following guest post is from University of Notre Dame political scientist Debra Javeline, who is collaborating with Notre Dame biologists, computer scientists, and other faculty on an interdisciplinary project on adaptation to climate change.  They are leading a survey of the world's top environmental biologists on how they assess the scientific, ethical, economic, and legal issues surrounding wildlife adaptation to climate change.
*****
President Obama recently announced a plan to deal with the single most important global problem, climate change. Included in the plan are policies to mitigate (reduce greenhouse gas emissions and thereby slow, stop, or in a dare-we-dream scenario, reverse climate change) and adapt (reduce our vulnerability by preparing for the inevitable impacts of a changed climate). While the natural and physical science on the climate is clear and less disputed than on the vast majority of scientific topics, the politics of climate change is extremely complicated and understudied, which offers an important research opportunity for political scientists.
To date, political science has engaged climate change primarily in three areas: (1) international relations, especially the lack of cooperation among nations on climate policy, (2) political theory, especially climate justice, and (3) the most obvious observations about the influence of fossil fuel interests in shaping policy and environmental outcomes. However, there remain many other important research and policy questions about climate change that could be fruitfully addressed by political scientists.
For example, important debates about climate change require understanding the costs of mitigating and adapting to climate change, compared to the costs of not mitigating and adapting. While political scientists may not be equipped to estimate these costs and benefits, they are precisely the scholars to analyze how politicians and constituents perceive costs and benefits and whether those perceived costs and benefits match the economists' assessments. Political scientists are the scholars who can tell us how political leaders and ordinary citizens behave in response to the perceived costs and benefits of mitigation and adaptation.
For another example, important issues surround voting, which is currently not climate-based. There is no evidence from the voting literature or even journalistic reports that most voters have a climate change litmus test for candidates or even factor climate issues into their voting decisions. On average, citizens have just not perceived a sense of urgency in dealing with climate change. Could it happen? What explains why some citizens do perceive urgency? What explains how a climate change denier comes to accept the climate reality and ultimately elevates the priority of climate change in voting or other political action?
Political scientists who study media and public opinion could also help understand what accounts for the use and effectiveness of political language as it relates to the climate change discussion, much as they do when analyzing political campaign advertisements. For example, why are some forms of activism designed to prevent deforestation, fracking, and other hazardous activities called “ecological terrorism,” while mountaintop removal is not? Who controls the language and dialogue surrounding climate change, is the language evolving over time, and how do changes in language matter for the success or failure of climate action?
Another important question is why policy on climate change is sometimes highly partisan and sometimes not. For mitigation, politicians in the United States seem to divide predictably along party lines, and it is in the more localized and therefore self-serving arena of adaptation that partisanship seems to offer few if any clues about climate policy preferences. Individual politicians such as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie take action to defeat mitigation efforts while simultaneously scrambling to find funds to adapt. Perhaps more puzzling is why policies to address climate change are met with so much more partisanship in the US than elsewhere: Political parties in most of Europe, for example, are not polarized about climate change policy, whether mitigation or adaptation. What explains partisan cooperation and contestation over climate change policy is an important agenda for future research, particularly if the research could offer insights into the fostering of cooperation.
Moving to the international arena, the president pointed out the dilemma of asking developing nations to contribute to mitigation by halting their development –to live without cars, air conditioning, and other amenities to which Americans feel entitled—when the relative contributions of these nations to the climate problem has been very small. They explained that gaining cooperation from developing nations, including emerging economies in areas highly vulnerable to climate change, rests to some extent on the wake-up call of adaptation: As these nations watch their coastlines recede, water supplies diminish, agriculture fail, forests burn, and populations suffer from increased disease and disaster, they may enter into productive partnerships with wealthier nations that can help them reduce vulnerability. Development experts outside of political science are leading the charge in research on climate change policy and development, arguing that the problems are highly intertwined and cannot be studied in isolation. Political scientists could contribute their insights to this growing literature by systematically studying the effects of climate policy (mitigation and/or adaptation) on development and development on climate policy and climate change itself.
The above are just examples of political science research questions relevant to the climate discussion. There are dozens of others involving subfields across the discipline, meaning we are all relevant to the discussion. The time has passed for us to “do something” about climate change. We are at the point where we need to do everything. As scholars, we have a responsibility to contribute whatever our respective specialties allow us to contribute.
The Fallen Roof granaries, constructed more than 800 years ago, still contain a dried corn cob. Maize accounted for roughly 80 percent of the ancestral Pueblo diet. (Juliet Eilperin/The Washington Post)
For centuries, humans have used the red sandstone canyons here as a way to mark their existence.
First came archaic hunter-gatherers who worked in Glen Canyon Linear, a crude geometrical style dating back more than 3,500 years. Then about 2,000 years later, early ancestral Pueblo farmers of the Basketmaker period used more subtle lines to produce a man in headdress. A little more than 700 years ago came their descendants, who used the same kind of hard river stone to make drawings of bighorn sheep and a flute player in the ancient rock.
Now, President Obama is weighing whether and how they can leave their own permanent imprint on history by designating about 2 million acres of land, known as the Bears Ears, as a national monument.
And despite the uniformly acknowledged historical significance of the area, some people regard the conservation efforts by the White House as classic federal overreach. In the current-era conflict between Washington and rural Westerners, the idea of a Bears Ears national monument has produced warnings of a possible armed insurrection.
In a state where the federal government owns 65 percent of the land, many conservatives already resent existing restrictions because they bar development that could generate additional revenue. Out-of-state militias came to San Juan County two years ago, when Commissioner Phil Lyman helped lead an all-terrain-vehicle protest ride through a canyon the Bureau of Land Management had closed to motorized traffic in 2007. Lyman is appealing the 10-day jail sentence they received in connection with the protest, and they argue that their case shows how BLM officials place the priorities of environmentalists over those of local residents.

“I would hope that my fellow Utahans would not use violence, but there are some deeply held positions that cannot just be ignored,” Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, the veteran Republican lawmaker, said in an interview.
Cedar Mesa is one of the best preserved and most archeologically rich sites in the United States. The dry climate and rock overhangs have protected important artifacts for millennia, and there are tens of thousands of ancient objects and structures preserved, including ones in which the original wood beams in cliff dwellings remain intact. In a granary where the Pueblo people kept maize, a single dried cob lies on a dusty floor.
But some lawmakers have suggested that unilateral action by the president, under the 1906 Antiquities Act, could provoke the same sort of resistance that led to the 41-day armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon earlier this year.
“There is a lot of conflict that has escalated into being on the precipice of violence that is unnecessary and unwarranted,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz
(R-Utah), who opposes the designation.
Obama has approached the designation of national monuments as a way to bolster the country's defenses against climate change and as a way to make the national narrative more inclusive, in addition to their obligation to safeguard the country's national treasures.

Looting incidents
In the case of Bears Ears, there is no question that the area is imperiled by the kind of looting and pillaging that first inspired the Antiquities Act, as well as more modern threats, such as ATVs and motorbikes tearing through the desert terrain.
There have been six confirmed looting incidents in the past six months, and at least two dozen over the past five years. In one, a vandal used a rock saw to remove a petroglyph; in one this year someone dug up a pristine ceremonial chamber, or kiva, that had never been professionally excavated. Although the BLM has allocated $400,000 over two years to stabilize 10 archeological sites and trained about 20 people to serve as volunteer “site flight attendants,” it employs just two law enforcement officers to patrol 1.8 million acres.
Without help from Washington, preservationists worry that the looting and destruction will continue. Word of the region's treasures has spread from academics and archaeologists to “pot hunters” and other looters, said Don Simonis, the BLM's archeologist for the area. “For years we've been reluctant to talk about it, but if we don't talk about it, how else can we convince the powers that be that we need protection here, and get the resources we need to protect it?”
But in the Bears Ears region, named for the twin buttes that define the landscape, and surrounding San Juan County there are competing claims to the land and its history. The area has been home over the centuries to Native American tribes, Mormon settlers who reshaped the land in the late 1800s and the energy prospectors, ranchers and thrill-seekers drawn to it today.
All lay claim to pieces of the region's past and all are determined to have a voice in its future.
On May 19, Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert (R) signed a resolution, passed in a special session, specifically opposing a national monument. But even that measure stipulated that the legislature and governor were in favor of “protection and conservation of the Bears Ears area” if done in “a constitutionally sound, locally driven legislative approach.”
Chaffetz and House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) have spent more than three years crafting a lands bill that affects seven counties in eastern Utah, spanning 18 million acres. The process involved extensive deliberations with a wide range of interests—more than 1,200 meetings and more than 120 different groups, according to staffers, as one of Bishop's aides racked up more than 65,000 miles on their Nissan Versa traveling from one meeting to another.
Forces of opposition
The lawmakers may introduce a bill this month, and earlier drafts set aside four times as much land for conservation as for development. But those proposals have drawn sharp criticism from environmentalists and tribal leaders, in part because they give state and local officials greater say over managing federal lands and redefine what activities can take place in protected areas.
Scott Groene, executive director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, has dubbed the plan the “Plundered Lands Initiative.” They said it “gives away vast amounts of public land, sacrifices landscapes to energy development, rolls back existing protection and fails to protect the Bears Ears.”
And a coalition of tribal groups — including representatives from the Hopi, Navajo, Uintah and Ouray Ute, Ute Mountain Ute and Pueblo of Zuni — abandoned what had been fitful negotiations with Utah Republicans in December, saying they were not given a proper voice in shaping the deal. Leaders of the tribes, some of which had warred against each other in the past, said they have found a common cause because of their spiritual and historical connection to the area.
“We put aside the sense of who came here first and who came here last,” said Carleton Bowekaty, a Pueblo of Zuni councilman. “We're not confined by reservation lines. We're not confined by state lines.”
A nonprofit Navajo group started pressing for federal protection six years ago, but tribal leaders say the state's current members of Congress haven't given them as much say as the late Sen. Robert Bennett (R-Utah), who started the talks. Kenneth Maryboy, who at the time served as one of San Juan County's three commissioners, attended a listening session with the two lawmakers and members of the community where one rancher openly scoffed at the idea of recognizing tribal claims.
“The damn Indians don't need another reservation,” Maryboy recalled the rancher saying.
One prominent Navajo backs the congressional approach. Rebecca Benally, a Democrat who defeated Maryboy and sits on the county commission, argues that the federal government cannot be trusted to properly manage a monument.
[Retelling the American narrative with national monument designations]
Feelings are so brittle here that one Utah conservationist, Black Diamond Equipment chief executive Peter Metcalf, remarked in an interview that it embodies William Faulkner's famous phrase: “The past is never dead. It's not even past.”
Lyman, a critic of both the national monument proposal and the lawmakers' broader lands bill, lives in Blanding, the town their great-grandfather helped found a century ago. Walter C. Lyman and other Mormon pioneers came from southwestern Utah in the arduous, six-month Hole-in-the-Rock expedition and first established the town of Bluff, which abuts the proposed monument designation. After repeated flooding ruined the settlers' crops, Lyman managed to bring water onto White Mesa, about 25 miles away, and most of the settlers relocated.
When Lyman discusses their disputes with federal officials, environmentalists and some Navajo activists, they cite historic markers such as the 1865 law Abraham Lincoln gave Utahans, granting the right-of-way to build roads, and a 1933 agreement county leaders forged with the Navajos that gave them 500,00 acres south of the San Juan River, which is now part of a reservation that spans multiple states.
“The whole purpose of it was to create certainty: This is yours and this is ours,” they said. “It was supposed to have settled this.”
At this point, Native Americans — mostly Navajos and some Utes — make up 46 percent of San Juan County's population. The county's unemployment rate is more than double the state average, and about a quarter of county residents receive food stamps and medical assistance.
And the fossil fuel and mineral extraction that once drove the local economy have dwindled: The last time a rig drilled a hole in the county was February 2014, according to the oil service company Baker Hughes.
Helpful or hazardous?
Some argue that a monument designation could prove to be an economic asset to the region, in the same way tourism increased at Utah's Grand Staircase-
Escalante National Monument after Bill Clinton designated it in 1996, as well as other sites that received similar presidential recognition.
Friends of Cedar Mesa Executive Director Josh Ewing, who has sought to broker a legislative compromise, noted that Utah's “Mighty Five” advertising blitz touts four national parks that were initially protected under the Antiquities Act.
Last week Herbert and Hatch held an event at one of those well-known sites, Natural Bridges National Monument, to reiterate their opposition to another presidential designation in the state.
“It's the sort of thing that will die down quickly,” said Ewing, an avid rock climber who regularly scales the area's canyons and cliffs.
Still, Hatch was concerned enough that they warned Interior Secretary Sally Jewell in a private meeting in their office on March 8 that a repeat of what Clinton did 20 years ago could prompt an armed confrontation.
Obama was briefed on the conversation with Hatch, according to several individuals, and instructed their aides to continue exploring the possibility of designating a monument. Jewell plans to visit the area this summer, and no final decision has been made.
But Obama pledged in November that their administration would “review tribal proposals to permanently protect sacred lands for future generations.” Those who have spoken to them about it, including presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, say Obama “keenly wants to do some things [recognizing] Native American culture,” and the proposal meets that test.
Natural Resources Defense Council President Rhea Suh, who served as one of the Interior Department's top officials before switching jobs about 18 months ago, said that when it comes to such monuments, “You usually wait for the harder ones for the last moment . . . and the window is closing for permanent protection of some of the grandest landscapes, I think, in the entire United States.”
Jonah Yellowman, who was forced at age 6 to attend a boarding school in New Mexico where they were physically punished for speaking their native language, is waiting for that sort of recognition. Yellowman walks easily along the landscape, pointing out where they collect firewood and the plants Navajos use to camouflage their faces in one ritual and scent sweat lodges in another.
Both Anglo and Navajo politicians have disappointed them before — Yellowman doesn't have running water or electricity at their remote home near Monument Valley, where iconic Westerns were filmed decades ago. They think the tribes have started a movement that can succeed.
“My people, they start something and it doesn't go anywhere,” they said. “You can tell that this is different. This one, there's hope.”
