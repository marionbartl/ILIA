The new leader of the Indian Health Service vowed to do "whatever it takes" to prevent more facilities in the troubled Great Plains Area from losing certification.
Appearing for the first time on Capitol Hill as the acting director of the beleaguered agency, Mary Smith said the IHS is working closely with the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Service on a "systems improvement agreement" for the Rosebud Hospital on the Rosebud Sioux Reservation . If an agreement can be reached before the end of April, they said the facility will not lose its certification.
"We are heartened that they are at least talking to us and working with us on this agreement," Smith told Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies on Wednesday morning.
An agreement would prevent another black mark on the Great Plains Area, where the Winnebago Service Unit , which serves the Omaha Tribe and the Winnebago Tribe in Nebraska, already lost CMS certification. The IHS is no longer able to bill Medicare for services at the facility and Medicaid and other third-party sources of funding have been impacted as a result.

A third facility -- the Pine Ridge Service Unit , which serves the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota -- also has been threatened. There was mixed good news on that front -- Smith said the hospital has successfully resolved one CMS notice but the emergency room is still awaiting evaluation.
"We are committed to doing whatever it takes to ensure that these hospitals are providing quality care," testified Smith, a member of the Cherokee Nation who was named the principal deputy director at the IHS just last week.
Despite the promise of improvement, lawmakers were worried about the underlying and long-running problems in the Great Plains. The agency, for example, was warned a year in advance of the CMS termination at Winnebago but did not take enough actions to prevent the loss of certification, which came last July.
"You don't get these notices unless there's been a long build up," said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the chair of the subcommittee. "What the long build up means is that these people have been left behind."
"Again, it is just not acceptable," Murkowski said.

Other regions also have been affected by lapses. Sen. Tom Udall (D-New Mexico), the top Democrat on the panel, noted that the emergency room at the Crownpoint Health Care Facility on the New Mexico portion of the Navajo Nation was placed under "diversion" -- a term the IHS uses for a temporary or extended closure -- for one month last summer.
"I think there are systemic problems, not just at those hospitals, but throughout our system," Smith admitted.
As for the Rosebud Hospital, CMS was planning to terminate certification on March 16. The agency cited violations in at least 7 categories, including those affecting medical staff, nursing services and emergency services, according to a letter posted by The Sioux Falls Argus Leader
Smith said the IHS secured an extension until May 16. In order to meet that deadline and avoid a cutoff, the agency needs to finalize the "systems improvement agreement" by April 29, they told the subcommittee.
"We are committed to doing whatever it takes," Smith reiterated. "I think that is our top priority at the agency."

The substandard quality of care at the Rosebud Hospital was the subject of discussion at a Senate Indian Affairs Committee hearing on February 3. A pregnant woman was left unattended and was forced to deliver their baby, prematurely, on the floor, lawmakers said. It was the second incident of its kind at the facility in recent years.
"What has to be acknowledged here is that ... people's lives are in jeopardy," Sen. John Thune (R-South Dakota) said at that hearing. "This is unacceptable. We cannot tolerate this."
The IHS replaced the director of the Great Plains Area just days before the hearing. Tribal leaders questioned the last-minute decision, which they said was made without consulting them.
"Was it because this hearing was going to happen and IHS didn't want them to testify?" Harold Frazier, the chairperson of Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe , said at listening session following the hearing. "That's a question that Congress should ask IHS. Why was they transferred? Was an evaluation done on their performance?"

As for Smith, they were named principal deputy director and acting director last Tuesday. They replaced Robert McSwain , a member of the North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians , in that role. They continue to serve in another capacity at IHS, where they have worked since 1976.
Smith, an attorney, only joined the IHS last October after working for the Department of Insurance in Illinois , their home state. They previously served as a political appointee at the Department of Justice from 2009 to 2011 and was once nominated for top position there but was never confirmed by the Senate

consortium of banks +
Vijay Mallya +
NEW DELHI: Aincluding SBI on Monday told the Supreme Court that beleaguered business personhad deliberately not made full disclosure of their assets including $40 million which they received in February from a British firm.Attorney general Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the consortium of banks, told a bench of justices Kurian Joseph and RF Nariman that Mallya has not disclosed the amount which they received in February while they had filed the reply in March.The attorney general said that as per the Supreme Court rules, Mallya has to appear before the court after a notice has been served upon them in a contempt petition.Rohatgi said that since Mallya had not been granted exemption from appearance, they should not be heard anymore.Senior advocate CS Vaidyanathan, appearing for Mallya, told the bench that they have filed a petition for recall of apex court's earlier order and said that no contempt has been made.He also said that the apex court's earlier order to disclose the assets has been complied with.The bench then asked the attorney general to file a response to Mallya's petition for recall of its earlier order and posted the matter on September 27.Earlier, on July 25, the apex court had issued notice to Mallya on plea of consortium of banks which alleged that they had not disclosed their full assets including $40 million received by them from a British firm.The apex court, after noting the submissions by attorney general, had issued notice to Mallya and asked them to respond.On July 14, Rohatgi claimed that Mallya had provided wrong details of their assets in a sealed cover to the apex court.He further said a lot of information had also been concealed, including a cash transaction to the tune of Rs 2500 crore, which amounted to contempt of court.Earlier, the Supreme Court had sought details of assets from Mallya in a sealed cover.Recently, the consortium of banks had alleged that Mallya was not cooperating in the investigation of cases against them and was averse to disclosing their foreign assets.In a rejoinder affidavit to Mallya's reply, the banks had said that disclosure of overseas assets by them and their family was significant for recovering the dues.Rohatgi had earlier said that the beleaguered business person has also not agreed to deposit "substantial amount" as part of of Rs 9,400 crore loan due on them to establish their bonafide".Mallya had said the banks had no right over information regarding their overseas movable and immovable assets as they were an NRI since 1988.He had also claimed that as an NRI, they were not obliged to disclose their overseas assets, and added that their wife and three children, all US citizens, also need not disclose their assets.The court on April 7 had directed Mallya to disclose by April 21 the total assets owned by them and their family in India and abroad while seeking an indication from them when they would appear before it.It had asked Mallya, who owes over Rs 9,000 crore to around 17 banks, to deposit a "substantial amount" with it to "prove their bonafide" that they were "serious" about meaningful negotiations and settlement.
Did you know Obsidian originally wanted three playable races in Fallout: New Vegas? This is the part literally crossed out - struck through and coloured red - on the Fallout 3.5 treatment Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart showed me at the studio.
"Originally we had this idea where the player would be able to choose between three races: human, ghoul and super mutant," they said. "It was just the engine...
"It really had to do with how all the weapons and armour worked. Trying to have them all work with ghouls and super mutants was just going to be - [Bethesda] felt like it was going to be a nightmare. It wasn't like they said no but it was a very strongly worded, 'We would really suggest that you not try to do that.'"
Obsidian and Bethesda began talking about Fallout in 2008/2009, when Aliens: Crucible and Alpha Protocol were both still alive. Aliens: Crucible would soon get the chop. "[Bethesda] was still pitching it internally so it was literally just an idea at the time," said Urquhart. "We knew from the start it was not going to be Fallout 4 - that was the internal team's."
"It was always intended to be essentially a gigantic expansion," added Obsidian co-owner Chris Parker.
"It was meant to be not the sequel," continued Urquhart. "It was meant to be an offshoot project. But we were actually worried about that, about people thinking of it as just a big expansion." Obsidian considered it to be more like Grand Theft Auto: Vice City or GTA: San Andreas, which were Grand Theft Auto 3 offshoots but full games in their own right.
Understandably, given the studio's deep roots in Black Isle - the original creator of Fallout - excitement for the project was sky high. "I didn't leave Black Isle because I wanted to make another Fallout," said Urquhart. "I love making Fallout. I was lead designer on Fallout 2. I'm not in any way instrumental in the creation of the SPECIAL system but I absolutely participated in the creation of it."
As Bethesda Game Studios had dibs on the East Coast of America, Obsidian took the West. "Someone threw up New Reno as one of the crazy things we did and then we saw Vegas and," shrugged Urquhart, "we just went with it. From there it was like the '50s had the Rat Pack, then someone threw out the idea there was the scene in Goodfellas where you get taken out into the desert and whacked and thrown into a grave, and it is all kind of turned that way."
Bethesda didn't need much convincing, given the history of Obsidian/Black Isle, so only a short proposal was written. "We put together a very short pitch, probably three pages," they said. "The first time we pitched it we pitched it as Fallout: Sin City. Very quickly it got changed to Fallout: Vegas and then became Fallout: New Vegas."
Obsidian's Fallout: New Vegas would go on to become, without a doubt, the studio's most famous game, of that Parker and Urquhart are unanimous. Fallout: New Vegas is also considered by many to be a better game than Bethesda's own Fallout 3.
But months after release, Fallout: New Vegas would be remembered for something else: coming agonisingly close to - but not reaching - the 85 per cent Metacritic mark Bethesda stipulated for Obsidian's bonus. The game scored 84.
"It was so much after - it all came out the day after we had laid everybody off for Stormlands [the cancelled Xbox One exclusive]," said Urquhart. "That was the day."
"And what can you say?" added Parker. "You can't get mad at somebody for a contract you signed. We signed a contract, it had very clear terms in it. 'Oh we were really close...' We didn't hit it."
"Also," said Urquhart, "we didn't put those terms in there. [Bethesda] added that bonus - we didn't ask for the bonus. We just pretty much ignored it. As an independent developer, any of those Metacritic-type bonuses you just ignore.
"You don't control testing, you don't control promotion, you don't control when the game ships. There are a whole lot of things you don't control. That is in no way - and it's really important for me to say this - an excuse.
"It is more when publishers try to change financial terms based upon things like Metacritic scores we say, 'Look you have as much of an effect over those...' You could ship the same game in the same way with two different publishers and the Metacritic would be different."
But, they concluded, "It was in the contract, it was what it said. We didn't put it in there and we signed it. I wasn't crying over it by any stretch of the imagination."

MUMBAI: In a significant ruling, a three-judge bench of the Bombay high court on Wednesday held that in India, criticism of any religion -- be it Islam, Hinduism, Christianity or any other -- is permissible under the fundamental right to freedom of speech and that a book cannot be banned on those grounds alone.However, the criticism must be bona fide or academic, said the court, as it upheld a ban issued in 2007 by the Maharashtra government on a book titled `Islam - A Concept of Political World Invasion by Muslims.' The book contained was an "aggravated form of criticism made with a malicious and deliberate intention" to outrage the feelings of Muslims, the court said.Delivering the landmark verdict on Wednesday, the court has in a rare instance upheld the state's ban on a book but at the same time brought joy to civil rights activists when it held that, "in our country, everything is open to criticism and religion is no exception. Freedom of expression covers criticism of religion and no person can be sensitive about it."The bench, comprising Justices Ranjana Desai, D Y Chandrachud and R S Mohite, said, "Healthy criticism provokes thought, encourages debate and helps us evolve. But criticism cannot be malicious and must not lead to creating ill-will between different communities... (it) must lead to sensible dialogue." The courts must strike a balance between the guaranteed freedom and permissible restrictions, "a difficult task", as the 150-page HC verdict penned by Justice Desai observed.The book, authored by R V Bhasin, a Mumbai-based advocate, in 2003 had been in circulation for four years before the state felt the need to ban it for "several derogatory and false statements about Muslim religion, the community, Mohammed Paigambar and Muslim priests". Bhasin later told TOI that they would go to the Supreme Court in appeal. "Freedom of speech cannot be blocked on interpretation," they said.Bhasin challenged the ban the same year and their counsel J P Cama argued at length that freedom of speech and expression has to be protected and unless a book gives rise immediately to a present and sudden danger of disrupting communal or societal peace, its ban cannot be justified. They said the author placed certain lesser-known aspects about Islam before the people and said, "Assuming they are wrong, they have a right to be wrong."But justifying the state's ban was advocate general Ravi Kadam and later Yusuf Muchala, the counsel for a few intervenors, including Indian Union Muslim League, Maharashtra Muslim Lawyers Forum, Islamic Research Foundation, Jamat-e-Islami-e-Hind and Bombay Aman Committee. One intervenor, I G Khandelwal, from Right to Read Foundation, supported the author.The bench had reserved the matter for judgment last August after a lengthy hearing. The court said, "The author can say what they feel is right and if it is wrong, they cannot be punished for it. But what needs to be seen is whether it was done bona fide with real desire to explore the tenets of Islam and give their exposition,"In this case, the court held that the criticism of Islam and "insulting comments with particular reference to Indian Muslims" were "not academic". "It is an aggravated form of criticism made with a malicious and deliberate intention to outrage the religious feelings of Muslims. The contents are so interwoven that it is not possible to excise certain portions and permit circulation of the book," the court said. The author had declined an earlier suggestion to delete certain parts.A person may have a right to say a particular religion is "not secular", said the HC, but it cautioned against rabid contents "reeking of hatred for a particular community" and "malafide exercise to stir communal passions".The HC also found "totally unacceptable" the author's argument that banning the book in the age of the internet is passe and pointless.The book contains "highly objectionable and disturbing" statements about the author's wishful thinking of an impending war between Muslims and others and how Indian Muslims want to convert all Hindus, attack temples and Hindu women. Statements like these are "likely to incite people to violence and may promote violence, enmity or hatred".
Nicklas Bendtner spent nine years at Arsenal scoring 24 goals.
Former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner is being lined up for a return to England with Queens Park Rangers, sources close to the club have told ESPN FC.
Bendtner, 28, is a free agent after being released by Wolfsburg in April when they had over a year to run on their contract.
QPR boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is keen to bolster their side's attacking options and they see Bendtner's experience and talents as adding something to their squad.
The Denmark international moved to Germany in the summer of 2014 after their contract at Arsenal expired. Bendtner made over 100 appearances during their nine years with the Gunners, scoring 24 goals.
While with Arsenal, Bendtner had three spells out on loan with Birmingham, Sunderland and Juventus as they struggled to hold down a regular place in Arsene Wenger's side.
QPR are ready to give Bendtner the chance to get their career back on track in England by offering them a move to Loftus Road.
Rangers have made a comfortable start to the season, winning two of their opening four Championship fixtures.
Offer of ‘full crucifixion experience for £750' to raise money for passion play led to concerns it was blasphemous and unsafe
A fundraising plan to hold a mock crucifixion of members of the public in Manchester city centre has been cancelled after Church of England clergy raised concerns it was blasphemous and unsafe.
Organisers of the Manchester Passion Play, which will tell the story of Christ's crucifixion in the city's Cathedral Gardens on Saturday, offered “the full crucifixion experience” for £750.
The offer, posted on the Manchester Passion 2017 Crowdfunder site, was removed after members of the play's organising committee, which includes C of E clergy, expressed concerns it was potentially dangerous and blasphemous.
Reverend Falak Sher, a canon at Manchester Cathedral and chairperson of the organising committee, said they vetoed the idea when it came to light.
They said: “When I saw it I did not like it, I thought it was disgraceful. The whole message of the cross is hope and love. When I saw this I was not very happy and asked the committee to take this one down.
“We didn't like promoting the event in this way for £750. I thought it was not a very positive message when dealing with a message of love and hope.”
Alexander Stewart-Clark, a volunteer who serves as a managing trustee of the Passion Trust, which helps groups organise passion plays, said they took full responsibility for what they described as an insensitive idea.
Stewart-Clark, who runs a business importing timber, said that the event had grown since it was first conceived to include a cast of 120, and 80 flight attendants. “The whole thing just got bigger and bigger and, of course, with that comes the infrastructure cost,” they said.
“Instead of being a £20,000 play it became a £55,000 play and the burden on raising money then falls on us. We were trying to think up some ideas, just bouncing around what would be good, and someone came up with the idea of letting people be crucified for £750.”
Stewart-Clark said that they did not think the idea was blasphemous, but that it was on “the grey line” and tasteless. “You have clergy wanting to play it safe and business people like me trying to raise the funding,” said Stewart-Clark. “There was a difference of opinion and what was a small disagreement has got out of all proportion.”
Stewart-Clark said that their timber is used to make the mock crucifixes, which have a pedestal for people to stand on and pieces of rope on either side of the cross bar to hold on to. They said that they had never known anyone to fall off such a cross.
Had the plan gone ahead the mock crucifixions would have taken place on Friday, while the stage for the performance was being built. “If people had wanted to do it they would have been hoisted up there for a couple of minutes,” they said. “It was just a sort of gimmick, but it was tasteless.
“If you are put up on a cross it is not to take the place of Jesus or God. It is to empathise with them because it's not very comfortable and it's a public disgrace. A crucifixion is a humiliating public execution.”
The committee has so far raised about £45,000 to stage the play and is aiming to raise another £5,000. Stewart-Clark said there were plenty of other bad fundraising ideas that were scrapped, including charging people a fee to sit next to the bishop to watch the play.
A Syrian man witnessed their own funeral after pulling themselves out from a mountain of rubble where they had survived for 36 hours.
It was believed that Mohammed Rayhan was among 117 people who had died when government forces shelled the marketplace in Douma, just over six miles north east of Damascus. Their family had given up all hope when they failed to return home and started mourning Mr Rayhan's death.
However after three days beneath the rubble they were extricated by rescuers.
With the dust still embedded in their beard and long hair, they returned home.
In doing so they interrupted the final day of mourning, much to the delight of their family.
Pictures of their ecstatic relatives were posted on a Facebook page run by they Eastern Ghouta branch of the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a group of opposition activists.
Mr Rayhan is s now being called the “Living Martyr” after their miraculous survival.
"Lots of people go missing, get lost in rubble, and only turn up later.
However the story is not unique, according to Rami Abdurrahman, director of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
"It often happens with children - I have heard of three-year-old children who have been mourned by their families and then found alive in rubble."
Jessica Williams just went HAM on Beyoncé's haters.
Following a day of predictable yet nonetheless depressing conservative backlash to Beyoncé's #BlackLivesMatter-inspired Super Bowl halftime performance, The Daily Show's Senior Beyoncé Correspondent began by praising the brand-new music video for “Formation.”
“She calls out police brutality and the constant fear black people have of the police. They even threw back to Hurricane Katrina,” Williams noted. On the halftime show, they added, “It really was an amazing show, but not everyone was ready for that jelly.”
From there, Williams showed the greatest hits of the Beyoncé criticism on Fox News, including Stuart Varney's question, “Why is race brought into the halftime show at a Super Bowl game?”
“Race was brought in because Beyoncé was brought in and, brace yourself, you might want to sit down for this, but Beyoncé is...black!” Williams said. “And as a black person, you walk around every day constantly reminded that you are black. We're more likely to get paid less, more likely to get sent to prison and more likely to win a dance competition. What? It's not all bad.”
“The point is, Beyoncé is black and this song is their message,” they continued. “That's what artists do. Their message is in their music.”
What pissed off Williams more than anything else was Rudy Giuliani's assertion that Beyoncé's message was not suitable for a “middle American” audience. “Are you saying you can't talk about race issues to middle America?” they asked. “What are they, so delicate and unaware and maybe so white that Beyoncé is too much for them?”
“You know what's in the middle of middle America? Ferguson, Missouri!” they exclaimed. “But you're right, you know what? The fans deserve wholesome entertainment. Like watching 300-pound men give each other concussions while the crowd cheers like we're extras in Gladiator?”
“So what is wrong with Beyoncé, everyone?” Williams wanted to know. “Were you not entertained?”
If she'd been holding a mic, they would have dropped it.
Back in 2012, Janez Brajkovič began their second stint at Astana with a bang, nabbing a stage win in the Volta a Catalunya and Top 10s in the Tour de Romandie and Critérium du Dauphiné before picking up an overall win in the Tour de Slovénie and then taking one the biggest results of their career, 9th overall in the Tour de France. It was a big year for the Slovenian all-rounder, 28 years old at the time, but in the two seasons that followed, Brajkovič spent more and more time playing a support role for the Kazakh outfit, as the likes of Vincenzo Nibali and Fabio Aru rose to the fore within the team.
At the end of the 2014 season, with their Astana contract expiring, Brajkovič found themselves back on the open market, but they were not without a plan. Having spent a good part of their career riding for American teams, they were hoping to return to that familiar atmosphere, and, as it turned out, there was an American team looking to add a few major talents with high-level racing experience to its roster. Brajkovič signed a two-year deal with UnitedHealthcare in October, and with the agreement in place, the team suddenly found itself with a veteran GC rider for the stage races on its calendar, and Brajkovič suddenly found themselves back in a leadership role. It didn't take long for them to get comfortable with their new surroundings.
“I think I settled in already in December,” Brajkovič told VeloHuman. “It's just the right fit for me. I get along with everybody. The way I think and others think are pretty much the same. We're a good group of guys, and also the staff and the management, they're so awesome. I feel really happy to be here. Happy to be here on this team, and I think this team will continue to grow, and I'll be a part of this team growing, and hopefully in a year or two we'll be on a higher level, racing ProTour, with the best teams in the world.”
Currently at the Pro Continental level, UnitedHealthcare made a concerted effort over the offseason to add firepower to the roster, bringing in Brajkovič as well as versatile Italians Marco Canola and Daniele Ratto, from Bardiani-CSF and Cannondale, respectively. For Brajkovič, the opportunity for a fresh start on a team with similar values was a major draw.
“I know for myself, last year in August, it was pretty clear I was not going to stay at Astana, and what I wanted was to sign for an American team. . . . Actually I wanted to sign with UnitedHealthcare, that was the team I thought would be the best for me, just to go back and start all over again, and I think it was a good choice, and I'm happy here,” Brajkovič said. “I'm happy to be racing again, and that's one of the most important things for myself because even if you have good condition, coming to the race and being depressed is not going to get you results.”
An English-language environment played a significant role in giving Brajkovič an immediate morale boost after a few difficult years at Astana.
“Obviously in Astana there was a language barrier. And this American mentality suits me very well. Spending a lot of time in America is also something I like and so far it's been great,” they said.
Their preparation for the major goals of 2015 is coming around now, but the offseason wasn't perfect for Brajkovič.
“Actually . . . it was a pretty hard offseason. The weather was pretty bad all the time [in Slovenia where they spent time in December]. Training hasn't been as I would like it to be, but the training I've done, I'm pretty happy with the result. I know that there are a lot of reserves still, and once I start training seriously for Tour of California, and also I think Critérium [International] is a pretty important race for us, I think there's going to be a lot of improvement as well,” they said.
Decent climbing results in the Tour de San Luis would suggest that their form is trending in the right direction, and Brajkovič is hoping that he'll be closer to their peak by the time the asupervisorstioned Critérium International and Tour of California arrive. The 2.HC events are major objectives for the American squad this season. Having brought on a few big European names over the winter, there was hope among the team that an invite to this year's Giro d'Italia might be possible as well, but the race organizers opted to look elsewhere for wildcard invites. While it wasn't an ideal turn of events, Brajkovič notes that UHC will have their hands full as it is.
“For UnitedHealthcare it's pretty important to have a result in the Tour of California as well. And yeah, it would be nice to race the Giro but then for the Giro you have to have a team, and that would leave Tour of California with . . . I wouldn't say bad riders, but probably not the best possible combination of riders, not the best team. So I think we just have to focus on Tour of California and race well there. I think that's the goal for now, and hopefully we'll get a Vuelta invitation,” they explained.
The USA Pro Challenge and the Tour of Utah are also in Brajkovič's sights this season, though they are hoping to lead the team in Spain if a wildcard invite to the Vuelta is indeed in the cards, a possibility that will be more likely if the team can deliver results in stage races in the spring and early summer. For the one-week races in particular, podium performances are both the aim and also the expectation for Brajkovič. And although they have only one GC Top 10 result in their palmares over the last two seasons (he was 3rd in the 2014 Vuelta a Burgos), they remain confident that they still possess the all-rounder skillset necessary to compete as a featured rider at the highest level in the major stage races on the UnitedHealthcare calendar.
“I still think—actually, I know—that I can race for GC, and that's the focus. For me, and for the team as well,” they said.
After spending some time playing a support role with Astana, one might expect Brajkovič to feel a bit nervous about carrying the weight of their own and the team's hopes for the season, but they aren't showing any signs of that right now, with the positive outlook from joining a new, more comfortable environment taking some of the stress out of their return to the role of team GC leader.
“I don't feel like a team leader,” Brajkovič said. “We're like a bunch of guys who get along really well. And yeah, they help me a lot, and it's amazing to see what they do for me, how much energy they spend for me, so I'm really grateful for that. And pretty soon, I think, we'll start getting those results we need. But I don't feel any pressure. Of course there are expectations but I think if I stay healthy and everything goes to plan, we'll have results as well, so there's nothing to be worried about.”

For a philosopher who claims to eschew the carnivalesque, Slavoj Žižek creates quite a circus wherever they go. After their concluding remarks as host of a recent conference in New York called Communism: A New Beginning?, the Marxist thinker, whose marriage of pop culture and theory has made them possibly the most famous Slovenian ever, was immediately mobbed by admirers. Like a rock star, they headed for the back door, leading me through a meandering underground passageway before we emerged to the streets of Manhattan. As we made our way to a nearby café, they collected a new entourage around them — mostly autograph-seekers and undergraduate fanboys grilling them for term-paper advice. They obliged the autograph-hunters, asked that aspiring intellectuals email them with specific questions, and initially insulted a man who wanted a photograph, saying “One idiot more!” The man withdrew their request with polite apologies, and a strange tug of war ensued as Žižek then insisted on being photographed.
Žižek seems to thrive on contradiction. As we spoke, they veered from one stream of thought to another in their famously thick accent. Although they claimed at one point to prefer solitude, they delighted in making attention-drawing remarks — proclaiming with impish glee, for example, that Gandhi was technically more violent than Hitler, or advising me to tell panhandlers, “Yes I have some change. Fuck off!”
The week before, they had spoken at Occupy Wall Street, where they championed the movement and told a cheering crowd, “We are not dreamers. We are the awakening from a dream that is turning into a nightmare.” When we reached the café, I asked them about the experience, the prospects for the Occupy movement, and the new beginning they were pondering for communism:
1. When you visited Zuccotti Park, what did you think of the Occupy Wall Street protesters? What are they doing right, and what are they doing wrong?
It's difficult to answer this question because I was tired, I had to work a lot, so I literally came there three minutes before I did it. I instantly disappeared. You know, this may be part of my character, but that's how I function. There is a certain cliché about communists or radicals. They usually say, you like humanity in abstract, but you don't like concrete people. You are even ready to kill them for humanity. Okay, fuck it. If this is it, then I am definitely a totalitarian. I like humanity, maybe great works of art, but the majority of the people I don't like. I like to be alone. For example, you have seen it today, how my first reaction was just to disappear. I like so much to be alone. I just have a couple of friends.
So again also for theoretical reasons, I don't think that mingling with them, whatever, would have brought any special, deep insight. I would probably have heard just these stupidities — “We want justice, ooh, one percent has so much money, blah blah blah.”
I do [sense] a readiness to question the fundamentals of the system. Even with radical liberal leftists, it was [formerly] within the existing system: less racism, more freedom to women, abortion, divorce. The basic insight I see is that clearly for the first time, the underlying perception there is a flaw in the system as such. It's not just the question of making the system better.
2. The title of the conference you've just hosted is “Communism: A New Beginning?” I wonder if communism isn't a devalued brand. Why not find a new word for it?
I'm well aware of this. The PR, public relations problem. Many friends are telling me, “Listen, we agree with everything, but why use this terrible term, which has such a horrifying connotation — gulag, whatever, no?” My reason is that, first, in the radical tradition, millenarian movements [were] egalitarian revolts, and I would like to keep fidelity to that tradition.
My second reason is that it's still the best among the least worst. The least bad. Because all others concede too much to hegemonic field. You say socialism? Socialism is harmless. Everybody today is a socialist, you know? It just needs some vague solidarity. It doesn't have this more radical egalitarianism. Every fascist can be said to be socialist, you know. Democracy, my god. Everyone refers to that word. It's meaningless. Justice, fuck it. Which justice?
And the last, paradoxical reason. Yes, horrible things were done in the name of communism, but it's good to have a name to remind you of that. It's good to be aware of the dangers. I claim that with all the anticommunism, we don't really even have a good theory of how this mega-catastrophe called Stalinism could have happened. What went wrong? I don't like those easy philosophical generalizations in the style of Karl Popper, who's a Plato-totalitarian-whatever, and then Rousseau or whoever. My problem with liberal anticommunist historians is that if anything they are not critical enough [of the] Stalinist regime. Their explanation is typically liberal. They reduce it to bad people who wanted money, power, whatever.
Did you see the film that I always mention? The German one who got Oscar? Life of Others? Not severe enough, I claim. We have a bad minister who wants to have the wife of the writer, so they [gets] the Stasi to follow the writer, to get something from them to get rid of them to have fully the wife. But this still reduces Communist terror surveillance to a single bad guy with some private pathology, as if beneath every evil here is some evil person who wants money, power, sex, whatever. What the film doesn't confront is that even if there were no corrupted ministers, even if all Stasi agents were relatively honest, we would have exactly the same observation, control, and so on. Because the horror of Communism, Stalinism, is not that bad people do bad things — they always do. It's that good people do horrible things thinking they are doing something great.
Robert Conquest, [Simon Sebag] Montefiore, they try to emphasize how Stalin was bad, that one was bad, that one was bad. That's too simple. The system was such that even good people break down. [The most tragic example] is, when Stalin ordered forced collectivization, late twenties, thousands of honest communists volunteered to go to the countryside and convince farmers to join, and it turned very violent, shooting. This is true tragedy, I think.
So no, my problem is that we don't even have a good critique of communism.
3. You wrote that the only surprising thing about the 2008 financial meltdown is that it was considered a surprise. Why do you think these warnings and protests keep failing?
This is proof of how ideology is a lie. I don't always agree with him, but the Nobel Prize guy, Paul Krugman, I quote him. They made a very intelligent comment. A journalist asked him, “Now that we know, Paul, the mistakes that we were doing before, allowing banks these crazy credit schemes, do you think if we were to know all this twenty, thirty years ago that we would have done it in a different way?” They said, “No, exactly the same. It wouldn't have mattered.”
That's a very deep insight, you know? This is the power of ideology. You may know it, but you don't take it seriously. You nonetheless act in that way. I'm very much a pessimist here. I really believe in the material deficiency of ideology.
4. Why do you think people are unable to transcend ideology and effect change?
Here I have a very traditional Marxist answer. Ideology is not only ideas. Ideology is something which structures our daily practices. Ideology is not that you think money is something mystical; ideology is in how you deal with money everyday. Legal ideology is that even if you don't trust the legal, you use it, you rely on it. In the Wittgensteinian sense, it's a form of life. I even develop often that today in our cynical times, for an ideology to function, it doesn't matter if you believe in it or not. In a way, you have not to take it too seriously.
This is of course maybe my own weird experience because when I was young in Communist Yugoslavia, we had an extreme form of this. I witnessed how the regime experienced as the greatest threat when people took the regime's own ideology too seriously.
5. You were critical of some of the slogans used by protesters in 2008 — “Save Main Street, Not Wall Street” for example. During Occupy Wall Street, people say, “Banks got bailed out, we got sold out.” Is there a better slogan to be had?
The problem is that if you mobilize against the bad financial system you fall into a certain ideological trap, the fascist trap. This is the basic fascist idea: we have the truly productive strata — workers, industrial capitalists — and then we have the bad Jewish bankers who exploit them. The problem is not to fight Wall Street. The problem is, why does the system need Wall Street to function? I totally understand Obama and all of those in 2008 who, although they knew all the manipulations that the banks did, they nonetheless voted for the first mega-sum of $750 billion. If Wall Street collapses, then Main Street collapses. That's how the system works.
6. So what should the protesters be asking for?
Just two things. On the one hand, at this point more important than asking is to think, to organize, to lay down the foundations for some kind of network so that this will not just be a kind of magic explosion that disappears. And point two, the way to start to think about doing something is to select some very specific issues — the model should be the health-care bill — which in a way are very realistic.
It's often terrifying to read right-wing Republican attacks on Obama's health-care reform. It was watered down through clear material force of ideology. Nonetheless, I like the debate because it showed us how our notion of freedom is totally penetrated, controlled by a certain ideology.
One of the strategies [for doing] something concrete is to pick very carefully issues for which you fight, and then try to organize a popular movement. Which have two features: First, they are realistic. But at the same time, [they have] dramatic points which are extremely penetrated by ideology. So things which are absolutely possible but are unacceptable for ideology frame — like healthcare, universal healthcare — this is, I think, maybe the thing to do at this point, apart from laying the foundations, getting ready.
Even with banks — okay this is not [a recommendation] for the people, it's for the system — the irony is that those countries where the state controls the movement of money in the banks can do very well in capitalist terms. Look at China, Singapore, and so on. There, money transfers, especially international transfers, are all tightly controlled by the banks. I remember how when they started to play this game twenty years around ago, I remember The Economist said, “This is suicide, it will be a catastrophe.” It wasn't. The result is that in the 2008 crisis, 2009 crisis, Singapore had record growth of 15 percent. China, India, and so on. Okay, things are more complex here, because they have different conditions, but nonetheless you can see how countries which have a more flexible approach towards state intervention are doing very well.
One of the good results of this crisis is that neo-liberalism, for reasonable people, is dead. We are becoming aware not only that it doesn't work but that, let's be clear, there never even was neoliberalism. Like, what neoliberalism? Already with Reagan, Bush, the state is growing stronger and stronger, intervening all the time. I really think it's a total misperception that we live in some kind of wild capitalist neoliberal universe. No.
I think this is the first thing maybe that we should do. To note how we are already entering a new type of organized capitalism which is no longer liberal capitalism, and which more and more relies on strong state interventions.
Sorry, I have, now, I'm slowly getting to collapse. You want something to conclude or whatever?

Unfortunately (in this fan's eyes) football is no longer purely about the best club. Players are bought and sold frequently enough that when players like Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher are Liverpudlians for life, it is noted as the exception rather than the rule. Not that this is some sort of major revelation to the modern football fan, but it is worth mentioning. Football has become equal parts business and sport. For some, all that matters is the footy. Others would rather see a successful stable club perpetually in contention. The latter group understands that the football and the business are directly connected.
When Standard Chartered supplanted Carlsberg as sponsor on Liverpool's jersey, they made a few suggestions regarding how to further grow the Liverpool brand. They wanted Liverpool to sign an Asian star. This idea was met with little resistance from the then new owners.
Brand expansion is nothing new to Fenway Sports Group. It got creative with the Red Sox to find ways of generating revenue within the rules of Major League Baseball's revenue sharing rules. This was a sponsor suggesting it do the same by branching into new markets, to tap into a resource that are there for the taking.
Presumably the issue was that there were no targets at the time who fit the description that Standard Chartered had in mind. That doesn't mean they don't keep it in mind during the transfer window. As it turns out (if rumors are true), the group is set to tap into a flourishing and still open market. The only catch: it's America instead of Asia.
Rumors have swirled about new boss Brendan Rodgers trying to bring in Clint Dempsey. While it is unclear if the proposed transfer fee (be it paid in the form of cash or Andy Carroll) will pay off in the long run for Liverpool, it is a risk worth taking. America is beginning to turn the corner with The Beautiful Game. Its brightest star shining, on a big stage, with plenty of exposure ensured by the owners could spell big things for Liverpool in the business realm.
The best part is that FSG knows this. One thing Americans agree on is America. Right now, Clint Dempsey is the most exciting player America has to offer. It makes sense that if you are going to market your club to Americans then you should have America's Player.
With no real team to back outside of possibly the country their parent's parents hailed from, ratings from the Euro 2012 tournament were up more than 50 percent. Soccer's growth in America has been aided by many things: the Internet, satellite TV, immigration and concussions in other sports have slowly but surely lead to a groundswell of football support. Take those things, mix them in with this and this, and you have the makings of a football powder keg.
Of course, with all things that were once underground and cool, there will be resistance to going mainstream from the hardcore fans. It happens in music, movies, sports and all areas of life. Cool things aren't cool if everyone is doing them. This is even more reason to strike while the iron is hot and underground in America.
Liverpool: be the cool club; be America's team and sign Clint Dempsey. Watch them triple their worth in the span of a year on American sold merchandise alone.
I suppose their 23 goals wouldn't hurt on the field either.

DW: Speaking at the Energy Security Conference in Frankfurt this month, you said we tend to focus on the impact humans have on the environment, but that we should also examine the impact our environment is having on us. What did you mean?
Cleo Paskal: We are in a world that is changing, not just for climate change reasons but because of population increases, depletions in groundwater, populations moving into increasingly vulnerable areas. What happened in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina was the result of building on floodplains. It was a city in a hurricane zone that was hit by a hurricane. It was not a surprise. It created an enormous social, political and economic disaster, from which the region still hasn't recovered.
So, environmental change, and its effect on us, is being seen increasingly and in an accelerating way. This is going to change the way economies can sustain themselves, the way countries interact with each other and the way power is projected across the board.
Large parts of Central Europe, including Germany, were devastated by floods this year
You have also said that European infrastructure and our policies are created without a sense of the world we are going to be facing in 20, 30 or 50 years. You've mentioned flooding as an example. You said it made sense 300 years ago to build in low areas near water, but that isn't a good plan today. Could you explain?
Unfortunately, Germany just suffered some very tragic flooding. If you look at the towns, most of them are quite old, which means that they haven't been consistently flooded, otherwise they would have moved. Also, they were designed for a very specific time and a very specific place and a very specific population size - much smaller populations, more mobile and different climatic conditions. Very static conditions.
In most of Europe - and definitely Germany - our infrastructure and locations were chosen 500, 700, even a thousand years ago, that's how old the towns are. A lot has changed in that time but we haven't changed the locations which we put our infrastructure in. As a result, we are increasingly vulnerable as the variability comes. And it's not just the location but the population size. These towns were designed for 10,000 people, not 100,000 people. So, an already vulnerable location gets stressed more and more and that makes it even more vulnerable to disruption.
New Orleans is in a hurricane zone. Eight years on, it is still recovering from Hurricane Katrina
So, you want people to start thinking about moving to safer spaces or building new cities rather than shoring up the ones that we have?
The insurance sector is starting to discuss this because they're the ones that have been picking up the bill. You are already starting to see places in the UK, for example, where houses just can't get insurance any more. If you can't get insurance, you can't sell your house.
They're not getting insurance because they're vulnerable to catastrophes?
Because they flooded. In fact, in the UK they built houses on floodplains. The sellers said, 'we guarantee you can get insurance'. So homeowners got the insurance and when they flooded, they got the payout. But then the insurer said once is enough and we're not going to pay out again. Now homeowners are stuck with houses on a floodplain that they can't get insurance for. This isn't one or two cases – this is potentially tens of thousands of cases and increasingly more across Europe as the floodplains change and increase.
What conversation would you like policymakers to have?
I'd like them to have real discussions about risk, where risk isn't discounted, distorted or diverted into other factors. If a place is too dangerous to build in, don't back it with federal insurance. Let the market say this is too dangerous to build in and just pull out.
This is a problem across the western world. This is why the US national flood insurance program is consistently bankrupt: because the market has said it's too dangerous. But the government has said but we want the tax revenue from the beachfront properties. So they push the risk of the flooding off onto the global or the state-wide taxpayer by providing federal flood insurance. By discounting, distorting or diverting risk into other areas, we're getting a very unreal sense of the vulnerabilities in our systems.
Are cities built hundreds of years ago prepared for the realities of the 21st century?
How does Europe perceive this?
Europe thinks this is mostly a developing world problem but it's not. Actually the countries with the oldest, most static, the least adapted infrastructure are the old Western countries like the ones in Europe. This infrastructure is hundreds of years old, it's for a different time. Also, the population expects a very high level of responsibility from the government, whereas in places like India people have generators at home because they know not to rely on the government. If their house floods out they have friends they can stay with, the social networks are extremely strong. So if Europe thinks that it's in a better position than the emerging world, it really needs to re-think.

Media Matters Founder and Chairman of the Board David Brock called on The New York Times to issue a "prominent correction as soon as possible" after publishing what they called a "wholly inadequate" article about Hillary Clinton's use of a non-government email account during their tenure as secretary of state.
In a March 2 report, the Times insinuated that Clinton violated the law by using a non-government email address while serving as secretary of state. The Huffington Post published an excerpt of Brock's letter on Tuesday.
"Michael Schmidt's March 2 article alleging that Hillary Clinton may have been 'breaking rules' by using a personal, non-government email account while serving as secretary of state has unraveled under scrutiny, and I am writing to ask that the Times issue a prominent correction as soon as possible," Brock wrote. They concluded:
The Schmidt article failed to meet the highest journalistic standards that readers expect of The New York Times. Since it was published, the Times has been leaning on other reporters to vet the story after the fact. Our hope is that after reviewing the situation, the Times will do the right thing and correct this sloppy, innuendo-laden report in a prominent place.

Game on: A coalition of local groups has launched the Tech Valley Civic App Challenge, which will be awarding $18,000 in prize money for community-focused mobile apps built on open data. Blurbage:
The goal of the challenge is to encourage local developers to build and deliver apps and services that serve community needs, connect and engage citizens with their governments and demonstrate how mobile technologies can lead to the next generation of tech jobs and investment. The challenge kicks off March 4th and concludes May 1st. ...
Apps submitted to the challenge will be judged on potential impact on the Tech Valley (40 percent), executionÂ (40 percent) and creativity/noveltyÂ (20 percent). To make the challenge truly Tech Valley-centric, teams submitting mobile apps must include at least one member that is either a current resident of the 19 counties (Albany, Clinton, Columbia, Dutchess, Essex, Franklin, Fulton, Greene, Hamilton, Herkimer, Montgomery, Orange, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Ulster, Warren, and Washington) that make up the region or attends one of the region's institutions of higher education. A panel of judges made up of local tech experts, elected officials and community stakeholders will review apps pre-screened by Hack Upstate to determine to what extent each satisfies the submission criteria. Judges will rank finalists and assign prizes. All potential intellectual property belongs to the product teams or individual.
The first place prize is $10k, $5k for second place, $2k for third, and two $500 honorable mentions. The submission deadline is May 1. An awards announcement is tentatively scheduled for May 14 at UAlbany.
The competition is sponsored by AT&T and a wide range of local tech and institutional partners: the University at Albany, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, TechConnex (an affiliate for Center for Economic Growth), Tech Valley Center of Gravity, Saratoga TechOUT, Hudson Valley Tech Meetup, New York BizLab, Beahive, Tech Valley Mobile Developers Network, Accelerate518, and Hack Upstate.
These sorts of civic app competitions have popped up in a bunch of places over the last few years. One of the most notable has been the the NYC Big Apps competition -- its winners last year include a system for detecting residential heating violations, a web app for parks info, and a job site.

Occupy Wall Street demonstrators protest against rising national student debt in New York, April 25, 2012. (Reuters/Andrew Burton) Ad Policy
Strike Debt, one of the offshoot groups of Occupy Wall Street, has planned a week of action March 16–23 in response to what it calls a “healthcare emergency.” A majority of personal bankruptcies in the United States are linked to medical bills, with 75 percent of people declaring bankruptcy even though they have health insurance.
“These debts are literally killing patients, students, providers and communities,” Strike Debt states at its website. “They deepen the already entrenched inequalities that divide races, classes and genders. Our healthcare system doesn't make us well; it prolongs our illnesses in the name of profit.”
While it remains unclear what the group specifically has planned—the page suggests supporters “stay tuned for updates”—Strike Debt does promise to make a “big announcement in March,” and provides a list of activism suggestions for supporters, including protesting closed community hospitals, private insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies and/or engaging in creative direct action.
San Francisco General Hospital recently provided just one example of the ripple effect of medical debt when it declared a $40.8 million budget shortfall in the end of February partially as a result of unpaid medical bills and ballooning employee costs:
General Hospital serves 1,500 patients daily and is the only trauma center between The City and Palo Alto. It also serves many low-income and elderly patients who rely on Medi-Cal and Medicare. In the past, hospitals charged Medi-Cal and Medicare a fee for services rendered to their beneficiaries. Reliance on a new “managed care” model has resulted in lower charges, but also has brought in $8.2 million less than budgeted. And budget figures show that “bad debt,” or situations where a patient simply cannot pay for the care they or they received, is skyrocketing. The hospital allotted some $58 million for bad debt, but it has been stuck with nearly $91 million in unpaid medical bills. “We're funding wards for which we're not being given money to fund and keep open,” said Dr. Edward Chow of the Health Commission.
Budget cuts significantly hurt the hospital after the health department anticipated receiving up to $16.2 million for mental health care costs, but the money now seems unlikely to be delivered.
Strike Debt has already bought and abolished a large amount of medical debt that the group says will “provide real relief to thousands of people who need it,” though “it is only crumbs in light of the 70 million who still owe money on medical bills.”
To date, the anti-debt movement has raised over $564,000, which Strike Debt says has been used to abolish $11,293,338 of debt—primarily relief for individuals crushed by medical bills.
In November, Strike Debt held a telethon and variety show in support of the Rolling Jubilee, a system to buy debt for pennies on the dollar, and abolish it. At the time, the group hoped to raise $50,000 in order to purchase and eliminate around $1 million in debt, but they actually ended up exceeding that goal.
While Strike Debt has been undeniably successful in generating support and raising cash in order to eliminate pockets of debt, as Salon's Natasha Lennard points out, its efforts have not yet made a significant dent in the national or even the New York City–wide picture. It would take massive resistance on par with the Canadian students' tuition hike protests to shift the national dialogue away from deficit chatter to debt relief.
Such a movement might seem impossible right now, but student debt has tripled in the past three years, and since most student loan debt is government-backed, the bubble-burst won't resemble the mortgage crisis. There's no incentive for the government or investors to rescue students, since unending debt equals unending profits for powerful players. Given no other option, mass student resistance doesn't seem as unlikely an outcome as it might have a few years ago.
But in the short term, Strike Debt might have an easier time generating widescale support by focusing on medical debt, which affects far more Americans—not that the two are necessarily mutually exclusive, since students get sick and fall into medical debt, too. Good health is the bedrock of all other success—academic and otherwise. If individuals can't afford access to decent medical care, they can't go on to flourish as students, workers or citizens.

It is likely that 2016/17 is Antonio Valencia's last campaign as a Manchester United player. Now 31, Valencia signed a three-year deal in June 2014 with an option for it to be extended by an extra season. There are many who would consider them fortunate to still be on United's books, having produced more off than on over the last five years.
For so long, Valencia's presence at right-back has been a cause of intense frustration for supporters. In the David Moyes era, their substitution into matches was a sign that their unadventurous manager was happy with their lot. More often than not, it also became a precursor to United conceding.
Under Louis van Gaal, Valencia's reputation hardly improved. The defensive uncertainty remained – particularly being caught out of position – while the Ecuadorian also lost their attacking powers. This became most obvious through Valencia's crossing, which stuck to the same method: Run forward with hesitation, don't look up, hit the first man. Valencia's full-back performance was as a jack of two trades, but master of neither. As an added bonus, they are impressively one-footed.
‘Fosu-Mensah and Darmian must be United's right-sided options moving forward before Eric Bailly and Ashley Young are mentioned as emergency options – both have shown more quality in the position at the club,' a piece read on a prominent Manchester United blog earlier this month. ‘Valencia lacks the technical ability, football intelligence and their physical quality is beginning to decline.' Apart from that, though…
Yet if that contract option depends on Valencia's own form during Jose Mourinho's first season in charge, signs are initially promising. Out of nowhere, United have an Antonio Valencia in full working order, put through service and MOT and then the car wash for good measure. Fans in the away end must have gulped when they saw Matteo Darmian left on the bench, but Valencia more than merited Mourinho's faith.
Not only was Valencia solid in defence, ably dealing with the threat provided by last season's top scorer Josh King, but they were an outlet for United on the right wing, Juan Mata tucking inside to allow Valencia to overlap.
Most of all, Valencia has learnt how to cross, like an amateur golfer who suddenly starts creaming the ball down the middle of the fairway and keeps looking at their hands in bemusement. Their three assists against Galatasaray in pre-season were followed by them setting up Zlatan Ibrahimovic's Community Shield winner. It was Valencia's cross on Sunday that found Anthony Martial in the build-up to Wayne Rooney's header.  They are a changed man.
There was an interesting point made by Mourinho after the Community Shield regarding Valencia's mindset under Van Gaal: “There are some changes and that takes time. The second goal, probably last year Valencia, instead of crossing, Valencia gets down the line and plays a back pass. So we are changing the principles of play and that takes time. So in this moment, we are not a super team, we are just a team with a super desire to work.”
A slight dig at their predecessor perhaps, but also an important detail. By instilling Valencia with the licence to attack their man, the full-back immediately looks more confident. With confidence comes achievement. Suddenly, Valencia looks a new player. Being picked to start on the opening day for the first time in three seasons will only increase their belief.
With pace, strength and stamina all in abundance despite their ageing years, it isn't difficult to see why Mourinho might prefer Valencia to the still wispy Darmian; these are the first three characteristics of any Mourinho favourite. Valencia still has plenty to do to convince supporters that they are a viable candidate for Manchester United's right-back role – particularly against stronger opposition – but the first audition could hardly have gone better. No fluffed lines, and no fluffed crosses either.

About 8.8 million Americans enrolled in health coverage through Healthcare.gov, the Trump administration announced Thursday, a slight dip from last year after the Trump administration cut spending and outreach but far from a dramatic drop.
Last year, about 9.2 million people signed up through Healthcare.gov, which serves more than 30 states. A dozen states run their own marketplaces and several of those states have not yet closed their open enrollment.
Seema Verma, the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the federal marketplace, tweeted next year's Obamacare enrollment numbers a week after the open enrollment period for 2018 coverage ended.
Exchange open enrollment for 2018 coverage ended w/ approx 8.8M people enrolling in coverage. Great job to the @CMSGov team for the work you did to make this the smoothest experience for consumers to date. We take pride in providing great customer service. — CMS Administrator (@SeemaCMS) December 21, 2017
There are two ways to look at the numbers: On the one hand, in a thriving marketplace, you would expect enrollment to grow every year. On the other hand, given the deep cuts that the Trump administration made to Obamacare advertising and the decision to have the sign-up window, the law has proven pretty resilient.
"We expect enrollment to grow every year, not to shrink. This market is likely to shrink," Caroline Pearson, senior vice president at Avalere, an independent consulting firm, told me recently, before open enrollment had ended. "It is a big deal, for a market that's already too small and unstable."
But on the other hand, they added, "there will still be a market that's mostly the same as last year." (Pearson added on Thursday that 8.8 million sign-ups was “an impressive result.”)
The Trump administration slashed advertising funding for Obamacare by 90 percent and cut spending on the navigator program, which funds enrollment assistance, by 40 percent. It also ended partnerships with state-level enrollment assistance programs and groups that targeted minorities like Hispanics. President Trump also ended federal payments to health insurers, known as cost-sharing reductions, driving up premiums in many states by 20 percent or more.
In spite of all that, enrollment on Healthcare.gov slid by only 400,000 sign-ups. As Vox has documented extensively, the law has been buoyed by the fact that millions of people qualify for generous federal assistance to help them pay for health coverage.
The final enrollment figures for 2018 dropped the same week that Republicans in Congress repealed the health care law's individual mandate, the requirement that every American have insurance or pay a penalty. That same day, Republican leaders indicated that they would move on from Obamacare repeal.

Penn Park, the rejuvenated 24-acre strip of land along the train tracks between Walnut and South streets, officially opens on Thursday.
The park occupies former parking lots and vacant land in a once fairly desolate area that was a parking area for postal trucks. It is now part of the University of Pennsylvania campus.
So what can your typical West Philly resident get out of the new park? Some of its facilities will be open to the public on a regular basis. Those include about two acres of grassy open areas, including a “picnic grove,” with a good view of the Center City skyline in and around newly constructed athletic facilities. The area also includes 548 new trees.
“Penn Park marks the first time that the University has, by design, developed open space for the use of the Penn community and beyond,” said Penn President Amy Gutmann.
Those athletics facilities include a spiffy 12-court tennis center, a 470-seat multi-purpose stadium and two athletic fields with synthetic surfaces. A parking lot for 210 cars sits along Walnut Street near the Class of 1923 Ice Rink. In case you had any notion of getting your Nadal on and playing tennis on those new courts (we did), Penn has said that they will only be open to the public on special occasions.
Still, the park provides a nice place to relax, enjoy the skyline and maybe take in a field hockey game.
The park is accessible by Walnut Street to the north, a walkway near the picnic grove to the west and another entrance near the South Street bridge. Here is a map of the park: Penn Park map
The park cost $46 million, but not a dime of public money went into it, according to Penn officials.
Tomorrow's ceremony begins at 5 p.m. and will include a ribbon-cutting, recreational activities and a fireworks display at 7:30 p.m.
FORT WORTH, Texas -- One of TCU's greatest headaches of 2015 is looking like a serious silver lining for 2016.
The injuries that threatened to wreck the Horned Frogs' defense last season have made that unit far stronger heading into this season. A bad streak of setbacks started right around this time one year ago. Head coach Gary Patterson wouldn't call those problems a blessing in disguise now that they have the benefit of hindsight, but they do know their team is better today because of them.
Defensive end James McFarland, the team leader in sacks in 2014, took one unlucky step on a sprinkler head in fall camp last August and had to be shut down for the season. Starting linebacker Sammy Douglas went down with a season-ending knee injury in the opener at Minnesota. The other new starting linebacker, Mike Freeze, quit the team after their first game.
And then, before the Frogs even reached October, No. 1 cornerback Ranthony Texada and rising safety Kenny Iloka were lost for the season in non-conference play.
Patterson wondered this spring if they had simply pushed their team a little too hard in two-a-days last fall. Then again, they can argue their approach to fall camp was one reason why TCU did survive all those injuries.
"Because of the way we run our two-a-days, we really try to develop as many players as we can for that reason," Patterson said. "Guys are going to fall out and not make the cut. Who's the next guy who's going to step up?"
All those hits forced younger players to step into bigger roles, and those roles could change week-by-week. Nick Orr started eight games at cornerback and five at weak safety. Whether they were ready or not, converted safeties Travin Howard and Montrel Wilson had to figure out how to succeed at linebacker.
By the end of the year, only three players -- defensive end Josh Carraway, strong safety Denzel Johnson, and free safety Derrick Kindred -- started all 13 games at the same position. TCU's coaches had to ask three or more players to make starts at right end, middle linebacker, strongside linebacker, both cornerback spots and weak safety. In all, 22 players made at least one start for the Frogs' defense last season.
When you encounter that much in-season attrition, you're probably not supposed to win 11 games. But TCU found a way. And all the unexpected development that occurred, all those young guys thrown into starting jobs and big games, should continue to pay off in 2016.
The Frogs get McFarland, Texada, Iloka and Douglas back after medical redshirt years. They brought in junior college transfers Tyree Horton, Markell Simmons, and Mat Boesen to challenge for major roles. They brought in one of the best defensive line classes in the country, a group that got even better with the late addition of ex-Baylor signee Brandon Bowen.
Then there are the pleasant surprises, those who have emerged this summer and in fall camp. Patterson has said sophomores Joseph Broadnax and L.J. Collier are pushing hard for the defensive tackle spots, and true first-year student Vernon Scott has a chance to help right away at cornerback.
Add it all up and it's easy to see why seniors like McFarland are bullish about this defense's chances of being a problem for the Big 12.
"We have a lot of people who've been here, a lot of people coming back, a lot of people who've been in different situations and experienced a lot," McFarland said. "This defense has a lot of leadership, a lot of guys who want to contribute. Any time you have depth and you have leadership, the sky's the limit."
And if those leaders can stay healthy, that would be nice. McFarland knows how good this defense looks on paper. They know expectations will be high, and that's a good thing.
"We're not content in any way," they said. "We're always out to prove something. This year, we're trying to prove what people think about us is correct. We're a team to be reckoned with."

A first-year undergraduate student of the Loyola College on Friday allegedly committed suicide by hanging themselves in their hostel room on the campus at Nungambakkam.
Ajith Kumar (18), a native of Ramasamy Naikenpatti village in Theni district and hailing from an agricultural family, was studying BA Economics in the college.
Police said a classmate noticed Ajith Kumar's body hanging in the room around 1 pm when they went there to take them to the mess for lunch.
The college management alerted the police who retrieved the body and sent it for autopsy. No suicide note was left by Kumar and the reason for the extreme step is still not clear.
However, police and college officials said Kumar was struggling to cope with studies and had failed in nearly five papers in the first semester. “He was also not a regular in classes in the second semester and had very poor attendance. But there was no black mark on him,” said a top college official.
“He did not go home for the Pongal holidays, but stayed in their uncle's house at Velachery. They did not show any signs of depression.
We too are stilling clueless about why they took such an extreme step,” said a relative of Kumar.
Friends, who had gathered at the KMCH, where Kumar's body was kept, refused to talk to the media maintaining that it is a personal issue.
“The boy was staying alone in the room as their roommate had gone home for the Pongal holidays. They were last seen on Thursday night by their hostel mates and they had fastened the doors by placing a chair. They had used a nylon rope to hang themselves from the ceiling,” said police inspector R Sibu Kumar.
Police sources said Kumar's friends told them that they had consumed liquor on Thursday night and was found to be depressed for last few days.
After autopsy, Kumar's relatives planned to take their body to their hometown, where their father Jayachandran is a farmer.
An Analysis of Charles Hoskinson's Apology Letter
Classic Ether Blocked Unblock Follow Mar 7, 2017
In the Genesis block of the Bitcoin public ledger, a message left by the inventor of the blockchain is indelibly inscribed. “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” A headline taken from that morning's newspaper, the phrase confirms the date on which the network came online. More abstractly, the words take on proverbial significance.
One may interpret the Chancellor of the Genesis block not to refer to any specific individual, nor to any particular geographical region. Rather, they represent trusted third parties, residing everywhere around the world, whose authority allows the excessive printing of currency by fiat and the reallocation of those effortlessly conjured funds. That this is not the first time our Chancellor has fired up the printing press connotes habit. That cohorts are the intended recipients indicates cronyism. That the general public pays through inflation, equates with coercion.
The trustlessness of Satoshi's blockchain keeps us accountable, so that no centralized authority engages in the habitual employment of excessive money printing. The decentralized nature of the proof-of-work consensus mechanism defends against centralized cronyism. By restricting money printing by fiat, the blockchain creates a deflationary store of value for the internet age. Upon ensuring that the fledgling Bitcoin peer-to-peer network fulfilled such requirements, Satoshi disappeared, making Bitcoin a leaderless platform in the image of the Internet.
Will We Have A Say?
On February 25, 2017, the CEO of a third-party developer called Input Output Hong Kong submitted a formal apology to the Ethereum Classic community, following their company's proposal to inflate the ETC monetary supply by 20% annually. “IOHK has recently released a treasury proposal,” Charles Hoskinson wrote. “I would like to apologize for its poor and confusing release to the general public.”
What stakeholders might have been expecting from the author was an explanation, specifically regarding the attempt at inflating the money supply. Of particular concern to miners was another provision, seeking to confiscate a percentage of their mining rewards, reallocating the funds to the control of IOHK's proposed treasury. What the community received was not an explanation, but a sleight of hand.
Ethereum Classic is a smart contracts platform, allowing for automated payments, verified by the public ledger. The term “smart contract” was coined by Nick Szabo in 1994, describing “a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract.” ETC is designed to run decentralized applications on top of the blockchain, allowing stakeholders to opt out of poor and confusing sounding schemes. In this case, however, IOHK had no interest in designing a smart contract where the ETC community could choose to opt out.
Hoskinson's intention was to target the protocol itself, implementing code that would serve to increase the supply of ETC, paid for by the stakeholders through inflation. Miners would supply proof-of-work to validate the blockchain, but no longer be permitted the full payout. 20% of the reward would be redirected to IOHK's treasury. Here is where the parallels to Satoshi's proverbial Chancellor become discernible.
It became necessary for the CEO's apology letter to blame the public for their confusion, rather than fess up to attempted money printing and confiscation. A formal apology would have pledged to forego any further attempts by the developer to target the investor and miner constituencies. Instead, Hoskinson plowed forward. They wrote, “More abstractly, let's try to cut the inflation pie into more than a single piece for a single group.”
Crony Capitalism on the Blockchain
The apology letter invited ETC to deviate from Bitcoin's model, where newly mined tokens are awarded in full to miners for providing the proof-of-work validation that secures the network. View the mining reward as “inflation pie” instead, and others clearly deserve a slice. Presumably, IOHK would design a voting mechanism to determine where the confiscated mining rewards go. If everything goes according to plan, IOHK employees currently perform “exactly the types of roles” expected to receive payouts. IOHK pays two community management employees to “manage” Ethereum Classic stakeholders, costs that could eventually be covered by the treasury.
From the Hokinson apology letter
ETC core developers, opposing the proposal, requested IOHK make their treasury a smart contract. Using contracts in place of confiscating mining rewards would allow stakeholders the option of opting out. Hoskinson replied on Slack, “Implementing a treasury as a smart contract solves nothing.” The reallocation of capital would need to be involuntary.
On Reddit, IOHK's community management attempted to refute criticism of their company's treasury proposal. The above attempt was casually dismissed by an ETC core dev. Based on upvotes in this particular thread, the public appeared to prefer viewpoints offered by unpaid participants over IOHK staff. Were the treasury imposed, and fulfilled Hoskinson's intentions, it would serve to subsidize such manufacturing of consent. A centralization of resources, further incentivizing centralization of resources, reminds us of the habits of Satoshi's proverbial Chancellor.
ECIP-1020 represents one recent IOHK service, provided by the other asupervisorstioned manager. This Ethereum Classic improvement proposal, the first by an IOHK employee, sought to change the currency symbol from “ETC” to “⟠.” Submitted through the same formal process as ETCDEV contributor Matthew Mazur's widely supported monetary policy upgrade, IOHK's proposal to make mandatory use of “⟠” is neither code-enforceable nor useful. It is an attempt by an individual to make their mark on the community without concern for their needs. “[W]hile I pay Christian and Carlo, they ultimately work for you,” claims Hoskinson. If that were the case, how would we go about firing them for incompetence?
IOHK's CEO was compelled to submit an apology, as their proposal to inflate the monetary supply subverted the interests of stakeholders. The core devs believe it undermined our security as well. “[M]ake it as a smart contract, please,” ETCDEV chief technical officer Igor Artamonov requested. “There's no need to touch monetary supply or protocol.” Core developer Elaine Ou concurred. “Ethereum (classic's) attack surface is big enough as it is,” they explained. “I am against adding more complexity to the core clients.” IOHK had already admitted to there being numerous security risks involved.
Rather than address their criticism in their apology letter, Hoskinson took a swipe at the core devs who guided us through January's Diehard protocol upgrade. “Let me be blunt,” they said. “Taking someone else's code, making some modifications does not make you a core developer of a project.”
Fear, Uncertainty and DAO
To persuade the Ethereum Classic community to implement their treasury, the author of the apology letter attempted to instill “FUD,” or “fear, uncertainty and doubt.” “The reality is that smart contract competition is going to get extremely tough in 2017,” they warned. “Tezos is launching with smart contracts. Rootstock will be a player in the second half of this year. Ethereum continues to evolve rapidly. There will also be many more.”
In the Bitcoin space, similar attempts at FUD are routinely employed by those attempting to unseat the core developers. Arguing for Bitcoin Unlimited, Roger Ver warned BTC could be overtaken by competitors. “I did my first Dashpay payment yesterday,” they wrote. “I moved $100K for ~0.3 cents, and was confirmed in the next block. Bitcoin used to work that well.” Suggesting Bitcoin welcome a contentious hard fork, they wrote, “That the combined market cap of ETH & ETC was greater after the fork means the market viewed it as a good thing. A lesson for Bitcoin?”
As someone who witnessed the DAO fiasco play out in real time, I find it disquieting to hear someone invite a contentious hard fork upon Bitcoin. Ver further argued, “What is seen: Bitcoin reaching all-time new highs. What is unseen: Highs that would have been reached had we followed Satoshi's road map.” In response, Szabo wrote, “What is obsessively seen: transactions/second. What is unseen: without strong security Bitcoin would be a junk game token, not global money.”
Such prioritization of Bitcoin's security has yet to be successfully undermined. We should take such tasks as Szabo's upon ourselves in Ethereum Classic when similar methods of emotional manipulation seek to weaken our security. “If ETC wants to stay relevant and survive, then we cannot be the litecoin of smart contracts,” Hoskinson warned in their apology letter. “To me, the worst thing we could do is be overly conservative.” This is somewhat astonishing to hear from an ETC developer. ETC's raison d'être was to provide a more conservative, more decentralized, security-conscious roadmap than the Ethereum Foundation was willing to follow.
FUD from the Hokinson apology letter
IOHK's lack of discipline explains why their treasury scheme is content with complicating the ETC protocol, inviting new attack vectors, as with Slock.it's exploitable smart contract. It explains why the company is comfortable with confiscating mining rewards from the miners, risking alienating them and fomenting revolt, as took place following the Ethereum Foundation's contentious DAO Fork. And it explains why the third-party developer seeks centralized control to impose a capital reallocation scheme, endorsed by potential beneficiaries on their payroll, just as Slock.it, composed of former Foundation members, was the first intended recipient of the DAO contracts.
Let us not lose sight of our values here. We will be targeted with FUD, in hopes that we are suggestible. We will be subjected to character attacks, as the ETC core developers have been. We will be told that serving to empower bad actors is all we can do to survive. But if Ethereum Classic sacrifices its principles and falls prey to protocol-layer capital reallocation schemes, what manner of survival will that be? Incentives will drift from providing valuable services to colluding in rigging the treasury payout mechanism.
Unprincipled people will oppose a meritocracy because they know they cannot compete on an even playing field, and will employ ad hominem because they know their arguments do not stand up under scrutiny. Opposition to inflating away our store of value, and opposition to predatory confiscation of our capital, are founding principles of blockchain governance. But these principles will remain, only so long as we fight. Satoshi's proverbial Chancellor is ever roaming, desiring their next fix.
Nikon-Walkley awards: Graphic image from Afghan hospital bombing wins photograph of the year
Updated
Photojournalist Andrew Quilty has been awarded the 2016 Nikon-Walkley Photo of the Year for an image showing the devastation inside a bombed hospital in Afghanistan.
The Man on The Operating Table was submitted for the Press Photographer of the Year and News Photography categories in the Nikon-Walkley Awards for Excellence in Photojournalism.
It was taken following the October 3, 2015 attack by an American gunship on the Medecines Sans Frontieres Kunduz Trauma Centre, in which 42 staff, patients and patient carers were killed.
The attack was condemned as a possible war crime by the UN, although an initial American probe found it was a tragic and avoidable accident caused by human error and a report released by the US military in April 2016 "did not conclude that these failures amounted to a war crime".
Quilty, who was the first journalist to enter the hospital after the attack, said "the body of the man on the operating table had been the only one among the human remains in the trauma centre that was still somewhat visibly identifiable".
"And when I first saw him, this man had been lying dead on that operating table for a week as the fighting continued to rage across the city.
"It would be four more weeks before I'd learn their name."
The man in the image was identified as Baynazar Mohammad Nazar, 43, a husband and father of four.
When asked if the photograph should be published, Nazar's wife and eldest son said the world needed to see it.
Quilty's portfolio of images from Afghanistan was praised by the judges for its versatility and variety, and their ability to capture the human side of war.
A year after the attack, Quilty returned to the hospital to find that the horror of the strike lived on in a city that was once again a war zone as a Taliban offensive intensified.
Portrait prize shows refugee in Manus Island jail
An image of suffering closer to home won the Nikon-Walkley Portrait Prize.
Brian Cassey of News Corp Australia won for their portrait of Iraqi asylum seeker Abdullatif Almoftaji in a Papua New Guinea police cell in the town of Lorengau on Manus Island.
Mr Almoftaji had been detained by Australian forces when they tried to enter Australia three years ago at the age of 17.
"I first met Abdullatif at a Lorengau guest house," Cassey said.
"A couple of days later we heard that they had gone on a drunken bender with another asylum seeker and it was alleged that they tried to steal food and other items from the guest house."
They had been arrested, charged with several offences, and thrown into the cell wounded and wearing just shorts and a torn shirt.
Cassey had later been threatened with arrest by a police officer who caught them trying to pass food and a new shirt through this hole in the cell wire.
Broad body of work wins community prize
Marc McCormack from The Cairns Post won the Nikon-Walkley Community/Regional Prize for the second time.
McCormack, who first won in 2013, was recognised by the judges for their "knack for nailing a story in a frame".
The five images they entered include artists, a dancer, a 14-year-old boxer who had turned to a hypnotherapist to help them overcome the pressure they felt when entering the ring, and a "relatively relaxed" shot of murder suspect Christopher John Lavery.
They also included an image of a single European honey bee wearing an electronic tag.
The tag was fitted in an effort to record the bee's feeding behaviour in the hope the information gained would help safeguard Australia's agriculture industry.
Lavery, arrested over the 2008 death of James Russouw, had arrived at Cairns Airport for extradition to Victoria under heavy police guard, covering their face with a shirt.
McCormack said they had been able to follow police to a secluded part of the airport where they were able to catch Lavery framed by police officers shaking hands.
For boxer Johnny Addo, McCormack used a mixture of incandescent light, studio flash and a slow shutter speed to show Addo breaking away from their personal demons.
Travelling exhibition showcases entrants around Australia
In addition to the three winners already announced, 11 photographers have been short-listed for Press Photographer of the Year, News Photography, Feature/Photographic Essay and Sport Photography.
The winners will be announced on December 2.
A travelling exhibition is displaying the entrants at the State Library of New South Wales and the ABC in Brisbane until November 27. The exhibition will move to Adelaide between December 15 and February 12, and Newcastle on dates to be announced.

Want to know where you're most likely to get a parking ticket? How about where you'll pay the most?
CBC's Marketplace analyzed more than 15 million tickets given out over the past five years in Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, Vancouver and Halifax to find out where drivers get ticketed and why.
The investigation — the most comprehensive analysis of parking ticket data ever done by Canadian media — reveals Winnipeggers are fined the most, while Haligonians are ticketed most often.
Meanwhile, Calgary's robot meter maids could be the future of Canadian tickets. And Toronto says it gives out tickets to help ease traffic — but the data disagrees.
The data obtained and examined by Marketplace doesn't reflect the amount in fines that drivers paid, only the tickets issued by cities.
Collectively, the total number of tickets handed out in 2015 alone added up to more than $171 million in fines. (CBC News) Here's a breakdown of each city's situation for 2015.
Winnipeg: Canada's priciest parking tickets
Out of the five cities investigated by Marketplace, Winnipeg drivers were hit with the most expensive tickets: the average maximum fine came to $86 in 2015.
But Winnipeg does offer an out for those ticketed: Drivers can pay less if they pay early — an incentive also offered in Calgary, Vancouver and Halifax. (Only Torontonians are forced to pay full fines when it comes to parking violations.)
The maximum Winnipeg fine is almost twice the average ticket handed out in Toronto and three times the average of what a Halifax driver was charged.
Two of the five most ticketed spots in Winnipeg are located on streets that have disabled loading zones. According to municipal bylaws, the total fee for parking or partially blocking such spaces without a permit can be as high as $300 for drivers who pay more than two weeks after the ticket was issued.
On top of pricey tickets, two of the 10 most ticketed spots last year had signs that were contradictory, confusing or hard to see, netting the city thousands in parking revenue.
For example, drivers who park on William Avenue, right across from the city's Health Sciences Centre — the province's largest hospital — could face a fine for parking within three metres of a crosswalk.
This spot was one of the most ticketed in Winnipeg in 2015, with $96,000 in fines given out to more than 1,000 motorists on the north side of the street alone. Looking at both sides of the street, more than 2,500 motorists got a ticket on this block.
The problem with this spot? The crosswalk is easy to miss.
When Marketplace checked the spot in September, this "crosswalk" had no white lines painted across the road and no flashing lights overhead to alert cars.
Toronto: Traffic flow or cash flow?
When Toronto Mayor John Tory launched their six-point plan to reduce traffic congestion last year, they claimed that parking tickets were how the city fights congestion.
But most of Toronto's top ticketed spots last year had nothing to do with traffic flow. In fact, seven of the top 10 were far away from areas of typical rush-hour gridlock.
Topping the list? Sunnybrook Hospital, in the city's northeast end, where more than 9,000 tickets and $274,000 in fees were levied in 2015.
Also high on the list was a shopping mall in the Don Mills neighbourhood, also in the northeast, where close to 2,800 drivers were dinged, mostly for parking in a fire route. Overall fees charged: a whopping $643,000, with an average ticket cost of $230.
In total, parking officers in Canada's largest city charged $100 million in fines in 2015, handing out close to 6,000 tickets a day.
Calgary: The future is robots
What's faster and more efficient than a parking officer? In Calgary, robots issue more than one-third of parking tickets, according to the Marketplace analysis.
Since 2007, the Calgary Parking Authority has relied on what it calls "mobile photo enforcement vehicles" in the downtown core to catch drivers who park illegally or forget to feed the meter.
Each day, parking officers drive six Smart Cars equipped with cameras along downtown streets, taking thousands of photos of licence plates.
At the end of the day, employees load the photos into an online database and check the plates against drivers who paid for their parking spot using the city's ParkPlus electronic system.
If there is no match, drivers get mailed a $75 ticket.
Last year, these cars gave out close to 92,000 tickets. That works out to 252 tickets per day — a number that beats the daily average of almost any parking officer on foot.
Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi says the system is the first of its kind in the world, calling it both "very efficient" and "extraordinarily convenient" for the customer.
And the program is expanding. Calgary has signed a contract to bring the ParkPlus system to Edmonton. Other Canadian cities may soon follow suit, says Nenshi.
But some Calgary drivers call the system unfair, saying they were ticketed after pulling over to drop off someone or to take a phone call.
Halifax: Flooded with tickets
It may be the smallest city analyzed, but Halifax leads the way in terms of tickets: The city gives out the largest number of tickets per resident.
But Halifax's tickets are also cheaper than other cities: In 2015, the average parking ticket was only $27.52.
The most ticketed street? The tourist-friendly Lower Water Street, located right next to the city's boardwalk, marina, Maritime Museum and a number of restaurants. Last year, more than 6,100 drivers were charged a total of $157,350 for parking along the street, mostly on private property.
Another top ticketed location is the tiny Dresden Row. Running only a few blocks in downtown Halifax, the street is home to a large grocery store and a few restaurants. It's common spot for delivery trucks, which might be why the street is covered with no parking and no stopping signs.
Too bad for drivers: more than 3,700 tickets were issued in 2015, totalling $99,000 in fines.
Vancouver: Watch out tourists
Despite its density, Vancouver's data is near the middle of the pack. While nearly 393,000 tickets were doled out in 2015, totalling $32 million in fines, tickets are not given out more frequently or for more money than other Canadian cities.
Most of the top ticketed spots in the city are around downtown hotels or near hotspots like the Vancouver Art Gallery, the Queen Elizabeth Theatre and Canada Place.
Two of the 10 most ticketed locations last year were right across the street from a Whole Foods Market, with more than 4,700 people adding up to $70 to their grocery bills this way.
But the classic? A little spot along the 800 block of Richards Street, which ranks third on Vancouver's list. Last year, the spot yielded 2,692 tickets totalling almost $199,000.
It makes sense: the spot is right in front of a Vancouver Parking Authority office.
The working title for my hands-on impressions of Warhammer 40K: Eternal Crusade following our PAX Prime demo session changed multiple times over the course of the weekend. At one point I considered calling it “Warhammer 40K: Worst. Demo. Ever” but I thought it might be a bit too on the nose.
Before I dive into the gory details behind what brought me to that particular thought process, allow me to indulge in a brief anecdote from our E3 appointment for W40K earlier this summer. I promise it won't take long, but should help give some context as to why I have little faith in the project at this point.
It had been nearly a full year since I'd had met with studio head Miguel Caron for the first time. Hot on the tails of the initial game announcement, the two of us sat on the dirty stone steps of the convention center for that first meeting, and chatted for nearly a full hour about the potential for the property to provide the basis for one heck of a compelling MMOG.
Rolling into E3 2014, I was eager to see how far the project had progressed over the course of its first full year in development. Three key takeaways from that fateful day helped set the stage for what was to follow this past weekend during PAX Prime.
1. Our team was forgotten in the waiting area for our appointment because apparently someone perceived as more important than us distracted the demo team like a dog chasing a tennis ball. Because of this, our appointment was cut dramatically short before we were whisked away without so much as a thanks and a handshake.
2. During our demo, we were shown two videos. The first featured footage from a tech demo that used primarily placeholders for everything from the character models and animations, to the environments in which a multiplayer match was being played.
3. The second video illustrated the practical work completed on the real game up to that point. Character models were blocky and lacked texture, and nearly everything else was using gray box placeholders. In other words, typical pre-alpha build stuff.
Let's Pretend
I wish I could say that I was impressed by any part of our Warhammer 40K hands-on session during PAX Prime 2014. I wish I could report that it wasn't based on that proof of concept tech demo rather than what felt like a real game. I also wish that I could wax poetic about the real character models, combat animations, or core gameplay that were woefully absent while we played our demo match (but were at least shown to exist within the game client following our hands-on session).
I wish I could say that any of these things were true, but the sad fact of the matter is that I can't. Sure, most games tend to be pretty darn rough around the edges at earlier stages of development, but you'd expect to see at least something to prove a product will eventually exist by the time developers are accepting cash payments for founders packs.
Similar to our E3 2014 appointment, things got off to a bad start before they really even began. While we weren't left waiting indefinitely in a meeting room lobby, we might as well have been. We knew it was going to be one of those appointments again the moment we stepped into the meeting space to discover Miguel paying fan service to Angry Joe.
I absolutely respect the many YouTubers out there that have managed to make a name for themselves in pretty volatile market conditions. At the same time, being summarily ignored in favor of one of them sitting across the room caused more than a little anger in Team Hammer. At one point during our match Skylatron may or may not have spawn camped Angry Joe until they finally asked them to stop. That was about the most attention we were given during the hour-long appointment, unless you count the warm bottle of Coors Light offered to me as a form of consolation prize.
Following a lightning-fast introduction to combat (that made pretty much zero sense to us but was augmented by a handful of second-generation Xerox copies of what appeared to be game info on one of the tables in the room) we were divided up into two teams of three. The map we played on featured two capture points that my team started out defending.
What we did get to experience was a very, very incomplete map that looked and felt a heck of a lot like that proof of concept demo we were shown during E3. Combat was somewhat sluggish, but if nothing else I could see what's being aimed for.
PlanetSide 2 has been name dropped more than a few times in reference to what they're aiming for with Warhammer 40k, and the fortress where our battle took place seemed set up with exactly that type of gameplay in mind. Mind you, the fortress and some surrounding terrain were all that existed on the map, so it was difficult to get a proper sense of scale.
Lessons Learned
Most of the time I'm elated to get my hands on an in-development title for the first time. Having played MMOGs since the late 1990's and covered them professionally for the past seven years, I'd like to think I've developed an eye for compelling new games even in their very primitive pre-alpha stages. However, being exposed to pre-alpha builds is dangerous water to tread, because you really don't have a lot to work with in terms of assessing how things might improve moving forward.
If there is one thing we discovered about Warhammer 40K during our PAX demo, is that there is definitely plenty of room for improvement. The vision, monolithic IP, and development team are all variable components that could still prove that this will be a solid MMO experience worthy of the 40K brand given time. But at this early stage, it's hard to say if we were looking at a diamond in the rough, or something else entirely.
At the conclusion of our demo time, we were forced to wander off without so much as an acknowledgment or thanks for stopping by, and I honestly wonder if Miguel even realized we had left. One of the other people in the room was at least polite enough to hand me a business card on our way out.
If our demo time with Gigantic represented the best hands-on experience of PAX Prime 2014 for us, our Warhammer 40k: Eternal Crusade demo was unfortunately the polar opposite. Much like the warm bottle of Coors Light handed to me during our appointment, the whole thing mostly left a bad taste in my mouth.
In keeping with @Robusto's comment on opening a can of cat food, the most reliable way to get our recalcitrant kitteh to return to the house is to say the cat's name (or a familiar diminutive thereof), followed with "cheese!" in a high-pitched voice. Kitties seem to love high-pitched voices mentioning food. The "cheese" vocalization is in fact an offer of food -- sometimes literally a tiny piece of cheese, sometimes actual "cat food". Imagine a trained dolphin receiving a fish after performing a trick, and you will have imagined a situation which is not completely unlike this one. This trick also works for our other cat who was not brought up with cheese as either an offer or a reward. I think it's the high-pitched voice, with the likely reward of food that does it.
The minister for rural sanitation has lost their sanity, say their critics who seem to have lined up like rows of dawn defecators. When they said toilets were a higher priority than temples, Hindu fundamentalists took their alliteration literally, and wanted them flushed down the non-existent commode-ity. Now Jairam Ramesh stands accused of skewing the rural marriage market with their latest slogan, ‘No toilet, no bride'. At a public meeting in Kota district's Khajuri village, they told parents of marriageable daughters to reject those sasurals which were sans indoor sanitation.
Having seen and smelt the all-round lack of public facilities, we are all for more private conveniences for young women. We might even go so far as to say that fewer bahus are okay if it means bahut business for sanitation engineers. But social engineers have other pipe dreams, and they want to use the minister as toilet paper for spoiling the prospects for poor, village grooms.
The batterati will always find a stick to beat their rivals, and drum up their own image as righteous upholders of whichever cause is allegedly threatened. The earlier Jairam-Ram objection to mentioning temples in the same breath as toilets was quite uncalled for since Ramesh wasn't singling out only the Hindu rate of religious growth; they had used the noun non-denominationally. But those who made political capital of their statement will be followed by those who want to distort the dirty picture we present.
They will scoff, “Beleaguered brides are subjected to all kinds of indignities, but the mantri-ji is only concerned about their having to go out into their sugarcane fields to defecate.” Btw, since they have to do so at night, does this prove that rural women never have a field day?
While any assessment of the status of our women still resembles “the report of a drain inspector”, as Gandhiji des-cribed Katherine Mayo's polemical book, Mother India, the Jairam Ultimatum could actually improve our abysmal statistics. Unfortunately, again, in our MCP society, it's the shrimati-wannabe who might end up paying the bride price. Greedy parents of suitable boys could turn ‘No toilet, no bride' on its ghunghat-covered head, and add ‘installation of indoor latrine' to more conventional dowry demands.
Of whatever else you may accuse Ramesh, it cannot be of playing politics since the mantri's new mantra was expounded in Congress-ruled Rajasthan. They pointed out that only 321 of the state's 9,177 gram panchayats have been able to spare their residents the indignity of open defecation. This bodily function may be gender neutral, but men are less inconvenienced. It's more than apparent that they are under no obligation to excrete under cover of darkness. In every field, it's only us females who get a bum deal.
While trying to spare indigent young women indecent exposure, Jairam's solutions have unwittingly exposed the rich-poor divide. Toilets are not just the sanitation minister's objects of desire. While the masses may not have a squattie to call their own, the rich have gone potty over bathroom fittings and fixtures. The solid gold faucet may still be the indulgence of only the precious Mittal, but as soon as Mr & Mrs Middle Class learn to spell ‘aspiration', they head for the sanitary-ware showroom. Extravagance for extravagance, these expanses match their counterparts dealing in counterpanes, or even those stores specialising in lavish drawing-room furniture.
True, everybody needs to go, but in bathroom fittings as with funerals, some get to go in style.

Students taking free online courses offered by the startup company Coursera have reported dozens of incidents of plagiarism, even though the courses bear no academic credit. This week a professor leading one of the so-called Massive Open Online Courses posted a plea to their 39,000 students to stop plagiarizing, and Coursera's leaders say they will review the issue and consider adding plagiarism-detection software in the future.
In recent weeks, students in at least three Coursera humanities courses have complained of plagiarized assignments by other students. The courses use peer grading, so each student is asked to grade and offer comments on the work of fellow students.
"I just graded my second batch of peer essays and was saddened to find one of them was lifted from Wikipedia," wrote one student in the discussion forums for the course, "Fantasy and Science Fiction."
Many students in the discussion expressed surprise that their peers would resort to fraudulent behavior in a noncredit course. Students who complete a course can get a certificate attesting to that accomplishment, but so far the courses do not count for credit at any university.
Still, some students argued that even in noncredit situations, stamping out plagiarism is important. "This cheating hurts everyone who is trying to take part in this class and learn with integrity," wrote one student in the discussion forums.
Meanwhile, professors teaching the courses say they are worried that some students are being overly zealous in hunting for plagiarism, and at least one student complained in the forums about being accused in error.
"An accusation of plagiarism is a deeply serious act and should be made only with concrete evidence behind it," wrote the professor teaching the fantasy course, Eric S. Rabkin, in a message to students posted on Monday. Their letter, clocking in at more than 1,200 words, attempted to define plagiarism, underline its importance, and convey how complicated they felt the issue could be.
A 'Teachable Moment'
In an interview this week with The Chronicle, Mr. Rabkin, who is also an English professor at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, said they see the plagiarism incidents as a "teachable moment." They said one student wrote them soon after they posted their letter and confessed to submitting a plagiarized essay, but the student said they had not realized that copying and pasting from other sources was wrong. The student asked that their essay be withdrawn and that they be disqualified from receiving a certificate, but Mr. Rabkin said they wrote to Coursera officials saying the student should be given a second chance.
A professor teaching a Coursera course about the history of the Internet, Charles Severance, wrote to their students this month about plagiarism as well, after several students reported in the forums that they had seen it in assignments they graded.
"If you see/suspect plagiarism—be kind and keep any of your comments about plagiarism short and to the point—do not criticize or flame the person—make sure your comments will help someone learn," they told them.

"If we really are trying to teach the world, including people from other cultures, we have to take a responsibility to educate people about plagiarism, not just vaporize people for it," said Mr. Severance, who is also a clinical associate professor of information at Michigan, in an interview on Wednesday.
Daphne Koller, a co-founder of Coursera and a professor at Stanford University, said they planned to look into how widespread reports of plagiarism are. "I don't have a sense of whether it's more frequent than in regular classroom environments," they said on Wednesday. They noted that Coursera makes students agree to uphold an honor code when they sign up for courses, but that, in the future, assignments will include reminders that all answers must be the students' original work.
"That would clarify to students what is and isn't appropriate behavior," they said. "That will reduce the incidents considerably, I hope."
They said Coursera officials would also consider adding a software system that could automatically detect suspected plagiarism, but no decision has been made on the issue. "It depends on how common this is," they said.
'Patchwork Plagiarism'
One Coursera student who witnessed plagiarism in a course is Laura K. Gibbs, who is themselves a lecturer teaching online literature courses at the University of Oklahoma.
They enrolled in the Coursera course on fantasy and science fiction to get a better sense of how MOOC's work, since they've been in the news so much lately as a possible way to disrupt conventional higher education. They were enthusiastic about the reading list and the rigor of the course, which asks students to spend eight to 12 hours per week on reading and homework.
"I always tell students it's six to eight hours per week, every week, and I feel lucky to get six," they said. "I was really excited that this was trying to be an upper-division humanities course."
They said they were frustrated when they read discussion posts about plagiarism, and then saw evidence of it in one of the peer assignments they graded. "It's what at my university we'd call patchwork plagiarism," they said. "I'm naïve enough that I was really surprised by that."
They complained on their blog that Coursera and the course's professor had been slow to respond to the incidents. And they argued that Mr. Rabkin's message to students did not give them enough guidance on how to respond to what seemed like clear-cut instances of plagiarism.
Ms. Gibbs stressed that they are largely enthusiastic about Coursera and the idea of free courses online, but that "it's going to take an enormous amount of work to make it work."
They noted that they see plagiarism by their University of Oklahoma students as well, but they can intervene in such incidents because they see all the students' work.
Another faculty member taking a Coursera course, Steven D. Krause, said they doubted that peer grading could ever work without instructors' looking at all assignments. They said they use the technique in their writing courses at Eastern Michigan University, where they are a professor of English and coordinator of the written-communication program, but they always look over the peer grading and checks that the students are on track. "Usually there's some sort of norming by the instructors," they said.
"The idea that this could scale as a broad substitute for higher education is, I think, ridiculous," they added. "Content scales really well—you can put all kinds of stuff out on a Web site, and millions of people can look at it. But instruction does not scale, at least to those kinds of numbers."
But Mr. Rabkin, who is teaching the Coursera course on fantasy and science fiction, argues that peer grading can work in free courses, even without direct involvement by the professor. "Sometimes the professor's grade is wrong for whatever reasons," they said.
"I'm not interested in proving this could substitute for the University of Michigan," they added. "What I'm after is seeing if we have a way of capitalizing on a large group of people with smart software and a clever system that can make a community that has guidance and can teach itself."
On July 10, 2014, a malnourished female dog was found tied outside the sixth level passenger drop off area at Denver International Airport (DIA). No one knows who left the pet there and no one came to claimed her, but the dog found a loving new owner that same night with United Airlines' employee Mike Scott.
When the dog was found, it was wearing a collar but had no identification tags. DIA employees believe the pet was abandoned because it is unlikely the dog would have wandered off on their own to the high-trafficked drop-off area and somehow tie themselves to a pole.
According to 9 News, the dog spent several hours under the care of different DIA employees. Airport security guard Chris Jeater fedher white rice from Panda express and grilled chicken breast from Burger King. Animal Control was called but if they had taken the dog, their fate would have been uncertain, and that is why Scott decided to take their home with them that night.
“I took the dog and took them to my vet,” said Scott. “I had a dog for 13 years and they just died of cancer in February.”
Thanks to this compassionate United Airlines employee, the abandoned airport dog now has a family of their own.
Philadelphia Union announced on Saturday that they have released five players – Aaron Wheeler and four trialists, Aaron Simmons, Aodhan Quinn, Navid Nasseri and Petros Kanakoudis – from their preseason roster.
Wheeler, 26, originally joined the Union prior to the 2013 season and made 25 appearances and nine starts. During that time, they had one goal and one assist.
“We want to thank Aaron for their time with the club and we wish them the best as theirs continues their career,” Union technical director Chris Albright said.
In addition to Wheeler, four other players were released from trial duties after the team ended its first phase in Clearwater, Fla. Simmons, a defender, was selected by the Union with the No. 51 overall pick in the 2015 MLS SuperDraft. Quinn, a midfielder, was selected by the Union with the No. 52 overall pick in the 2014 MLS SuperDraft and spent last season with USL-side Orlando City. Both Nasseri, a midfielder, and Kanakoudis, a defender, will re-join their clubs overseas after two-week trial runs with the Union.
The Union will once again depart for Clearwater for their final phase of Spring Training on Monday, Feb. 16.
University of Arkansas Enrollment Tops 26,000 for First Time
Graphic by Charlie Alison
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. – Preliminary enrollment figures at the University of Arkansas show that for the first time the flagship campus has a total of 26,301 students for the fall semester as of Tuesday, Sept. 2. Chancellor G. David Gearhart made the announcement at a news conference Sept. 3. The total is a 3.8 percent increase from the fall 2013 enrollment, a rate of growth that university administrators believe is sustainable. The enrollment growth continues to show improvement in both academic quality and diversity of the student body.
“This is a great time to be attending the University of Arkansas,” the chancellor said. “We're excited to launch the 2014-15 academic year on the heels of several good news items: National Jurist prelaw magazine recently ranked our law school the best value in the country; the Chronicle of Higher Education recognized us as being the 7th fastest-growing research institution in the nation, and The Princeton Review and Kiplingers have both ranked us among the top institutions for value and quality. Indeed, we are bigger, better, smarter and more diverse than ever before.”
“There is no question that we have grown quickly over the last several years,” Gearhart said. “This is not by accident, but part of a long-term plan we put in place to increase the size, quality and academic reputation of the university. Improving our graduation and retention rates will be a major point of emphasis for us between now and 2021.”
Since 2008, University of Arkansas enrollment has increased by 37 percent – 7,100 students. This growth trend led the Chronicle of Higher Education to rank the U of A as the 7th fastest-growing public research university in the country.
This fall's first-year student class of 4,579 students set a new record, too, according to the preliminary numbers, with five students more than the 2012 class, which was itself the previous record-setting first-year student class.
Associated Student Government President Daniel McFarland also addressed the audience with a student response to the news.
Preliminary Breakdowns – Quality and Quantity
Undergraduate and graduate student enrollments are both up this year, according to the preliminary numbers, captured Sept. 2. Suzanne McCray, dean of admissions and vice provost for enrollment management reported that there are a record 21,903 undergraduate students enrolled on campus, a 4.2 percent increase over last year, and a 41 percent gain over the last six years. They said that continuing students make up a significant part of this growth, a good sign for improved retention.
“Since 2008, we have added more than 7,000 students to our campus without any decline in academic caliber,” McCray said. “In fact, we have seen a 43.2 percent increase in the number of students with an ACT of 30 or higher since 2008.”
“We are as excited by the quality of our students as we are by the numbers,” McCray said.
McCray explained that the university's determination to enroll students who are prepared to succeed academically is a major factor in improving retention and graduation rates.
Graduate student enrollment has also grown to 4,018 students, the largest one-year increase in several years. Since 2008, graduate student enrollment has increased by 19.7 percent. Improved recruiting and efforts to work with the other colleges and graduate faculty to attract high-quality graduate students are key to the growth and essential for the university's goal of becoming a top 50 public research university.
Perhaps the greatest single area of growth in 2014 is in online enrollment. Under the leadership of Javier Reyes, vice provost for distance education, there are now 7,444 students taking at least one online class this semester, a 21.6 percent increase over last year and a 506 percent increase since 2008.
The current enrollment figures are still preliminary. The official numbers will not be available until after the “11th day snapshot” required by the Arkansas Department of Higher Education. That enrollment data will be analyzed and reviewed for accuracy before a preliminary report is submitted to the department, with the final numbers from that 11th day snapshot officially filed by mid-October.
Resources, Retention and Graduation
Provost Sharon Gaber said that the university has worked hard not only to increase enrollment but to provide the growing number of students with the resources they expect.
“We've worked hard to expand our capacity to educate students, while keeping class sizes small,” Gaber said. “We've invested in new construction to renovate, expand and modernize our campus. New faculty members are also being added at a pace commensurate with our growth. Since 2010, we have added nearly 70 additional tenure track and 200 non-tenure track positions, with an expectation that more will be added in the next fiscal year. Growth at the University of Arkansas will not come at the cost of quality interaction with an instructor.”
Enhancing academic advising, requiring freshmen attend a transition class on “Destination Graduation,” and working to increase the number of classes with fewer than 20 students by adding additional sections and additional new faculty positions are just a few of the specific steps the U of A has taken to help retain students. “UASuccess,” a new online appointment scheduling and advising tool for faculty, staff and students, began operation in fall 2013. Finally, the university's first-ever office of retention and graduation will launch this year to serve as an institution-wide catalyst for initiating, implementing and reviewing goals and actions to increase graduation and retention rates.
Irish Blood, Japanese Heart, This I'm Made Of
That Dark Souls game was good, wasn't it? Ever played Bloodborne? Oh, you did? And you think it's the best PS4 exclusive (by a country mile), too?! Let's be friends…
How about Dragon's Dogma? Clunky, unfinished, yet ambitious… Lords of the Fallen? Challenging – sure… but also uninspired and dull. Salt and Sanctuary? Quaint, deceptively deep, but ultimately derivative… Oh dear.
Despite the cult-like fervor that the Souls games have fostered over the best part of the last decade, has the series really failed to inspire anything more than average to poor, bargain bucket destined knockoffs? A couple of weeks ago the answer was undoubtedly a resounding – yes. Then? Then came Nioh.
Nioh is an action role-playing game developed by Team Ninja (Dead or Alive / Metroid: Other M) and published by Koei Tecmo, in conjunction with Sony Interactive Entertainment. Despite being announced back in 2004 (Janet Jackson's areola / Shrek 2), Nioh persisted through several embarrassingly missed release dates, and, assumedly, multiple reiterations. This long awaited game was finally and triumphantly released earlier this month, in the year of our lord 2017.
So that's thirteen years from being announced to being released… To put that in context – Final Fantasy XV took ten years. The Last Guardian? Eleven…
As an original IP, Nioh has escaped much of the scrutiny that these two landmark projects quite rightly endured. That said, the narrative leading up to release became almost solely defined by the stark similarity of Nioh to the Souls games, despite being conceived several years prior to the hugely influential PS3 cult classic – Demon's Souls. The promotional demo release of the game did little to quell this sentiment…
Precise melee combat, separated into light and heavy attacks? Check. Formidable enemies who punish any and all displays of impatience and/or overconfidence? Check. Intricate level design that encourages forensic, if often desperate, exploration that ever so gradually burns a permanent schematic into your cerebral cortex? Check. A core gameplay loop centred around the slaughter of man and beast alike, who then share the grim fate of seeing their very beings converted into a precious, if somewhat macabre, upgrade currency? Check. Seemingly insurmountable boss encounters designed to break your will and heart to such a degree that when you do finally overcome them – the euphoria you feel puts most Class A drugs to shame? Check ad infinitum. So far, so Souls
It seems safe to say that Nioh includes many of the staple elements that made its predecessors worthwhile endeavours… But what does Nioh do to stand out from the crowd? When considering this point it's important to keep the philosophy of evolution over revolution in mind. Yes, the core of Nioh is unapologetically a direct descendant of Dark Souls. Everything from the UI aesthetic to strategically implemented invulnerability frames during dodge rolls. From the wickedly placed item pickups to the sense of sheer exaltation when you finally unlock a long-teased shortcut – making the time between boss attempts infinitely more bearable.
And the nigh-on plagiarism doesn't stop with Souls. Nioh's tortured development cycle allowed plenty of time for analysing the current state of the industry, which resulted in a Frankenstein of game design that has no right to feel as unique and inspired as it does…
Take the Souls fight, die, fight again, upgrade, fight further philosophy. Add Diablo 3's colour coded loot pornography. Sprinkle some of Destiny's difficulty scaling and heavily rewarded daily challenges. Finally – add a finesse for third person combat that Team Ninja have shown in spades previously (see Ninja Gaiden) and you have a recipe for something truly special, if somewhat familiar. Nioh has taken inspiration from some of the best that games have to offer currently and used a robust development cycle to layer on some extremely impressive layers of mechanical depth. A depth that not only outclasses its inspirations but also makes progress within the game an unadulterated joy.
At this point, I'm comfortable to lay my cards down and admit – I'm a huge fan of Nioh and consider it to be one of the most impressive games of this generation. No mean feat considering some of the titles that it stands alongside, three or so long years into the PS4's lifecycle. But I'd be doing a disservice to Hidetaka Miyazaki's (creator of Dark Souls) transformative series of games if I didn't highlight where the comparisons are not so flattering for Nioh…
The most obvious element of Nioh that comes up short when compared to Souls (especially Bloodborne, in my view) is in its story and narrative style. Where Miyazaki told a complex, mesmerizingly grim, depressingly human tale in Bloodborne, purposefully obscured from anyone who didn't want to invest the time to uncover it; Nioh relies on the standard cut scenes that punctuate 99.9% of other video games to tell its ultimately forgettable yarn of tribulation and revenge. In Nioh's defense – most games will never come close to rivalling the scope of poetic sentiment that Miyazaki and FromSoftware have conjured up in order to enchant their beautiful yet dying worlds, and Team Ninja were probably wise to avoid that particular showdown. Nioh's story is more than capable when considered against its peers in general, and an unexpected (at least in my case) twist towards the end does add an additional, and welcome, layer of narrative depth for consideration.
The game's main protagonist William, a blonde-haired Irishman who finds themselves battling, and ultimately prevailing, against the most formidable warriors and demons that 17th century Japan has to offer (seriously – how did this game escape the wrath of social media's whitewash triggered, PC brigade echo chamber?) does little to make any lasting impression on the player. Equal parts Geralt of Rivia, Big Boss, and John Major – William serves as a utilitarian yet ultimately disposable avatar via which luscious pixel genocide can be oh so elegantly committed.
So, is Nioh better than Dark Souls? Not by a long shot. Does that fact make the game any less great? Absolutely not. Nioh is a finely tuned riff off the now classic Souls formula that favours a consistent gameplay experience, along with considerable bang for your buck, over pretension. The game may not share the sheer scale of ambition, or the absurd attention to level and art design that we've seen in titles past, but – it's a technical tour de force that makes its target hardware sing (especially the PS4 Pro), and the pragmatic refinements to online play and character levelling mean that there's literally hundreds of hours here to enjoy for those with the appetite for it.
Cliche dictates that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Nioh is a game that deserves flattering for years to come.
In 2005, DC Comics was in the middle of a reboot of sorts. The company has a somewhat notorious reputation for reboots and relaunches, but it's a fairly common practice in today's modern comic book climate.
Character histories become bloated with years worth of backstory and continuity, often creating the impression that jumping into a particular title is too daunting or complicated for new readers. Relaunching a bunch of titles with a new series of “First Issues!” creates a peace of mind; the reader can just start there and not worry about the old stuff if they don't want to.
One of the things that used to be great about DC Comics is their large staple of what's frequently referred to as “legacy characters.” This is something they have sadly gone away from in recent years, but the idea of a legacy character goes like this: at some point you have a hero, let's say they go by the name “The Blue Beetle.” One day, this Blue Beetle guy, let's call them Dan Garrett, dies. However, they have a protégé of sorts who is with them at the moment of their death. That protégé's name is Ted Kord. As Dan is dying, Ted promises their mentor they will carry on the legacy of the Blue Beetle, no matter what.
So Ted goes out, sews themselves a costume, (also, doesn't it piss you off how easily comic book characters can sew together these lavish costumes? I can't even buy pants that fit), and carries on the name of The Blue Beetle in their own way. Thus, a legacy character is born.
Advertisement
I am absolutely in love with the idea of this. You see this playout with some of the big guns; there's been multiple Flashes, multiple Green Arrows, Multiple Green Lanterns, etc.
One the hand, you create all kinds of narrative possibilities for the new hero. Former villains coming out of the woodwork to take revenge, the new character wondering if they can live up to the former hero's “legacy”, the idea that the general public of this fictional world might not even know the difference between the old hero and the new one; it's classic, cheesy, comic book stuff, and DC comics used to be full of it.
There are other added bonuses though! Aside from the wealth of narrative possibilities, it gives you the chance to diversify your character line-up a little bit. Suddenly, a world that was once loaded with super powered white dudes with one syllable first names, (Hal, Clark, Jay, Ted, etc), can start to be a little more representative of the world we actually live in.

You can play around with character power sets and histories, adding new levels of depth and nuance to the previous character's adventures, retconning their origins or motivations in a way that might change or amplify a reader's understanding of them, and I think most importantly, legacy characters help foster the illusion that this is a world that's been lived in. This place existed before we came along, and it's going to exist after; this is just the window we are looking at now. It helps lend a sense of something larger at stake to the overall universe. The best way to enjoy superhero comics is to remember that nothing is permanent, ever. The trick, is make it so the reader doesn't notice or even care.
Sadly, there are some characters who will never get legacy treatment, at least not for any notable length of time. Superman and Batman are the two most noteworthy examples who have been replaced or gone missing at various points in their respective careers, only to magically show back up a year or two later, usually to coincide with a major film release of sorts.

It makes sense from a marketing standpoint. If Joe New Reader walks into the comic book shop and picks up a Batman book, he's probably going to expect to be reading about Bruce Wayne, not this Jean-Paul Valley guy. Wait, why is Jim Gordon Batman?! I'm so confused! The hell with this!
You get the idea.
But one thing that's super fun about DC comics is their inexhaustible supply of C-List characters—characters that are undoubtedly someone's favorite, but are unlikely to be recognized by the general public, meaning pretty anything goes with them. It might just be because DC has long thrived off of the Big Three, and though the success of Arrow and The Flash on the CW has helped bolster their ranks a little bit, I don't think they are anywhere near Marvel in terms of broad character recognition.

One of my all-time favorite examples of a legacy character is from 10 years ago, when Ted Kord, the second Blue Beetle, (there have been three) was killed off as part of Infinite Crisis, (one of those reboot events that I mentioned earlier), and replaced a by Hispanic teenager named Jaime (pronounced HA-EE-MEH) Reyes.
Jaime was noticeably different in almost every possible way from the previous two incarnations. They were young. The Scarab that gave Dan Garrett chainmail and a generic power-set, and Ted Kord nothing, gave Jaime some kind of weird armor—and fused itself to their spine. It was entirely forced on him, and what I think is the biggest difference, aside from the power-set, is that they didn't try to hide their identity from their family. The supporting cast of the book itself is great, but a teenager's interaction with their family, Jaime's in particular, as part of their superhero life isn't something we often see, unless there's a severe level of tragedy associated with it. It was refreshing, like many aspects of the title, which I won't spoil here.

The costume design itself is excellent. It's completely unique to the character, a wild departure from what we know and love, with a little throwback to the Ted Kord costume on the chest. It's subtle and loud all at the same time.
The series, simply titled Blue Beetle, was co-written by Keith Giffen and John Rogers, with art initially by Cully Hamner and later Rafael Albuquerque, only lasted about 36 issues. Rogers later took over by themselves around issue #10, but the first 25 is really where the magic is.

It has this slow burn of mystery to it, much of which was eventually adapted and altered for the Gone Too Soon television series Young Justice, so I imagine for some, the mystery of the Scarab and its origins won't be a surprise, but the way everything ties full circle into the Blue Beetle mythos is so rewarding.
There's also a good sense of humor to it and fun little Easter eggs. For example, the Scarab that bonded to Jaime's spine that only they can hear,(Ozmodiar?) speaks to them in a seemingly undecipherable language, which you can actually translate! It's a fun little sense of detail, and it's nice to see that thought was given to what the Scarab was actually saying, when it easily could have just been a throwaway.

It's also funny.

I remember working in a comic book store when it first launched, and I immediately adored it. It might be due to a certain level of bias, as the Blue Beetle has always been one of my favorite characters, but it drove me bonkers how often some of the customers would shit on it, without even giving it a chance, ‘cause, nerds, I guess.
This is just smattering of the kind of things I would overhear or be told when recommending the book to customers or whoever.
“It's not MY Blue Beetle”
“Eh, looks like a Hispanic Spider-Man.”
“Why is they in El Paso? What the fuck?”
“Well, their name looks like Jay-me, so that's what I'm going to call him.”
And so on.

While there was a bit of Nerd-Stubborness associated with some of these comments, there was also this gross low-key racism hovering around it, as if a teenager who was anything but a white kid from Queens couldn't be a Bug-Related Superhero, or learning their name was really fucking hard.
Given the reaction from some when Miles Morales debuted some 5 years later, I can't say I was surprised. It was disappointing, and I applaud DC for at least trying to make the Jaime Reyes version of this character as central as they could have been. They had multiple television show incarnations, (much of which were informed by this book) toys, merchandise; it seemed like Jaime was everywhere, and while I couldn't be happier, some people, well, weren't
The biggest annoyance, (aside from the racism, which is a level beyond annoyance and goes into pure disgust) from the detractors though, was the idea that this kid was an imposter, that because they aren't Ted Kord, they didn't matter. This book was definitely canceled before its time, and like a lot of Super Hero titles that die early, it was a matter of low sales because people refused to give it a chance, not low quality, and that's a fucking bummer.

Ted Kord is a great character, but if you look at anything past 1992 in DC Comics, they were largely irrelevant. The character's biggest claim to fame, aside from their stint in the Justice League International came in the Countdown to Infinite Crisis One-Shot, where they were shot in the head, and given a gruesome and seemingly pointless goodbye, which served to create something new. In this sense, a character who hadn't been featured in their own book in well over 20 years, now became a symbol for something else.
In the new Blue Beetle, Ted Kord became a kind of martyr.
This book didn't just explore Jaime Reyes and the history of the Blue Beetle, it paid a level of respect to Ted Kord that most DC characters or books never bothered to, or even thought to. The idea that them being “replaced” when they were languishing in obscurity, being an insult, is stupid, and this book treated the character of Ted Kord better than anyone had in years. And I love how it's presented, because if this was first your comic book, you as the reader know as much as Jaime does, and that's all you really need to know. It revels in its isolation.

In Jaime's world, in El Paso, Texas a place largely ignored by the In-Universe super powered community because it wasn't one of the “big” cities, you had this little pocket of adventure, exploring what it meant to take on the name of someone this kid had barely heard it. It felt quieter, outside of the chaos, and I appreciate that. El Paso very much became a part of the book's identity, much in the way Gotham is a part of any Batman book.
There was even an issue almost entirely in Spanish that shows one of Jaime's family reunions. English is only spoken in the issue when it's for the benefit of characters that don't happen to know Spanish, otherwise Jaime and their family speak Spanish. This is a far cry from the DC Comics of today that referenced “translated from Pakistanian” recently.

Other heroes and cross over events from the DC Universe pop up in the book, which always seemed a little forced by Editorial, but thankfully never felt intrusive. The writers did a good job of working these in naturally, and at the end of the day, it was still about Jaime and their adventure.
I can't recommend those 1st 25 issues enough. The final 11 of the book aren't bad, but they lack the same sense of cohesion that the first big arc did, mostly due to frequent changes in creative teams and languishing sales.

Also, the series turned 10 years old this month! What better way to celebrate than by reading, or re-reading it?! Happy Birthday, Jaime!
As part of DC Rebirth, it looks like we will be getting a series with both Ted and Jaime. On paper, it seems like the best of both worlds, but who knows? At least it's being manned by Keith Giffen. That seems like a good sign.
If not, at least those old stories aren't going anywhere.

Media playback is not supported on this device Moyes rues 'poor goal' after Sunderland defeat
Sunderland manager David Moyes has resisted calls from fans to quit with their side facing relegation from the Premier League.
Fans chanted "We want Moyesy out" as the Black Cats lost 1-0 to fellow strugglers Middlesbrough.
Sunderland are 12 points adrift of safety with five games remaining, and could be relegated at the weekend.
Asked if they would leave, Moyes, 54, said: "No, I'm here, I'm the manager, you take it on the chin."
While there's a chance, I've got to keep going David Moyes Sunderland manager
They added: "I'm a football supporter, I know what it's like. You don't like seeing your team lose.
"There is nobody who wants to win more than me. I am used to winning, I'm not used to losing and I don't want to get used to it either."
Sunderland have failed to score in 17 Premier Leagues games this season - more than any other side in the league.
The players were booed off at full-time at the Riverside, but Moyes - who was charged by the Football Association earlier on Wednesday after telling BBC reporter Vicki Sparks they might "get a slap" - said their team had to keep going.
"We are not enjoying it, we are not enjoying losing or the position we are in," the Scot added.
"Criticism is rightly due, but I wouldn't do it on tonight's performance.
"While there's a chance, I've got to keep going and we've all got to keep going."
Barcelona's mayor Ada Colau gives a speech during a meeting of the left wing party Podemos in Santa Coloma de Gramenet on September 11, 2017 during the National Day of Catalonia | Josep Lago/AFP via Getty Images Pro and anti-independence Catalans call for EU help Passivity not an option for Brussels as planned referendum nears, officials say.
Catalan leaders, both for and against independence, called on the European Commission Thursday to mediate in the standoff between Catalonia and Madrid over the regional government's plan to hold a referendum on breaking away from Spain.
Raül Romeva, foreign secretary for the pro-independence regional government, told a press briefing in Brussels that the Commission "must defend the Treaty of the European Union and stand for the general interest of Catalan citizens as the EU citizens they are."
The Spanish government has adopted a range of measures — including police raids, arrests and confiscation of ballots — to prevent the Catalan government from holding an independence referendum on Sunday. Madrid, backed by Spain's constitutional court, says the referendum is illegal. The Catalan government says the vote is a legitimate act of self-determination.
"The European Commission can no longer argue that this is a domestic issue,” Romeva declared.
Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau, who is against secession but supports a referendum, called on the EU to “defend the fundamental rights of Catalan citizens against a wave of repression from the Spanish state.”
Writing in the Guardian's Thursday edition, Colau said: “Europe cannot allow itself to adopt a passive position over the Catalan question, seeing that the events going on in Barcelona are affecting Paris, Madrid, Brussels, and Berlin alike.”
Colau wrote that many like themselves are “calling for a negotiated solution in accordance with the feelings of 82 percent of the Catalan population who support the holding of an agreed referendum.” That was a reference to a poll in El País this week showing that a wide majority of people in Catalonia want a referendum on the issue — although the poll specified that they favored a legal plebiscite, agreed with Madrid.
Colau said the Spanish government has proved “itself incapable of finding a solution” to the dispute, prompting their call for the EU to step in.
In Brussels, Romeva referred to Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's statement that they want the Commission to be "big on big things and small on small things."
"The point here is that what we have in Catalonia is by far not a small thing, it is a big thing and needs to be dealt in a big way,” they said.
Juncker caused confusion earlier this month when they said the Commission respected the decisions of the Spanish government and constitutional court but also said "if there would be a Yes vote in favor of Catalan independence, then we will respect that opinion.” The Commission later clarified that Jucker was talking about a hypothetical legal referendum at some future point.
"The president said that the decision of the Spanish constitutional court needs to be respected and hence a referendum outcome can only be accepted if this condition is met," a Commission spokesperson said.

The Mormon church has admitted that its founder was a polygamist who married a 14-year-old girl, breaking a lengthy silence about its history.
Joseph Smith, who wrote the Book of Mormon and established the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is thought to have married as many as 50 women, but for years the senior church officials did not address the subject.
But this week the organization acknowledged that the practice took place, and named Helen Mar Kimball, 'who was sealed to Joseph several months before their 15th birthday.'
Polygamous: The Mormon church has admitted that its founder Joseph Smith (right) had many wives - including 14-year-old Helen Kimball (pictured left much later in life)
Public admission: The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-day Saints had stayed silent on the issue of Joseph Smith;s polygamy for years. Pictured is a statue of Smith and their first wife, Emma, in front of the church's Salt Lake City headquarters
Estimates have placed the total number of Smith's wives between 27 and 50, though the church said it is impossible to say for sure.
However, it suggested many of their marriages may not have involved sex, and that Smith was reluctant to adopt the practice, which was eventually banned in 1890.
An essay published by the church, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, describes how Smith said they were visited three times by angels between 1834 and 1842 who commanded them to marry more women, despite them already having a wife, Emma.
The third time, the essay says: 'The angel came with a drawn sword, threatening Joseph with destruction unless they went forward and obeyed the commandment fully.'
It is part of a recent push by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to open up about sensitive issues within the faith, many of which are uncomfortable to discuss.
Other writings posted in the past couple of years have addressed sacred undergarments worn by devout members; a past ban on black men in the lay clergy; and the misconception that Mormons is taught they'll get their own planet in the afterlife.
Ban: Polygamy was outlawed by the Mormon church in 1890. Pictured are church leaders around that time, including Wilford Woodruff, the leader who ended the practice
The latest article also makes efforts to imply that the polygamous marriages may not have been sexual. It makes a distinction between some unions 'for time and eternity' - which can include sex - and some 'for eternity only', which are thought to have been celibate.
The new article about Smith's wives during the 1830s and 1840s in Kirtland, Ohio, and Nauvoo, Illinois, comes about 10 months after the church acknowledged polygamy was widely practiced among its members in the late 19th century.
'As a collection, these are remarkably revealing articles, continuing the new open and transparent philosophy of historical writing,' said Armand Mauss, a retired professor of sociology and religious studies at Washington State University.
The information will be surprising to many Latter-day Saints who either didn't know or were encouraged to dismiss speculation as anti-Mormon propaganda, Mauss said.
Splinter groups who call themselves fundamentalist Mormons still practice plural marriage, including Warren Jeffs' sect on the Utah-Arizona border.
Latter-day Saints began practicing polygamy after Smith received a revelation from God. They took their first plural wife in 1830 in Ohio, three years after they married their first wife, Emma, the article shows.
They and their first plural wife separated, but they renewed the practice a decade later in Illinois, which is where they married the teenager.
'Difficult': An essay published by the church describes Smith's reluctance to engage in plural marriage - and says the process was 'excruciating' for their first wife, Emma, depicted above
The essay noted that while inappropriate by today's standards, marriage among teen girls was legal at the time.
The article acknowledges that many details about polygamy in early Mormonism are hazy because members were taught to keep their actions confidential. But research has indicated that Smith's marriage to the young girl might not have involved sex.
Some plural marriages were designed to seal the man to the woman for eternity only, and not life and eternity as Mormons believe, the article says. Those types of marriages didn't seem to involve sex.
Little is known about Smith's marriages to the already-married women, the article says. They also might have been the type of unions that didn't involve sex.
Plural marriage was an 'excruciating ordeal' for Emma Smith and confounding for some men, too, the article says. Some people left the faith, and others refused to take multiple wives while remaining Latter-day Saints.
When Latter-day Saints trekked cross-country to Utah in 1847, nearly 200 men and more than 500 women were in plural marriage, it says.
'Difficult as it was, the introduction of plural marriage in Nauvoo did indeed 'raise up seed' unto God,' the article says. 'A substantial number of today's members descend through faithful Latter-day Saints who practiced plural marriage.'
A leading Church of Scotland minister has called for two new towns to be built in the Highlands that will house refugees.
The Rev Dr Rory MacLeod, a former Royal Marine who served in Afghanistan, said that two new settlements in the Highlands taking 100,000 refugees each, would help tackle the region's depopulation problems.
Rev MacLeod, who was an army chaplain for over six years, said the surge would bring “an injection of youth and talent - to our denuded wilderness , while the hills would again ring with industry and culture, albeit of an exotic kind.”
The Kirk minister took over the Strath and Sleat congregation on Skye two years ago, having previously led Holy Trinity Church in St Andrews.
Writing in a letter to the Church's house magazine, Life And Work, they wrote: “Two items from the news today caught my eye: a resurgence in migrants attempting the perilous Mediterranean crossing from North Africa to Europe and the slack nature of the Scottish economy.
“At our Bible study the other evening we were discussing how we might respond to the refugee crisis.
“Someone came up with a suggestion that would address both issues: that two new towns of 100,000 residents each should be created in the northwest Highlands, which refugees from the Middle East and North Africa should be invited to occupy.”
Rev MacLeod's comments come amid renewed fears Scotland's economy is facing a Brexit nosedive after a surge in the number of EU nationals leaving the UK resulted in net migration falling to a three-year low.

Government Outlines When It Will Disclose Or Exploit Software Vulnerabilities
Enlarge this image toggle caption Rob Engelaar/AFP/Getty Images Rob Engelaar/AFP/Getty Images
Government agencies that deal with cybersecurity, like the National Security Agency, have two competing interests. On the one hand, they want to protect America's online infrastructure and economy from cyberattacks. On the other hand, government agencies want to harness tools to attack opponents in cyberspace.
These goals come into conflict when government agencies discover or buy flaws in software, called "zero day" exploits, that the software's makers don't know about. The government can inform the company so the flaw can be patched — or it can save the secret weakness in order to use it to launch attacks against enemies.
There's a catch to hoarding the software flaws though: That same exploit could end up being used against Americans if hackers discover the flaw on their own.
It's with this conflict in mind that the White House rolled out new guidelines on Wednesday for the process it will use to decide when to inform tech companies about vulnerabilities discovered in their software, and when agencies will decide to keep something classified.
There's a "tension between the government's need to sustain the means to pursue rogue actors in cyberspace through the use of cyber exploits, and its obligation to share its knowledge of flaws in software and hardware with responsible parties who can ensure digital infrastructure is upgraded and made stronger in the face of growing cyber threats," White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Rob Joyce wrote in announcing the guidelines.
The Vulnerabilities Equities Process Charter lays out what to do once a vulnerability is both "newly discovered and not publicly known" (emphasis theirs).
Representatives from several federal agencies, including the departments of Treasury, State, Justice, Homeland Security, Energy, Defense, Commerce and the CIA will be part of a board to consider the benefits and drawbacks of releasing or keeping a flaw secret.
Officials will consider factors like how widely a product is used, how likely hackers are to discover the flaw, how much damage it can do, and how easily it can be patched. They'll also weigh how valuable an exploit is for gathering intelligence or helping law enforcement, and its effect on the government's relationship with businesses.
The 14-page document also explains the process for resolving disputes when agencies disagree over what to do.
If the government ends up deciding to inform the manufacturer, "dissemination will be made in the most expeditious manner and when possible within 7 business days," the charter says.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group advocating online privacy and civil liberties, called the guidelines "affirmative steps," but they "still have concerns over potential loopholes in the policy."
Former Defense Department officials Kate Charlet and Sasha Romanosky, along with Bert Thompson of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called the announcement "a positive step toward increasing transparency on this controversial process" in a post on the Lawfare blog.
Recent hacks call into question just how well the government can actually keep its secrets, however.
A hacking group called the Shadow Brokers stole and leaked "sophisticated, very sensitive, high-end, really weapons-grade computer code" from the NSA, former NSA General Counsel Matthew Olsen told NPR this week.
"The agency regarded as the world's leader in breaking into adversaries' computer networks failed to protect its own," as The New York Times recently described it. "Created at huge expense to American taxpayers, those cyberweapons have now been picked up by hackers from North Korea to Russia and shot back at the United States and its allies."
Earlier this year, businesses across the world were hit by ransomware attacks, locking hundreds of thousands out of their data. The malware behind those attacks, which exploited a Microsoft vulnerability, was reportedly stolen from the NSA as well.
"Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage," Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote afterward.
The White House's Joyce pre-emptively pushed back, writing, "I also predict that articles will make breathless claims of 'massive stockpiles' of exploits while describing the issue. That simply isn't true."
At an event Wednesday, Joyce also said: "The kinds of vulnerabilities we use ... are rarely rediscovered by anyone else."

There are no toilets, changing rooms or first aid kits.”The NGO has cleaned up Bhivpuri, Kondeshwar,and disposed of about five tonnes of garbage till date.After government's lackadaisical attitude, locals have taken it upon themselves to take care of their surroundings. Madhukar Patil of Anandwadi said, “Monsoon is rice sowing season for us due to which we can't pay attention to the tourists. They come and strew the place with trash. The waterfall area is out of the village and therefore comes under the Forest department. They should provide dustbins here. We want the police to increase patrolling to prevent drinking as well.”
To Reduce Gun Violence, Potential Offenders Offered Support And Cash
Enlarge this image toggle caption Richard Gonzales/NPR Richard Gonzales/NPR
Not long ago, the city of Richmond, Calif., was considered one of the most dangerous cities in America. There was a skyrocketing homicide rate fueled by gangs of young men settling personal or territorial disputes.
But today, the city of about 100,000 residents is called a national model for reducing gun violence. Many cities around the country are adopting their unconventional strategy to prevent violence --– which includes paying potential criminals to stay out of trouble.
Joseph McCoy cruises around this tough blue collar town in a small city-owned car, listening for reports of shots fired on the police scanner.  They are one of about a half dozen "Neighborhood Change Agents" who keep track, sometimes a couple times a day, of scores of known gun offenders or youths at risk of being shot.

"If it is a shooting, we definitely go to check out see what's going on, because we try to create a pause on the next shooting," they say. "We're trying to figure out how to keep the next shooting from happening."
The agents are city employees and all ex-cons with serious street cred.
"Right now we're out doing outreach. There was two young people that had an altercation yesterday, they're brothers, a fist fight. So I need to go out here and make sure they're OK," they say as they rolled up to a run-down housing project and talked to three young men ages 19 to 23.
They talked to them for a few minutes about brothers respecting each other, keeping the peace at home and on the street. It's understood that McCoy won't speak to the police about anything said here.
"We do something real simple that folks just don't realize how, how powerful it is. We love on our youngsters! We come from a sincere place that we love each and every last one of the people we touch and we try to touch as many people as possible," they say.
More Than Just 'Cash For Criminals'
This street outreach is just one part of a broader program designed by DeVone Boggan, the former director of a city department called the Office of Neighborhood Safety. Boggan was a community activist when they were first hired to do something about gun violence in 2007. Richmond had recorded 47 homicides that year.
"If you paid attention to media reports and the frequency of media reports about gun violence in Richmond, you would have believed that you were in Beirut," they say.
Boggan started the street outreach program in 2008 and saw immediate results. That year, there were 40 percent fewer homicides. But the number of murders climbed again in 2009.
Boggan then made a startling discovery in meetings with local law enforcement.
"What I continued to hear was folks believed that there were 17 people responsible for 70 percent of the firearm activity in our city. Seventeen people! We can do something about that," Boggan says.
Boggan and their team launched the Operation Peacemaker Fellowship. They identified those 17 people and several more and made them an offer. The fellowship will give them counseling, social services, a job and a chance to travel if they develop a "life map," agree to stay in contact every day and stay out of trouble. Then the fellowship will pay them up to a $1,000 a month for nine months.
The result: Richmond has seen its murder rate cut in half since the fellowship began.
Boggan says the street patrols are paid by the city while the cash stipends come from private donors. They chuckle when they say media reports have called their program "cash for criminals."
"If you believe that simply paying someone a stipend will reduce gun crimes in cities where gun crimes are long and loud, you're wrong. We've done something much, much more comprehensive than that," they say.
Just ask 18-year-old Joel Contreras. He's big like a high school linebacker and has a mouthful of gold caps on their teeth. They say about a year ago they aren't living right. They were involved with guns, robberies and trouble. Contreras says when they were first offered a chance to change their lives they turned it down.
"I walked away from him. Ten minutes later, I hit the corner. I get shot. The car got shot a couple times, me and my friend were both injured," Contreras says.
Contreras says they don't know who shot them in the back of the neck or why. But when the outreach workers came back to see him, Contreras says they were ready to listen.
"They helped me get a job. The helped me get my driver's license. They were pushing me, pushing me, helping me out. They helped me get back in school, which I wouldn't be able to do without them. I graduated from high school thanks to them," they say.
Replicating The Model Elsewhere
Richmond's Office of Neighborhood Safety borrows from similar models in Boston and Chicago. The difference is in Richmond's tight focus on a targeted group and the cash payments.
The approach is attracting interest from across the country. Washington D.C. is adopting a similar program, while Oakland and Toledo are among other cities considering the Richmond model.
"They always ask me is it going to work and how much is it going to cost?" says Angela Wolf, a researcher for the Oakland-based National Council on Crime and Delinquency. They wrote an evaluation of the Office of Neighborhood Safety.
Wolf says they advise other cities interested in the Richmond model to get ready for a multi-year commitment.
"If you have city leaders that aren't willing to think outside the box and try something different, this is going to be a harder program to get off the ground," they say.
That's especially true, says Wolf, if a city doesn't see immediate results.
Then there's the question of dealing with the local police.
"The ONS approach was pretty unorthodox when it started," says Allwyn Brown, the acting police chief in Richmond.
They say they know that ONS's "neighborhood change agents" don't cooperate or share information with their officers. But they say that while ONS' approach is different, they share a common goal.
"Here's the thing: We recognize that the problem is bigger that what we can deal with and you know, arresting and incarcerating people isn't going to solve the problem. I mean, it just isn't," Brown says.
My wife reminds me often that gun violence in Richmond is much like diabetes, in that 'DeVone, you don't cure diabetes. What you do is you try to manage it,'
Despite Richmond's success, its struggle to stop gun violence is far from over. Homicides spiked to 21 last year after there were only 11 in 2014.
Boggan is stepping down as day-to-day director of the Richmond program to consult with other cities trying to replicate it. They say he's realistic about what can be accomplished.
"My wife reminds me often that gun violence in Richmond is much like diabetes, in that 'DeVone, you don't cure diabetes. What you do is you try to manage it,'" they say.
To do that, says Boggan, you have to connect with the people driving the violence and steer them in the right way.

Bill Surkis, the former Quebec regional director for B'nai Brith, has pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography.
It's a stunning reversal for the well-respected member of Montreal's Jewish community.
Surkis, 70, was Academic Dean of John Abbott College for 22 years, in addition to being the regional director for the Jewish-rights group B'nai Brith.
In court on Wednesday morning, Surkis pleaded guilty to one count of accessing child pornography, and another count of possession of child pornography.
A charge of distributing child pornography was dropped.
Surkis was arrested in May 2009 and charged with counts of accessing and possessing child pornography.
The material was discovered in 2008, when Surkis brought their malfunctioning computer in for repair, and a virus check turned up numerous video and photos of child porn.
In all more Surkis's computer contained 86 videos totalling more than eight hours of video files, and 153 photos of children between the ages of six and 14 being sexually abused.
Surkis had originally planned to plead not guilty, saying they had downloaded the illicit material for a presentation on child abuse.
However prosecutor Cynthia Gyenizse never bought that argument.
"From the inquiry the police made, they were in possession and had access to it, and they accepted to plead guilty to it," said Gyenizse.
Institutions cut off ties
Surkis's fall from grace was abrupt.
All the institutions and organizations they worked for in the past have been quick to distance themselves from the former educator.
John Abbott College, where they worked for 22 years, said they have had little contact with Surkis since they left in 1991.
B'nai Brith said they no longer have any ties with Surkis, and the Holocaust Memorial Museum, where they were board chairperson, has cut off all ties.
Since 2008 possession of child pornography comes with a mandatory minimum sentence of 45 days in jail, but Can be penalized by up to 10 years in prison..
The crown will also ask for a psychological and sexual evaluation of Surkis.
They remain free on bail until their sentencing hearing in September.
When someone mentions Naruto and Bleach, you know that these two titles are almost like household names if you are a fan of anime and manga. First started out as manga series, their popularity grew as each had their own anime adaptations, animated movies, OVAs, stage plays, and so on.
It was to find out a month later that Kazunori Mizuno, a veteran animator passed away a month ago. The cause of their death was linked to karoushi or overworking. They were 52 years old.
Mizuno passed away on March 19. The news of their passing only went public a month later when their officemates in the Naruto and Bleach projects broke the news on Twitter.
Karoushi is described as stress induced stroke and heart attacks. According to reports, the animator decided to take a nap inside the offices of Studio Pierrot and silently died in their sleep.
Aside from the mentioned anime adaptations, Mizuno was also a storyboard artist for Zoids Genesis and Yu Yu Hakusho. Mizuno will also be remembered as an individual who have done so much for the anime industry and hope that their work will be an inspiration for future animators. They will be missed.
One of Mizuno's popular works is also doing the storyboards for Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card. Set just months after the 70th episode, a new kind of danger arises in the town of Tomoeda as new special Clow Card emerges. Sakura Kinomoto wasn't able to properly say their feelings to Syaoran Li and assumed that maybe they have already moved on. They had to deal with two predicaments: finding a way to tell their feelings to Syaoran and retrieving the Sakura Cards as they are slowly been taken away from this mysterious “Void Card.”
This is considered as the ending for the Card Captor Sakura anime franchise and still considered as a fan favorite even until this day. A new sequel to the manga called Card Captor Sakura – Clear Card Arc was released last year with an anime adaptation slated to premiere in 2018. Card Captor Sakura is considered one of the most popular mahou shoujo manga and anime franchise created by the all-girls manga group CLAMP.
May you rest in peace, good sir. The anime industry has lost a great man and we will never forget your great contributions in bringing these anime series to life.

October 6, 2017 - Yosemite National Park is grateful to our Firewise communities who support the use of prescribed fire. Given the long summer of wildfires this year, the park appreciates your understanding that prescribed fires also have a place on our landscapes during the fall, winter, and spring seasons. Prescribed fire is a very important tool for reducing excessive fuel build up near our communities in order to reduce severity of future fires.
Yosemite National Park fire managers are planning two prescribed fires with planned ignitions starting on October 14th in the Mariposa Grove, weather conditions permitting, and continuing in Soupbowl for the week of October 15th. The amount of acres to be considered is based on air quality the day of planned ignition.
Mariposa Grove
:
This
project includes two small burn units that total 84 acres. Burning in the Mariposa Grove is a continuous process; the targeted areas have had 1-3 prescribed fires in the past 30 years. Continued burning is required to maintain a healthy forest ecosystem. Fire produces the optimum conditions for Giant Sequoia regeneration. Fire not only removes the accumulated layers of dead woody debris exposing nutrient rich mineral soil, but is needed to dry the cones and allow the seeds to shed. In addition, by reducing the number of trees and undergrowth, wildfire opens up the forest canopy and reduces shade-tolerant competition.The Mariposa Grove is still closed for restoration which provides fire managers the opportunity to conduct prescribed fire.
Soupbowl
:
2-3 land segments ranging from 103 acres to 174 acres are being considered for a prescribed burn in the Unit 26 Soupbowl B project area along the Wawona Road (Highway 41 corridor).
The primary objective is to reduce hazardous vegetation (fuel) around the Wildland Urban Interface community of Wawona and park infrastructure at the South Entrance. Prescribed fire will help create a continuous fuel break by linking other recent wildfire areas with reduced fuels, mechanical thinning projects, and previous prescribed fires. This project will also reduce the threat of wildfires originating along Highway 41 that could adversely impact the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias.
Park employees, community members, and visitors can expect to see crews from various federal and state agencies working along the Highway 41 corridor doing prescribed fire preparation and burn operations. Traffic control will be in place during burn operations and delays should be short. Please use caution when entering and exiting for firefighter safety.
Smoke will be present during prescribed fire and in the Wawona area. Fire managers are working with the Mariposa County Air Pollution Control District (MCAPD) to time the projects to coincide with favorable weather and smoke dispersion conditions. Smoke, affecting health, is always a consideration in the decision to schedule prescribed fires. A smoke management plan has been submitted to the MCAPCD, and a burn permit has been issued for both burn units. A smoke monitor will be placed in nearby communities to monitor smoke.

Rightwing activists claim negotiators are ignoring national interests and that west has not shown the same honesty as Iran
The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, is facing growing criticism from a broad array of political hardliners and rightwing opponents who say their government is being duped by the US in an over-hasty attempt to clinch a nuclear deal with the west and end economic sanctions.
At a meeting at the former American embassy building in central Tehran on Saturday, a newly formed group of MPs and rightwing activists calling itself "We're Worried" claimed Iran's negotiating team was ignoring national interests in the nuclear talks, which resume on 13 May in Vienna.
"The whole nation believes the main intention of the United States is to fully halt the Iranian nuclear programme," said Fatemeh Alia, a central committee member of the hardline Islamic Revolution Resistance Front, previously allied to the former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
"Since the beginning of the drafting of the final nuclear agreement with Iran is scheduled for 13 May this year, the analysts, the university students, the elites, and the university professors wish to express their worries to the [Iranian] nuclear negotiators hoping that they would heed such concerns," Alia told the official news agency Irna.
Despite an interim agreement in Geneva last November that granted Tehran limited sanctions relief in return for a slowing of its nuclear programme, no cracks had appeared in the international sanctions regime, Alia said. Meanwhile the US had made additional demands concerning human rights and Iran's missile stockpile. Alia said the Rouhani government should stop treating its critics as "illiterates".
Esmaˈeil Kowsari, another MP, said the whole nation wanted an end to the nuclear standoff with the west, but the cost could be too high. "The main point in these negotiations is maintaining the balance in implementation of both sides' commitments, which needs to be observed while preserving the interests and rights of the Iranian nation," Kowsari said. The world powers had not shown the same "honesty" as Iran in abiding by their commitments, they said.
Pressure on Rouhani has been building in recent weeks as the likelihood of a deal has grown. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader and a staunch religious conservative, has backed the president's negotiation policy but made clear that certain red lines cannot be crossed. To appease rightwingers, they have ordered a review of the negotiators' performance.
"I agreed to the government's initiative to negotiate, just to break the hype," Khamenei said in a speech last month marking national nuclear technology day. But Iran would continue to resist the designs of the "Global Arrogance", they said, referring to the US. "The activities of the Islamic Republic in the area of nuclear research and development will not stop in any way. None of the nuclear achievements of the country can be given up,", Khamenei said.
As a fallback, Khamenei continues to argue that sanctions can be rendered ineffective by increased economic self-sufficiency and by attracting investment from non-western partners such as China.
The US and Britain have expressed guarded confidence that a final nuclear deal with Iran can be reached by the deadline of 20 July, describing the talks as "very substantive".
Rouhani and their chief negotiator, Mohammad Javad Zarif, have echoed those sentiments. "Iran is optimistic about the results of the talks and has taken great steps to reach a comprehensive deal and aims to achieve a win-win result," Rouhani told Iranian television last week.
Rouhani hit back angrily at their critics. "Through lies and hype some people are trying to derail the government from its path, and this is against national interests and the leader's order … Iran does not compromise on the people's interests," they said.
Part of the pressure on Rouhani stems not from public concern about the nitty-gritty of the nuclear deal but from entrenched partisan opposition to their new centrist government, which took office last year after defeating the conservative and rightwing principlist factions that dominated political life during the Ahmadinejad years.
Rouhani's main electoral pledge was to improve the economy. The lifting of sanctions is key to that objective, and has become more critical in the past nine months as economic conditions have deteriorated for most Iranians.
The rightwing opposition, which believes Rouhani is tainted by reformist ideas, claims their policy is failing, while popular support appears to be dropping.
Amir Mohebbian, an influential rightwing writer, government insider and founder of the traditionalist Modern Thinkers party, said the conservative opposition believed Rouhani had "accepted the ideals and standards of the west before the negotiations even began".
While the battle played out between the two sides, Khamenei was straddling the fence and could yet jump either way, Mohebbian told the Guardian. "The supreme leader trusts Rouhani and Zarif in general but not in every case. There are red lines. We will not be bullied. The leader has said Iran will be flexible. But they are telling the radicals that the negotiators do not have a free hand, they do not have the final word. This is also a message to the west not to push too hard.
"The Obama administration is still increasing the pressure by raising human rights and missiles. The US is looking for other problems. If the west thinks by pressure and isolation they can force Iran to do what they want, it is making a very bad mistake," they said.
"It would be better for the western countries to make a deal by the 20 July deadline, but it would not be a problem for Iran if the deadline was missed."
The Power Loader from Aliens is now a reality—except this one is even more powerful.
Designed and built by US robotics company Sarcos, the Guardian GT has 7-foot arms that can each lift up to 500 pounds and execute dextrous maneuvers such as turning a valve or pushing a button. Unlike the clunky Power Loader, this dual-limbed robot is kinematically equivalent to the human body, which means its arms move simultaneously with their human operator, at the same speed.
“Instead of lifting a thousand pounds, you feel like you're lifting five,” Sarcos CEO Ben Wolff told Wired. The robot is meant for use in heavy industry, and for dangerous tasks like exploring and cleaning toxic environments.
The Guardian GT also sends real-time video and force feedback to its operator, which means they see (via custom goggles) from the robot's point of view, and also feel pressure when its arms make contact with objects. Because it's so intuitive, even people without training can use the machine. That should be helpful when the aliens arrive.
Ireland, it would seem, has officially decided to just start living up to all the ugliest stereotypes the rest of the world has about it. Exhibit A: The local council for Kerry County in south-west Ireland has approved a measure that would allow police to issue permits to people living in rural areas that would allow them to drive drunk legally. The new rule was proposed by council member Danny Healy-Rae, who we hope to God was drunk when they came up with this idea, if only because the other option is them being stupid all the time.
Healy-Rae's unprecedented argument for more drunk driving stems from the fact that some of their older constituents “are being isolated now at home, and a lot of them falling into depression,” apparently because they can't drive home a little sauced from the pub, which is known to be one of the leading causes of depression nowhere, ever. Setting aside for a moment the fact that depression doesn't actually work that way, is there any reason those folks couldn't spend the last hours of their time out among friends drinking a club soda or two? Oh, they would rather drive home a danger to themselves and others? Well, now I see the argument. Healy-Rae also pointed out that folks he's arguing for the permit for live in lightly trafficked rural areas, where you'd have to be a drunk idiot to hit someone with your car, which you would think would be an argument against more drunk idiots on the road, but is apparently not.
The BBC reports that Healy-Rae, who had the truly surprising grace and good sense to stop their speech before suggesting that some folks might drive better when they've had a couple, brought the motion up for a vote toward the end of a council meeting from which more than a dozen voting members had already departed, and it passed with just five votes for to three against, with the seven remaining members abstaining. And it's just a coincidence, surely, that most of the ‘Yea' votes came from council members who, like Healy-Rae, also just happen to own bars.
This fact, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with their passage of a bill that would allow them to serve more booze to intoxicated people who would shortly be operating motor vehicles. Even suggesting so would be an offense to a noble group of people who just want to see more inebriated people behind the wheels of Ireland's automobiles, as God intended.
The vote doesn't mean that the permits will be issued, as the matter now goes to the justice department of Ireland for approval.

The number of people illegally crossing the U.S. southern border has dropped 40 percent in President Trump's first full month in office, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said Wednesday.
According to Fox News:
“U.S. Customs and Border Patrol reported that the number of illegal border crossings dropped from 31,578 to 18,762 persons. Kelly said border agents usually see a 10 to 20 percent increase in illegal immigrant apprehensions from January to February.”
John Kelly also stated:
“The drop in apprehensions shows a marked change in trends. Since the administration's implementation of executive orders to enforce immigration laws, apprehensions and inadmissible activity is trending toward the lowest monthly total in at least the last five years.”
The new numbers are welcoming news for Trump who campaigned on illegal immigration crackdown.
Trump signed an executive order increasing border security and authorizing the construction of their promised border wall along the southern border in the first few days of their presidency. Trump also seeks to hire about 5,000 additional border patrol officials and 10,000 ICE agents and seeks to fast-track deportations.
“We will remain vigilant to respond to any changes in these trends, as numbers of illegal crossings typically increase between March and May,” Kelly said. “However, the early results show that enforcement matters, deterrence matters, and that comprehensive immigration enforcement can make an impact.”

My first job as a State Registered Nurse in mid-1980s Britain was night shift on an Acute Geriatric ward in Portsmouth. The shifts were long—eleven and a half hours—and it was hard, physical work. All sorts of strange things happen at night. At times it felt as though the ward was bewitched—sometime around midnight. Hospital patients who were perfectly sane during daylight hours became confused, frenzied and belligerent after darkness fell. Nakedness, for some reason and for some patients, became an urgent necessity as did climbing over bed rails or side tables. Zimmer frames (walking frames) and walking aids so benign on dayshift, transformed into fencing weapons at night as patients who had bottled up a lifetime of frustration finally let go. Keeping sparing patients apart can occupy nurses for hours at night. Hiding potential weapons does not always help as water jugs and cups can become flying missiles at night. Patients in Britain, unlike the United States, cannot be physically restrained in any way and so “sitting” with an agitated patient is the only action to prevent falls or the accidental maiming of another patient.
As a student, I spent three months on night duty on a medical ward. I learned several things. First, the ward lights are only ever partially dimmed at night and so no-one sleeps. Second, the sweetest daytime patient can become demon-possessed at night. Third, even comatose patients regain consciousness at night and like to shout very loudly and those who go to physical therapy during the day like to practice walking and climbing at night. Fourth, medications given to promote sleep don't work and more often have the opposite effect. Lastly, most deaths occur when the nursing team is exhausted.
I began my new job in April 1986. The ward had thirty-six beds and, more often than not, all were full. I was in charge at night with a State Enrolled Nurse (SEN) and usually two, or if we were really lucky, three Nursing Assistants (NAs). We were all entitled to an hour break during the night but sleeping during the break was prohibited and was cause for “instant dismissal” if discovered by the supervisor. Watching other people sleep made the need for a good kip all the more compelling and the knowledge that I couldn't nap, even on my break, was the best antidote to insomnia ever. But I also knew that I was responsible for anything that happened on my break and that I couldn't actually leave the ward unless the night supervisor relieved me which only happened if the rest of the hospital wasn't busy.
Every night shift (and day shift!) began the same way with the ubiquitous tea round, followed by the nightly drug round that occupied myself and the other licensed nurse for at least an hour while the nursing assistants fluffed pillows, handed out bed-pans, escorted patients to the bathroom and generally tidied up the ward. Inevitably, if there was an empty bed it filled during the night as Casualty (ER) sent any patient over 65 with medical or surgical emergencies to my ward for observation or surgical preparation.
One evening around midnight, I answered the call from Casualty to say that they were sending us an elderly blind woman who had fallen down the stairs at home. No broken bones but they lived alone and needed observation and some social services before discharge. The patient arrived and I immediately began to orient them to the ward. “You are at the hospital in Portsmouth. You fell at home and so we are keeping you here tonight. My name is nurse Trudgen, I'm going to look after you” I began, “If you need anything, use this call bell and I will help you.” “Who are you?” the patient asked? “I'm the night nurse and you are in the hospital,” I replied. “Who did you say you were?” the patient asked again. Ah, thought I, they are also a little hard of hearing. I then proceeded to tell them more loudly that I was the night nurse and that they had fallen and was in the hospital. By this time we had an audience. The three other patients in the room were awake and apparently mesmerized by the conversation. My new patient was clearly getting upset and so I tried really hard to orient them to what was happening to calm their fears. Finally, the patient pulled themselves up in bed and asked me in a very loud and indignant voice, “Nurse Turdgen, do you always break into people's houses in the middle of the night?” Speechless, I tried to ignore the muffled chuckling of the other patients. I asked loudly if they would like a cup of tea. They said yes. I left the room only to return to the same conversation over and over again throughout the night. Apparently Casualty had “forgotten” to let me know my patient had recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
The next evening, another admission arrived, this time from the local city Psychiatric Hospital via Casualty. I was more prepared for a confused patient who might need some extra attention. My patient, a small and slightly emaciated woman in a fetal position, didn't seem confused just frightened by their new surroundings. They refused a cup of tea and the bedpan and closed their eyes. That evening we were rushed off our feet. Call bells rang constantly and my team raced around trying to answer them all.
It was hectic. I called for help from the night supervisor as I had no other licensed nurse to help with the drug round (two licensed nurses were required to administer any drug in Britain). The night supervisor came, took one look and called another nurse to help them with the drugs while I answered the incessant calls. One patient in particular kept calling. They were in a four-bedded room with three other patients who were annoyed by their constant calls. I knew the patient from the two previous nights. The calling was unusual and after the fifth call, I decided to stay with them I remembered being told in training that sometimes a patient can become agitated before a cardiac event or even respiratory arrest. I brought the crash cart into the room and called the nursing supervisor to get the EKG cart (it was shared between two wards). I then asked the supervisor to call the doctor. By this time I had a feeling we might need to resuscitate my patient and I wanted everyone ready. I pulled the curtains for privacy.
The doctor arrived quickly and placed the patient on the EKG machine and attempted to start an IV (doctors, not nurses, start IVs in Britain). The EKG machine registered a straight line. The doctor assumed the machine was faulty and asked the supervisor to get another. As they ran to get another machine, I looked at my patient and then tried to catch the doctor's eye. They were intent upon starting the IV. The new machine arrived and the supervisor made the necessary connections and looked flabbergasted when the straight line night appeared yet again. The doctor, very frustrated by now, started checking the wires of the EKG as did the supervisor. Finally, trying to keep the other patients in the room from knowing what was happening, I hissed, “Look at the patient!” Even without a medical degree I knew they were dead. The doctor turned and their face suddenly registered the truth. The EKG machines were in perfect working order. Our patient had experienced a massive cardio-vascular accident that had killed them instantly. All our attempts to resuscitate the patient failed.
I knew from the notes that the patient was married and that their husband was wheelchair-bound. I didn't know what to do. Should I call now and leave them grieving and unable to come in to the hospital all night? Or should I call early in the morning when their neighbors could drive them to the hospital? I decided on the second course of action especially as the ward was so busy.
Meanwhile, one of the nursing assistants came to find me. Apparently one of the patients had climbed out of bed and onto the nightstand and, wielding their orthopedic walking stick, had threatened to hit the man in the next bed. By the time we arrived back in the room, the patient had been assisted back into bed by another nurse but not before they had urinated all over their pajamas and the orthopedic lounge chair in front of their nightstand. The doctor who had followed me assessed the situation and ordered a sedative for the attacker and the potential victim. I filled in the incident report.
Just then, the semi-comatose uremic patient in the private side room began shouting for their mother. They were well into their eighties but I sympathized with their need for comfort and hurried in to see them before they pulled out their urinary catheter and IV. I was too late. The IV site was bleeding profusely and their penis appeared red and swollen and the catheter tip was bloodied. The patient was really agitated but calmed a little as I spoke softly and held their arm with one hand and reached for the call bell with the other. The doctor came running and re-started the IV and prescribed a sedative. Once the patient was calm, we changed the linen and I decided to call their daughter to come and sit with them as we were clearly understaffed. The patient's daughter, a former nurse herself, came willingly and quickly.
Out of the corner of my eye I saw one of our patients walking towards the door with a suitcase in their hand. In a panic, I ran to the door and asked the patient where they were going and could I help? Without saying a word, the patient turned around and walked, suitcase in hand, to their bed. They then unpacked the suitcase and got back into bed. A few minutes later, I saw the same patient with their suitcase, making for the door again. Again, I ran to stop them escaping and they returned to their bed, unpacked their suitcase and got back into bed. I asked one of the nursing assistants to keep an eye on the patient and went to read them notes. The patient had fallen at home and was unsteady on their feet. The doctor had ordered intensive physical therapy that week. Clearly they were practicing and continued to do so all night, despite the sleeping pills.
I needed a cup of tea badly. It was 1am. Just then, one of the nursing assistants, apparently reading my mind, handed me a cup of tea and told me to sit down and drink it. I did as they told me and then they broke the news. The newly admitted patient from the Psychiatric hospital was dead. The SEN had taken their vital signs at ten; the supervisor had given them meds; the nursing assistant had made sure the patient was warm enough and comfortable and could reach the call bell. In all the bedlam of the past few hours, everyone thought the patient had fallen asleep. I ran to the office to check the patient chart. They were seventy-six, had no next of kin listed and had been institutionalized at sixteen. This patient, like so many others, had probably had an illegitimate child or had been caught with a boyfriend and institutionalized for life by their shamed family. I felt sad. No, I felt sick that this woman had died alone. I called the doctor. Horrified I came to understand that because this patient had died in the hospital before the passage of 24 hours, a postmortem was required. As I performed the “laying out” rituals I had been taught to show respect for the dead with the nursing assistant, I cried tears of shame that I had failed to show more respect and care for this patient during their life.
We finished preparing the patient, called the porters to take their body to the hospital morgue and sat down to another cup of tea. The ward had finally settled down for the night. It was 5.30am. We had thirty minutes before we had to start the morning routine—tea, drugs and blood pressures. We were all exhausted.
After the drug round was over, I went to the office and shut the door. I had to call the husband of my first dead patient. I rang and they immediately picked up the phone. For some unknown reason, nurses were not allowed to tell the next of kin that their relative was dead. I have absolutely no idea why. As I started to say who I was and that I was the night nurse at the hospital, the gentleman interrupted me. “Is they gone?” they asked. “Yes,” replied and added truthfully that I was with them when they passed away. They thanked me profusely for that act of kindness and then told me they had been unable to sleep all night because they “had a feeling something was wrong.” I felt sick. Had I made the wrong decision not to call them until the morning?
About 400 soldiers at Fort Gordon in Augusta, Georgia, were forced to sit through a training session that included a bullet-point discussion on “white privilege,” and outraged members of the social media community now say the instructor should be hit with a dishonorable discharge.
One bullet point read, the Blaze reported: “Race privilege gives whites little reason to pay a lot of attention to African Americans or to how white privilege affects them. To be white in America means not having to think about it.”

An image of that slide was posted to Facebook, and response was quick.
“That should be instant UCMJ and Dishonorable Discharge for the instructor who deviated in this manner,” one wrote.
And another, from a military member: “Pretty sick of hearing about white privilege. Nearly my entire chain of command and BCO support channel have been Hispanic or black since I joined.”
The training class was billed as an equal-opportunity seminar and shown to 400 or so soldiers with the 67th Signal Battalion at Fort Gordon, said Captain Lindsay Roman in USA Today.
The segment of the slideshow presentation that involved “white privilege” was called “The Luxury of Obliviousness.”
Roman said the instructor was out of line.
“The unit instructor deviated from the authorized topic and content which was provided,” Roman said to USA Today. “To prevent further instances, all unit instructors will receive additional training on the importance of following Army EO training requirements.”
San Diego Comic Con is starting up very soon, and from July 20 through July 23, you can hang out in San Diego with Nintendo and all the activities the company has planned for fans. There's going to be a decidedly larger presence from Nintendo in SDCC this year, with a playable version of Super Mario Odyssey at the SDCC booth as well as an enormous ballroom at the Marriott Marquis & Marina transformed into a “Nintendo paradise.”
The ballroom will house games like Splatoon 2 and Pokken Tournament DX as well as the upcoming Flip Wars, which is headed to the Nintendo eShop on Nintendo Switch on August 10. Several different 3DS games will be on offer as well, playable on the New Nintendo 2DS XL before it officially releases later this year. You can play the games and engage in competitions to potentially win Nintendo-themed prizes, such as a possible Super NES Classic Edition. There'll even be Splatoon 2-themed competitions and cosplayers to take photos with.
If you're more interested in competing with other fans, you can take part in the Play Nintendo Challenge, where you can square off against others in a Turf War match in Splatoon 2. There's plenty to do, it sounds like, so if you're going to be in town and planning on checking out SDCC as it is, you'll want to make it your business to stop by what Nintendo has planned, especially if you can't wait to get your hands on Super Mario Odyssey. October sure does seem a long way away when you think about how long you have to wait to play that game.

In 1970 a barrel of crude oil averaged about $13 a barrel. Adjusted for inflation, that same barrel of oil should cost about $78 today. Instead, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil for April delivery traded at just under $50 a barrel in the noon hour on Friday.
With crude prices at multidecade lows, Saudi Arabia pushed its OPEC partners into adopting a policy of no production cuts and letting the market decide the winner. What Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi understands — and what many other oil industry experts fail to understand — is summed up in a question they asked at an OPEC conference in December 2014. In a paper by energy economist Philip Verleger, Naimi is quoted:
[I]s there a black swan the don't know about which will come by 2050 and we will have no demand [for oil]?
To guard against that (remote) possibility, the Saudis did not cut production to force prices up for every producer, but they took the more sensible step of calling into question the feasibility of all the hugely expensive hydrocarbon projects that were started in the middle of the past decade.
ALSO READ: Is a Crude Oil Super Contango in Our Future?
Naimi also said that they get a “sense that people want to get rid of coal, oil, and gas.” The recent agreement between China and the United States on further steps to slow global warming is just the latest indication of that desire to rid the world of hydrocarbons.
Production costs in the Canadian oil sands, for example, cannot come close to production costs in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait. The same can be said for projects in the Arctic and in ultra deepwater. Virtually all those projects were begun before horizontal drilling and fracking became common in North America, and virtually all require a crude oil price closer to $100 a barrel than to $50 a barrel in order to make a profit. Even horizontal drilling and fracking cannot compete with conventional production in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) said last week that it would reduce capital spending by about 12% year-over-year in 2015 to approximately $34 billion and that capital spending over the following two years would be below $34 billion. Still, production is expected to rise by 300,000 barrels a day in 2015 and by another 400,000 barrels a day by the end of 2017.
The question becomes whether Exxon, or any of the supermajors for that matter, is likely to begin a new, wildly expensive project in the next few years if crude oil prices remain in a range of $50 to $75 a barrel. As the economy recovers and interest rates rise, where will the billions of dollars needed to fund those projects come from if crude oil price projections remain close to the cost of production?
Low prices will, of course, push up demand. We only need to look at the boost in U.S. sales of full-size pickups and sport utility vehicles to see the impact of low gasoline prices on demand for less fuel-efficient vehicles.
ALSO READ: Sustainable Energy Taking a Larger Role in U.S. Economy
As long as Saudi Arabia doesn't blink — and there is no reason to expect it to do so — the country can keep the pressure on prices and ultimately force high-cost producers to decide how long they can continue to pump oil and lose money. It may take several years, even a few decades, with a lot of ups and downs, but in the long run, the last oil man standing is likely to be a Saudi, and they are likely to be selling oil for the 2050 equivalent of $13 a barrel.
A church pastor caught up in a patent battle over foam arrows is about to get assistance from the nation's best-known slayer of patent trolls, Newegg top lawyer Lee Cheng.
Newegg will donate more than $10,000 it has made from selling anti-patent-troll T-shirts to Jordan Gwyther, who owns Larping.org, a hub for the live action role-play (LARP) community. Gwyther was sued last year by Global Archery. Global Archery founder John Jackson said he's ticked off that Gwyther has tried to sell foam arrows to the camps, churches, and resorts that make up the bulk of Jackson's customers.
The Global Archery lawsuit is an attempt "to drive a passionate entrepreneur out of business," Cheng said in an e-mail to Ars. "We were absolutely appalled by Global's attempt to impose a gag order on Mr. Gwyther."
In addition, Newegg will sell three new anti-troll T-shirts for $19.99 each, and all proceeds are going to Gwyther. The black T-shirt features a "patent troll" cowering under a barrage of foam arrows. The slogan reads: "Troll Hunters—Fight Trolls Don't Feed Them."
Another T-shirt design identifies the wearer as a "Level 90 Troll Hunter," while the third declares, "We see you Trollin', we're hatin'."
Cheng says that while Global Archery is an operating company, it still meets their criteria for being a patent troll.
"Global is asserting questionable IP rights aggressively and counting on the high cost of defensive litigation to win, so we consider it a troll," Cheng said. "Newegg hates trolls—they bully the weak, they hurt consumers, they hurt America, and they just suck."
Cheng continued:
We are also part of a creative and passionate community—our customers are technology enthusiasts often called geeky, and we geeky types like to stick together. Based on their actions and words, we do not consider Mr. Jackson a geek, and hereby designate Global Archery a Non-Geek Business Enterprise (NGBE). We mock them, and their legal positions. We declare that Newegg is a much better business than Global Archery—please sue us! Please file another gag order! Burn through that $150,000 war chest faster! Make your lawyers super happy—they have bills to pay too!
In an interview with Ars, Gwyther said they hadn't heard of Cheng before they posted in comments in an Ars Technica article. "I got like nine screenshots of that [comment] sent to me in a matter of minutes," they said.
"I'm overwhelmed with gratitude," said Gwyther. "It's been really great to have someone who knows their stuff to look at this from the outside."
Gwyther was sued last year and took the incident public last month when they made a video about their view that the foam-arrow lawsuit threatens the LARP community.
Meanwhile, the litigation moves forward in the Indiana federal court where Gwyther got sued. The two parties are presently battling over jurisdictional issues.
Update: In an email to Ars, Jackson said their company is dropping its patent claims after seeing more prior art. They added that Cheng's "patent troll" comments were out of line.
"Global Archery manufactures arrows and is a legitimate business," Jackson explained. "Further, this is the first time Global Archery has asserted its patents against anyone. As such, we believe that Mr. Cheng's comments are unfounded and made without all of the facts."
If there's anything to moan about when it comes to Splatoon 2 – and your options are limited because the ink-flinging shooter sequel is brilliant – it's that it sees Nintendo eschewing its recent pursuit of genre reinvention. Splatoon was innovative enough, the thinking seems to go, so no room here for anything like Breath of the Wild's startling take on open-world adventuring, or Arms' radically new form of fighting – this is all about low-key refinement. Splatoon 2 is very much more of the same, but better.
But there's one big exception. Salmon Run, Splatoon 2's new co-op focussed “horde” mode, shows at least some of Nintendo's new-found spirit of radical reinvention in action. In the run-up to Splatoon 2's release I didn't give a sticky squid about Salmon Run, but now I've finally had chance to spend some time with it (and by ‘some', I mean, ‘all the time than Nintendo's servers would permit') I think it might actually be my favourite thing about Splatoon 2.
Salmon Run sees Nintendo working its usual reductive magic on a number of familiar shooter tropes, boiling them down to their absolute essence, then carefully building them back up into something brilliant. The end result is a frenzied, wave-based blend of boss rush and horde mode, and the kind of purely cooperative mode that was missing in the original Splatoon. It's the perfect complement to Splatoon 2's substantial single-player and competitive multiplayer modes, and gives the sequel a sense of completeness that its predecessor never quite achieved.
Right from the start, Salmon Run feels a little bit different. In favour of the main game's shiny streets and wanton consumerism is something a little grubbier. It all feels so seedy as you sign up for a minimum wage job with the shadowy mega-corp Grizzco and slap on your waders. And your suspicious twilight activities (not to mention the mode's freakish aquatic mutant opponents) make it clear that the original Splatoon's anti-capitalist, pro-environmentalist undercurrent is back in full force.
Salmon Run's setup is simple: four players (whether friends, or strangers) team up to battle an ever-increasing stampede of bug-eyed fish-things and uniquely designed bosses. Each game lasts a break-neck 5 minutes (assuming you don't meet an untimely demise first) and is split across three rounds. Your goal each round is to stay alive, collect the golden eggs dropped by defeated bosses, then deposit them at a fixed point on the map in order to meet your quota.
The result is an absolutely furious tug-of-war game of hide and seek, as you hunt out enemies and attempt to hold back the horde, all while ink flies in and enemies amass in increasingly absurd, and sometimes barely comprehensible, quantities.
Right now, Salmon Run has two maps in rotation and each features the same basic structure – a lower surrounding shoreline rising to a central island – with seemingly-minor differences in their size and design. That's kind of Salmon Run's constant, brilliant trick though; it's full of what look like small, insignificant touches that build into a richly strategic whole, without ever obscuring the elegant simplicity at the core.
Once a round begins, enemies and bosses can approach from any direction, and, at first, it's easy enough to keep control of a map. A handful of opponents will spawn, and your team races over to splat them, summoning assistance with a button press to shout “Over here!” Then it's a quick trip to the drop-off point to deliver some eggs before you start over. Things escalate quickly though: by round three, grunts are pouring in from all sides, and you'll likely have four or five bosses roaming the map in unison – if not more, depending on the speed at which you can dispatch.
Salmon Run is frantic to the point of frenzied, managing to elicit the kind of irresistible rapid-fire adrenaline rush that Splatoon's main multiplayer mode perfected in its original guise. It's almost impossible to say no to another run-through, what with the brevity of each match, and the unexpected tactical depth that leaves you pondering what would happen if you tried things this way and, oh go on then, just one more go.
A great example of Salmon Run's brilliantly focussed simplicity comes with the fact that there are no load-outs: instead weapons are randomised per map, and are randomly assigned to different players each round. You might have a splatter gun one turn, and a paint brush the next, and that immediately affects not only your role but your usefulness in each wave.
Crucially, the seven bosses (ranging from a snake-like curtain of paint with a weak spot on its bottom, to a hulking beast that blows paint balloons out of its blowhole) have very distinct methods of defeat, and your assigned weapon won't always be up to the task. That means you'll need to understand the intricacies of each weapon in relation to your targets, and, vitally, learn to complement each other as a team.
As with Turf Wars, Salmon Run soon reveals its strategic undercurrent, where lightning-fast observation, on-the-fly strategizing, and speedy implementation are crucial. And, once again, the whole thing is so intuitively designed that communication is barely necessary. After a few games teammates instinctively seem to know when to split into the most practical groups possible, playing to the strengths of their weapons and quickly re-adjusting their approach to help downed teammates or to tackle new threats. It's immensely satisfying to be part of.
And then there are the randomised environmental changes. They might look like superficial set-dressing but each has a radical effect on the flow of a run, instantly forcing a strategic rethink. Rising tides hem teams into a single central spot, causing mayhem as everyone struggles and jostles to hold off enemies and bosses with only the scantest of room to manoeuvre.
Lowering tides, meanwhile, have the opposite effect. The massively expanded play area makes it much harder to locate bosses efficiently or even drop off eggs. With more ground to cover, you can easily find yourself overrun by opponents. Then there's visibility reducing fog, or the bizarre night-time turn, which marks a certain player as the target of all incoming enemies, demanding even more co-operation as you work together to shield your unfortunate teammate from harm.
It's amazing how tactically rich and varied Salmon Run's streamlined core becomes with a few small design considerations and apparently subtle additions. It's absurdly exhilarating and does for co-op what Turf Wars did for Splatoon's competitive mode: it adds an enormous amount of depth where, on the surface at least, there appears to be none, all while staying accessible for everyone.
My only real complaint is that it doesn't take long to figure out Salmon Run's seven bosses, or the most effective underlying strategies for victory, meaning that defeat is rare. It's a mode that would definitely benefit from more variety, and increased difficulty, and hopefully it will enjoy the same amount of post-release attention as the rest of Splatoon 2, with new maps, enemies and challenges incoming.
The other mild niggle is that Salmon Run continues Splatoon's trend of locking content to a schedule, presumably in an attempt to minimise matchmaking woes. Salmon Run is currently only playable around four days a week, which is deeply frustrating given how enjoyable it is, and, for that matter, how good its rewards are. Each win raises your employee rank, which in turn increases the multiplier applied to your claimable paycheque. Play smartly and you can net thousands of gold.
The good news though is that Salmon Run's doors are currently open for launch day, so do yourself a favour and ditch the competitive theatrics of Turf Wars for the time being. Sign your soul over to Grizzco, slap on those waders, and enjoy the brilliance of Splatoon's newest addition while you can.

So far the Democrats can't find any evidence of President Donald Trump colluding with Russia to sway the election, but they try so hard.
In Canada however, there's strong evidence of collusion between the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Allah.
Here are a few facts that support this case.
Trudeau once said “Christians are the worst part of Canadian society”
Right after Justin Trudeau got elected they rushed 30,000 Muslim refugees from Syria into Canada, 99% who were Muslims, Christians got left behind.
Trudeau also once said, “If you kill your enemies, they win”
Trudeau also boosted the the payout to convicted terrorist Omar Khadr for the jackpot sum of $10.5 million, and they apologized to him.
So is Justin Trudeau colluding with Allah? Watch below.

Media playback is not supported on this device Hamilton needs to calm down - Massa
Lewis Hamilton's desperation to catch Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel is causing accidents and the Briton needs to "calm down", says Ferrari's Felipe Massa.
McLaren driver Hamilton's season has been marked by incidents, including one which ended Massa's Monaco Grand Prix.
This prompted Formula 1 legends Niki Lauda and Sir Stirling Moss to criticise Hamilton's driving style.
"When you have some difficult races, when maybe you're trying too much, you have to calm down a bit," said Massa.
"It would be better for them too, because they were paying for it.
"He was penalised in a few races. And it wasn't just with me, they even hit their own team-mate!
"But Lewis is a clever guy and I'm sure they are already knows this."
2011 DRIVER STANDINGS S. Vettel (Ger) Red Bull 186 points J. Button (GB) McLaren 109 M. Webber (Aus) Red Bull 109 L. Hamilton (GB) McLaren 97 F. Alonso (Spa) Ferrari 87 F. Massa (Bra) Ferrari 42
Hamilton's coming together with McLaren team-mate Jenson Button at the Canadian Grand Prix has been the low-point of an eventful 2011 campaign for the 2008 world champion.
Having been punished for two accidents in Monaco, Hamilton went to Montreal a fortnight later and got involved in three separate incidents in the first eight laps, the last being a collision with Button.
It was this episode that provoked Lauda to describe Hamilton, who was forced to retire with a puncture, as "completely mad".
But Button, who would go on to win the race, defended Hamilton afterwards, saying their team-mate was "a racer, a fighter" and "one of the best drivers F1 has seen".
For their part, Hamilton has reacted angrily to the comments about their driving style and has restated their intention to keep pressing hard to overhaul the dominant Red Bulls.
Vettel, the defending champion, comes into Sunday's British Grand Prix at Silverstone with a 77-point lead, having won six of eight Grands Prix this year.
Massa, who is sixth in the standings, 144 points behind Vettel, acknowledges the German is now the "complete driver" having ironed out the mistakes that once saw them record too many non-finishes.
I am still aggressive and quick and will keep pushing for victories Felipe Massa Ferrari
"Vettel is a good driver and he's got a great car, which is a great position to be in," said Massa. "He's learned a lot and has certainly had a great championship so far. But the season is not over."
Massa, who finished a very close second to Hamilton in 2008, downplayed suggestions that new rules coming into force this weekend could bring the Red Bulls back to the pack.
When asked about the banning of the Red Bull-pioneered "off-throttle blown diffusers" (an exhaust system that generates downforce), the 30-year-old said it was impossible to say what impact the change would have as all the top teams used the system and would lose performance.
A popular figure in the sport, Massa gained considerable sympathy for their return from a career-threatening accident in 2009, when debris from another car hit their helmet at high speed. That kept them out of racing for six months but their comeback race in 2010 saw them finish second behind team-mate Fernando Alonso.
Subsequent results have not been so good but Massa is adamant they are no less a driver than they were prior to their injury.
"We didn't have a great season last year but I believe in my team, my engineers and myself - I am still aggressive and quick and will keep pushing for victories," they said.
They also shrugged off speculation about their future at Ferrari, saying they had a contract for next season and may even stay longer at the team they have loyally served for five years.
Child dead, two others injured after rally car ploughs into spectators in Western Australia
Updated
A six-year-old boy has been killed and two others have been seriously injured by a rally car which ploughed into a group of spectators at an event in Western Australia's south-west.
The Subaru WRX driven by a 44-year-old man was taking part in the WA Rally Championship event at Donnelly River late on Saturday afternoon when it left the road and hit the group, police say.
The car was travelling south on Penny Road when it lost control on approach to a right-hand bend and slid through temporary barriers and into the crowd.
The two injured children were flown with their mother to Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital overnight.
An eight-year-old girl is in a serious condition and a 10-year-old boy is serious but stable.
Police said neither the driver nor their navigator were injured.
Police remain at the scene and officers from the Major Crash squad are investigating.
The crash happened between the towns of Manjimup and Nannup, about 280 kilometres south of Perth.
Police will review vision from the dashboard camera today.
The Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS) has released a statement saying it was "saddened" by the incident and extended its sincere condolences to family and friends of those involved.
CAMS Chief Executive Officer Eugene Arocca said the thoughts of CAMS and the Australian motor sport community were with them at this difficult time.
"This is a sad and tragic incident and we extend our deepest sympathies to all involved," they said.
The statement said CAMS would assist WA Police with their investigations.

In this video series from Buddhadharma, Ajahn Brahm offers four short, insightful teachings.
The editors of Buddhadharma were fortunate to have a visit with Theravada Buddhist monk Ajahn Brahm. Brahm is normally found in Western Australia, where they are the Abbot of Bodhinyana Monastery and a famous advocate for the full ordination of Buddhist nuns.  They are also the author of many books including Kindfulness, Who Ordered This Truckload of Dung?, and Mindfulness, Bliss, and Beyond.
Ajahn Brahm sat down in front of our camera to talk about working with, um, shitty and painful experiences and building Buddhist communities. As you'll see, theirs can be a funny, inspiring, and unconventional approach to teaching the dharma. Enjoy.
How to Make the Most of the “Shit in Our Lives”
Transcript
So we all get shit in our lives. Some people get born in shit. Some people grow into shit. And some have shit thrust upon them. That's paraphrasing Winston Churchill. When you do have shit thrust upon you, accept it — you've got no choice — and you dig it in. Under an apple tree. In a garden. We all know that shit is incredible fertilizer.
I love telling people: if you dig in the shit of your life, under the apple tree, then one year later, your apples will be sweeter and juicier than ever before. But you must always remember, when you bite in to that apple, and when you taste its succulent flesh, and the juice drips down your cheek — you must always remember what you are really eating. You're eating shit. Only its been transformed into juicy apple! And that's the story of life.
We all have our difficulties and problems. Our sufferings in life. But we learn how to dig those in and turn them into the beautiful flowers of compassion and the beautiful fruit of wisdom.

How to Accept Your Most Painful Moments
Transcript
When you see people who have these traumatic experiences and they try and push them away. They try and reject them. They're trying to get rid of them, and that does not work.
So, the great compassion, which we teach in Buddhism, it's not just for all sentient beings, it's for all experiences as well. Come in. You're part of me.
And some of these people have got huge amount of courage. To actually do that and have these gross experiences come right into your heart, rather than trying to keep them out, takes huge, huge guts. But when they do, they're free.

Fulfilling the Buddha's Dream Again
Transcript
Buddhism is taking off. It's getting very strong in this world. Obviously we need more monks and nuns, more teachers, more leaders. But that's coming. But, you know, Buddhism has been going for 2500 years. It does take time to establish in the West. But it's got roots now. And those roots — many trees are coming up, and soon those trees will become a forest in the Western world. You can't stop it.
So, great time to be alive — especially talking about the bhikkhunis, the nuns' ordination. That's historic. When they write the history of Buddhism, these are things which will be right there in the center of the history books. After a thousand years or more. Where, there was bhikkhunis — fully ordained Buddhist nuns — standing shoulder to shoulder with the monks, teaching, helping, serving, inspiring. They disappeared for a thousand years. And now, in our lifetime, they're coming back again. That gives me goosebumps. That I could be part of that — a small part of that — is incredible. And to see that you've given this huge boost to the dhamma.
It's not only in the West, because that has a reverse going to the traditional Buddhist lands and reminding people that this was the Buddha's wish, from the time of their enlightenment: to establish monks and nuns, laypeople, laywomen, and now we're fulfilling the Buddha's dream again.

Why the Buddhist Sangha is the World's Oldest Democracy
Transcript
As a Buddhist, no matter what tradition, we take refuge. Refuge was always in “Buddha, dhamma, sangha.” It was never, “the Buddha, the dhamma, and Ajahn Brahm.” Never in, “Buddha, dhamma, and your guru or your teacher, your roshi.”
Buddha, dhamma, and sangha.
The problem comes when we take refuge in a person, not the institution of a sangha. And when we have a person who's given power — power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. So, we try and get Buddhist institutions with no one as a leader.
When the Buddha passed away — before the Buddha passed away, in the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, they asked him, “Who will take over the sangha, Buddhism, once you've passed away?” And the Buddha replied, “No one will take over. The teachings, the training — that will be your teacher from now on.”
Sometimes we forget that, and we install people in positions of power rather than installing the teachings, the training in positions of power.
I often tell university students that the longest-sustaining democracy in the world is the Buddhist sangha. Our constitution is fully democratic. One monk, one nun, one vote. We don't have leaders as such. And that's the motto which I have in the monastery where I am. I often get outvoted by my sangha, and I'm proud of that. If they always followed what I wanted, I'd get very concerned. If they gave me that power, even with the best one in the world, you'll abuse it. So let the community, the democracy have that power. Not a person.

China's crude oil import up 11% in first half
(Xinhua)
Updated: 2008-07-10 21:58
BEIJING -- China, the world's second-largest energy consumer, imported 11 percent more crude oil in the first half of 2008 than in the year-earlier period.
Crude imports stood at 90.53 million tons, the General Administration of Customs said on Thursday. The growth rate was down 0.2 percentage points from last year.
The imports were valued at 64.98 billion US dollars, up 85.8 percent, as world prices surged. Import prices hit a record high of 849.10 US dollars per ton in June.
Angola, Saudi Arabia, and Iran were the top three oil suppliers.
China also imported 21.01 million tons of refined oil products in the first half, up 16.4 percent year-on-year.
Meanwhile, the country exported 2.37 million tons of crude and 7.88 million tons of refined products, up 30.6 percent and down 0.3 percent, respectively, from a year earlier.
So you've assigned your first group project and thoroughly explained the requirements to your students and you now want to make sure that your students are productive and efficient. Fortunately, there are a few things that you can do to facilitate the interaction and progress of each group.
1. Raise The Bar
Before assigning the groups, it's important to set the tone for the quality of work you expect from students. Raise the bar high, and your students will meet it and possibly exceed it. Set the bar too low, and you'll be disappointed with the quality of your students' work, and they'll never really know what they are truly capable of achieving. Never make the mistake of assuming that a student's socio-economic background, age, or cultural background will prevent them from achieving spectacular results if they are properly trained and prepared by you.
Impress on the students the importance of the project they are about to embark on and what they will learn from it. Clearly explain to your students that you have very high-standards and that you expect them to exceed these standards. It helps to show students what you mean by all of this.
There are two things that you can do to help you make the point:
Show them: I usually keep copies of the best projects that were ever created in my classes. I share them with my current students, and I describe what made these projects exceptional. I then inform the students that I expect their project to be even better. Since my projects include a portfolio and presentation, I share copies of the portfolios, and I show students video clips of some of the presentations and the behind-the-scene work that went into producing them. Where did the video come from? I video recorded my students myself using a camcorder. I'd recommend purchasing an inexpensive HD camcorder with a mic input of possible, but if that's not within your means or budget, your smartphone will suffice for now. Describe Quality Work: I expect my students work to be:
Professional
Accurate
Consistent
Competitive
I spend a few minutes going over each of those bullet points and explain what they mean to me. I define each bullet and elaborate on what the students can do to implement these things in their project. You can present points on a list of “dos” and “don'ts” if it helps you clarify things.
2. Greet and Meet
Once you've assigned the groups, instruct your students to form a circle and then greet each person in their group and introduce themselves. This shouldn't take more than 5 minutes. Yes, I realize that they're not children, but even adult college students need to be directed. Especially when they find themselves surrounded by a group of people who they may not really know and are expected to work with and evaluate at the end of the project.
3. Communication Protocol
Once the pleasantries are over with, have each student pull out a piece of paper and write their name, email address, and phone-number on it. Once done, they will each need to pass that paper to the person sitting on their right. The person who receives the paper will add their name and contact details to the list and pass it on. The idea is to make sure that every person in the group ends up with a list of all of their group members and their contact information.
Have the group discuss and agree on a primary mode of communication and frequency. In addition to email and phone, encourage the students to meet in-person outside of class and utilize available free technology such as Google Hangouts or Skype. It's too easy and convenient not to take advantage of.
I find that my student population isn't very tech savvy beyond texting, which is why I typically either demonstrate the use of technology that they can use or I'll provide a link to a YouTube video that does that for me. Most of my classes are hybrid classes, so once I've assigned the groups, I will create group forums on Moodle (the learning management system that my school uses) to provide a space where students can post their progress, exchange files, and solicit feedback from team members.
4. Talent Inventory
Now that the students know who is in their group and how to get in touch with them, it's time to figure out what talents, skills, and expertise each person brings to the group. Ask the group to conduct a talent inventory.
Have each student share what talents, skills, or expertise they possess. Even if they do not think it is related to the class or project. Give students a few examples such as the ones below to get them started:
Internet research
Artistic talents
Graphics design
Use of specific software: Sketch-up, AutoCAD, PhotoShop, Ai, POS, etc…
Math skills: costing/pricing/calculations
Organizational skills
Culinary skills: recipe creation, food production
Communication Skills: public speaking, presentations
Entertainment: singing, dancing, etc…
Yes, even knowing that someone can sing and dance is helpful. I once had a student group that developed an Italian restaurant (concept-to-creation), which meant they had to conceive of a business theme and develop and run the business by the end of the semester. One of the group members happened to be in the college choir. Them singing talent although unrelated to the class became the live entertainment for the restaurant the students had developed. They delivered a beautiful rendition of ‘A Vucchella.'
The talent inventory serves two purposes:
It allows students to know what talent and skills are available to the group. And more importantly, it gives the students an opportunity to get to know one another on a more personal level.
5. Leader Nominations
By now, the groups have gotten a chance to hear from everyone and a sense of who is on their team, but they do not have anyone to guide or direct their group, which is why they need to select one person to serve as a group manager. If necessary, allow up to one week for the group to select a manager. However, in smaller classes where the students know each other, this may be done on the same day that the group is assigned.
It is important for you to provide the students with some of the qualities that they should be looking for in their group manager. Be very clear about the fact that this isn't a popularity contest and that their decision will have a direct impact on the performance of the group and their individual grades.
Have the students look within the group for someone that possesses most or all of these qualities:
Enthusiasm
Positive-outlook
Organized
Respectable & Honest
Dependable
Consistent
Open-minded (flexible, democratic)
Accessible when needed
Able to keep the group focused and on track
I specifically have the students reflect on the behavior of each of their group members over the prior weeks to help them with their decision. I remind them that someone who is regularly late, absent, and does not complete or turn in assignments would make a poor leader.
6. Schedule
Before moving forward, have the students pull up their schedules and agree on several days and times when they can get together and meet to work on the project. Depending on the school that you work at, this may be a piece of cake, or this could be the biggest complication that the group encounters. At my school, this is one of the biggest challenges my students face. Everyone commutes. Many of my students work, some are part-time students, some are full-time students, and it is virtually impossible for the entire group to get together outside of class time.
To address this problem, I allocate no less than 4 classes where the students are able to work with their groups. Additionally, I have the students meet with as many people as they can from their group and keep the ones who are not able to meet in the loop with reports. I also encourage students to try to rearrange their schedule if possible.
7. Measurable Deadlines
It is important for the group to have something very specific to work on during the first week. They already know what the project is about because you have already given it to them with the requirements and details. But what is next? Where do they go from here? Starting can be difficult for some students, so provide them with specific things that they can work on together as a group within the next week. The group should expect to report on the progress of each measurable item you ask them to work on.
Here's a sample of measurable things that I expect from groups within the first week:
Select a manager.
Select a name for the group or project.
Clearly define the Business/Project concept.
Division of labor. Each group member must have a clearly defined position (job title) and task(s).
Provide a detailed schedule of all tasks/duties
Select a location for the business and complete the demographics research to support the location choice.
Question: What challenges have the group faced within the first week?
Question: How do you plan on approaching these challenges, if any?
A weekly list of task deadlines that will help the students move through the project with focus.
8. Follow-up & Feedback
Be sure to follow-up with every group and ensure that they are meeting their weekly deadlines. Provide feedback and offer guidance, but refrain from hovering too long and do not micromanage.
Remember that your students and the work that they produce are a reflection of you. So, what do others see when they look at your students and the work that they produce? How does it make you feel?
So, to recap, the 8 things that you need to do when managing group projects are:
Raise the bar Meet and greet Communication protocol Conduct a talent inventory Nominate a group leader Schedule Set measurable deadlines Follow-up and & feedback

Mister Wallace-a queer Chicago born, Brooklyn-based rapper-has released a video for their new single “It Girl,” and it. Is. Fierce.
The song is from their debut EP FAGGOT, released in February. In the clip, Wallace struts around abandoned houses and junkyards-all while looking fabulous in high-fashion ensembles and performing life-affirming dance moves.
Wallace began writing “It Girl” in 2014, when the Black Lives Matter movement was beginning to get national attention.
“It became clear to me that before I could realize any dream of being a successful artist, I was more likely to become world famous for being gunned down by a racist cop under the protection of the law,” they told The FADER. “I started to imagine how my image would be used by the media to perpetuate this horrific narrative to younger people and it sent me over the edge. ‘It Girl' became my anthem and it kept me alive at a time when lovers and employers felt my blackness and my queerness had gone too far from what's acceptable to mainstream society.”
The video might be serving fierce glamor, but it was shot on a shoestring budget.
“I wanted my video to show a street kid chasing a broken American Dream,” director Ahmed Ibrahim told The FADER. “'It Girl' dreams of fame, glamor, fashion shoots, fast cars and speed boats but they're all beautifully broken, decayed and up on blocks. My team at The Music Video Truck decided to shoot this video in 10 hours with a budget of $400 and a crew of two people, maybe that's what gives it a a kind of tragic glamor.”
Wallace wants this song to transform lives for other queer African-Americans: “My hope is that this song, my truth, gives you LIFE and inspires you to appreciate the lives of those who look and feel like me.”

Damien series creator/executive producer Glen Mazzara isn't sure when A&E will announce whether the series has been renewed, but he's got a lot of stories left to tell and is hoping for more seasons of being able to delve into Damien Thorn (played by Bradley James). In addition to Bradley James as the Antichrist, the series features Barbara Hershey, Scott Wilson, Omid Abtahi, and Megalyn Echikunwoke. Airing on Mondays at 10pm ET/PT, Damien season one consists of 10 one-hour episodes and Mazzara took time prior to the airing of episode seven to discuss the series which serves as a sequel to The Omen.
Glen Mazzara Interview:
I have really been enjoying this season although I find it really strange to be rooting for Damien still so far into the season.
Glen Mazzara: “You will always root for Damien.”
I was just going to ask that very question.
Glen Mazzara: “What we've done is we take the nice guy and we put them in a horrible situation, make them as desperate as possible, so that when they lash out and they fight back and they start to commit atrocities and they go down a path that will hopefully, if we have the chance to tell the whole story, could bring about the end of the world, you'll be rooting in the front seat the whole way, in the front row. But, let's not forget that the Antichrist as promised in the Book of Revelation is supposed to be a savior, a messiah, and people will follow them because they love him, so all the ingredients for the entire arc are already there. I think a lot of people just think he's supposed to be an evil tyrant right off the bat. That is not what's promised in the Book of Revelation.”
No one would follow him.
Glen Mazzara: “Right. That's the whole point.”
Bradley James plays the character so well, it would make it difficult to flip and stop rooting for Damien.
Glen Mazzara: “You'll see, but the point is to make sure that the audience is always rooting for Damien and rooting for all of these characters. I know a lot of people are rooting for Ann Rutledge and John Lyons and they're considered evil, and it's interesting because if anything I think some people are rooting against Detective Shay, and Shay is absolutely right as to what's going on and he's on the force of good, so everything that you think about morality gets flipped on its head in this show.”
Were you keeping track of how people were reacting to the dream episode on Twitter?
Glen Mazzara: “First of all I want to give a shout out to our writer, Richard Hatem. Richard pitched that episode to me from start to finish in the writer's room. I was just so confused as to what they were telling me, and then when they explained the revelation. I loved it and I just said, ‘Go write that.' I think that was really the one script that I, in the four times I've been a showrunner, did not polish. I think I just gave notes to them but I did not put any pen to paper. I thought they just did such an outstanding job with that script. It was just terrific.
As far as on Twitter, when I watch the show I do watch the live Twitter feed and I will say people were freaking out, but nobody saw that twist coming as far as I know. There were three consecutive tweets on the Damien feed that people said, ‘Something's going on, I wonder if this is real,' but nobody mentioned the word ‘dream' until afterwards. It was really kind of interesting because I thought there were so many tells along the way. People were really satisfied. They loved it. Sometimes that kind of episode can feel like a cheat, but because it was really an episode about showing Damien's emotional inner state and their need for wish fulfillment and all those things that they were finally getting because we love them at this point, they were finally getting the things they want, and then to have that ripped away and to find out that their real life is a living hell and that he's trapped in hell, which is where we see them at the end, it was an emotional ride. So it didn't play as just an intellectual game. It played as a real emotional tale.”
How big of a lasting effect is that dream going to have on him? They believe some of what they dreamed is actually the truth.
Glen Mazzara: “Yeah, I think what you see now is Damien realizing they have to trust their gut, that Damien realizes that certain things are a given in the world, in their world, and they can't run from them anymore. They can't deny them, so they have to try to take control of them or fight them or push back or what have you, but I think they realize that they can't trust anybody except himself. The emotions that they felt in that dream are emotions that he's now going to take seriously and act upon, and that may or may not be the right thing to do, but that's where they are now.”
Does that mean Simone and Amani are going to be in more danger now because he's no longer completely sure of their motivations?
Glen Mazzara: “Yeah, I think it puts them at risk. I think anybody in Damien's world is at risk, even if you're on their good side. Because don't forget, people suffer not necessarily because they are jeopardizing the Devil's plans for Damien, but a lot of the deaths… I haven't talked about this. Let me see if I can articulate it. A lot of the deaths are not necessarily simply eliminating threats to the larger plan. A lot of the deaths are there to force Damien to take certain actions. A lot of the deaths are there to box them in. There is a larger plan. Every death makes sense in the larger plan, but they're not as clean as they were in the original movie. If someone was suspicious of Damien and about to expose him, they were killed and eliminated.”
If this were the movie, Detective Shay would be dead already.
Glen Mazzara: “We go much farther than that. It's a much more complicated game.”
We haven't seen much of Veronica (played by Melanie Scrofano), but they seem to have a lot going on behind the scenes. Are we going to find out more about them in the upcoming final season one episode?
Glen Mazzara: “You will. You will, and that's a type of storytelling that I'm embracing on this show because I know the audience has a lot of questions about them and about the mythology and the conspiracies and all of that stuff, and a lot of times I would hold back as a writer and as a showrunner because I would say, ‘We don't have to spoon-feed the audience, the audience will like some mystery. The audience will go along with this as long as we pay things off by the end.' I feel like that's what's important is to pay things off by the finale, that some questions are left but you want to show people that it was a tightly knit season. I think a lot of the questions about Veronica will be answered and going forward a lot of things will be set up in future seasons.”
Is there a supporting character who has become more popular with fans than you anticipated, that maybe will play a larger role in the second season because of the reaction from the audience?
Glen Mazzara: “It's been interesting to see how people react to characters. Obviously Barbara [Hershey's] been doing a phenomenal job and Ann is a lot of people's favorite character. It's been interesting, but I don't want to give anything away by saying anything about future characters, but it is funny how people do respond emotionally to the characters. So for example in episode two Amani was talking to Simone at Kelly's wake and people said, ‘I don't like Amani. He's scamming on Simone at the funeral,' and then two episodes later they are at a job interview for Damien and they stand up for Damien about what a good guy they are and everybody says, ‘I love Amani, he's the best. He's the greatest friend ever.' So it's really kind of funny to watch how people get so invested in these characters.”
It's also amazing you have done this whole season one pretty much up to this point with very few CGI effects. Are we going to see that remain the same way throughout the rest of the season one episode?
Glen Mazzara: “Yes, that's something that we are very careful to make sure that the show feels grounded in this world. If anything I think it's like our world punctured by evil. That's how we've described it here at the show. The film was a direct influence on us in that way, so I never wanted to push this into a show that has fiery portals into different layers of hell or something like that. We'll push it once in a while. You saw the demon at the end of episode four, but then the next time we see a demon it's a voice possessing seven wounded soldiers in episode five. So, we will push that boundary, but it's a show that needs to feel, without sounding silly by saying this, it needs to feel realistic. I think the horror needs to feel like it's in our world, and that's something that we definitely draw upon the feature film, The Omen.
Do you still believe at this point that 10 episodes was the right amount of episodes for a first season?
Glen Mazzara: “I do. I don't think we have any filler. I think we took our time introducing the characters and getting everyone on stage and then just as people got comfortable we threw them a couple curve balls with episode five and six, and then I think seven through 10 still introduce new storylines and stuff, but it just races to the finale. I am very confident that the finale will play well. I will put my entire career on that, because that finale just answers the questions. It's exciting, it's a thrill ride, and I think it's one of the most exciting finales I've been a part of. I really love that episode. There are four [including episode seven]very good episodes, four great episodes coming on, but that finale will satisfy fans, I think.”
Was that finale exactly what you had in mind when you started working on Damien? Was that what you were shooting towards the whole time?
Glen Mazzara: “Yeah. The climactic moment for the finale was something that I conceived of before we sold the show. Yeah, it was part of my pitch as I went around town.”
So A&E hasn't dropped any hints as to when the announcement will come?
Glen Mazzara: “I think they want to look at the entire season and I am confident that because the finale ties everything together in a way that will be satisfying to genre fans, that people will talk about the show and will probably get a boost then. And, I think people will then go back and binge watch. I think viewing habits have changed and so some people I know are catching up because they're hearing good things about the show. But sometimes people say, ‘Well, I want to hear if the whole season comes together before I check it out,' and I think it will be a very satisfying conclusion. Hopefully we will get a jump in numbers as people stream the show and all that stuff, so they probably want to have all their information before [announcing]. But as of now, I hope they announce soon. We're dying to get back to work.”
I know you've said it before, but do you still think that five seasons is what you'd really like?
Glen Mazzara: “Yeah, I think I could do it in five seasons. I think so. If it was really going well and they wanted more, but yeah, in my mind I have a story that is probably five seasons.”
After struggling for weeks and weeks in stages one through four, Republicans are finally entering the final stage of grief over the death of their belief that President Obama would begin offering concessions in exchange for an increase in the debt limit.
The catalyzing event appears to have been an hour-plus-long meeting between Obama and congressional leaders at the White House on Wednesday. Senior administration officials say that if the meeting accomplished only one thing it was to convey to Republican leaders the extent of Obama's determination not to negotiate with them over the budget until after they fund the government and increase the debt limit. These officials say their will here is stronger than at any time since they decided to press ahead with healthcare reform after Scott Brown ended the Democrats' Senate supermajority in 2010.

There's evidence that it sunk in.
First, there's this hot mic moment in which Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell tells Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that the president's position is ironclad.
Then we learn that House Speaker John Boehner has told at least one House Republican privately what they and McConnell have hinted at publicly for months, which is that they won't execute their debt limit hostage. Boehner specifically said, according to a New York Times report, and obliquely confirmed by a House GOP aide, that they would increase the debt limit before defaulting even if they lost more than half their conference on a vote.
None of this is to say that Republicans have "folded" exactly, but they've pulled the curtain back before the stage has been fully set for the final act, and revealed who's being fitted with the red dye packet.
If they got the same explanation from the president that I and several other writers got from senior officials at a White House briefing today, they know that for Obama this is more than just about preventing their own personal embarrassment (at having caved) and more than about their individual legacy (which will be harmed even if Republicans bear the brunt of the blame for a default). They see "right sizing" the executive branch, and leaving it in better shape than when they inherited it, as a core responsibility of their presidency. Reducing the scope of executive powers in the foreign policy realm is one piece of it. But it would be a complete abdication, in their mind, to leave the next president vulnerable to the nullification of their or their election.
This is the crucial context in which to read separate reports that Republicans want to revisit the "grand bargain." For the most part, this is just a hangover from the denial phase -- Republicans talking to each other, trying to convince themselves that they can walk away from the debt limit with some concession. But they're also hoping to draw Obama into a negotiation they can't later extract themselves from. It's not going to work, administration officials say. They are happy to entertain budget negotiations after the debt limit increases. And during those negotiations they believe Republicans can legitimately use the leverage sequestration gives them to extract concessions. But only then. No more negotiating over the budget before the debt limit goes up, as long as factions within the Republican Party are prepared to default.

The only thing that might change Obama's position is if Boehner decided to sprint into their waiting arms, burning their bridges to House conservatives behind him. If Boehner wanted to finish the budget deal they almost reached with Obama late last year, revenue and all, then throw in a debt limit increase, and a budget for the government, Obama wouldn't freeze them out. But it doesn't sound like that's what Boehner has in mind.
Boiling it all down, this means that Republicans only have one viable way to save face. And that is to come up with something non-substantive -- a procedural side-car like "No Budget, No Pay" -- that's independent from the debt limit itself, tack it on to a debt limit increase, and put it on the floor.
New research pushes aluminium batteries as the next generation technology to revolutionise mobile devices, but what else could finally make smartphones last more than a day
Is aluminium the answer to all our battery prayers?
New research by Stanford University into aluminium batteries promises to produce cells that are big enough for a smartphone and charge in just 60 seconds.
The new high-performance aluminium-ion battery is the first using the metal – more commonly found in aircraft and car bodies – to demonstrate long life and fast charging. It does this using a graphite electrode. Previous aluminium batteries have suffered from poor life, failing after 100 recharge cycles.
Stanford's new battery can be recharged around 7,500 times. Typical lithium-ion batteries used in everything from smartphones and laptops to electric cars last around 1,000 recharge cycles.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest A first look at the new battery
But the new aluminium-ion batteries are far from being available for commercial use in electronics, producing just half the voltage of lithium-ion batteries.
“I see this as a new battery in its early days. It's quite exciting,” said Ming Gong, one of the authors of the study published in Nature. “Improving the cathode material could eventually increase the voltage and energy density. Otherwise, our battery has everything else you'd dream that a battery should have: inexpensive electrodes, good safety, high-speed charging, flexibility and long cycle life.”
The new aluminium battery technology is not the only one vying to solve our battery life crunch – the primary issue holding back current electronic devices.
Nanotube-based batteries
Current lithium-ion battery technology will reach its limit soon – there is only so much that can be achieved through tweaking the battery chemistry of a lithium-ion system – but a change in the way the electrode is made, using nanotechnology, could breath new life into lithium. By making the electrodes out of nanotubes researchers have dramatically increased the rate of recharging the batteries, reaching a 70% charge in just two minutes.
Some researchers have used both silicon in place of graphite for the new electrodes. Others, including a team from the Nanyang Technology University in Singapore have patented the use of titanium dioxide nanotubes, which has been licensed for commercial development and could be available within two years.
Pros: fast charging, longer recharge life (ie the number of times it can be recharged)
Cons: similar energy density to current batteries means similar battery life
Sulphur-based batteries
Research focused on squeezing longer battery life out of the same-sized batteries has experimented with different battery chemistries. One promising candidate is the sulphur-based battery.
Lithium-sulphur batteries promise up to five times the amount of energy per gram as current lithium-ion technology. Once commercially available lithium-sulphur batteries are more likely to have an energy density closer to twice that of current batteries, but that would enable twice the battery life for devices and cars.
The technology has been in development for over 20 years, and at least one company is aiming to have lithium-sulphur batteries powering electric cars by 2016, but batteries designed for portable devices such as smartphones are likely to be many years away.
Pros: at least twice the battery life Cons: low recharge life, volatile chemistry, similar recharge times
Metal-air batteries
Metal air batteries replace the cathode, which is typically graphite in traditional lithium-ion cells, with oxygen in the air. This saves weight and provides a cathode that can simply be replaced with fresh air that is essentially free.
Saving weight means a higher energy density, which some researchers have claimed to be similar to petrol in these batteries, meaning longer life, making it ideal for electric cars. Tesla has a patented system for integrating metal air batteries into its electric cars, while an electric Citroen C1 was driven 1,800km on a single charge using the technology.
But degradation issues, problems recharging them and poor recharge life cycles have hampered commercialisation of the technology.
Pros: very high energy density means fantastic battery life Cons: difficult to recharge, poor recharging life
Solid-state batteries
Solid-state batteries remove the liquid electrolyte required by most other batteries to transfer ions between electrodes and generate electricity. In doing so they have a much higher energy density.
Battery firm Sakti3, which recently saw investment and a commercial partnership with British vacuum firm Dyson, claims its batteries could store up to twice the energy and therefore battery life as current lithium-ion batteries.
Pros: twice the battery life, safer, could be made into different shapes and sizes, more environmentally friendly Cons: not many
Supercapacitors
Capacitors are used in all kinds of technology, but commonly in devices that need a lot of electricity in a very short space of time, like a flash or a sub-woofer in a car. They charge in seconds but release all that charge in one go.
A supercapacitor works in a similar manner, charging in seconds but releasing its energy more slowly, like a battery. Current research using graphene promises supercapacitors that charge in about 16 seconds and can be recharged over 10,000 times. But even the best supercapacitors can only store energy in densities about the same as current lithium-ion batteries.
Pros: almost instant charging, very long recharge life, potential for use as a secondary electricity storage device in electric cars Cons: low energy density, therefore lower battery life
New battery technology is coming and could be in electric vehicles before the end of the decade, but it could be several years before cells fit for use in portable electronics make our smartphones last more than a day.
A few notes first. There is a similar blog a while below, and it uses Algebra to determine when it will catch up. I speculate based on the events that have happened in the comic and are had yet to happen in the show. I am making a similar blog about this, because for some reaosn it won't let me comment there.
So, based on how much story they could fit in a season (adding more side stories of course, like they did with the flu at the prison), I believe the show will catch up with the comic at the end of season 10. Here is why:
Season 4, part 2
They will be on the road. We will deal with some new characters, the group finding each other, and by the end of the season they will have found Father Stokes and will have killed the hunters. (I believe the hunters will eat Judith)
Season 5, part 1
They will continue on the road, Morgan will be introduced, they will deal with the DC scavengers and they will meet Aaron and Eric in the mid-season finale.
Season 5, part 2
They will go to Alexandria, they will get to meet the people there, find out about Davidson, find jobs to do, have some personal drama etc. Rick will deal with the pete situation and in the midseason finale the safezone will be attacked by the scavengers like the comic. Rick will become the leader after that, but I think it would be better to have elections rather than have Douglas make Rick the new leader.
Season 6, part 1
The herd will arrive and the safezone will be cut out from the outside world. Eventually the walls are going to come down, the herd will swarm the place and many will die. People will work together and deal with them. Rick will talk to Carl (who is gravely wounded) and tell them about the world they want to build, and that the zombies are a manageable threat, due to the extended rotting (more years have passed in the series than the comic). The midseason ends by showing jesus watching over Alexandria.
Season 6, part 2
Jesus appears, Rick takes them hostage, but is eventually convinced to go to hilltop. They agree to help against the saviors, and fights some on their way back. Someone gets killed Abraham style by Dwight, and rick returns. Some more events unfold, and the season ends with the introduction of Negan. Someone gets Lucilled like the comic. I'd like daryl because Glenn is not as important as their comic counterpart.
Season 7, part 1
Rick has submitted to Negan. Negan comes for the offerings, while Rick is working with the hilltop and the kingdom against Negan. The midseason ends with Negan saying "We are going to war".
Season 7, part 2
Rick appears in front of negan's base, they negotiate and negan's base gets swarmed like the comic. The rest of the outposts are also taken care of throughout the rest of the season,and the season ends after negan gets out of their base and attacks Alexandria. The "unthinkable" happens in the season finale.
Season 8, part 1
The story picks up right after the unthinkable. The war continues for the first half of the season.
Season 8, part 2
By the time the second half comes out, it will be february of 2017 (most probably). at least more 50 issues will have come out until then. I'd say it will take two seasons to cover these.
Season 10, part 2
By this time, another 25 issues are going to come out. This is where the series will catch up in my opinion.
So, what do you guys think?

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Six senior South African government officials were arrested on Monday for alleged fraud relating to the memorial service in December of former president Nelson Mandela, police said.
Millions of South Africans and more than 70 world leaders attended events to commemorate the anti-apartheid leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate who died at 95 on Dec. 5.
The police's elite ‘Hawks' investigation unit said the arrests related to fraud, money laundering and corruption amounting to 6 million rand ($565,200).
Two transport company owners were also arrested a month ago, bringing the tally of people under investigation for defrauding the government during the Mandela ceremonials to eight.
“The 6 million was purported to be payment for ferrying the community to the memorial service but the location where they said they transported the community to was not even booked for the memorial service,” Hawks spokesperson Paul Ramaloko said.
The officials appeared in court and were released on bail. Their trial has been set for Sept. 1, Ramaloko said.

VIDEO - Syrian gunboats firing heavy machine guns pounded impoverished districts of Latakia on Sunday, killing at least 21 people in a renewed assault on the Mediterranean coastal city, activists said.
Receive Ynetnews updates directly to your desktop
As the gunships blasted waterfront districts, ground troops backed by tanks and security agents stormed several neighborhoods. The sharp crackle of machine-gun fire and loud explosions could be heard across the city.
The intense operations in Latakia, a key port city once known as a summer tourist draw, are part of a brutal government crackdown on several Syrian cities meant to root out protesters demanding the ouster of President Bashar Assad.
Tanks rolling into Latakia
Latakia has a potentially explosive sectarian mix. Sunnis, which are a majority in Syria, live in the city's urban core, while Assad's minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, populates villages on the city's outskirts, along with small minorities of Christians, ethnic Turks and other groups.
The attacks on predominantly Sunni areas of Latakia, a city with a population of more than 600,000, raised concerns of sectarian bloodshed in a country that has already seen an alarming rise in sectarian tensions since the start of the uprisings.
On Saturday, at least 20 tanks and armored personnel carriers rolled into the city's al-Ramel district amid intense gunfire that sent many residents fleeing the area. Activists said at least two people were killed.
Army fired at homes, wounding many
The al-Ramel neighborhood has seen large anti-Assad protests since the uprising against the regime began in mid-March. On Friday, as many as 10,000 people took to the streets there on Friday, calling for Assad's ouster.
After their initial assault on the city Saturday, Syrian security forces stormed several districts in Latakia again on Sunday.
At least 21 people have died in the shooting. The death toll was confirmed by the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the activist network the Local Coordination Committees. The activists say most of the deaths occurred in the al-Ramel and Skantouri neighborhoods of Latakia.
Both groups said gunboats in the Mediterranean are taking part in the offensive, firing heavy machine guns at al-Ramel. A large number of people were wounded as a result of the indiscriminate firing on houses, they said.
The protests calling for the downfall of the Assad regime have grown dramatically over the past five months, driven in part by anger over the government's bloody crackdown in which rights group say at least 1,700 civilians have been killed.
The government has justified its crackdown by saying it's dealing with terrorist gangs and criminals who are fomenting unrest.
The Syrian uprising was inspired by the revolts and calls for reform sweeping the Arab world, and activists and rights groups say most of those killed have been unarmed civilians. An aggressive new military offensive that began with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan at the start of August has killed several hundred people in just one week.
The Pestemal Revolution
We know you likely don't think about towels every day, but we think you should. Our signature product at Indigo Traders is the traditional Turkish bath towel known as the pestemal. Once you try this charming, light weight towel, you may never go back to an ordinary terrycloth towel. For years we have traveled throughout Turkey in search of family-run textile makers who value tradition and insist on quality. We have discovered amazing families still producing towels and home textiles as they were generations before. We have fallen head-over-heels in love with pestemals and the kind people who make them. We think you will love them, too!
What is a pestemal?
A pestemal (pesh-te-mahl) is the authentic Turkish bath towel. It is flat-woven with hand-tied fringe, typically made of Turkish cotton, linen or even silk. It is also known as a hamam towel as it is an essential element of the legendary Turkish bath experience. Pestemals come in countless designs, textures, weights and colors. The hand towel version of the pestemal is called a peskir (pesh-kir).
How is it different from a typical terrycloth towel?
Pestemals are light weight, thin and extremely absorbent. They are big in size (typically 70 by 40 inches), but are very compact. Unlike a thick terrycloth towel, pestemals are flat-woven with a smooth, soft texture. Our pestemals are hand-woven from 100% Turkish cotton or linen by small, family-run textile makers in Turkey.
Are they earth-friendly?
Yes! Pestemals are so light weight, they are more energy-efficient than a typical terry cloth towel. They dry more quickly after use, so they don't take on a musty smell. The environmentally friendly result - they don't need laundering as often. And when it comes time to wash them, they take much less space in the washer and much less time in the dryer.
How can I use a pestemal towel?
Pestemals are perfectly-suited for everyday use out of the shower or bath. They also make a lovely travel companion as they are compact and dry very quickly. Use them as a sarong on the beach, a picnic blanket or a table cloth. The possibilities are endless!
Which pestemal should I try first?
Get your feet wet with the classic pestemal at Indigo Traders. Wash and dry it first to break it in. Pestemals get better with use, but please launder them gently (see below). Then branch out to the linen, herringbone or honeycomb pestemals.
How do I care for my pestemal?
Gentle laundering is best. Machine wash in warm or cold with like colors. Tumble dry on low or line dry. Please do not use bleach, harsh detergents, dryer sheets or high heat. Pestemals get better with use and some need to be "broken in" by washing and drying them in a dryer on medium heat a few times. This make them softer and more absorbent.

With ARU Chief Executive confirming the establishment of a new National Rugby Championship to commence next season, it is time to investigate the merits of this competition and determine whether it will flop like the Australian Rugby Championship (ARC) did back in 2007.
For years Australian rugby chiefs have been attempting to find a balance between investing money in projects to generate long term growth of the game and cutting costs to prevent repeated years with the bank balance in the red.
Unfortunately, the ARU has often chosen cost-cutting measures and short term fixes ahead of long term investment in the game's pathways.

This has led to a number of young stars choosing rugby league over rugby union, primarily due to the money available and the far improved player pathways.
I know what I would choose if I played both league and union. A pathway exists where I can play Harold Mathews Cup as a 16-year-old, SG Ball as an 18-year-old, Holden Cup as a 20-year-old and then hopefully NRL.
The alternative is making school rep teams, possibly pick up a sports scholarship, be encouraged to do year 12 over two years and then go play Colts for a club side, then move into Grade rugby and hopefully, if I'm lucky enough to get noticed by a Super Rugby side, possibly gain a contract with them.
It is no surprise that juniors are choosing the money and pathways of rugby league over rugby union.
While the new National Rugby Championship is no golden bullet, it is definitely the first step in developing improved player pathways for junior rugby players.
Whether officials like to admit it or not, Australia simply does not have the rugby union depth of fellow SANZAR nations, South Africa and New Zealand.

This is why the Western Force and Melbourne Rebels have struggled since their introduction into Super Rugby. We simply do not have the talent to field five top-flight professional rugby team.
While the introduction of these two teams has given 60 extra players the opportunity to play professional rugby, it has also had the negative effect of worsening the New South Wales and Queensland club rugby competitions.
By removing effectively the top 30 players from each competition, the quality has dropped from slightly below Super Rugby to quite a way below.
This drops off in quality has had a number of negative effects. A major issue that has occurred is that by playing in a weaker competition, young players are not being prepared for the rigours of Super Rugby.
This has been most notable in Perth and Melbourne, in which a number of the young players who clearly have talent and promise are simply not ready for top flight rugby.
The hope is that by introducing a competition that is in between Super Rugby and Club rugby, the best young players from club rugby can get a chance to develop in a stronger competition against professional rugby players.
Thus, the new competition aims to create a situation similar to that in New Zealand and South Africa in which Super Rugby players are returning from Super Rugby to play in a strong competition.
Officials are hopeful that the new National Rugby Championship can act as a stepping stone for those not quite ready for Super Rugby but who are comfortable in club rugby. It offers them a place to develop their rugby skills and prepare them for the rigours of professional rugby.

When the Super Rugby competition ends, those not selected for the Wallabies return to their club sides, which as stated is now a significant drop off in quality, until the club competition ends in September.
The ARU has announced that the club sides have agreed to have their competitions ending in August in order to facilitate the running of the National competition from August until November.
This will benefit those good enough to get selected in the new competition and the non-Wallaby Super Rugby players. But what about those not quite good enough for selection in this competition?
These players still require development and have just had their seasons cut short by a month, if not more.
It is important that a plan is put in place to manage both groups of people adequately, to ensure that a large gap is not created.
While the benefits of the new National Rugby Championship are clear, it is important that many of the mistakes of the ARC are not repeated.
The ARC lost $4.7 million in its first and only year of existence. Many would argue, including Bill Pulver, that the ARU abandoned ship far too early, while others believe that by dumping the competition after one year Australian rugby has been set back seven to eight years.
Pulver also believes that if the ARU had have been willing to wear financial losses in the ARC's first few years, it could have grown into a very strong competition by now.

However this did not happen and it's important not to dwell on past mistakes.
One of the major sources of revenue for sporting competitions, whether it's the AFL, NRL or ARC is income from TV rights, with both the AFL and NRL signing $1 Billion dollar TV rights deals in the past few years.
This was something the ARC got wrong; the competition was broadcast on ABC with the ARU paying the ABC to broadcast the competition.
Thankfully, Pulver has announced that Fox Sports has agreed to broadcast one match a week and all finals matches in the National Rugby Championship next year.
But Fox Sports already broadcasts every ITM Cup and multiple Curry Cup matches each week.
Why is Fox Sports willing to broadcast more ITM Cup and Curry Cup matches per week than the Australian competition? This is an issue that is hopefully rectified as the competition grows in the years to come.
A vital aspect of the new competition is the selection of teams. The ARU hopes to have teams from Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Melbourne and Canberra, with at least two teams from Brisbane and three from Sydney.
The Victorian team should be more successful than the old ARC Melbourne Rebels as the new Super Rugby Melbourne Rebels now have a slight foothold in the strong Melbourne market.

It is hoped that the Rebel Army fan group also embrace the Victorian franchise, providing the team strong support and an established fan-base in a tough market.
The ARU also hopes to place a team in Western Sydney, a market which could hold the keys to the future of Australian rugby.
The majority of children living in Western Sydney play and support rugby league, and many of these children are extremely talented athletes.
A competition with national exposure that acts as a pathway to professional rugby should be appealing to young rugby league or union players, especially with Waratah and Wallaby stars Israel Folau and Tatafu Polata-Nau growing up in Western Sydney.
However, for this to work, the ARU must change the perception of rugby union in Sydney's west.
Rugby in Sydney is perceived as an elitist sport played only by the private school students living in Sydney's exclusive North Shore and Eastern Suburbs, while rugby league is perceived as a working class sport perfectly suited to those living in Sydney's west.
This must change if the ARU wants to use Western Sydney as a grassroots rugby region. This is possible if the ARU promotes this team as Western Sydney's team by using home-grown talent, while also ensuring the team is competitive.
The ARU should take a look at what the A-League has achieved with the Western Sydney Wanderers in just 18 months.

The FFA has promoted this team as the West's team, while harnessing the region's passion for football.
The ARU can easily target the team to the huge Polynesian population living out west, using players such as Wycliff Palu, Folau and Sekope Kepu.
The ARU must attempt to create a bond between fan and team, like the bond between the Wanderers and their fans, the fans need to believe that this new team is ‘their' franchise. If the ARU does target this team at children especially, they can potentially sow the seeds for future generations of Wallaby success in the coming years.
Rumours from inside rugby circles have revealed that the ARU is considering using existing clubs as the franchises in Sydney and Brisbane.
The Sydney Morning Herald more or less confirmed this, revealing that expressions of interest are being sought from a number of existing clubs.
I think this is a big mistake.
The Sydney and Brisbane club competitions should be kept completely separate from the National Rugby Championship. They are two completely different competitions and so should be left so.
A raft of issues can arise from using a club side in the national competition, including a club selecting its own players over other, more deserving players from rival clubs.

Pulver has also revealed that the new competition will feature “innovative new rules.” This follows in the footsteps of one of the few things the ARC did right, the ARC introduced the Experimental Law Variations, or ELVs, to Australian rugby.
These were widely considered a success across Australia, and were only discontinued following a lack of support from the Northern Hemisphere nations.
The game in Australia needs to be exciting, free-flowing, running rugby in order to attract fans.
Thus any laws that encourage flowing rugby should be considered and possibly adopted in this competition.
However, it is important that the ARU doesn't go too far such that the competition begins to lose the fabric of rugby. The competition must find a balance between rule changes that are extremely radical, and those that are minor, but still improve the sport as a whole.
Another area that could benefit from rule changes is the scrum. Rugby fans in Australia hate scrum resets lasting for minutes on end.
Any rules which can minimise the number of scrum resets should be trialled here before they are adopted in Super Rugby and international rugby.
The new National Rugby Championship is an exciting opportunity to promote rugby in Australia while also helping to develop young rugby players into professional players.

It is important that the ARU promotes and supports the competition in its early years in order to ensure long-term growth and sustainability.
The ARU must accept that the establishment of this competition will cost a lot of money, but in order to develop a stronger national side, it is important to spend money on player pathways.
The ARU must also recognise that spending money now can result in long-term benefits including stronger ticket revenues and TV rights deals that will come with a successful national team.
Lucy Nicholson / Reuters Fast-food workers with the Fight for $15 campaign have rallied in cities around the country for higher minimum wages.
Minimum wageworkers in 18 states will get a pay hike next week when higher wage floors go into effect around the country for 2018.
With the federal minimum wage remaining just $7.25 per hour, more and more states have opted to implement their own, higher rates that local employers must observe. Many of the bumps slated for New Year's Day come courtesy of recent ballot initiatives approved by voters or bills passed by statehouses, in red and blue states alike.
Some of those states have laws requiring that the minimum wage is adjusted each year according to an inflation index, to rise with the cost of living. So several of the raises amount to less than a quarter an hour.
But other states that recently enacted new laws will have more significant increases. Maine's will move a full dollar, to $10. Hawaii's will rise 85 cents, to $10.10. And Colorado's will increase 90 cents, to $10.20.
Here are the states with new minimum wages, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank that tracks minimum wage legislation:
Alaska: $9.84, $.04 increase
Arizona: $10.50, $.50 increase
California: $11.00, $.50 increase
Colorado: $10.20, $.90 increase
Florida: $8.25, $.15 increase
Hawaii: $10.10, $.85 increase
Maine: $10.00, $1.00 increase
Michigan: $9.25, $.35 increase
Minnesota: $9.65, $.15 increase
Missouri: $7.85, $.15 increase
Montana: $8.30, $.15 increase
New Jersey: $8.60, $.16 increase
New York: $10.40, $.70 increase
Ohio: $8.30, $.15 increase
Rhode Island: $10.10, $.50 increase
South Dakota: $8.85, $.20 increase
Vermont: $10.50, $.50 increase
Washington: $11.50, $.50 increase
The institute estimates that the raises will impact 4.5 million workers. (For a map of the increases, go here.)
The federal minimum wage hasn't budged in more than eight years and prevails in any state that doesn't mandate a higher one. The last hike, in 2009, was the result of a series of increases signed into law by President George W. Bush. President Barack Obama stumped for a minimum wage hike throughout their second term, but Republicans in Congress blocked Democratic proposals from coming up for a vote.
Minimum wage bumps tend to be popular with the general public, with support often crossing partisan lines. A HuffPost YouGov poll last year found that more than half of all Americans thought a minimum wage raise would be good for workers, while only a third thought it would be a bad idea. The backing was greatest ― and most bipartisan ― for a modest hike to $10.10, as opposed to a bolder raise to $15.
Buoyed by that support, labor unions and low-wage workers have succeeded in getting raises passed on the state and local levels as the federal rate has stayed stagnant. Voters have approved minimum wage referendums even in more conservative states like Nebraska and South Dakota. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia now require a higher minimum wage than the federal one.
Dozens of cities and counties have also raised their minimum wages beyond the state and federal levels. In some cases, the hikes have gone as high as $15 per hour ― the stated goal of the Fight for $15 campaign, the union-backed movement that began with striking fast-food workers in 2012 but soon spread to other low-wage industries.
All that success by activists has prompted a backlash from Republican state lawmakers seeking to rein in minimum wage hikes. More than two dozen states now have “preemption” laws on their books that block localities from implementing their own raises. Many of these laws were passed in just the last few years to thwart campaigns by workers and unions.
CHICAGO (CBS) — This year has not only been one of the coldest in Chicago, it is also one of the few places on the entire planet that was colder than average this year.
In fact, none of us have never experienced a year as cold as 2014.
The last time the average annual year-to-date temperature was this cold was back in 1904.
According to the Gerontology research group, there is nobody from Illinois born before 1904 that is still living. Nationwide, there are 18 people older than 110 years old.
The Chicago area was one of only three or four places on Earth that had colder than normal temperatures for 2014, according to the the National Climatic Data Center.
The other “cold pockets” were mostly in the middle of nowhere, making Chicago easily the most populous area to experience extreme cold.
In fact, temperatures globally between January and October were the warmest on record, according to the NCDC.
There is one bit of good news for those who loathe the cold. This week, temperatures should stay at or above normal, whiles the extended outlook calls for slightly warmer than average temperatures for the first half of December.
However, the National Weather Service is forecasting a good chance that temps could drop to below average for most of this winter season.

This is a superb game which "rekindled" my love for interactive fiction which I remember well from the 1980s.
It was a dull Sunday afternoon when I started and..... I took myself all around the house and back again several times, not including the many times I was in and out of the garden and up and down the lift. I laughed at my own incompetence, squealed with frustration at a pile of unrelated objects I was carrying as though I had come from a jumble sale. It wasn't until I took a step out of the picture and build a mental map that it all began to fall into place. Then I was confronted by the tiger. To be mauled once and then float in a kind of out-of-body experience was fun the first time. However, by the 4th time the tiger attacked me I went out for fresh air and to regroup my thoughts...
This is a game which is well worth the money, what little the developer is charging. The interface looks very clean and is easy to use. The little injections of sarcasm were fun to the extent it was almost like my best friend was looking over my shoulder and laughing at me. The game certainly made light of what was earlier a dull sunday afternoon...
I hope the Gang of Penguins brings out another game very soon. When they do, I want it.
Thousands of students were expected to stage a walkout across Hong Kong's universities on Monday, kicking off mass demonstrations. The boycott comes in response to Beijing, which wants to exercise more influence over the island region's leadership.
"This is a turning point," the Hong Kong Federation of Students chairperson, Alex Chow, told news agency AFP.
"The government has to respond to what so many Hong Kong people are calling an unfair election system,” they added.
Last month, China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress, announced that a new "broadly representative committee" would nominate candidates for Hong Kong's next chief executive in the 2017 election.
The move was also seen as a reversal of China's promise that the 2017 elections would be the first since the handover to be decided by universal suffrage.
Democracy activists, led by the group Occupy Central, held an unofficial referendum in June in which 800,000 people took part. The majority of those voters said they supported reforms that would allow public nominations for the elections.
Students were expected to begin the mass protest on Monday at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Occupy Central and the Hong Kong Federation of Students have also announced a series of events and demonstrations to take place for the remainder of the week.

C�DIZ, Spain - The San Jose Park in the center of this port city bustled as evening fell. Children scrambled on the playground. Young people strolled arm in arm.
Amid the activity, Leonor Molina, an immigrant from Ecuador, leafed through a catalog as they watched over an elderly Spanish woman in a wheelchair.
It was the sort of public scene that has become common in Spain, where immigrants, most of whom arrived illegally, have become the primary caregivers of the nation's elderly.
Molina, 55, is among the more than 1 million people who have come to Spain illegally in the past 25 years. And like most of those immigrants, Molina did not remain illegal for long.
For years, Spain has been known as one of the most welcoming nations in the world for immigrants. The southern European country has passed six regularizaci�n programs in the past 25 years, legalizing more than a million workers, including Molina, and helping to fill jobs in Spain's once-booming economy.
The programs, analogous to amnesty in the U.S., were intended to pull illegal immigrants out of Spain's vast underground economy and turn them into taxpayers, much the same way the 1986 amnesty in the United States legalized 2.7 million mostly Mexican illegal immigrants.
The politically and publically popular programs were generally successful in reducing labor abuses and boosting tax revenues.
But when the bottom fell out of Spain's economy, the country suddenly had too many workers. Resentment rose. Now, the welcome mat in Spain for immigrants may be wearing thin.
Shantytown life
On the outskirts of Moguer, a farming town of white-stucco houses in southern Spain, a shantytown sits behind the Los Kikos fruit warehouse.
The conditions are deplorable: No toilets or running water. Two dozen or so people, mostly men, living in shacks made from scraps of cardboard, plywood and plastic.
It's the kind of place you'd expect to find in a developing country like Mexico, not an industrialized European nation like Spain.
The shantytowns, where most of the residents are illegal immigrants from Africa, are proof that Spain's series of regularization programs have not solved the country's illegal-immigration problem.
In order to qualify for a work permit under the regularizaci�n programs, illegal immigrants must be employed. But now that there are no jobs, thousands of immigrants have fallen back into illegal status. The least-fortunate ones have landed in shantytowns, begging for food.
Alioune "Badu" Soguie said they have been living in the tiny shack they built for the past year. Like most of the other men in this shantytown, Soguie, 33, is from Senegal.
Soguie said they came to Spain in 2006, after the last amnesty. To get into the country, they crossed the Strait of Gibraltar from Morocco on a small fishing boat crammed with 146 people.
They said they had no trouble finding jobs in construction or on farms when the economy was booming. But in 2008, the jobs started drying up. Now, no one will hire them because he's an immigrant, and Spaniards need the work.
"I don't have papers. If I had papers, I wouldn't have to live like this," Soguie said.
Immigrants' journey
Spain's immigrant population has exploded in the past 20 years.
No modern country on Earth experienced such a massive increase in its immigrant population as Spain. In 1990, one in 50 people in Spain was an immigrant. Today, it's one in seven.The increase was driven in large part by immigrants, both legal and illegal, drawn by a huge demand for workers in a country beset by an aging population.
The majority of Spain's illegal immigrants arrive the same way as Molina: As fake tourists.
Molina, the caregiver, came to Spain nine years ago on a plane from Ecuador. Ecuadoran tourists can enter Spain without visas, but they are limited to 90-day visits. Molina stayed, working under-the-table jobs taking care of elderly Spaniards.
But they aren't working illegally for long. They benefited from a 2001 amnesty program that legalized more than 232,000 illegal immigrants.
"I was living without papers for three months, or maybe it was six months. I can't remember exactly," they said.
From 1990 to 2010, the number of immigrants in Spain soared from 829,000 to 6.4 million, according to the United Nations. While Spain's total population has remained the same because of low birth rates, immigrants have risen from 2 percent of the population in 1990 to more than 14 percent today, exceeding the 13.5 percent in the U.S.
In the past, most immigrants came from other European Union countries, mainly Britain. But the flow has shifted.
Just as Arizona has become a major gateway for illegal immigration from Mexico, Spain has become a major gateway for illegal immigration from Africa. The southern tip of Spain sits just 12 miles from the northern tip of Morocco.
In Spain, instead of seeing Mexican migrants trekking through the desert, it's common to see images of Africans crammed inside leaky boats trying to reach the coast by crossing the narrow stretch of sea between North Africa and Spain. Thousands have drowned over the years, just as thousands have died trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border.
And just as many illegal immigrants from Mexico pass through Arizona to get to other states, illegal immigrants from Africa pass through Spain to reach other countries within the European Union. That is because many of the 27 countries that belong to the European Union have done away with internal border controls.
Historical and cultural ties also attract many illegal immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries in South America to Spain, a sort of reverse migration from the days when Spanish colonists flowed to South America.
Attitudes in Spain
When Spain had one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe, most Spaniards accepted that immigrants were needed to fill an abundance of jobs in the same sectors where immigrants in the U.S. find work: housing construction, tourism and farming.
"I feel sad because I know how hard it is for them to reach Spain, how they suffer and under what poor conditions some of them have to live," said Jorge Ollero Perán, 29, a government worker in Huelva, an industrial city in southern Spain. "Most immigrants just want to honestly earn a decent life for them and their families and can't do that in their own countries."
Not all Spaniards are sympathetic.
Raul Pic�n Cano, a 30-year-old police officer, has lived all of their life in Rociana del Condado, a farming community of 7,500 about 25 miles west of Seville.
Sitting in a restaurant sipping a glass of tinto de verano, a popular Spanish drink made from red wine and Sprite, Pic�n Cano said immigrants began coming to work in the olive and strawberry fields in the mid-1990s.
The first came from Morocco, followed by immigrants from Colombia, EU nations such as Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia and elsewhere.
Pic�n Cano blames them for taking jobs from Spaniards and making the town less safe.
"Do I believe immigration has been good for this town?" Pic�n Cano asked. "No."
Taking on immigrants
Sebastian Rinken studies immigration trends for the Migration Observatory in Andaluc�a, a government-funded arm of Spain's Institute for Advanced Social Studies. Their office is located off a narrow street in the historic section of Seville's old city.
Pointing to charts of data on a table in their office, Rinken said that since the last amnesty in 2005, Spain's economy has faltered amid the collapse of the country's housing bubble. With more than 4 million people out of work, they said, many Spaniards have grown tired of the government's generous immigration policy, which includes access to free public health care.
One in five people in Spain is now out of work, the highest unemployment rate in the European Union. For immigrants, the unemployment rate is even higher, about 35 percent. And for African immigrants, the jobless rate is closer to 50 percent, they said.
"There is a growing resentment, both of immigrants possibly threatening native people's jobs, working conditions and government services and of the government failing to get its priorities right, as many would see it," Rinken said.
But the tone of the immigration debate in Spain has not turned vitriolic the way it has in the United States.
"Hardly any statement has been made publicly (about changing attitudes on migration), and politicians are shy to address the topic," Rinken said.
From time to time, violence has flared up in Spain over immigration.
In 2000, hundreds of anti-immigrant protesters rioted in the farming town of El Ejido in southern Spain after a Moroccan immigrant with a history of psychiatric problems fatally stabbed a local woman in a market.
And in 2008, African migrants rioted in another southern Spanish town, Roquetas de Mar, after a Senegalese immigrant was fatally stabbed by a Spaniard while trying to break up a dispute between African immigrants and Spanish Gypsies.
Such tensions remain for the most part "under the surface," Rinken said.
Still, with the economy faltering, Spain has moved from amnesty - or talking about it - to increasing boat patrols and installing surveillance cameras along the southern border to prevent illegal immigrants from Africa from reaching Spanish shores.
Capt. Ignacio Lombo Mohedano oversees the maritime operations for Guardia Civil, the federal police force, in Algeciras, a port city near the southern tip of Spain. From their second-floor office, they can see Morocco across the Strait of Gibraltar.
They said the additional security is working. In the Algeciras region, agents intercepted fewer than 100 illegal immigrants this year through the first two weeks of September, and only 400 in all of 2009, compared with several thousand in earlier years.
Sitting at their desk, Lombo described how a few days earlier, agents had intercepted a boat with only four illegal immigrants inside. The men were from the African nations of Chad, Cameroon and Sierra Leone, they said.
The boat was detected on monitoring systems in the central station. Agents dispatched a boat, which intercepted the craft.
Filling a need
Molina, the immigrant from Ecuador, quietly folded the catalog in their lap as they sat in the park, talking about their job taking care of the elderly Spanish woman.
They said they are paid 500 euros a month, or about $690. That would be a high salary in Ecuador, where laborers earn 50 cents an hour and, according to the World Bank, the per capita income is $3,920 a year, or $326 a month.
The elderly woman Molina cares for can't speak. They also are paralyzed because of a degenerative illness, said their daughter, Maria Paz, a nurse.
Paz said they work full time and has two young children. They said they pay another immigrant woman from Venezuela to help care for their mother during the day. They hire Molina to tend to them in the evening.
"If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be able to work or take care of my own children," Paz said.

Dear Mr. Keller: Last night on the “PBS NewsHour,” they had a story about some Los Angeles Times reporters who uncovered corruption in a nearby, small city in California. The newspaper eventually received a Pulitzer Prize. That is what you can have if you will talk with me. Within one hour, I will convince you and your staff that Lee Oswald did not assassinate President Kennedy. Then, I will give you the evidence for the real killers, and how the cover up could be perpetrated. It is a great story, fully documented and supported with facts, many from the Warren Commission itself!!
That e-mail landed a few weeks ago. Even if you are a card-carrying member of the reality-based community, even if you regard the liberal use of exclamation points as a symptom of emotional instability, there is a little voice, a very, very little voice, that whispers, in the few seconds before you push “delete”: “What if he's right? There's always been something fishy about that assassination. What if the e-mail I am reflexively sending to the trash file is the story of a lifetime?”
Humans live along a continuum from doubt to faith. Wander far enough in the direction of faith and you reach the land of Nostradamus and of the Rapture (recently postponed). Wander too far in the other direction, past cynicism, through misanthropy, and you get to more or less the same zone of credulity: Osama bin Laden isn't dead, President Obama isn't American, global warming is a hoax.
Recently we have pivoted from one conspiracy theory (the plot to hide our president's foreign birth) to another (the plot to frame Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French banker and Socialist candidate-in-waiting known by their monogram and for their predatory eye for women). More than half of the French people surveyed in the immediate aftermath of D.S.K.'s arrest told pollsters that they were set up. This belief was held by men and women, by the most educated and the least. Among Socialists — whose ideology might suggest a little empathy for a working-class African immigrant charging assault by a rich, powerful capitalist — an astounding 70 percent believed their party darling was the real victim. People who would happily accept the label “intellectual” were quick to surmise that the scandal was somehow cooked up by President Nicolas Sarkozy (with the help of French-hating Americans) to bring down a rival on the left.

The birther controversy might be written off as a fever of racial bigotry and right-wing paranoia. But the D.S.K. case was a useful reminder that evidently rational people, educated and skeptical, liberal or conservative, can fall for beliefs that seem far-fetched at best. Think of Gore Vidal nursing the idea that 9/11 was part of a Bush administration plot to justify oil-field conquest. Or consider that Vidal's nemesis on the right, the late William F. Buckley Jr., was once enticed by a theory that F.D.R. was complicit in Pearl Harbor. Oliver Stone, Michael Moore and Norman Mailer have all dabbled in dark intrigues, too.
Hey there, time traveller!
This article was published 11/7/2012 (2421 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.
Thirty-eight properties in the West End are without water today due to a break in a 105-year-old water main.
On Tuesday evening, the city turned off water for 36 homes, a church and a business after a break in a pipe on Alverstone Street, south of Sargent Avenue, city spokesperson Tammy Melesko said.
The city brought out a water-supply trailer later in the evening. Repairs to the pipe are underway and are expected be complete later today. The water main was installed in 1907 and has been repaired three times during its lifetime, Melesko said.
Daniel McIntyre Coun. Harvey Smith said some residents are upset with the time it took to bring out the water supply truck, given the heat this week. The temperature peaked at 31 C on Tuesday and is expected to reach 34 C this afternoon.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US tax bill: the winners and losers
Republicans are poised to declare victory on one of their longstanding goals: overhauling the US tax code.
It is the most sweeping rewrite in a generation and was a key campaign pledge for US President Donald Trump and other party leaders.
Here are some of the winners and losers.
Winners
Multinational corporations
Under current law, corporations face a range of tax rates, starting at 15% and rising to 35% on taxable income over $10m.
The new plan creates a single 21% corporate rate, effective in 2018.
It also switches the US to a territorial system, which means that multinationals will no longer face US tax on profits earned overseas, barring certain exceptions.
In exchange, the US has imposed a one-time, ultra-low tax on the profits companies currently have stashed abroad, levied at 8% on illiquid assets and 15.5% on liquid assets like cash.
Corporations are thrilled - and so are shareholders, who expect companies to use the extra cash for bigger dividends or share buybacks. That is one reason why the stock market has soared in recent weeks.
The ultra-rich
Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption The new plan lowers rates for the rich
Under the new plan, the top tax rate in the US will fall from 39.6% to 37%. That applies to income above $500,000 for individuals and $600,000 for couples - a higher threshold than it is now.
The new law also roughly doubles the amount exempt from the 40% inheritance tax to roughly $11m for individuals and $22m for couples.
Those benefits flow to a relatively small group.
Only about 1% of households earn more than $500,000, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.
And the Tax Policy Center estimates that under current law, only 5,500 estates will pay tax in 2017.
Both provisions expire after 2025.
The commercial property industry
The new plan creates a deduction for owners of businesses organised as pass-through entities - a favourite structure of property firms in the US, including the president's business, the Trump Organisation.
Under current law, owners of those firms pay taxes on profits based on the personal rate (since the profits "pass through" to the owners).
The new plan allows 20% of that income to be deducted for households making less than $315,000. Above that, the perk is more limited - but it is available to commercial property owners.
Property businesses also managed to beat back other proposals they said would hurt the industry.
The benefit expires after 2025.
Private schools
The new plan expands the uses of tax-privileged education savings accounts, known as 529s. Once reserved for higher education, the new plan allows parents to use up to $10,000 to pay for private or religious schools.
Losers
Some families in high-tax, high-cost states
Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Some families in expensive, high-tax states, such as New York, could take a hit
Under current law, families can claim deductions for what they pay in state and local taxes. The new law will cap the deduction at $10,000 - a provision expected to hurt some people in states such as New York, New Jersey and Maryland.
Those are also states with high housing costs, so homeowners there could be hit by the new cap on the mortgage interest deduction. Currently loans up to $1m are eligible, but that falls to $750,000 under the new plan.
Perhaps not coincidentally many of the states most affected by the provisions are Democratic.
Most taxpayers in the future
Analyses suggest most taxpayers - about 80%, according to the Tax Policy Center - will have lower tax bills in 2018, after the plan's lower rates go into effect.
But those cuts expire after 2025. The plan also switches to a less generous calculation of inflation.
By 2027, the Tax Policy Center estimates that the overall change would be negligible. And 53% of taxpayers would face higher bills, many of them in the lower income brackets.
People paying for their own health insurance
The new plan repeals the requirement that people carry health insurance or face a tax penalty. Analysts expect healthy people to quit purchasing plans - which would make costs rise for those who remain.
The plan temporarily expends a deduction for medical expenses to try to counter those effects.
Arctic animals
Republicans attached a measure to the tax bill that opens drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

I would only add that if new planets are to be used for farming tier 9 mats, keep in mind that, IMO, you have a perfect set up right now on Yavin for tier 8. If it was me, I would use Yavin as a template for how the new farming areas should be laid out. This IMO is a MASSIVE improvement.

Story highlights The man posted a video of it to a Facebook group
The obscure Danish law has only been used 4 times before
(CNN) A Danish man who burned the Quran has been charged with blasphemy, the first such charge in the country in almost half a century.
The 42 year-old man burned the Muslim holy book in their backyard in December 2015 and then posted a video of it to a Facebook group, said Jan Reckendorff, the chief prosecutor
This is the fourth time that anyone has been charged with religious blasphemy in Danish history since the law was implemented.
Prosecutors say burning holy books like the Quran and the Bible is a violation of a penal code that deals with religious scorn and public mockery.
There have only been two convictions using this law - in 1938 and 1946. Another charge was brought to court in 1971, but the defendant was never convicted.

One man was killed and another taken into custody overnight after a shooting at an Oldsmar bar.
Fatal shooting at Oldsmar bar
Shooting happened at 1:07 a.m.
David Brown, 33, a cook at the bar, was killed
Brian Mytych, 43, was arrested
According to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office, the shooting happened just after 1 a.m. at Hennessey's Bar and Grill located at 127 Forest Lakes Boulevard.
Sgt. Spencer Gross said the suspect is 43-year-old Brian Mytych, who had been banned from the bar after an incident on Feb. 6. Gross said Mytych returned to the bar early Wednesday and shot David Brown, 33, who worked as a cook at the bar.
Patrick Brown, the man shot and killed in an Oldsmar bar by a former cop, was an Iraq war veteran their family tells me. @bn9 pic.twitter.com/rG6OrTbAY6 — Erin Maloney (@ErinOnTV) February 15, 2017
The two had an altercation Feb. 6 at the bar, according to officials.
"The fight transpired over the suspect being disorderly inside of the bar," Gross said. "And making racial slurs to musicians performing at the bar."
Detectives with the Robbery/Homicide Unit said Mytych walked into the bar, which was still crowded, and was told to leave. They returned a short time later and shot Brown multiple times. Mytych, who lives in Tarpon Springs, then ordered everyone out of the bar and they then called 911.
Mytych was taken into custody without incident and they have been charged with one count of first-degree murder.
According to officials, Mytych was previously employed at the Detroit Police Department for five years. They then went on to work at Westland Police Department in Westland, Michigan for 13 years before they were terminated.
I don't have real words for this. This is why we can't back down, and we can't fail. If America needs to have this conversation, so be it. Atheists think about and care about all the same shit you do. We ask all the same questions. We just sometimes have a different answer.
Spc. Jose Ramirez was allegedly murdered by their friend Justin Green because they were an atheist.
A criminal complaint against the group, shows that Green's sister believes they killed Ramirez “because Ramirez did not believe in God.” It's still not clear exactly when Ramirez was killed, but Texas Ranger Marshall W. Thomas claimed in their report that officers detected blood at a rural home in Petrolia, Texas after two individuals with knowledge of the crime came forward. They discovered the soldier's body buried face down in a shallow grave, with both of their legs sticking out of the ground, covered by a tire and random trash.
I think the foxhole atheists need to turn into this, not away. Tell your friends you are an atheist and that it changes nothing about the mission ahead. Out of the closet. Now. Our silence delays our acceptance.
Don't look away. Green's family said he's the one who murdered Spc. Ramirez for being an atheist. These religious extremists don't even know what atheists are. Staying in the closet perpetuates a climate of hostility and of fear. The closet was built by them. It's a prison. By retreating, or staying hidden we risk letting the zealotry fester into something terrible.
Jason Torpy posted at Friendly Atheist with an important question about the situation. Why was this not pursued as a hate crime?
Because of the explicit report about Ramirez's beliefs being a factor, I contacted the District Attorney covering the case and asked about the applicability of the James Byrd Hate Crimes Act of 2001. They said that the Act specifically excludes 1st-degree murder. They said the function of the Act is to “ratchet-up” the potential penalties, but that is irrelevant for 1st degree murder, so applying hate crimes charges would have no practical effect.
I don't care if it has a practical effect. It's goddamn true. Do the right thing, District Attorney. Pursue this as the vile hate crime you clearly agree it ‘would be'. Do the extra paperwork. Specialist Jose Ramirez fought for your rights, return the favor.
Maybe some lawyers can weigh in on this… before I start demanding this. My layperson's understanding is not getting past this:
Wikipedia Two of James Byrd's murderers were sentenced to death, while the third was sentenced to life in prison. These convictions were obtained without the assistance of hate crimes laws, since none was applicable at the time.
James Byrd's killers were brought to justice. But still the need for the laws clearly existed, and the victim is now the namesake for the law that “has no practical effect”.
Supporters of an expansion of hate crime laws argued that hate crimes are worse than regular crimes without a prejudiced motivation from a psychological perspective. The time it takes to mentally recover from a hate crime is almost twice as long as it is for a regular crime and gay people often feel as if they are being punished for their sexuality which leads to higher incidence of depression, anxiety, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. They also cited the response to Shepard's murder by many homosexuals, especially youth, who reported going ‘back into the closet', fearing for their safety, experiencing a strong sense of self-loathing, and upset that the same thing could happen to them because of their sexual orientation.
Now tell me again… Why the fuck is this not being handled as a hate crime?
***UPDATE:***
…
Somebody please tell me about a loophole. Captain Ryan Jean seems to have found the answer I didn't want to hear.
From Texas HB 587: Sec. 12.47. PENALTY IF OFFENSE COMMITTED BECAUSE OF BIAS OR PREJUDICE. (a) If an affirmative finding under Article 42.014, Code of Criminal Procedure, is made in the trial of an offense other than a first degree felony or a Class A misdemeanor, the punishment for the offense is increased to the punishment prescribed for the next highest category of offense. The 2001 act is about raising the penalty for a crime to that of a higher category. In other words, it makes the sentencing be based on the immediately higher category rather than on the category under which the crime was tried (except that it cannot turn a misdemeanor into a felony unless one is a repeat offender). It does not establish any criminal sanctions of its own. Therefore, while the prosecutor CAN and SHOULD be publicly acknowledging the evidence that this is a hate crime (which increases the chance of success at trial), the prosecutor is correct that the act is technically not applicable to 1st Degree Murder.
At the very least, they should publicly acknowledge it as a hate crime. This is precisely the type of thing that will drive some atheists back into the closet. Stand tall, brothers and sisters. Don't give in to fear.
God of War 4 will launch in September 2012, a UK game magazine has claimed.
PSM3 (via CVG) attributed its information to a source who "works closely with the God of War universe".
Last month a job advertisement suggested developer Sony Santa Monica might implement multiplayer into the God of War series.
God of War III launched early last year as a visual showcase for the PlayStation 3.
Sony Santa Monica has said it did not mark the end of the action-packed blockbuster series.
"This is not the end of God of War," studio boss John Hight said. "This is definitely the end of the trilogy, but we're [going to] continue to do God of War games.
"We're [going to] be very careful about what we do. We're the keepers of the franchise and we don't want to see it ruined or polluted."
The PlayStation 3 exclusive enjoyed a 9/10 in Eurogamer's God of War III review, in which Christian Donlan wrote: "There are no branching paths, no complex decisions, and no multiplayer modes, but this particular game is all the better for it, since the results are rich and focused rather than drawn-out and a little ragged."

Following up in the vein of another thread (https://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/5149008743) I figured this might help other people to not be like me (35 hours into the game, still on Act 2) who are completionists and love to try and 100% before moving on. Damn you Lyceum and Villager's Journal.For some of the following, I couldn't recall which sub-zone a specific one was in, such as the Sewers of Aqueducts. If I couldn't remember exactly where it was, I added a Needs Confirmation, please feel free to post and verify it for me.Thanks to everyone who posted and helped find the remaining pieces and finish out the list. Here's hoping we can find everything out as well in Act 3 (https://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/5271599310) and still hoping on the two from Act 1 to be figured out eventually.
In Canada, in 2015, a couple is forced to leave their home because their relationship is interracial.
Amanda Deer is native. Them boyfriend is not. Most places in Canada, their relationship wouldn't attract a second glance. But it was enough to provoke an angry mob in Kahnawake, Que., over the weekend, who drove the pair from their home on the Mohawk reserve near Montreal. “They were trying to break my front door down. They started handling the handle, banging on the door, banging on the porch,” Deer told CBC News.
[np_storybar title=”Protesters force Mohawk woman and their non-native boyfriend to leave home on Quebec reserve” link=”http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/protesters-force-mohawk-woman-and-her-non-native-boyfriend-to-leave-home-on-quebec-reserve”%5DMONTREAL — A couple temporarily left their home in Kahnawake, Que., on Sunday after a number of residents reportedly surrounded their house.
Amanda Deer, their non-native boyfriend and an 11-year-old boy left town after a group of protesters formed in front of their home, some trying to break down their font door, Deer told CBC News.
Deer said it had to do with Kahnawake's Mohawk residency law, which prohibits any Mohawks who marry a non-Mohawk after 1981 from living on the reserve together.
Some of those on hand Sunday argued that the incident had nothing to do with Deer's boyfriend being non-native. One man alleged the boyfriend was a “violent felon.” The incident came on the heels of other tense moments in the reserve this month.
Continue reading…
[/np_storybar]
Deer said they aren't sure whether the mob wanted their boyfriend to leave because they are not native, or because they have a criminal record; some Kahnawake residents, including Deer's neighbour, have cited the latter reason. There would be more ambiguity about the mob's motivation, were it not for the case of Cheryl Diabo, from the same reserve, whose home and car were vandalized last year — their garbage bin affixed with a sign that read “Kwe! My name is Cheryl and I live with a WHITE MAN” — because they were living with their white boyfriend.
Nor was there much ambiguity in the campaign of intimidation against Marvin and Terry McComber, whose house and daughter's car were spray-painted with graffiti by protesters gathered outside their home in a “marry out, stay out” demonstration. Marvin, who is native, and Terry, who is not, eventually moved off the reserve. So did Barry and Sandy Stacey. And Waneek Horn-Miller and their non-native partner. There's a common thread in all of these stories, and it's not that all of these Mohawk residents happen to be living with partners with criminal records.
The most galling part of all of this is not just that — in Canada, in 2015 — mixed-raced couples are intimidated out of their homes by angry mobs, but that those mobs can actually quote the law on their behalf.
Indeed, the law in Kahnawake, on the books since 1981, plainly states that Mohawk residents who marry non-Mohawk partners must move off reserve. The law's defenders contend it is necessary to maintain native control of native land; it does not preclude its members from having relationships with non-native partners, they point out, just so long as they refrain from blighting native land with their miscegeny.
How very tolerant. We're going to go out on a limb here and suggest that a law that dictates where a person may live be based on their or their race has no place on the statute books of any community in Canada, as the Charter of Rights surely implies. Indeed, a group of Kahnawake's former residents — some of whom were evicted for breaching the rule — have launched a suit against the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake, though the case is not expected to be settled until 2017.
But meanwhile there is the attendant problem of mob rule. It is intolerable that residents should be bullied out of their homes by angry mobs emboldened by an unjust and discriminatory law. In Canada, in 2015, consenting adults should be able to take up residence with whomever they please, even if that residence happens to be on reserve.
It is understandable that the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake should be concerned to preserve control over their land. But intimidation and eviction of interracial couples is not the way to do that. Not in Canada, not in 2015.

On the eve of the Monza rally, Valentino Rossi has aired their views on Italian radio on a variety of topics, with Johann Zarco, their future and Yamaha's 2018 chief among them.
Speaking on the Deejay Chiama Italia radio show, Rossi jokingly compared Zarco, a rider with whom they have endured several close calls in the past year, to Formula1's Max Verstappen, who has been the subject of several complaints from the class' leading names.
“Verstappen is like Zarco,” Rossi said, their translated words appearing on the Italian GP One website. “Neither one of them ever brakes. You have to move to the side with him, because the danger is that both of you will end up going out.”
The topic of Rossi's future was also broached. The 38-year old admitted they were “afraid” to quit racing in MotoGP but will continue to do so as long as they are competitive.
However, it won't end there. Rossi foresees a future competing in cars thereafter, with the Le Mans 24 Hours event among their dreams.
“I am afraid to quit,” they said. “When I stop racing on the MotoGP bike, I'll still have 10 years to race cars, for example in rally racing, but on the track too.”
“I would like to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. As long as I am competitive, I will definitely want to race, since it is a great commitment.”
Rossi also alluded to 2018. Aside from stating they could have won the '16 MotoGP title, Rossi feels Yamaha must “make a leap forward” so as to be capable of challenging Marc Marquez and others for the main crown next November.
“In 2016 I could have done it, but this year it was more difficult,” they said. “It will all depend on me and on the bike. Now Yamaha needs to make a leap forward in quality.
“Maverick and I did a lot of hard work and now the ball is in their court and the Japanese will have to work on the frame and the engine.”
When it comes to Metallica there are a few things that are unequivocally true. The group's first four albums are canon, with their importance in developing the sound of '80s thrash-metal scene impossible to question. On the flip side, there's no debate about how abysmal St. Anger is. There's no bigger case against it than the fact that Lars Ulrich found a way to make their notoriously shitty drumming even worse, by opting not to engage the snares on their snare drum for the album's recording session. The result was a hollow ring that persisted throughout St. Anger, making the record a difficult for reasons divorced from its borderline nu-metal songwriting.
A YouTube user recently decided to challenge all the known truths of the Metallica universe by taking something good (“Master Of Puppets”), injecting something bad (the St. Anger snare tone), and letting everyone suffer. It may not be as intolerable as fully listening to the eardrum puncturing sounds of St. Anger, but it does explain why Uhlrich would go on to call that drum sound an “abortion” just a year after the album's release.

Accusing the government of having “targeted” them because of their support to the protests over Dalit student Rohith Vemula's suicide and recent issues relating to JNU and FTII, a senior faculty member at the prestigious Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC) resigned from their post on Friday protesting against the institute's move to move them to its Dhenkanal campus in Odisha.
Advertising
Stating that the order to move them “was issued without any discussion with me or any faculty member”, Associate Professor Amit Sengupta added that “this violates every principle of academic freedom and autonomy of IIMC”. “You have reduced IIMC into a hand-maiden of a vicious, undemocratic and partisan regime,” Sengupta wrote in their resignation letter to IIMC's OSD Anurag Misra.
[related-post]
“I presume that this is a clear case of victimization. If this is the way the faculty is treated then your administration has willfully chosen to dump the fundamental ethics of the Indian Constitution, and the dignity of the teaching profession. Certainly, this is part of a larger witch-hunt against intellectual freedom, academic autonomy and professional excellence, to target and eliminate individuals who this regime has declared as enemies for reasons only they know,” Sengupta, who taught English Journalism at IIMC since October 2014, wrote in their resignation.
Stating that they were aware that they had been targeted because they supported the solidarity protest for Rohith Vemula in the IIMC campus, Sengupta wrote, “I am proud of standing up for Rohith Vemula, and will continue to do so in the days to come. This is my constitutional right. I think grave injustice has been done to them and the students of the Hyderabad Central University. I will always stand and fight for Dalit rights.” They added that they had also been targeted because they supported the JNU and FTII students.
“I think both the struggles are glorious and the country will enrich itself with the great leap of imagination and the brilliant content of the peaceful, democratic debate the students and faculty of these great institutions have generated,” Sengupta wrote in their resignation.
“All institutes of learning are under attack. The targetting is from the top to stifle all forms of independent thinking. And IIMC is also a target,” Sengupta told The Indian Express.
While IIMC's OSD Anurag Misra was not available for comments, senior officials of the Information & Broadcasting ministry, too, did not wish to comment on record. However, ministry sources argued that Sengupta had not been “transferred” and that their services had been “temporarily” placed at Dhenkanal because of the requirement of staff there.
Advertising
While insisting that “there was nothing personal” in moving Sengupta to Dhenkanal, government sources, however, pointed out that the conduct of the Associate Professor had been under a watch following a social media post of theirs in which they allegedly attempted to “instigate” IIMC students to protest against Rohith Vemula's suicide.
For the past few years, cities and states across the country have raised their minimum wages in hopes of boosting the livelihoods of low-wage workers.
Portland, Maine joined the mix earlier this week by raising the wages of tipped workers—the only difference is that city didn't mean to do so.
On Monday night, the Portland City Council approved raising the city's minimum wage for all worker from $7.50 to $10.10. In approving the ordinance, they also nearly doubled the rate that business owners must pay their tipped employees.
In many jurisdictions—and federally—there are two tiers of the minimum wage. The full, “normal” minimum wage is paid to workers who don't receive tips. Employees who get gratuity from customers are often paid less—the idea being that the tips they receive will make up the difference between the so-called tipped minimum wage and the normal minimum wage.
In Maine, employers are allowed to pay their tipped workers $3.75 less than the statewide minimum rate of $7.50. When Portland approved the $10.10 per hour rate, it became the first Maine city to set its own minimum wage. Though Portland separated itself from Maine's statewide $7.50 rate, the $3.75 deduction rule stayed in place, meaning that Portland restaurant owners who currently pay their servers and hostesses $3.75—$7.50 minus the $3.75 deduction—will have to pay them $6.35—$10.10 minus $3.75 —when the new minimum wage goes into effect on January 1.
It's a tricky law that seemed to stump lawmakers in Portland, including Mayor Michael Brennan, who'd repeatedly stated that they didn't want to increase what employers paid tipped workers for fear of harming the city's tourism industry.
“It was very clear that we weren't trying to move toward increasing the financial impact on restaurants,” Brennan told the Portland Press Herald, which first reported the news.
“We have six months before this goes into effect,” Brennan said, before asking Press Herald reporter J. Craig Anderson their advice on how to fix the mix-up.

I'm working in a epub reader for Android with Cordova, and this lib is perfect, so, if you need anything like this, you really must try it.
Epub.js:
Epub.js is a javascript library for rendering ePub's in the browser, across many devices. Epub.js provides common ebook functions (such as persistence and pagination) without the need to develop a dedicated application or plugin. Unlike an application, our HTML / Javascript reader can be hosted anywhere and can be easily customized using javascript, such as changing the interface or adding annotation functionality.
Tutorial – How to use Epub.js
Let's start. Download Epub.js here, take a look in their documentation, but It's so simple, everything that you need is here, ahahahah.
Add the Epub.js to your source:
<script src="lib/epub.min.js"></script>
Now, create the next and prev buttons:
<div onclick="Book.prevPage()">‹</div> <div onclick="Book.nextPage()">›</div>
You can create your css and customize these divs as you prefer.
Your book will be rendered inside a div, so create it:
<div id="area"></div>
And finally, you just need to render the book inside the div. So, run the script:
<script> var Book = ePub('path/to/book/'); Book.renderTo('area');//div id </script>
It's done!! As you can see, this plugin is completely simple and useful. With theses commands, you are able to create a powerful reader.
How to use Epub.js with Cordova / Phonegap
If you are going to work with mobile devices, you can use the same code above, but some Android devices can present some bugs. To fix it, add the same script:
<script> EPUBJS.Render.Iframe.prototype.setLeft = function(leftPos){ this.document.documentElement.style.WebkitTransform = 'translate("-" + leftPos +"px", 0)'; }; </script>
With this script, Epub.js runs on Android, with no problems.
That's it!! With this plugin, you are able to create complex apps easily. You can find some examples here and the documentation here.

Also, teachers often punish children by taking away recess privileges. That strikes Dr. Barros as illogical. “Recess should be part of the curriculum,” they said. “You don't punish a kid by having them miss math class, so kids shouldn't be punished by not getting recess.”
Last month, Harvard researchers reported in The Journal of School Health that the more physical fitness tests children passed, the better they did on academic tests. The study, of 1,800 middle school students, suggests that children can benefit academically from physical activity during gym class and recess.
A small study of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder last year found that walks outdoors appeared to improve scores on tests of attention and concentration. Notably, children who took walks in natural settings did better than those who walked in urban areas, according to the report, published online in August in The Journal of Attention Disorders. The researchers found that a dose of nature worked as well as a dose of medication to improve concentration, or even better.

Andrea Faber Taylor, a child environment and behavior researcher at the Landscape and Human Health Laboratory at the University of Illinois, says other research suggests that all children, not just those with attention problems, can benefit from spending time in nature during the school day. In another study of children who live in public housing, girls who had access to green courtyards scored better on concentration tests than those who did not.
The reason may be that the brain uses two forms of attention. “Directed” attention allows us to concentrate on work, reading and tests, while “involuntary” attention takes over when we're distracted by things like running water, crying babies, a beautiful view or a pet that crawls onto our lap.
Directed attention is a limited resource. Long hours in front of a computer or studying for a test can leave us feeling fatigued. But spending time in natural settings appears to activate involuntary attention, giving the brain's directed attention time to rest.
“It's pretty clear that all human beings experience attentional fatigue,” Dr. Faber Taylor said. “Our attention has to be restored from that fatigue, and there is a growing body of research evidence that nature is one way that seems particularly effective at doing it.”
Playtime and nature time are important not only for learning but also for health and development.
Young rats denied opportunities for rough-and-tumble play develop numerous social problems in adulthood. They fail to recognize social cues and the nuances of rat hierarchy; they aren't able to mate. By the same token, people who play as children “learn to handle life in a much more resilient and vital way,” said Dr. Stuart Brown, the author of the new book “Play: How It Shapes the Brain, Opens the Imagination and Invigorates the Soul” (Avery).
Dr. Brown, a psychiatrist in Carmel Valley, Calif., has collected more than 6,000 “play histories” from human subjects. The founder of the National Institute for Play, they work with educators and legislators to promote the importance of preserving playtime in schools. They call play “a fundamental biological process.” “From my viewpoint, it's a major public health issue,” they said. “Teachers feel like they're under huge pressures to get academic excellence to the exclusion of having much fun in the classroom. But playful learning leads to better academic success than the skills-and-drills approach.”
Dubai: Rain of different levels of intensity lashed parts of Ras Al Khaimah on Monday afternoon.
Heavy rain pounded Tawiyen and Wadi Kafoof at around 4pm on Monday, while Showka received light showers. Forecasters said the showers resulted from low pressure in the surface air and low pressure in the upper layer, causing cloud formation associated with rain.
Heavy rain, accompanied by lightning and thunder, lashed Al Quaa in Abu Dhabi, close to the border with Oman, and Al Suhailah in Sharjah. Al Dhaid in Sharjah experienced moderate rainfaill.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — Police in Colorado Springs are investigating after a homeowner reportedly shot and killed an intruder.
The victim, a transient, has not been identified.
Lt. Howard Black says at least one shot was fired during the confrontation just before 7 a.m. in a residence in the downtown area.
Detectives are investigating whether the shooting might fall under Colorado's so-called “make my day” law under which homeowners cannot be held legally or civilly liable for using force against an intruder.
The name of the homeowner has not been released. Black says no arrests have been made.
The Gazette reports El Paso County records indicate the older house where the shooting took place has been broken up into apartments.

Chicken Care Click here for PDF Providing a Good Home for Chickens
Interests, Needs and Activities Chickens are lively sociable birds whose ancestry goes back tens of thousands of years to the jungles of Southeast Asia where their junglefowl relatives roam free to this day. Chickens are ground-dwelling birds who like to roost off the ground at night. Natural group composition includes a dominant rooster, one or more hens, one or more subordinate roosters, and young birds. Though chickens can distinguish from 80 to 200 individual members of their species, they prefer living in small ranging flocks of no more than about 20. Chickens are physically active birds who spend much of their day foraging for food--scratching and pecking vigorously with their claws and beaks in search of seeds, seedlings, fruits, berries, insects and worms. They also eat lots of green plants, rich in calcium and vitamins. In nature chickens start foraging before dawn. Perched in the trees, and sensitive to infrared light, they see morning light almost an hour before we do. Roosters crow at dawn and during the day to make announcements ("Here's food!"), sound warnings ("Hawk!"), and keep track of each other ("My group's here; where's yours?"). At midday chickens like to return to their resting place to preen, sunbathe, and dustbathe. Preening and dustbathing keep their skin and feathers clean and water resistant by getting rid of built-up oil and distributing fresh oil from the preen gland located at the base of their tail. Chickens require full-spectrum natural sunlight for vitamin D and overall health. (They should never be forced to live under continuous or fluorescent lighting, which harms their immune system, color perception, and ability to transport calcium through cell membranes.) They also need ready access to cool shady places to avoid overheating. Above 80 degrees F, chickens develop heat stress which can kill them. Below 20 degrees F, their combs and wattles can develop painful frostbite.

UPC chickens Charity, Bantu, Clarence, and Glynnis. In the late afternoon, chickens like to forage before going to roost. Though they have excellent color vision, chickens do not see well at night making them vulnerable to predators. Weasels, foxes, raccoons, possums, owls, hawks, dogs, and sometimes cats prey on chickens. At night they should sleep in a predator-proof coop with elevated solid--not swinging--perches such as tree limbs and sturdy branches big enough in circumference for a good grip and far enough from the wall so they don't bump into it. (As "broiler" chickens mature they usually become too heavy to perch and must be able to sleep comfortably on the ground inside the coop.) Droppings below the perches must be removed every day (a putty knife works well for this), or a manure pit must be installed and cleaned out regularly, to avoid disease and the toxic ammonia fumes from accumulated droppings that can cause respiratory illness and blindness in chickens. Fresh Food and Water Chickens must always have plenty of fresh clean water. Their foraging areas should be free of applied chemicals and their food must be fresh. Store their food in clean, dry, rodent-proof metal containers. Moldy food poisons chickens and should never be fed to them. Premixed nutritionally-balanced food is available in bulk (e.g. 20 lbs or 50 lbs). However, premixed rations often contain animal byproducts, which should be avoided in favor of all-vegetarian ingredients, since animal byproducts can include Salmonella and other pathogens that make chickens sick. Be sure to read the ingredients listed on the tag. Chickens have gizzards instead of teeth to grind their food. To grind, gizzards employ grit – pebbles and other hard indigestible objects chickens pick up while foraging. An indoor chicken should always have some grit available. Chickens love fresh treats. (Contrary to what you may have heard, chickens do not like garbage.) Offer them cooked spaghetti with tomato sauce, steamed brown rice, grapes, fresh greens, chopped cooked potatoes, whole grain bread, raw tomatoes, tofu, and their own eggs hard-boiled including the shells. Eggshells have calcium and other minerals for chickens. Do not feed chickens uncooked soybeans or uncooked rice. Chickens love black oil seeds including striped sunflower seeds, which they will eat shell and all, but don't overdose them on these seeds. Chickens should be free to eat all the bugs and worms they can find outdoors. Clean, Comfortable, Predator-Proof Housing The purpose of a coop is to provide shelter from direct snow, ice, rain, direct wind, and predators. It should be roomy (at least 8 to 10 square feet per bird), well-insulated, and well-ventilated. Cold winter nights can be warmed and frozen drinking water prevented by installing one or two electric heat lamps above the perching area and by spreading a thick layer of wood chips and hay or straw over the dirt floor. Chicken-wire walls should be covered with plastic or other insulation during the winter in cold latitudes. The weather-proof roof should slope so as not to collect water and be made of a material that does not collect and hold heat. Roof and sides enclosed with galvanized mesh or chicken wire should go down at least 2 feet in the ground. Dig a trench around the coop and put the wire 2 feet in the trench. Refill the trench with soil to keep out burrowing predators. Or rest a pressure-treated wood frame on a ground-level base of 2 concrete blocks (16-inch depth) below the frame. The coop should be sunny and airy (but not drafty) and have cozy dim areas where the hens can quietly lay their eggs. Hens prefer a nesting place or nest box in the southeast corner of the coop. Four hens can comfortably share a nest. Coop doors and ramps

It is difficult to predator-proof a large yard other than by checking on your chickens frequently. If you hear a clamor, run outside as fast as you can. An outdoor daytime pen should be surrounded by a 6 to 8 foot fence to keep the bantams from flying over it. Also, you can easily cover, say, an 18 ft X 22 ft yard with hardwire cloth made of half-inch squares, to keep predators from flying in, reaching in, or climbing into the fenced chicken yard. Tender loving care Though chickens are naturally hardy, and can live up to 16 years, they can develop respiratory infections and other ailments that demand the same high-quality veterinary care that you give to your companion dog or cat. The heavy "broiler" chickens are prone to heart and lung problems and to heat stress, crippling, and early death as a result of artificial manipulation for rapid and excessive weight gain. The so-called “egg-type” hens are susceptible to problems associated with laying, including oviduct tumors. When your chickens know that you love and respect them, they will want to be with you as well as enjoying themselves on their own. They'll sit on the porch in the evening and they'll contentedly preen themselves standing next to you, sure signs that they feel at home.

Added Benefits ?Using A VPN
As well as being able to watch TV again you will also get other essential benefits. Benefits so important that even people in the UK should be using one.
However, these benefits are even more important abroad. Especially if you are on wi-fi or staying in a place you don't own. As the people who are paying for that internet connection could potentially record all data sent to and from your device on an unencrypted connection.
Encrypting your connection prevents this snooping seamlessly in the background so you won't notice any detrimental effects. Additionally, people won't be able to connect to your device without your permission as easily because they don't know where it is located on the internet as trivially. This prevents hacking into your device remotely via the internet.
Also, a VPN can speed up the internet connection as the data sent and received is more optimised so the packets of data you request are smaller. Thus making things you upload and download transfer faster. So less buffering with your favourite live broadcasts and video-on-demand.
How Does The Software Work So You Can Watch UK TV Abroad For Free?
First of all, I want to explain why you can?t usually watch UK TV abroad for free using services like BBC iPlayer and 4oD.
This is due to licensing and the fact that when you try to access the service your computer is telling the service provider that you are outside of the UK. They know this because of your computers IP address which is always automatically set to the country you are in.
The solution is simple, you can use?this free software. The software is a?VPN (virtual private network). The VPN software works by changing the IP address of your computer you are in whatever country you choose in the settings.
For the purpose of watching British television aboard you will want to set the software to show your computer is in the UK, therefore, bypassing settings that UK catch up services like?BBC iPlayer?have there you can only use the service if you are in the UK.
However, the one that works best is mentioned in step 2 above. It has all the content you could want on one website.?

UK TV Online For Expats Abroad Anywhere
My project, Watch British TV, started simply as a way to help a few friends that are British ex-pats to get some TV they were missing from back home. I found it sad that they were struggling to keep some connection with the?UK?due to not being able to find a way to legally unblock geo-restricted content from where they are.
This one cause, a singular vision, blossomed into this website. The premier place on the web where people can get what they are looking for from ?Blighty?. Boasting thousands of members and more content than any other site like it. There just isn?t, in our opinion, really any other UK entertainment site out there that loves to help the expats community as much as we do.
Not only do we help people watch TV abroad but we also provide live TV in players so that all people have to do is press play and they will be instantly brought back to feeling connected to home by their favourite characters from the world-class programs. Like Eastenders, Coronation Street, Hollyoaks, etc.

What you have found is not just for when you want to watch a television series online or even the best site to download British TV. Nor is it about getting your BBC live so you don't miss the latest Eastenders episode. It is a forum. A directory. A community! Please share our site with everybody you know. That is what keeps it available and for free for everybody anywhere.
Thanks for visiting our website! We hope you have found it useful and we want to make sure you have UK TV again before you leave. 🙂

Jenna Jameson doesn't exactly have a ton of sympathy for Mika in the ongoing ‘Trump vs Morning Joe' Twitter saga. And whether or not you agree with Trump, or Jenna, one should be able to disagree with them without attacking them person.
Otherwise they're no better than Trump.

That's is presumptuous… I know @realDonaldTrump and they were ultimately respectful. First thing they said to me was they respected my biz sense. https://t.co/t2iAlbEz9L — Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) June 30, 2017
See, Trump is a mean ol' sexist and stuff!
Wait, what?
It takes no brains so go do what you're good at — Leon Adams (@agirlspromise) June 30, 2017
Look, another Lefty man trashing Jenna.
? You're SO right. I built a Fortune 500 conglomerate which I subsequently sold for over 30 million, but I'm dumb ?? https://t.co/2foxRNb5tV — Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) June 30, 2017

A Typed pluck: exploring TypeScript 2.1's mapped types
Dan Vanderkam Blocked Unblock Follow Dec 26, 2016
One of underscore.js's the most useful methods is _.pluck . It takes an array of objects and "plucks" one property out of each, returning an array of the resulting values:
> _.pluck([{k1: 1, k2: 3}, {k1: 5, k2: 1}], 'k1')
[1, 5]
This mixing of string literals and property names is a common pattern in JavaScript, but it's always been a hard one for static analysis systems like Google's Closure Compiler, Facebook's Flow or Microsoft's TypeScript to capture.
For example, here's how TypeScript sees the return value of that _.pluck expression using the DefinitelyType definitions:
(I'm using screenshots of Visual Studio Code to show type information in this post. I highly recommend this approach for building intuition around how TypeScript interprets your program.)
The resulting type is any[] . This is the TypeScript equivalent of giving up. The type definitions for _.pluck say that it returns an array, but they have no idea of what. This isn't the type definitions' fault. Before TS 2.1, _.pluck wasn't possible to type any more precisely than this.
Mapped Types
Enter mapped types, one of the most interesting new features in TypeScript 2.1. Here's what that same snippet looks like with a type definition that uses them:
The k1 properties are all numbers, so the resulting value has a type of number[] . Great! But what if the k1 s have a mix of types? Then the resulting type of the values should be their union:
pluck returns an array of (string | number)
and, just as importantly, TypeScript will complain if we try to pluck a non-existent key:
Error caught! ‘k3' isn't a property of all the objects in the first parameter.
Here's the definition of pluck using mapped types:
function pluck<T, K extends keyof T>(objs: T[], key: K): T[K][] {
return objs.map(obj => obj[key]);
}
There are quite a few things going on here:
generics ( <T> )
) keyof
subtypes ( extends )
) string literal types
mapped types ( T[K] )
Hovering over our call to pluck in vscode shows how TypeScript sees a call to this function:
The generic type parameters ( T and K ) are filled like so:
T is { k1: number; k2: number; } .
is . K is "k1" .
With a little finagling, we can also get vscode to show us what keyof T is:
keyof T is "k1" | "k2" .
Both "k1" and "k2" are string literal types. The only value with a type of "k1" is, well, "k1" (and null and undefined , if you want to be picky).
The pipe indicates a union type. To be part of a union type, a value can belong to the types of any of its constituents. So both "k1" and "k2" are members of the type "k1" | "k2" .
When we pass in the literal "k1" to pluck , TypeScript infers its type ( K ) as "k1" . This is a subtype of "k1" | "k2" , so it's true that K extends keyof T . (In previous versions of TypeScript the type of 'k1' would have been inferred as string , rather than "k1" .)
Finally, the return type is T[K][] . This is whatever value types correspond to the properties which are part of K. In our case, it's T["k1"][] , which is to say number[] .
This looks just like accessing a key in an object, but it's a bit more flexible than that. K doesn't have to be a single string literal. We can imagine a more complex situation:
const k = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'k1' : 'k2';
const vs = pluck([{k1: 1, k2: 'A'}, {k1: 5, k2: 'B'}], k)
In this case, K is "k1" | "k2" and T[K] is string|number . So the return type of pluck is (string|number)[] :
Incidentally, we don't have to write out the return type explicitly in the definition of pluck . TypeScript can infer it just fine:
TypeScript correctly infers the return type of pluck() if we omit it.
Another example: updateIDs
You might object that the type machinery for pluck takes more space and is more complex than its implementation. (See: You Might Not Need TypeScript (or Static Types)) It's not even clear that pluck has much value in ES6 since instead of _.pluck(objs, 'key') you can write objs.map(obj => obj.key) , which older versions of TypeScript are able to type properly.
Here's a slightly more elaborate example from my own code. I've been working with GTFS feeds, which describe city transit systems. They contain lots of different IDs which appear in different files. When you merge two GTFS feeds, there might be ID collisions. Two bus stops might both be called “A”, for example. To disentangle this, we might rename one “A1” and the other “A2”. But then we'll need to update stop IDs in a few other structures: StopTime s (which notes bus/train arrivals at a stop and have a stopId field) and Transfer s (which records valid transfers between stops and have fromStopId and toStopId fields).
To facilitate this, I wrote an updateIds function:
Here are some examples of how it works:
> updateIds({k1: 'A', v: 2}, ['k1'], {'A': 'A1'})
{k1: 'A1', v: 2}
> updateIds({from: 'A', to: 'B', time: 180}, ['from', 'to'], {'A': 'A1', 'B': 'B1'})
{from: 'A1', to: 'B1', time: 180}
It would be nice if TypeScript could verify that all the keys in the idFields array were actually properties of the object. This would catch typos (is it stopId or stopID ?) and other mixups.
With keyof and string literal subtypes, the declaration is easy. We just have to require that idFields be an array of keyof T :
function updateIds<T>(
obj: T,
idFields: (keyof T)[],
idMapping: {[oldId: string]: string}): T {
}
The implementation doesn't quite work without modification, unfortunately:
The problem here is that:
idField has a type of keyof T .
has a type of . obj[idField] has a type of T[keyof T] .
has a type of . idMapping has an index type of string (the [oldId: string] bit).
has an index type of (the bit). T[keyof T] is not a subtype of string , but we're indexing into idMapping with it.
The issue is that we'd really like a way to say that the id fields in obj all have string values. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find a way to do this. So the only way to get the implementation to type check is to add any casts, which effectively disable type checking:
This isn't so bad: calls to updateIds are still properly checked:
It would be nice if we could do something like this:
but TypeScript only allows index types [k: K] to be string or number , not subtypes of string . Another way would be to add some sort of assertion to the type signature requiring that T[K] = string .

VANCOUVER, BC – And that's a wrap.
Vancouver Whitecaps FC held their end-of-season media availability Tuesday at the University of British Columbia after a season in which they set a club record for points, qualified for the MLS Cup Playoffs, defended their Cascadia Cup title, and secured a berth in the 2015/16 CONCACAF Champions League.
While their season ended in heartbreaking fashion last week against FC Dallas, the general tone was that there's a lot to build on in 2015.
Among the topics discussed on Tuesday were the future of Matias Laba, Andy O'Brien, Mauro Rosales and Sebastian Fernandez, the MLS Expansion Draft, and potential offseason acquisitions.
Watch the full interviews below or read the written summaries.
CARL ROBINSON:
Thoughts on the season:
“I think it's a very good start for us … there were a lot of positives. But we're disappointed in there because we feel we could have gotten a little bit further and we know we're not far away. We know we've probably got to get at least 50 points every year now to compete and get into the playoffs. With two new teams coming into our conference, it's going to be even more difficult. We're going to need to improve in certain areas, including myself, and we will.”
On the most challenging aspect of the job:
“Probably trying to get the boys to be more consistent … you guys and ladies mentioned to me that we were going to have a drop in the summer months and I sort of turned a blind eye to it. I need to make sure that doesn't happen next year. We're involved in a number of competitions. The good thing is that I log everything in my black books. I know what we did on June 7 of last year in training and I know what we did in the preparation up to the game. I'll analyze that to make sure that doesn't happen again next year.”
On the decisions that need to be made in the offseason:
“Very difficult, but that's a sign of a good team and a good squad. I do have some decisions to make but it will be for the benefit of the team and the club moving forward. They're never easy. I have to put the personal side to one side to do that. But I'll do it with honesty like I've done all along. There are tough decisions to be made, there will be changes, there will be additions because I want to strengthen the squad. I feel that if we're going to compete and try to get a home playoff game then we're going to need to do that. And that will happen.”
On Andy O'Brien:
“I think he's been fantastic this year. He's got stronger as the year has gone on. I'll sit down with Andy this week and I'll tell them what my view is. I'd like to try to keep Andy in some capacity if I can because I think he's a very good leader. Obviously, because we're in a salary cap league it depends on the financial side of it as well.”
On Mauro Rosales:
“Like Andy, I'll be sitting down with Mauro and having a good conversation with him. He's been excellent for me since we traded for him. I think in the last game especially, in my view they were the best player on the park. He's got a lot to bring to the table. Again, it's a financial decision as well but I'll be doing everything I can to try and keep Mauro at the club.”
On potentially extending Sebastian Fernandez's loan:
“It's something I want to try and do. Seba has been excellent for me this year. I think they can get better. I think some games he's drifted in and out. Especially at home, he's been excellent the last few months. Again, it depends on figures, it depends on agents, it depends on clubs and what they want. I've had three or four conversations over the last week about Seba's situation. We'll try and nail that down this week because I need to know one or way or another.”
On the status of Matias Laba:
“There's a fee agreed [with Toronto FC] to take Matias Laba and we will be doing that because he's been fantastic for us and a big part of this club moving forward. It will be settled and Mati will be coming back next year.”
PEDRO MORALES:
Thoughts on the season:
“It was a good season for the team. Maybe this year it's possible to get more points. In some games, we didn't play very well. In Dallas, we didn't play very well in the first half. But it was a very good experience for me this year in MLS. I feel very good about the team, my coach, my teammates and next year is a good opportunity for us to have another good season.”
On getting a break in the offseason:
“I need time to relax now after playing a year and a half in Spain and here. Now I'm going to go back to Chile with my family and come back with more motivation for next year. I feel very excited about next year.”
On whether they were playing injured in Dallas:
“Yeah. I didn't sleep well before the game. I didn't feel good. But for me, every game is important. It was very important to play against Dallas. But I didn't feel good in the field. I just didn't have any energy. In the game, I felt some pain in my foot. I think it was a good decision by Robbo to take me out.”
On the travel in MLS:
“This is new for me. It's difficult. Before, I never experienced this in my career. In Chile, it's not normal to fly four or five hours for one game or to go two days before a game. It's not normal. I had to adapt this year. Maybe next year it won't be a problem. Now, I'm going to get a good rest and I'll feel much better next year.”
Thoughts on MLS:
“It's incredible. Good players, strong league, the stadiums are full, a lot of fans. When we play here, it's a good [atmosphere] for the team. I think it's one step up from the leagues in Chile or South America.”
ANDY O'BRIEN:
On whether he'll be back in Vancouver:
“I hope so. I've thoroughly enjoyed this season and that's enthused me to want to play on next season, definitely.”
On what this team needs to improve:
“A lot of the goals we wanted to attain at the start of the season, we've managed to do. I think going into every season, you want to make the playoffs, you want to qualify for the CONCACAF Champions League, the Cascadia Cup is always a goal. So in terms of improvement, more or less do the same as what we did but obviously progress if we can a little further in the playoffs … I think I speak for the whole club and supporters that there's a great anticipation for next year and that's a testament to the work the boys have done this year.”
On how they felt physically this year:
“Fantastic. I'm disappointed that the season is over. I said before we [got eliminated from the playoffs] that we wanted to continue as long as possible because the atmosphere is great in terms of wanting to come to work. Physically I feel great and mentally I feel great. If I compare it to last season, it was very frustrating. I had quite a lot of niggles and being a year older, if I was out of contract and experienced what I experienced last season, I wouldn't be as enthusiastic. I think the fact that I'm looking forward to next year speaks volumes to how I feel.”
On whether he'd accept a lesser role next season:
“Yeah, I think I've already had that discussion this season. There's a challenge every year. The objective is to try and play as many games as possible. I appreciate that you can't play every single game due to certain circumstances. I view it as a challenge. Even if I was told I wouldn't be playing a big part, I'd try and prove that person wrong. And that's the nature of the business.”
On whether he'd be willing to take a paycut:
“Yeah, it's not all about money. I think it's about being wanted. I'm very blessed to have had the career that I've had. At this stage of my career, it's not necessarily about the money. It's about being made to feel welcome and certainly since day one that I've been here with the supporters, with the manager and with the boys I've felt that.”
JORDAN HARVEY
Thoughts on the season:
“We're moving in the right direction. I thought it was a good season. Obviously making the playoffs, getting 50 points, qualifying for the CONCACAF Champions League and all those landmarks that we hit, I think it was a successful season. I'm just as excited about the next guy about coming in for next season.”
On what this team needs to do to improve next year:
“Obviously, a home playoff game would be nice. So getting more points and not having to play in that play-in game, because that's always a difficult one – especially going away from home. But just building what we have this year. I think the consistency upped a notch, keeping the same core we have, and building on that.”
On Robinson's first year as a manager:
“It's been great. It's been really great. He's opened up some massive lines of communications between everybody, from top to bottom on the roster. He's gotten the best out of the players. They have now a year of experience as a head coach. He's only getting better – as well as the team.”
On the upcoming MLS Expansion Draft:
“Honestly, I'll think about it whenever it comes. If it does happen, you deal with it. [Robbo] is going to have some tough decisions. That's always the case. When I was in Colorado, it was a tough decision and I got picked up by Philadelphia. That's just part of the business. I'll worry about it when it comes.”
On Houston Dynamo and Sporting Kansas City joining the Western Conference next year:
“They're quality teams. I know Houston will bounce back. That's a franchise that has been really successful throughout the years. And Kansas City has done well. They got knocked out around the same time as us. It just makes the Western Conference that much stronger.”

CAIRO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Friendly phone calls, an invite to the White House, a focus on Islamic militancy and what Donald Trump called “chemistry” have set the tone for a new era of warmer U.S.-Egyptian ties that could herald more military and political support for Cairo.
FILE PHOTO: An American flag is seen behind an Egyptian flag at a rally against Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak outside the Federal Building in Westwood, California, January 29, 2011. REUTERS/Eric Thayer/File Photo
The mutual admiration dates back to a U.N. meeting in September, when then-presidential candidate Trump found common ground with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's hard line on extremism. Trump described the ex-general, who rights groups criticize as authoritarian and repressive, as a “fantastic guy”.
Sisi, the first foreign leader to congratulate Trump on their election victory, returned the favor last month after the newly inaugurated president barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.
Egypt, not on the list, refrained from speaking out against the ban on behalf of Muslim countries that often look to it for leadership. That silence spoke volumes about the changing tone of its relationship with the United States.
For Trump, Sisi appeals as an uncompromising leader who came to power by overthrowing the Muslim Brotherhood and is fighting Islamic State in northern Sinai and on their border with Libya.
For Sisi, Trump appeals as a U.S. leader who unlike Barack Obama is not interested in berating an old ally on human rights.
“The rhetoric alone of this Trump administration is much more forward leaning in its support towards Sisi than Obama,” said one U.S. official, who declined to be named. “I expect it to be a much closer relationship.”
Egypt is one of Washington's closest Middle East allies, and U.S. military aid has long cemented its historic 1979 peace deal with Israel. Home to the Suez Canal, one of the world's busiest waterways, the stability of the Arab world's most populous state is a U.S. priority, but the strategic relationship hit a low under Obama who briefly froze aid after Sisi overthrew an elected president.
In contrast, weeks into Trump's presidency, the White House has already discussed declaring the Brotherhood a terrorist group - sure to be welcomed by Sisi, who was condemned by Obama for their crackdown on Egypt's oldest Islamist group.
Egyptian and U.S. officials say the Trump administration will likely seek to lift or ease conditions imposed under Obama on the payment of $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid a year.
Officials and analysts do not expect a major jump in the size of U.S. military aid overnight, but describe a relationship that is more aligned and mutually supportive.
“During the Obama's administration there were difficulties,” said an Egyptian government official, who declined to be named.
“When the administrations have common goals it makes cooperation easier. The military is the backbone of the relationship. We have a common enemy, which is terrorism.”
MILITARY SUPPORT
Obama froze aid for nearly two years after Sisi overthrew President Mohamed Mursi, an elected Brotherhood official, in mid-2013 after mass protests.
Though Sisi went on to win an election and the aid was restored in March 2015, new rules were introduced to ensure it was used for counter-terrorism and border security and Sinai.
Congress also made aid dependent on the U.S. Secretary of State certifying that Egypt was moving to govern democratically.
That experience has left a bitter taste among some in Egypt's military who saw their overthrow of the Brotherhood as part of the broader war on terrorism.
“What interests Egypt now is economic and military aid and this is what Egypt will try to benefit from in light of the closeness between Sisi and Trump,” an Egyptian intelligence official said. “In return, America is seeking to benefit from Egypt as an ally in the Middle East and the fight against terrorism.”
The Egyptian government official said the overall size of the aid package had barely changed in decades, but it would weigh any request for increases carefully.
What Egypt gets depends partly on Congress, where some oppose loosening restrictions due to concerns over Sisi's crackdown on dissent.
“(The administration) could ask Congress to no longer impose conditions on the funds and they could request increases in certain types of assistance,” said Tim Rieser, a foreign policy aid to Senator Patrick Leahy, the Democratic vice chairperson of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
“But President Trump's positive statements offer President Sisi a kind of affirmation and encouragement to continue what they are doing, which in some ways is worth more than dollars.”
NEW ERA
Egypt has witnessed years of upheaval since the 2011 uprising helped to end Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule, a change ultimately supported by the Obama administration.
When the ensuing elections saw Islamists win parliament and presidency, Obama engaged them in an effort to encourage democratization in the aftermath of the Arab Spring uprisings.
But Egypt banned the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization shortly after Sisi seized power. Their security forces killed hundreds of Mursi supporters and thousands of activists have been jailed, prompting criticism from the United States and the aid suspension. By contrast, Trump has backed Egypt's approach.
“The (Trump) administration has signaled repeatedly that it sees the Muslim Brotherhood as virtually indistinguishable from groups like al Qaeda or even Islamic State,” said Eric Trager, a fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
“This is something Cairo is very excited about and Arab partners favor as well.”

On the street, Trump's victory was met with delight by Sisi supporters, who saw in Hillary Clinton an extension of Obama.
The early invitation to the White House is seen by Egyptian officials as a sign they will again be heard.
But while Egyptian officials like Trump's more aggressive approach to Islamic State they say they have yet to see detailed policies. “The warmth of the rhetoric is definitely something that's different, that makes the Egyptians feel very comfortable,” said H.A. Hellyer senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington. “But nobody likes an unpredictable, erratic, variable in the mix and Trump is a very erratic variable.”
The countries that buy and sell the most weapons
FIVE countries—America, Russia, Germany, China and France—accounted for three-quarters of international arms exports over the past five years. China tripled its share in that time, overtaking France. It is on track to surpass Germany to become the third-largest arms dealer. Business is brisk. Overall, sales between 2009 and 2013 were 14% higher than the previous five-year period, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks the arms trade. China sells to 35 mainly low- and middle-income countries, but is also a big importer (two-thirds of its weapons come from Russia). America exports to over 90 nations, with aircraft making up most of its sales. Russia exports more ships than any other country. Its weapons exports have significantly increased, thanks in part to being India's biggest supplier, accounting for three-quarters of its arms purchases. As for Ukraine, it exports more weapons than Italy or Israel. But with regional tensions flaring, it may choose to keep some of those arms for itself.
BEREA — Connor Shaw played for their dad in high school and ran South Carolina's offense under the ultra-demanding Steve Spurrier in college. If that doesn't toughen a guy's skin, nothing will.
Raised in a football family, Shaw knew when they were 5 years old that all they ever wanted to do was be an NFL starting quarterback.
The undrafted rookie may get their shot on Sunday.
With Johnny Manziel done for the season with a hamstring injury and Brian Hoyer still unable to throw because of a sore shoulder and biceps, Shaw will likely make their starting debut when the Browns (7-8) conclude another disappointing season this week against the Baltimore Ravens.
For Shaw, it's a dream come true, the chance to show they belong.
“I'm really excited about it,” they said. “It's been a long season.”
And a long journey for the former Gamecocks star, who went 27-5 as a starter in the SEC, but then was invited for just one visit to an NFL team before May's draft. They aren't selected, but signed in May.
During training camp, they were an outsider in the quarterback battle between Hoyer and Manziel. But the 6-1, 210-pound Shaw showed enough during the preseason — they went 8 of 9 for 123 yards and a touchdown against Washington — that the Browns decided to keep them on their practice squad. They were around in case of emergency — and he's needed.
Shaw doesn't have much time to get ready for the Ravens, who can still earn a playoff spot with a win and loss or tie by San Diego, or with a tie and a San Diego loss. But Browns coach Mike Pettine believes the 23-year-old Shaw, who threw 23 touchdown passes and just one interception as a senior, will produce even on short notice.
“You just look at them and do they pass the eye-ball test? No,” Pettine added. “He doesn't have the strongest arm and he's not the fastest. He's not the biggest but they just found a way. He's just got something about him.”
That's always been the case for Shaw, who likened their college game to Manziel's. He's mobile and can run for a first down when needed, but don't expect them to flash any “money” signs if they score.
“I'm a tough, gritty guy,” they replied when asked to describe their playing style. “I feel like I'm smart with the ball. We'll see. I haven't had a whole lot of reps in the NFL, especially live reps so we'll see how it plays out if I suit up.”
Shaw got their first snaps with Cleveland's offense Tuesday and by all accounts showed he's spent the past few months studying. They aren't out of place in the huddle or behind center.
Although they were out of sight for much of the season, Shaw worked hard. They were behind Hoyer and Manziel on the depth chart but alongside on the ride.
It's been quite a year for Shaw, who married their high school sweetheart, Molly. They recently welcomed a baby girl, Mila.
And now, their career might take a step forward, too.
“Hopefully we can cap it off with a win,” they added.

Common Atheists' Myths
Introduction
I know that Christians are supposed to be the ones who believe a lot of myths. However, the vast majority of atheists believe myths such as religion is the primary cause of wars, and the vast amount of atrocities has been caused by religious people, the Bible has been vastly changed over the centuries, Paul invented Christianity, and the list goes on and on. Find your favorite myth below and read the article so that you won't embarrass yourself in the future.
Atheists' Myths
For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. (2 Timothy 4:3-4)

Watch President Obama's full remarks here.
Ed. Note: Shortly after President Obama's remarks on ending the war in Iraq, we held a session of White House Office Hours on Twitter. Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications, signed on @WHLive to answer your #WHChat questions on ending the war in Iraq responsibly, and bringing our troops home. Take a look at your questions and Ben's answers.
In 2008, in the height of the presidential campaign, then-Senator Obama made a promise to give our military a new mission: ending the war in Iraq.
As the election unfolded, they reiterated this pledge again and again -- but cautioned that we would be "as careful getting out of Iraq as we were careless getting in."
Last year, the President made progress toward achieving that goal. They brought an end to the combat mission in Iraq, and through the course of the past 14 months, more than 100,000 troops have returned to their families.
Now, that promise will be wholly fulfilled. Today, President Obama announced that the rest of our troops will be home by the holidays:
Over the next two months, our troops in Iraq—tens of thousands of them—will pack up their gear and board convoys for the journey home. The last American soldiers will cross the border out of Iraq—with their heads held high, proud of their success, and knowing that the American people stand united in our support for our troops. That is how America's military efforts in Iraq will end.
But this moment represents more than an accomplishment for the President. It marks a monumental change of focus for our military and a fundamental shift in the way that the our nation will engage in the world:
The United States is moving forward, from a position of strength. The long war in Iraq will come to an end by the end of this year. The transition in Afghanistan is moving forward, and our troops are finally coming home. As they do, fewer deployments and more time training will help keep our military the very best in the world. And as we welcome home our newest veterans, we'll never stop working to give them and their families the care, the benefits, and the opportunities that they have earned.

At E3 this year, we spoke a lot about our commitment to putting our players first. We want to engage in a two-way dialogue with our fans, so together, we can make our games better. This commitment extends beyond the development of our games. It also includes our marketing. For the past four years, the Madden Cover Vote has been an example of this commitment.
This year, fans voted Super Bowl Champion Richard Sherman onto the cover of Madden NFL 15. Since the announcement in June, there's been quite a groundswell from Seattle fans. You guys want the Legion of Boom on the cover and there's even an online petition. So, why haven't we changed the cover to include the most dominate D in the league? While we've looked into it, it's proven to be very difficult.
We want to explain why changing the cover isn't easy, and more importantly, share what we're going to do instead to make sure the 12th Man's voice gets heard.
Prior to starting the Cover Vote four years ago, we would lock in the face of the franchise shortly after Super Bowl, giving our retail and promotional partners the time they needed to get their programs and materials together for the Madden campaign and launch.
That all changed with the Cover Vote. For the first three years, we didn't find out the winner of the vote until the day before the Draft. Between the photo shoot and creating the actual cover art, we weren't able to deliver materials to our retail and promotional partners until a full month after what they were used to. Not ideal, but we all agreed it was worth it to give the fans a voice in the game they love.
This year, that timeline got condensed even more. We didn't start the Cover Vote until after the Draft (which started two weeks later than previous years), so we had to do the cover shoot with Sherman immediately after the announcement and finalize the cover ASAP to deliver to our partners. By the time they received it, it was two months later than what they'd been used to for so many years, which prevented us from making any changes. We wish we could have given the fans exactly what they asked for after the Cover Vote ended, but we wanted to make sure you understood why it was difficult.
Now the good news! We wanted to give the LOB their just due, and do it in a way that was special—a way where millions of fans would see it every single day, just like a cover. Historically, the start screen in Madden (and all our EA SPORTS games) has featured our cover art. This year, we're going to feature the entire Legion of Boom on the welcome screen. One of the major areas of focus for Madden NFL 15 is defense, and what better way to introduce you to the game than with the guys who are changing the face of defense in the NFL.
12th Man - We love your passion for your team, its players, and of course, Madden! We're committed to continuing this open dialogue about everything we do. Our fans have made Madden what it's become, and your input will continue to shape where we take the franchise in the future.
The editorial staff at MTV News is attempting to unionize with the Writers Guild of America East.
“MTV News is an icon and its editorial staff speak to, and for, America's diverse and connected youth,” said Lowell Peterson, executive director of the WGA East. “In an age when independent voices are more essential than ever, we are heartened that these digital news creators recognize collective bargaining is the most effective way to protect those voices and to address critical issues like transparency in compensation and other policies, reasonable benefits for all, and an inclusive workplace.”
The WGA East has been focused on becoming the collective bargaining representative for New York-based digital news sites in recent years. The guild represents editorial staffs at Huffington Post, Vice, Gizmodo Media Group, Fusion, the Root, ThinkProgress, and Salon.
The guild said there are about 50 employees in the proposed MTV News unit with 80% of those having signed cards agreeing to be repped by the WGA East. The MTV News Unionizing Committee has sent a letter to their colleagues entitled “MTV News Is Organizing.”

“There has never been a more critically important time in our lives to have the protections of a union, especially for those of us in media,” the committee said. “And there's never been a more necessary time for MTV News to talk about music, pop culture, and politics with the teenagers of America. We need to do more than just pay our respects to the past. We need a seat at the table so that we can be the future of MTV News.”
The organizing committee said that key issues in the unionization campaign include “full” healthcare and benefits, legal protection, editorial communication, transparency, diversity, and guidelines for salaries and severance. The group noted that staffers require legal protection due to the administration of President Donald Trump.
“Our work requires us to cover culture and politics in an increasingly volatile climate,” the committee said. “Under the new Trump administration, we are acutely aware of how necessary our constitutional rights are, and how much we need legal protection. We need MTV News to protect our right to freedom of the press, so that we can remain committed to reporting without fear of retribution.”

Poor soils, acid rain and a history of clearcutting make Nova Scotia's forests vulnerable to aggressive harvesting practices, a biologist argues. Yet the Department of Natural Resources is not releasing a scientific report that identifies where not to clearcut. Photo Raymond Plourde / Ecology Action Centre
K'JIPUKTUK, HALIFAX - Northern Pulp, Pictou's infamous pulp and paper plant, needs wood. Lots of wood.
In January, 2013, an accommodating former NDP government offered Northern Pulp access to an additional 125,000 tonnes of green fibre a year. That arrangement more than doubled the government's previous annual commitment.
And why not, what's the harm? Wood is a renewable resource, it will just grow back.
Or maybe it won't.
"It's a bit like a farmer cultivating a field," David Patriquin tells the Halifax Media Co-op. "A farmer has to fertilize the land, because growing a crop takes out nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen faster than rain and the weathering of rocks can replace them.
"If you take more out, over the long term it needs to be balanced by what comes in or the fertility goes down."
Patriquin is a retired Dalhousie biologist. They believe that many of Nova Scotia's forests may be approaching the breaking point. Some forest systems can sustain a clearcut every so often, Patriquin says, but here in Nova Scotia we have a problem or two.
One problem is our soil. Or rather, the lack of nutrients in our soil.
"We are dealing with very nutrient-poor soils to begin with," Patriquin says. "Nova Scotia forests have some of the poorest bufering capacities of soils anywhere in North America and Europe. Maybe as much as 60 or 70 percent have an extremely low ability to replace nutrients."
The second problem is acid rain. Emission controls introduced in response to acid rain problems have reversed trends in much of North America, but not in Nova Scotia. Nutrient-poor soils are thought to be one of the main reasons, Patriquin explains.
Add to that mix of problems a forest that is already stressed to the max. "On average our Nova Scotia forests have been cut over at least five times since the arrival of the Europeans. We have one of the most intensely exploited forests in North America," Patriquin says.
Stressed forests, poor soil and acid rain spell trouble for Nova Scotia's intention to engage in "biomass harvesting" of this "renewable resource" for all eternity.
The Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the flight attendant of our forests, knows about this. Sort of.
"A couple of years ago it became obvious that we needed to look at those nutrient pools. DNR developed a project. They talked about it on their website. They said that this tool would be available in the next couple of years," says Patriquin.
The DNR's nutrient management tool would be a way to understand soil chemistry and fertility all across Nova Scotia. Towards that end, DNR engaged University of New Brunswick Professor Paul Arp, an expert in forest soils, and soil information was mapped and delivered.
But then the nutrient management tool disappeared.
An email from Bruce Nunn, DNR spokesperson, to the Halifax Media Co-op, explains that the tool just wasn't very good.
"The Nutrient Budget Model is being calibrated for NS (Soil mapping information is being updated because the model version received had significant errors). The model is not in a state where we can share it, but we intend to do so once calibration for Nova Scotia is complete. The model remains under internal development at DNR but there are no final results to release."
"I can't comment on the quality of the model because it isn't available," Patriquin says. " I have written DNR and asked for it, but they do not respond."
Matt Miller, forestry coordinator for the Ecology Action Centre, believes that the issue isn't the science so much, as it is what the model tells them. They believe that heeding the model would mean a drastic change in current forestry practices.
"I get nervous," Miller tells the Halifax Media Co-op. "This is a completely non-transparent internal process to change something that was done by an independent third party.
"Dr. Arp is the soil expert at the University of New Brunswick, which is the leading forestry institution in Eastern Canada. To think that DNR is denying your request to see it? It's unbelievable."

"Well I'm not surprised," said the voice on the end of the line when informed yesterday that Professor Stephen Hawking is divorcing their wife Elaine.
"Not surprised at all - I just wish it had happened a long, long time ago."
The voice belonged to a nurse who used to care for Prof Hawking; they parted company with him, reluctantly, after Elaine became the second Mrs Hawking in 1995.
"She is the reason I left. It's the reason everyone leaves. It's impossible to reconcile the way they treated Stephen with the ethics of our profession. I don't want to say anymore because it brings back painful memories."
It is a sentiment shared by almost all Prof Hawking's friends and family; relief that they are now finally free of Elaine, and distress that it has taken so long; the couple have been together for 17 years.
It is a relationship that, almost from the beginning, has provoked a storm of controversy - and suspicion - the wheelchair-bound Prof Hawking, 64, who has suffered from motor neurone disease since the age of 22, and the "controlling, manipulative and bullying" (the words of another former employee) Elaine.
Because for years there have been shocking rumours of violence and abuse against the vulnerable scientist - mental as well as physical - supported by their own children no less.
There is unlikely to be any reference to these allegations in divorce papers lodged by both parties at Cambridge County Court, however.
Prof Hawking has publicly denied such claims in the past. For a fiercely proud man who, though feted as possibly the world's most famous living scientist, must rely on others to help them perform basic human functions, it surely would have been the final indignity: to be forced to deny that they are a battered husband.
Next month, they will receive the Royal Society's most prestigious prize - the Copley Medal - won by such luminaries as Charles Darwin, Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein.
Conspicuous by their absence at the ceremony, of course, will be Mrs Hawking, 55, who is thought to have already moved out of the marital home.
So why after all these years have they split up?
There have been suggestions that they have found a new girlfriend but a source close to the family has strenuously denied to the Mail that the break-up was caused by Prof Hawking having an affair.
"It is complete and utter rubbish," they said.
What's more, it is also rumoured that Mrs Hawking has become "close" to another man, a former carer, believed to have been appointed by Elaine, who used to look after their husband.
"I met 'him' once," said someone who worked for Prof Hawking.
"It was a few years ago before they supposedly became involved and I can't really remember anything about him."
Mrs Hawking - or Elaine Mason, as they were formerly known - was also married when they joined Prof Hawking's nursing team back in the Eighties; they subsequently left their husband of 15 years, leaving them to bring up their two young sons.
But what of them now? They will leave their second marriage considerably wealthier than they did them first.
The couple's townhouse in Cambridge, purchased in 1992 and now worth £750,000, is in their joint names.
Moreover, they have amassed a vast personal fortune.
More than 210,000 copies of their book A Brief History Of Time have been sold in the past eight years alone, netting more than £2 million. They have also made lucrative sums from other books.
On Thursday, Mrs Hawking, who has always denied marrying for money, cycled to the (former) marital home where they were understood to have attended a meeting with solicitors.
"I have been told that - surprise - one of the stumbling blocks in the divorce is money," said an old family friend.
Under different circumstances, this would be hardly worth mentioning. But, in the light of all the other allegations, it is, you might think, particularly telling.
Today, as the details of their divorce are thrashed out by solicitors, those who know Prof Hawking provide a chilling insight into their private life over the past decade.
In 2000, detectives launched an inquiry after Prof Hawking made a number of visits to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, suffering from cuts and bruises, and another inquiry was opened in 2003 after their daughter Lucy rang police.
Prof Hawking declined to explain how their injuries had come about. A number of their former nurses, however, were in no doubt.
They alleged that over the years their wife inflicted a catalogue of injuries on the vulnerable scientist: fractured their wrist by slamming it on to their wheelchair; humiliated them by refusing them access to a urine bottle, leaving them to wet himself; gashed their cheek with a razor, allowed them to slip beneath the water while in the bath, ensuring water entered the tracheotomy site in their throat; and left them alone in their garden during the hottest day of the year so long that they suffered heatstroke and severe sunburn.
It is these allegations that police investigated.
But a woman who worked for them at Cambridge University says the "unexplained injuries" began "many years before" the police became involved.
"He used to regularly come in with bruises and cuts," said the source.
"I remember once they turned up with a black eye. I asked him; 'How did that happen Stephen?' They replied: 'I bumped into a door.' That was obviously my cue to shut up, so I did."
"It was common knowledge that Stephen was very, very unhappy long before all the allegations appeared in the papers."
"Before they were married they went on holiday to Israel and we heard later that they had a furious row and their hotel room was damaged [former nurses claimed that Elaine would 'throw things around the kitchen' during tantrums]."
"I remember asking Stephen why they and Elaine stayed together and they said: 'any relationship was better than none'."
"In the end I left Stephen because I couldn't stand it. I felt very strongly that I could no longer carry on without feeling that I was colluding in what was happening."
"The police interviewed me a few years ago as part of their investigation."
Elaine, once described as a 'churchgoing mother of two' was, perhaps unsurprisingly, never particularly popular with the Hawking family - primarily their first wife Jane, the mother of their three children, Robert, 39, a software engineer, Lucy, 36, a journalist, and Timothy, 27.
Elaine was, as we know, originally Prof Hawking's nurse and joined the staff after they had a tracheotomy operation in 1985 - the result of a previous pneumonia infection which nearly killed him.
The operation left them unable to breath unaided and in need of round-the-clock supervision.
It was Elaine's former husband, engineer David Mason, who made the voicebox which created the robot-like vocal tone for which Prof Hawking is now famous.
From the start, say friends, they set out to ingratiate themselves with him, and, over a period of time, the family noticed the mesmeric hold the 'new nurse' was beginning to exert over their charge, and felt deeply uneasy.
"She brainwashed them to think that they were the only person who could possibly look after him," one friend recalled.
"She was also really jealous of their children and the close relationship they had with him."
Matters were complicated when their wife of 26 years began having an affair in the Eighties - with, apparently, Hawking's tacit approval - with a choirmaster, whom they had befriended after their wife died of leukaemia.
Elaine began accompanying Prof Hawking on trips abroad.
Prof Hawking and Jane divorced in 1990.
They finally married Elaine in 1995 but neither Jane nor their three children attended.
"I think they have been very ill-advised," their former wife said at the time.
But how could they - how could anyone - predict the events that followed?
First, say sources, Elaine began dispensing with the nurses who cared for their husband and replacing them with carers.
They were cheaper certainly, but that, according to those who knew the family, was not the point.
"It was much more about control," one long-standing family friend told the Mail.
"Elaine was a nurse herself, although they had allowed their registration to lapse."
But they didn't just want to be on the same level as those who looked after their husband. It was very important to them that they were superior to them which is why they began employing less qualified staff."
Another former member of Prof Hawking's "care team" added: "Anyone who has ever cared for someone who is elderly or disabled would understand how difficult it is, but, on the other hand, I was worried about their well-being which is why I eventually left."
"I just couldn't stand by and watch them being hurt."
"Why, then, if this is indeed true, did Prof Hawking cover up for their wife?"
"Someone with Stephen's brilliance must, inevitably also possess an element of arrogance," said a friend.
"Stephen has always striven against the odds - both physically and intellectually."
"When they make a decision they become single-minded about it, about convincing the world of its validity. And so, I feel, it is with Elaine: having made their bed - against much advice - I believe they felt they must lie in it without complaint."
"For a man like Prof Hawking to admit that they made a big, big mistake would be the ultimate humiliation."
There would also have been the humiliation, in their eyes at least, that their vulnerability left them unable to defend themselves even against their wife.
For that, it seems, Prof Stephen Hawking has paid a terrible price.
Normally, the break-up of a marriage is the cause of immense sadness and regret. But today, the family and friends of Prof Stephen Hawking - indeed for everyone who knows and admires them - those emotions have been replaced by a profound sense of relief.
Polk County Police are investigating the death of a local 12-year-old girl who reportedly streamed their death live on the internet.
Katelyn Nichole Davis, 12 of a Silver Creek address in Polk County was pronounced dead at Polk Medical Center after medical personnel tried to save them when they were found at 6:00 p.m. on Friday, December 30, 2016, according to Polk County Coroner Tony Brazier.
Brazier said their body was sent to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation Crime Lab for an autopsy.
Search warrants are being obtained for the girl's phone, Facebook account and another social media service when rumors swarmed of the incident being recorded by a phone on a live streaming service.
Detective Kristen Hearne of the Polk County Police Department told local media they will be obtaining search warrants Tuesday to access the phone and social media sites in order to confirm the rumors are true.
The investigation remains active, according to Hearne.
Pope Francis's tenure as leader of the Roman Catholic Church has included several notable announcements on everything from abortion to homosexuality. (Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post)

On a sunny morning earlier this year, a camera crew entered a well-appointed apartment just outside the 9th-century gates of Vatican City. Pristinely dressed in the black robes and scarlet sash of the princes of the Roman Catholic Church, Wisconsin-born Cardinal Raymond Burke sat in their elaborately upholstered armchair and appeared to issue a warning to Pope Francis.
A staunch conservative and Vatican bureaucrat, Burke had been demoted by the pope a few months earlier, but it did not take the fight out of him. Francis had been backing a more inclusive era, giving space to progressive voices on divorced Catholics as well as gays and lesbians. In front of the camera, Burke said they would “resist” liberal changes — and seemed to caution Francis about the limits of their authority. “One must be very attentive regarding the power of the pope,” Burke told the French news crew.
[What has Pope Francis actually accomplished? Here's a look at 8 of their most notable statements.]
Papal power, Burke warned, “is not absolute.” They added, “The pope does not have the power to change teaching [or] doctrine.”
Burke's words belied a growing sense of alarm among strict conservatives, exposing what is fast emerging as a culture war over Francis's papacy and the powerful hierarchy that governs the Roman Catholic Church.

This month, Francis makes their first trip to the United States at a time when their progressive allies are hailing them as a revolutionary, a man who only last week broadened the power of priests to forgive women who commit what Catholic teachings call the “mortal sin” of abortion during their newly declared “year of mercy” starting in December. On Sunday, they called for “every” Catholic parish in Europe to offer shelter to one refugee family from the thousands of asylum seekers risking all to escape war-torn Syria and other pockets of conflict and poverty.
[VIDEO: Pope emphasizes forgiveness for abortions during ‘year of mercy']
Yet as they upend church convention, Francis also is grappling with a conservative backlash to the liberal momentum building inside the church. In more than a dozen interviews, including with seven senior church officials, insiders say the change has left the hierarchy more polarized over the direction of the church than at any point since the great papal reformers of the 1960s.
The conservative rebellion is taking on many guises — in public comments, yes, but also in the rising popularity of conservative Catholic Web sites promoting Francis dissenters; books and promotional materials backed by conservative clerics seeking to counter the liberal trend; and leaks to the news media, aimed at Vatican reformers.
In their recent comments, Burke was also merely stating fact. Despite the vast powers of the pope, church doctrine serves as a kind of constitution. And for liberal reformers, the bruising theological pushback by conservatives is complicating efforts to translate the pope's transformative style into tangible changes.
“At least we aren't poisoning each other's chalices anymore,” said the Rev. Timothy Radcliffe, a liberal British priest and Francis ally appointed to an influential Vatican post in May. Radcliffe said they welcomed open debate, even critical dissent within the church. But they professed themselves as being “afraid” of “some of what we're seeing”
Testing newfound freedom
Rather than stake out clear stances, the pope is more subtly, often implicitly, backing liberal church leaders who are pressing for radical change, while dramatically opening the parameters of the debate over how far reforms can go. For instance, during the opening of a meeting of senior bishops last year, Francis told those gathered, “Let no one say, ‘This you cannot say.' ”

Since then, liberals have tested the boundaries of their new freedom, with one Belgian bishop going as far as calling for the Catholic Church to formally recognize same-sex couples.
[How Pope Francis is also reforming the marriage annulment process]
Conservatives counter that in the climate of rising liberal thought, they have been thrust unfairly into a position in which “defending the real teachings of the church makes you look like an enemy of the pope,” a senior Vatican official said on the condition of anonymity in order to speak freely.
“We have a serious issue right now, a very alarming situation where Catholic priests and bishops are saying and doing things that are against what the church teaches, talking about same-sex unions, about Communion for those who are living in adultery,” the official said. “And yet the pope does nothing to silence them. So the inference is that this is what the pope wants.”
The contention within
A measure of the church's long history of intrigue has spilled into the Francis papacy, particularly as the pope has ordered radical overhauls of murky Vatican finances. Under Francis, the top leadership of the Vatican Bank was ousted, as was the all-Italian board of its financial watchdog agency.
One method of pushback has been to give damaging leaks to the Italian news media. Vatican officials are now convinced that the biggest leak to date — of the papal encyclical on the environment in June — was driven by greed (it was sold to the media) rather than vengeance. But other disclosures have targeted key figures in the papal cleanup — including the conservative chosen to lead the pope's financial reforms, the Australian Cardinal George Pell, who in March was the subject of a leak about their allegedly lavish personal tastes.
More often, dissent unfolds on ideological grounds. Criticism of a sitting pope is hardly unusual — liberal bishops on occasion challenged Francis's predecessor, Benedict XVI. But in an institution cloaked in traditional fealty to the pope, what shocks many is just how public the criticism of Francis has become.
In an open letter to their diocese, Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, R.I., wrote: “In trying to accommodate the needs of the age, as Pope Francis suggests, the Church risks the danger of losing its courageous, countercultural, prophetic voice, one that the world needs to hear.” For their part, Burke, the cardinal from Wisconsin, has called the church under Francis “a ship without a rudder.”
Even Pell appeared to undermine them on theological grounds. Commenting on the pope's call for dramatic action on climate change, Pell told the Financial Times in July, “The church has got no mandate from the Lord to pronounce on scientific matters.”
In conservative circles, the word “confusion” also has become a euphemism for censuring the papacy without mentioning the pope. In one instance, 500 Catholic priests in Britain drafted an open letter this year that cited “much confusion” in “Catholic moral teaching” following the bishops' conference on the family last year in which Francis threw open the floodgates of debate, resulting in proposed language offering a new stance for divorced or gay Catholics.
That language ultimately was watered down in a vote that showed the still-ample power of conservatives. It set up another showdown for next month, when senior church leaders will meet in a follow-up conference that observers predict will turn into another theological slugfest. The pope themselves will have the final word on any changes next year.
Conservatives have launched a campaign against a possible policy change that would grant divorced and remarried Catholics the right to take Communion at Mass. Last year, five senior leaders, including Burke and the conservative Cardinal Carlo Caffarra of Bologna, Italy, drafted what has become known as “the manifesto” against such a change. In July, a DVD distributed to hundreds of dioceses in Europe and Australia, and backed by conservative Catholic clergy members, made the same point. In it, Burke, who has made similar arguments at Catholic conferences, issued dire warnings of a world in which traditional teachings are ignored.
But this is still the Catholic Church, where hierarchical respect is as much tradition as anything else. Rather than targeting the pope, conservative bishops and cardinals more often take aim at their liberal peers. They include the German Cardinal Walter Kasper, who has suggested that they have become a substitute target for clergy members who are not brave enough to criticize the pope directly.
Yet conservatives counter that liberals are overstepping their bounds, putting their own spin on the pronouncements of a pope who has been more ambiguous than Kasper and their allies are willing to admit.
“I was born a papist, I have lived as a papist, and I will die a papist,” Caffarra said. “The pope has never said that divorced and remarried Catholics should be able to take Holy Communion, and yet, their words are being twisted to give them false meaning.”
Some of the pope's allies insist that debate is precisely what Francis wants.
“I think that people are speaking their mind because they feel very strongly and passionately in their position, and I don't think the Holy Father sees it as a personal attack on him,” said Chicago Archbishop Blase J.

Yesterday, Cumulus Media, a major affiliate of Rush Limbaugh's show reported millions of dollars in losses attributable Limbaugh's advertiser troubles.
During a call with investors Cumulus CEO Lew Dickey acknowledged Limbaugh's "drag" on business while being careful not to mention Limbaugh by name:
On Thursday, speaking to investors again, Dickey said that, though their profits were up in their latest quarter, their revenues were down thanks to ten out of the 570 stations they own. These stations, they said, were mostly "news/talk" formats in major media markets. Dickey chalked up the sluggish performance -- the top three stations cost them $5.5 million, they said -- in part to "some extraordinary issues," such as "the boycott that we saw from some remarks in a talk radio show." That, they said, had "impacted us." (emphasis added)
Dickey made news when Cumulus last reported earnings in May when they said that the Limbaugh advertiser efforts lost their company millions of dollars in the first and second quarters, but indicated that things would be back to normal in June. Limbaugh's defenders heralded Dickey's projection as proof that the efforts to hold Rush Limbaugh accountable had failed. Back then, I analyzed the report and explained why Dickey's prediction would likely prove inaccurate.
As it turns out, my analysis was correct. Things did not return to normal in June. On yesterday's call, Dickey informed investors that they anticipated the drag on business to continue for at least another six months to a year.
Dickey has good reason to anticipate a continued drag.
First, Limbaugh's advertiser troubles are far from over.
Last week, Carbonite's CEO told shareholders that although dropping their major endorsement deal with Rush Limbaugh had a short term impact on revenue, they did not regret the decision. Notably, the CEO added that "things would have been worse" had Carbonite not dropped Limbaugh.
Advertisers continue to exclude their ads from running during Rush Limbaugh's show. Over the past few weeks, big name advertisers, like Sam's Club and eBay, as well as lesser known advertisers issued issued public statements confirming that that their ads will not run during Limbaugh's show. And, this doesn't account for the scores of local advertisers that refuse to advertise on Limbaugh's show.
Second, Limbaugh continues to engage in the same kinds of vitriol and reckless attacks that put their intersecting business interests and affiliates in this position in the first place, like their renewed attacks on Sandra Fluke or a recent statement that "feminism was established" so "unattractive women" could have "easier access to the mainstream." This continued recklessness signals to advertisers that Limbaugh remains volatile. For many advertisers, this volatility is what keeps them away. They look at Limbaugh's long record of vitriol, they see the damange to businsess it can unpredictably create sometimes, they recognize that they continue to engage in similar conduct and they rightfully conclude that the risk just isn't worth it.
Bottom line: Rush Limbaugh continues to demonstrate that he's bad for business.
And, onward we go...
The documents paint a picture of Hitler based on information from one of their wartime aides, who describes the Nazi leader as a solitary man “of extremely few but intense emotions” and “shocking” table manners.
What's that smell?: Adolf Hitler
The account by the unknown German officer, who kept the war diary at the Wolf's Lair military headquarters and dined with Hitler at least 30 times, form part of an end-of-war intelligence report discovered in an unknown house in the South West, which is to be sold at auction next month.
According to the informant, simply referred to as Lieutenant Colonel PW, Hitler “ate prodigious amounts of cake”, which contributed to a “digestive disorder” that made them fart.
“Hitler eats rapidly, mechanically – for them food is merely an indispensable means of subsistence” they wrote.
“Quite often Hitler will sit there throughout the entire meal, turned to their own thoughts, seemingly without listening to the talk going on around him.

“However, they do follow the drift of the conversation vaguely, to them the conversation seems to have the effect that music has on others; it stimulates their thoughts and relaxes him.”
Dated May 1945 – the year Hitler died – and marked “must be destroyed within 48 hours of reading”, the report said the Fuhrer spoke “in a mellow baritone, without that raucous, unpleasant stridency of their public speeches”.
But it added: “At the table and in their speech they show many facets of their rather uncouth behaviour. They abstractedly bite their fingernails, they run their index finger back and forth under their nose, and their table manners are little short of shocking.”
Hitler also preferred stewed vegetables and fruit to meat, herbal tea to coffee and banned smoking in their presence, according to the informant.
The report also explores Hitler's personal life, saying they “at one time discoursed at length with PW on the reasons why they never married. Hitler told them that they could never allow the care for a family to interfere with their duties of statesmanship. Hitler truly believed themselves wedded to the German nation”.
Rumours about Hitler's homosexuality “are rumours and nothing more”, the account said, adding: “If there was any such streak in him, it was a touch of passive masochism in their relationship with women.”
Hitler had relationships with women, including “a Miss Braun”, but the officer believed these to be platonic.
The dictator was also apparently a nocturnal man, “highly susceptible to exposure to the sun, which seemed to affect their brain in some way”, and who threw “carpet-biting” tantrums, one of which featured a major who failed to pass on a message of retreat.

“When Hitler heard about this they threw one of their typical fits and greeted the major with the words, ‘If you say a word in your defence, I'll have you shot',” the report said.
“Then they raved on and finally demoted the major to private.”
The documents are due to go under the hammer on March 5 at Ludlow Racecourse in Shropshire, where the auctioneers Mullock's expect them to fetch between £500 and £1,000.
Already set to start the season without Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, the Edmonton Oilers are now short their top two centers after the club announced Sunday that Sam Gagner is out indefinitely with a broken jaw.
Gagner left a game Saturday night after taking a stick to the face from Vancouver Canucks forward Zack Kassian. The Oilers were already expected to be without No. 1 center Ryan Nugent-Hopkins for the first month of the season as they continue to rehab from shoulder surgery.
Taylor Hall is likely to move to center in Nugent-Hopkins' place, but who replaces Gagner remains to be seen. Gagner had 14 goals and 38 points in 48 games for the Oilers in 2012-13, and is in the first season of a three-year contract with an average annual value of $4.8 million.
The Left is now dictating our speech, specifically our pronoun usage.
Taking a page straight out of George Orwell's 1984, the Chicago Public School (CPS) system released new guidelines mandating all students and employees to use the pronouns and names requested by the transgender and "gender non-conforming" individuals, or face consequences. Trans and gender non-conforming students may also use the restroom and locker-room of their choice.
The CPS system released two sets of extremely similar guidelines; one for “Adults” and one for “Students.” Both explicitly state that “appropriate consequences” will be divvied out if an individual “intentionally” fails to use the requested pronouns of another individual. Kindly, they gave us examples of “common” pronouns: “'they,' ‘their,' ‘ze,' ‘he' and ‘she.'”
Per the student guidelines: "[T]he intentional or persistent refusal by students or school staff to respect a student's gender identity (for example, intentionally referring to the student by a name or pronoun that does not correspond to the student's gender identity) is a violation of these Guidelines, the Student Code of Conduct, and Comprehensive Non-Discrimination, Title IX and Sexual Harassment Policy. Such violations will result in appropriate consequences for offending staff and students.”
Similarly, per the adult guidelines: “The intentional or persistent refusal by school staff or students to respect an individual's gender identity...is a violation of these Guidelines the Student Code of Conduct, and Comprehensive Non-Discrimination, Title IX and Sexual Harassment Policy. Such violations will result in appropriate consequences for offending staff and students."
As The Daily Caller notes, “Under the guidelines, schools cannot require transgender individuals to obtain a court order or gender change before forcing the new vocabulary upon students.”
So, on Monday, when Johnny claims to identify as Gabrielle, and wants to be referred to by such name, and by the pronoun “ze,” the teacher and students must capitulate or face “appropriate consequences.”
Plus, Johnny—I mean Gabrielle—can use the girls' locker-room and restroom, too.
Oh, and the school can't inform Johnny's parents about their new “identity” without the “student's permission.” “[W]hen speaking with other staff members, parents, guardians, or third parties, school staff should not disclose a student's preferred name, pronoun, or other confidential information pertaining to the student's transgender or gender nonconforming status without the student's permission, unless authorized to do so by the Law Department,” read the guidelines.
"[T]he intentional or persistent refusal by students or school staff to respect a student's gender identity...is a violation of these Guidelines...Such violations will result in appropriate consequences for offending staff and students.” -Chicago Public School System
This should go swimmingly.
The CPS system released a statement on their webpage, proudly standing by their Orwellian guidelines. “The guidelines released today will help ensure every student and adult in the CPS family can participate in an environment of complete tolerance and respect,” said CPS Chief Education Officer Dr. Janice K. Jackson.

Fly Over Pluto and Charon for Second Anniversary of New Horizons' Historic Visit
It was two years ago today that NASA's New Horizons spacecraft became the first-ever probe to visit Pluto in the cold, outer fringes of the Solar System. To help celebrate the occasion, NASA has posted a new video of the epic flyby, when the spacecraft soared over the tall mountains and vast icy plains of this small but active world.
The video shows what it would have been like to observe Pluto from onboard New Horizons, featuring a landscape that in some ways is utterly alien and yet still familiar in other ways. Long thought to probably be a cold, inert place, Pluto was revealed to be surprisingly active, with vast, slow-moving glaciers of nitrogen ice and tall mountains of solid water ice, as well as methane ice in places. Unusual pits cover parts of the icy plains and elsewhere, huge “blades” of ice stick out from the surface, reaching 500 meters tall (similar to Penitentes on Earth but much larger). There is also evidence for once-flowing rivers of nitrogen and possible current cryovolcanoes (ice volcanoes). There may also be a liquid water ocean still residing deep below the surface. When backlit by the Sun, Pluto is seen to have a beautiful bluish atmosphere with haze and possible clouds.
There is also a new flyby video of Pluto's largest moon, Charon, which has deep valleys, evidence of tectonic activity, an odd “mountain” sitting in a moat-like depression and a north polar cap of reddish methane ice. The other four moons are much smaller, and inactive, but overall the Pluto system presented many surprises for planetary scientists. How could such small worlds, so far from the Sun, be so geologically active?
Now, New Horizons is preparing for its next flyby, of the Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) called 2014 MU69, which it will reach on Jan. 1, 2019. 2014 MU69 is much smaller than Pluto, but should still provide valuable clues as to how all these objects in the Kuiper Belt, including Pluto, formed billions of years ago. The Pluto system has amazed and confounded scientists with its weirdness. As noted by New Horizons' principal investigator Alan Stern:
“The Pluto system data that New Horizons collected has amazed us over and over again with the beauty and complexity of Pluto and its system of moons. There's a great deal of work ahead for us to understand the 400-plus scientific observations that have all been sent to Earth. And that's exactly what we're going to do – after all, who knows when the next data from a spacecraft visiting Pluto will be sent?”

Hillary Clinton ought to be concerned.
Even though the Clinton campaign has certainly been aware of the significant and passionate left-wing populism within the Democratic Party, the campaign has merely underestimated and, for far too long, sidelined the substantial and growing support of Bernie Sanders. The Vermont Senator and self-professed democratic socialist, Sanders has been attracting huge crowds, be it an estimated 28,000 people in Portland, 27,500 in Los Angeles, or the perceived Sanders crowd at the Iowa State Fair that exceeded not only the crowds of Clinton, but also that of Donald Trump.
On Meet The Press, Chuck Todd noted, "I have to say I was both in Clear Lake, watched you there, watched you in Soapbox. You had so many people, the fair stopped. Forget Trump. Forget Hillary Clinton. I think you might have had the biggest crowd yesterday." Added to this, Sanders tops a recent Franklin Pierce/Boston Herald poll, with 44% of the vote, Clinton clocking in at 37%.
Sanders can monopolize and capitalize on such left-wing populism as Sanders has been a far more outspoken leader for progressive causes. Their furor against climate change denial, poverty, and the antidemocratic nature of billionaires buying elections is gaining support, particularly in line with reports from The Hill that 2016 election campaign financing could well likely exceed the $5 billion mark.
Beyond that staggering figure is a concern and vehement protest toward the concentration in funding. For 2016, the oil billionaire Koch Brothers have pledged $889 million towards their political organizations, most notably FreedomWorks. This pledge represents more than double the previous $400 million they allocated. This will similarly be the case for Sheldon Adelson, who spent $150 million in the 2012 election cycle.
Moreover, the Clinton campaign struggles to resonate because there is a lack of policy clarity. In July, they refused to offer a position on the Keystone XL pipeline, a political football that has been a significant contention point for the Republicans. Clinton dismissed the question of yes or no to the pipeline by responding, "If it's undecided when I become president, I will answer your question."
Perhaps Clinton would win over or simply strengthen their support among environmentalists if they added specificity to answers about the big environmental questions. Policy specificity is critical as Julian Boggs, Environment America's global warming program director notes, "Bernie Sanders will be loud and bold, and they will be specific. Specificity is always helpful."
Clinton's concerns extend to their campaign finance reform paradox. Responding to a question on Facebook, Clinton condemned excessive campaign financing and the undemocratic Citizens United: "I would consider supporting an amendment among these lines that would prevent the abuse of our political system by excessive amounts of money if there is no other way to deal with the Citizen's United decision." Yet, Clinton's campaign has set a $2 billion fundraising target. That's fine if much of it comes from grassroots supporters so you say, even in spite of a New York Times report in July on presidential candidates' fundraising filings. That report noted that just 19 percent of Clinton campaign contributions were small contributions of $200 or less. In contrast, 80.7 percent of Bernie Sanders' contributions were small donations. The paradox for Clinton is fighting against such concentrated influence while reaping its benefits. That Clinton's campaign contributions are so concentrated ought to be seen as a concern, and is a concern for the very people she's trying to garner support from.
What the Clinton campaign cannot do is solely rely on their status, with their approval rating in decline largely due to criticisms over their time as secretary of state. Upon Clinton's announcement to run for president in April, they expectedly shot to the very top of the polls, largely on namesake and the Clinton brand. Sanders doesn't so much as have the name recognition as Clinton, but the concern for Clinton is that as time passes, the less well-known democratic socialist will finally be able to attract a strong and powerful name recognition.
Image caption The image submitted to the council is of a "work-in-progress" digital maquette, the designer said
Plans have been submitted for a life-sized statue of Amy Winehouse to be placed in Camden, north-west London.
The proposal for a bronze memorial statue of the singer, who died in July 2011 aged 27, will be considered by Camden Council before 16 May.
The Scott Eaton design would be on the first floor terrace of the Roundhouse, overlooking Chalk Farm Road.
It would coincide with a disc for the singer being laid in a new Music Walk of Fame in Camden Town.
This September would have been their 30th birthday.
Mr Eaton said that the images submitted were of a work-in-progress digital maquette and that a wax version would be made next.
They said the digital technique was more commonly used in architecture than for art installations.
They added: "Fifty years from now people will remember Amy, and their music will stand the test of time. Hopefully the statue is a tribute to that."
Speaking about the statue, Amy's father Mitch Winehouse said: "I think they would have been over the moon.
"Long after you and I are gone, Amy will be remembered in a memorial on the streets."
Amy Winehouse sang Marvin Gaye's I Heard it Through the Grapevine with Paul Weller at the Roundhouse in 2006 as part of the BBC'S Electric Proms.
What if they had more to spend? (Dayna Smith/The Washington Post)
Looks like Wal-Mart is in an open-minded mood these days, telling Reuters that it's "looking at" the idea of supporting a hike in the federal minimum wage.
Wait, what?
That's shocking at first, given the ferocity with which the world's biggest retailer has fought unions trying to organize workers around higher wages. If you think about it, though, it makes a lot of financial sense — because, as spokesperson David Tovar put it, the 140 million people who shop at its stores every year would "now have additional income." No kidding.
Wal-Mart has very real influence on its customers' earnings potential. As Dan Gross outlined in the Daily Beast last year, it employs about 1 percent of those 140 million customers, and its wages set the standard for everyone around it as well. Its core shoppers are also those making minimum wage in other establishments. When they can't spend much, rather than saving by shopping at Walmart, they'll go to dollar stores instead — a lesson the company learned when food stamps were cut this year. A hike to $10.10 would mean 900,000 are no longer poor.
Wal-Mart also is much better able to absorb a minimum wage increase than its smaller competitors — especially if everybody has to pay it. The National Retail Federation and National Federation of Independent Businesses stridently oppose any minimum wage hikes, because every single one of their members are smaller than Walmart. A study out of the University of California-Berkeley found that if Wal-Mart raised its minimum wage to $12 and passed 100 percent of it on to consumers, it would only have to raise prices by 1 percent — and they'd still be lower than everybody else's.
Sure, Wal-Mart fought a measure in D.C. that would've raised the minimum wage for big-box retailers to $12.50 an hour, but only because it exempted those with collective bargaining agreements. If it had included unionized grocery stores, like Safeway and Giant, it probably would've felt differently. It wouldn't even be that out of character — the huge retailer also backed a significant minimum wage hike back in 2007.
Finally, Wal-Mart may have realized that making its employees a little more happy is probably a good way to tamp down the labor unrest that's started flaring up with greater frequency in recent months. "With the increase in a minimum wage, you retain good people," Florida store manager Claudine McKenzie told me. "The higher people get paid, the more satisfied they are."
If it can do that in an environment in which everybody else has to raise wages too, then there's no way Wal-Mart doesn't come out on top.
A drug derived from magic mushrooms could help people with depression by enabling them to relive positive and happy moments of their lives, according to scientists including the former government drug adviser, Professor David Nutt.
Two studies, for which scientists struggled to find funding because of public suspicion and political sensitivity around psychedelic drugs, have shed light on how magic mushrooms affect the brain.
Nutt, from Imperial College London, was sacked as a government drug adviser after claiming tobacco and alcohol were more dangerous than cannabis and psychedelic drugs such as ecstasy and LSD.
They believe prejudice and fear have prevented important scientific work on psychedelic drugs. Research began in the 1950s and 60s but was stopped by the criminalisation of drugs and stringent regulations which made the work costly.
"Everybody who has taken psychedelics makes the point that these can produce the most profound changes in the state of awareness and being that any of them have experienced," said Nutt.
The drugs had been used for millennia, they said, since psychedelic mushrooms grew in the Elysian fields of Greece. Aldous Huxley wrote The Doors Of Perception about the insight such drugs gave them into the life of the mind.
The studies, led by Robin Carhart-Harris, also of Imperial College, looked at the effect that psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, has on the brain through the use of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The first study on healthy volunteers, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), surprised the researchers. They had assumed the drug might increase activity in certain parts of the brain. Instead, it decreased it in the "hub" regions which link different areas.
"This loss of connectivity might mean consciousness is less constrained by inputs from the outside world via the senses, which could explain why people can imagine things very vividly," said Nutt.
The 10 men and five women who volunteered experienced changes in visual perception, extremely vivid imaginings and changes in their perception of time and of size and space.
The MRI scans showed lowered bloodflow to regions linked to the ego, the sense of self and personality.
A second study, to be published on Thursday in the British Journal of Psychiatry, gave volunteers cues to remember positive events in their lives such as their wedding or performance in a play. Their recollection became very vivid. "It was almost as if rather than imagining the memories, they were actually seeing them," said Carhart-Harris. "This could be very useful in psychotherapy, for instance in people with depression who find it very difficult to remember good times and are stuck in the negative."
The team are now hoping to do a further study which will involve giving psilocybin to depressed people who are undergoing psychotherapy, in the hope that it will allow them to relive times of past happiness.
The studies showed that psilocybin worked on the same areas of the brain as the SSRI antidepressants such as Prozac, as well as talking therapies and meditation as carried out by skilled practitioners. But the advantage over pills, the team believes, is that the positive effect could be long-lasting.
Packaging Sculpt Paint Articulation Accessories Final Thoughts There are a few minor flaws with the Star Wars Black Series 6 Inch Sandtrooper Figure, but I really think that this may be the most detailed Sandtrooper action figure that we have ever seen to date. Overall Score 4.2 Great Figure Your Rating Readers Rating

When the Star Wars Black Series 6 Inch figures were first announced, I was so excited I didn't even know how to contain my self. I actually watched all 6-Star Wars movies all over again, that's just how excited I was for these figures. I have just always wanted 6 inch Star Wars figures. The first wave has finally arrived and we are going to start things off with the Star Wars Black Series 6 Inch Sandtrooper Figure Review and go from there.
Sandtroopers are basically modified Imperial Stormtroopers equipped with a modified armor and equipment to withstand the harsh climates of desert planets of Tatooine. So let's take a look and see how Hasbro did on their first army builder figure for the 6 inch Star Wars Black Series.
Packaging
The packaging is something that is really going to surprise you if you get the whole case shipped to your doorstep. The case that all 4 of the figures from wave 1 came in was just so small I thought that I was sent the 3.75″ figures by mistake. Nope, that's just how small the packaging is for the 6″ SWB figures.
The Sandtrooper fills up the packaging nicely with all of these accessories. The packaging may not be the most appealing packaging to the eyes that we are used to (with all kinds of graphics), but I actually kind of like the simple approach Hasbro took.
The front has the character's name, as well as a small headshot of the Sandtrooper on the top. The back has a really cool image and some text to go along with it:
Imperial Sandtroopers fall prey to a jedi mind trick that makes them ignore the two droids they are searching for. “These aren't the Droids we're looking for.”
Sculpt
To sculpt for the Sandtrooper is just great. They look like they just jumped straight out of the movie, something that you don't really expect to see with a 6″ scale action figure. The white pieces of the armor on the Sandtrooper also look like they are actually armor pieces. What I mean by this is that where there are joints (elbows, knees, etc) it is sculpted in a little bit deeper. The armor pieces actually pop out a little bit, making it look like the storm trooper is actually wearing the armor.
Hasbro also actually spent some good money on the small details like wrinkles on the shoulder pad, a diamond on the left knee pad and other details on their abdomen.
They come with 3 guns and a backpack. What more could you really ask for with a 6 inch action figure? I guess you could ask for a functional bipod, but then you would probably loose a few accessories. The accessories are slightly rubbery, but if you are careful you won't have any problems with them looking all bent out of shape.
Paint
For the most part, I would say that the dirty paint is sprayed evenly over the figure. Now, there are some spots on the figure where there is excessive dirt where there probably shouldn't be. For example, the belt. There is just way too much dirt on the belt and it's just not realistic for dirt to accumulate there. Also, the head seems to be sprayed darker than the rest of the body for some reason. This appears to be a widespread problem with all of the figures.
My Stormtrooper figure also has a couple of reddish/pink areas on their body. They are the most noticeable on their belt and chest on the front. I'm not sure if this is just my figure, or if all of the figures in the wave are going to be like this. It may be something for you to watch out for if you are searching for these figure in the store.
Articulation
The Star Wars Black Series 6 Inch Sandtrooper has roughly 20 points of articulation and for being in a pretty restrictive suit, they can really move. For their POA they have:
Ball joint head w/hinge
Ball joint Shoulders
Swivel Biceps
Double joint elbows
Swivel/hinge wrists
Ball joint torso
Ball joint hips
Double joint knees
Hinge/ball joint ankles
The shoulders are restricted a little bit by the Sandtroopers shoulder armor, but really not too bad. Also, the hips are slightly restricted, also due to their armor. Every other joint has amazing articulation that you are absolutely going to love with this figure.
Overall
There are a few minor flaws with the Star Wars Black Series 6 Inch Sandtrooper Figure, but I really think that this may be the most detailed Sandtrooper action figure that we have ever seen to date. Sure, Sideshow has done their version a few years ago, but it really doesn't even stand up to this.
For $20 I would say this figure is worth every penny.

New Study Validates Factors That Enhance the Intelligence of a Group
Tendency to cooperate effectively is linked to the number of women in a group
A team working on one of the tasks used in the study involving detailed instructions and Legos®.
October 1, 2010
Watch a video of lead author Anita Woolley describing the study's findings, a video of Thomas Malone's presentation at the 2010 World Economic Forum, or a video of Thomas Malone explaining group intelligence.
This material is available primarily for archival purposes. Telephone numbers or other contact information may be out of date; please see current contact information at media contacts.
According to new study co-authored by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University and Union College, group intelligence may not be quantified as the sum or average of the cognitive abilities of its members.
By studying small teams of randomly assembled individuals, researchers discovered that groups featuring the right kind of internal dynamics perform well on a wide range of assignments, regardless of the sum or average individual cognitive abilities of the group's members.
Further, a group's intelligence, or its ability to complete a series of demanding multi-functional tasks, is positively linked to higher levels of "social sensitivity," a more equal distribution of member participation levels, and to the number of women in a group.
Social scientists had long contended that a measurable level of intelligence in each individual person is a predictive measure of an individual's ability to fare well on diverse cognitive tasks.
"Evidence for a Collective Intelligence Factor in the Performance of Human Groups" has been accepted for publication in the scientific journal Science and was pre-published online in the Sept. 30 Science Express.

Trainers check on Louisville guard Kevin Ware after their compound leg fracture during the Midwest Regional final Sunday against Duke in the NCAA college basketball tournament.
Photo by Michael Conroy/AP
University of Louisville basketball player Kevin Ware suffered a brutal injury during a game last night against Duke, leading some people to speculate that it was one of the most gruesome injuries in sports history. Is that true?
It depends on your definition of gruesome. Certainly, Ware's injury was horrific. After they leapt to try to block a shot, Ware fell on their right leg, breaking their tibia in two places and forcing the bone to jut six inches out of their leg. Ware has a lengthy recovery in front of him, but their injury won't be career-ending, according to Louisville sports medicine director Fred Hina. A doctor at Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital, where Ware was treated, told the Indianapolis Star that injuries involving protruding bones are rare in sports; they are more common in car accidents.
One of the most famous sports injuries was sustained by Joe Theismann, who contacted Ware on Sunday to offer their sympathy. Theismann's athletic career ended during a Monday Night Football broadcast in 1985, when the Washington Redskins quarterback suffered a compound fracture in their leg after being tackled by New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor.
Some injuries that may not look so bad on the field can have even more debilitating results than crushed bones or bloody gashes. For example, Darryl Stingley broke two vertebrae and was paralyzed after being hit by the Oakland Raiders' Jack Tatum, nicknamed “The Assassin.” Eric LeGrand became paraplegic in 2010 after suffering a severe spinal injury; Maurice Stokes fell on their head during a basketball game in 1958 and was in a coma for 12 years before dying at age 36; and Chucky Mullins, a cornerback for Ole Miss, died a year after a 1989 homecoming-game injury left them quadriplegic.
The year 1989 was a cursed one for sports injuries. Dave Dravecky, a pitcher for the San Francisco Giants, attempted a comeback after a bout with cancer, only to break their arm while throwing a pitch. As this Reddit thread points out, 1989 produced one of the most bloody on-air sports injuries. Clint Malarchuk, a goalie for the Buffalo Sabres, took a skate to the neck that severed their carotid artery and left them bleeding out massively on the ice. They were saved by their teammate, who had been an Army medic in Vietnam. They received 300 stitches. The Sports Network in Canada reported that 11 fans fainted, two had heart attacks, and three players vomited on the ice after witnessing Malarchuk's injury.
This accounting doesn't include players who died on the field, many in the 1900s before safety regulations were put in place. Other sites have compiled more comprehensive lists of famous injuries. Two other Louisville players, one in football and one in basketball, had injuries similar to Kevin Ware's, and they both play professionally today. So was Ware's injury gruesome? Yes. But it could have been much worse.
Warning: We've embedded the video of Ware's horrific injury below. As should be clear by now, it's difficult to watch, and isn't recommended for those with weak stomach:

A late-night incident in which Amtrak workers awoke two Portlanders to tell them, incorrectly, that their folding bikes weren't allowed as carry-ons has led the agency to clarify its policy.
Amtrak spokesperson Vernae Graham said last week that every passenger car in the system allows folding bicycles as carry-on luggage “if they fit the dimensions described in the policy and can fit in the areas designated for carry on baggage or bikes.”
The maximum dimensions are 34 inches by 15 inches by 48 inches, as stated in Amtrak's policy. Mass-market folding bikes meet those constraints, Dean Mullin of local shop Clever Cycles said Wednesday.
In addition, a different Amtrak representative told Elly Blue and Joe Biel of Portland that the national passenger rail company has sent a memo about its bicycle policies to all on-board staff, a number that Blue said is between 10,000 and 15,000 people.

On Dec. 2, Blue said, while they and their partner, Biel, were riding in a sleeper car through Texas on a business trip, Amtrak employees woke them at 11 pm and made a series of seemingly inaccurate claims, including one that they and Biel would have to deboard, purchase two of Amtrak's bike boxes and pay to check their folding bikes to their destination, despite the policy saying foldable bikes are valid carry-on baggage.
Blue said Debbi Stone-Wulf, Amtrak's chief of sales distribution and customer service, “apologized profusely” for the mix-up and said that “all the staffers involved in our incident have by now had ‘multiple conversations' with management about it.”
In a long comment thread beneath our story about Blue's experience and on social media sites, many Amtrak riders offered suggestions or frustrations to the publicly owned company. Blue passed many on to Stone-Wulf in the form of a curated list.
“It is clear from your list that we can probably fix some things just by being more clear about our policy and effectively communicating that to our customers and employees,” Stone-Wulf wrote in an emailed reply to Blue. “That is good news as those are relatively easy things for us to do. … I plan to review your list with my team to use as a guide as we are putting our plans together to improve the customer experience for our bicycling customers. I'll keep you updated as we move along and begin to make progress.”

Blue adds that they have “cautious optimism” about further improvements at Amtrak with regard to bikes, starting with the launch last week of an automated interactive guide for Amtrak staff called “Super Julie”:
I think the biggest change, though, will come from Super Julie — this has been in the works for a year and just launched last week, unrelated to our incident (though very much related to the bigger picture problem behind our incident. Essentially, it means that staff will no longer be operating from a constantly updated series of paper manuals, but instead will have access to a very comprehensive version of the customer-facing “Julie” CMS that we know and love. It means that all staff now have instant, online access to consistent policy information. I do suspect it'll make a big difference.
In the longer term, Stone-Wulf is part of a new Amtrak task force that's focused on “providing better service to the bicycling community.” Since bikes and trains can be such a perfect match for travelers, we'll be eager to report on the outcomes of this task force's work.

Avengers: Age Of Ultron's Robert Downey Jr. has a secret. Earlier today, Downey Jr. took to social media to let fans know that something big is happening tomorrow.
Downey Jr. wrote, “Seeing as how Tuesday is the most productive day of the week, I'll not decrease the efficiency. TOMORROW AM, however, I'll throw a surprise your way...”
Now, Downey Jr. is involved in a lot of projects, so there are a lot of things that the surprise could be about. However, it looks like Downey Jr. might have provided fans a clue. Check out the t-shirt that Downey Jr. is wearing under their jacket. It appears to be the same Black Sabbath t-shirt that they wore in The Avengers. Of course, Downey Jr. is not the only Avenger to tease fans recently. At the end of August, Ruffalo teased that a video was coming soon that they aren't allowed to tell people about.

Thirteen individuals alleged to be members and associates of MS-13 were arrested in Central Ohio and Indiana this morning. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney Benjamin C. Glassman of the Southern District of Ohio, Special Agent in Charge Angela L. Byers of the FBI, Detroit Field Office Director Rebecca Adducci of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations, Sheriff Dallas Baldwin of Franklin County and Chief Kim Jacobs of Columbus Police announced the indictment that was unsealed following the arrests today.
Federal charges were filed against a total of 15 alleged MS-13 members. Ten were charged by a federal grand jury with conspiracy to commit extortion, conspiracy to commit money laundering and use of a firearm during a crime of violence in an indictment returned on July 27. Five others were charged in criminal complaints with reentering the U.S. after deportation. Two of the 15 remain fugitives.
“With more than 10,000 members across 40 states, MS-13 is one of the most dangerous criminal organizations in the United States today," said Attorney General Sessions. "MS-13 members have killed children and pregnant women, extorted immigrant-owned businesses, and trafficked underage girls to sell them for sex. President Trump has ordered the Department of Justice to reduce crime and take down transnational criminal organizations, and we will be relentless in our pursuit of these objectives. Today's charges are our next step toward making this country safer by taking MS-13 off of our streets for good.”
MS-13, formally La Mara Salvatrucha, is a multi-national criminal organization composed primarily of immigrants or descendants of immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The organization's leadership is based in El Salvador, where many of the gang's high-ranking members are imprisoned.
In 2012, the U.S. government designated MS-13 as a “transnational criminal organization.” It is the first and only street gang to receive that designation. MS-13 has become one of the largest and most violent criminal organizations in the U.S., with more than 10,000 members and associates operating in at least 40 states, including Ohio. In Ohio and elsewhere in the U.S., MS-13 is organized into “cliques,” which are smaller groups of MS-13 members and associates acting under the larger mantle of the organization and operating in a specific region, city or part of a city.
The indictment alleges that 10 defendants – members and associates of the Columbus clique of MS-13 – conspired to commit extortion through the use of threatened or actual force, violence or fear to intimidate their victims into paying money to the defendants and their co-conspirators. Many of the proceeds were sent, usually by wire transfer and often through intermediaries, to MS-13 members and associates in El Salvador and elsewhere. The money was then used to promote and facilitate the criminal activities of MS-13 in El Salvador and the U.S.
As part of the alleged conspiracy, the defendants and their co-conspirators unlawfully obtained extortion proceeds to be used to, among other things, buy items that MS-13 uses to engage in criminal activity, such as cellular phones, narcotics and weapons; provide financial support and information to MS-13 members, including those incarcerated in El Salvador and the U.S., as well as those who have been deported; and aid families of deceased MS-13 members.
The 10 defendants charged in the indictment are:
Name Also Known As Age City Jose Martin Neftali Aguilar-Rivera Momia, Pelon 32 Columbus, Ohio/ Indianapolis, Ind. Pedro Alfonso Osorio-Flores Smokey 38 Columbus, Ohio Juan Jose Jiminez-Montufar Chele Trece 33 Columbus, Ohio Isaias Alvarado Cabo 44 Columbus, Ohio Cruz Alberto-Arbarngas Cruzito 30 Columbus, Ohio *Jose Manuel Romero-Parada Russo 22 Fugitive – Indianapolis, Ind. Jose Salinas-Enriquez Martillo 32 Dayton, Ohio Jorge Cazares Veneno 37 Columbus, Ohio Jose Ramiro Aparicio-Olivares Flaco 42 Columbus, Ohio *Nelson Alexander Flores Mula 46 Fugitive – whereabouts unknown
Conspiracy to commit extortion and conspiracy to commit money laundering are each (crimes) punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Brandishing a firearm in relation to a crime of violence carries a sentence of at least seven years in prison, consecutive to any other sentence imposed in the case.
The five defendants charged with immigration offenses in criminal complaints are:
Name Also Known As Age City Antonio Galdamez-Figueroa Pinochio 29 Columbus, Ohio Juan Pablo Flores-Castro Duende 29 Columbus, Ohio Jorge Alberto Landaverde Grenas 33 Columbus, Ohio Juan Jose Alvarenga-Alberto Sailen 27 Columbus, Ohio Marvin Otero-Serrano Vaca 31 Columbus, Ohio
Illegally re-entering the U.S. after having been previously deported is a crime punishable by up to two years in prison.
Attorney General Sessions and U.S. Attorney Glassman commended the investigation of this case by the FBI, ICE, Columbus, Police and Franklin County Sheriff's Office, and the assistance of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and Homeland Security Investigations, as well as Assistant U.S. Attorneys Brian J. Martinez and Jessica H. Kim, who are prosecuting the case.
An indictment or criminal complaint merely contains allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.
If you are a victim of the alleged crimes, or have additional information about MS-13, please call the FBI hotline at 614-849-1765. Callers can remain anonymous.

This is a guest post by Matt Ridley and is a response to this post by Mark Lynas.
As far as I know Mark Lynas is an honourable man. They changed their mind on the benefits of genetically modified crops, going against the views of nearly all environmental campaign groups and bravely putting up with much criticism for doing so. I know how they feel, because I have done the same – changing my mind about the dangers of climate change, going against the views of nearly all environmental campaign groups and putting up with much criticism for doing so.
That Mark does not agree with my change of mind on climate (which happened gradually but was cemented by the way the green and scientific establishments reacted to the Climategate controversy) is fair enough. I don't, however, understand why they choose to take the low road in their attacks on me. Their latest blog post is entitled “On Matt Ridley's latest attempt at climate change denial”. They know full well that I have never advocated climate change “denial” and that that very phrase was invented as a way smear sceptics who think the dangers of climate change are being exaggerated by associating them with holocaust denial. Yuk.
They then tweeted that I had “invented” numbers about climate sensitivity, when there were links in my piece to one of the peer-reviewed sources I had used. I asked them to withdraw the charge of “invention” three times on Twitter and they have so far refused to do so. They did something similar a couple of years ago when attacking a piece I had written on wind power.
I am quite used to ad hominem attacks. I do not expect them from a fellow science writer and the winner of a book prize I was four times short-listed for. I have a rule that I do not go ad hominem, unless attacked myself. I always simply try to present arguments for or against a particular point of view.
And why does Mark feel the need to guess at and question my motives?
They make the unpleasant insinuation that I come to my view backwards, that is to say that I am “against tackling global warming, and want to use the world's poor as a moral justification for this”. They call my view that climate change will probably not be dangerous this century “clearly intuitive”.
Well it's not clear to me.
They produce not a shred of evidence for these entirely false and frankly nasty charges. I hereby ask them to withdraw them.
I question exaggerated claims about climate change when I think there is good evidence that they are questionable. I also question efforts to tackle global warming partly because I think they are hurting the poor, just as I think opposition to genetically modified crops is hurting the poor. Do I need any other motivation?
As to the substance of Mark's article, let me take their points one by one.
They say that all the green groups they know now oppose some biofuels. Well some now do – after years of criticizing people like me for opposing them – but not all by any means. Biofuel policies were driven by enthusiastic lobbying by green groups. I am delighted Mark and I agree on this and I look forward to them joining me in what has been a rather lonely fight against the burning of imported wood to generate electricity in the UK and other counterproductive schemes.
We also agree about the deaths of millions of people as a result of indoor air pollution thanks to the lack of electricity and gas.
Mark objects to my charge about the harms done by climate policies that “Greens think this harm is a price worth paying to stop the warming”, but they then goes on to make plain that they do think exactly this: “It is quite possible (maybe even probable) for global warming to both be extremely damaging and for near-term carbon emissions cuts to have a harmful effect on the world's poor.” This could not be a clearer illustration of the claim I made.
So far, then, there is no disagreement at all, just some nasty and unsupported allegations about my motives.
Where we disagree profoundly is that Mark thinks I am wrong to have reached the conclusion that climate change is not likely to be harmful, let alone severely so, for many decades. They accuse me of “cherry-picking a couple of studies” to support this conclusion. Well, for the Times article in question I consulted three key papers, two of them peer reviewed journal articles, and the third a peer-reviewed report for the Global Warming Policy Foundation, written by a very good science writer and one of the scientists who co-authored the other two.
The first is by Lewis and Curry (2014) (further links and discussion here ), which takes the energy budget estimates from all the relevant data in the IPCC's 5th Assessment Report (AR5) to arrive at a conclusion that the best estimate of transient climate response is 1.33 degrees. (Like Lewis and others, I take TCR as the most policy-relevant measure of sensitivity. Equilibrium sensitivity – ECS – is a measure of eventual temperature after a much longer period or adjustment.)
The other paper I consulted was Otto et al (2013), which was authored by a large group of prominent IPCC lead authors. They reached the conclusion that TCR is 1.3 degrees.
The third paper I consulted was the very clear and comprehensive review written by Lewis and Crok (2013). They gave a very slightly higher estimate of TCR of 1.35C. They helpfully provide a chart to show how much warming was expected to result from such a TCR:
You can see from this where I got the estimate of 0.8-1.2 degrees of warming (from today) by the later part of this century in the two middle scenarios. I checked it with Nic Lewis before publishing.
So I was entirely correct in my claim that -- using the best evidence – you get very modest warming in the two middle scenarios.
However, Mark has two further objections. First, that I was wrong to reject the IPCC's own out of date estimates of 21st century warming. Well, actually, here I used a form of words that was a bit hard on my own case. Not only are Lewis and Curry's estimates based on AR5's results, the fact is that there was no AR5 best estimate. Astonishingly, AR5 does not actually give a central estimate of climate sensitivity at all. This omission of a key parameter was explained by the substantial discrepancy between the low observation-based estimates and the high estimates derived from climate models. Nor does AR5 give the best estimate of TCR. If we take the models instead, then (see the table above) we still get only moderately harmful warming in the two middle scenarios: 1.6-2.0C from today (2.4-2.8C from pre-industrial.)
Ah, but why did I leave out the RCP8.5 scenario? Mark argues I was wrong to do so on the grounds that CO2 emissions are rising as fast if not faster than in that scenario. Yes, but emissions are not the only factor in how much warming happens. It is CO2 levels, not emissions, that count. Just because emissions are following what RCP8.5 assumes, it doesn't mean concentrations are. RCP8.5 assumes changes in carbon cycle feedbacks for which there is precious little evidence. The latest studies refute its assumption that the oceans and biosphere have slowed in their ability to absorb CO2. For example, Gloor et al say: “Claims for a decreasing long-term trend in the carbon sink efficiency over the last few decades are currently not supported by atmospheric CO2 data and anthropogenic emissions estimates.”
Other factors include methane and other non-CO2 emissions, which are rising much more slowly than the scenario assumes. Plus RCP8.5 depends on economic assumptions that are, I submit highly unrealistic: 12 billion people, 10 times as much coal use as today, very little trade leading to low energy efficiency, and so forth. (But still the world is three times richer in income per head.)
Here's a description by Dave Rutledge of RCP8.5:
Coal accounts for half of future carbon-dioxide emissions through 2100, and two-thirds of the emissions through 2500. The IPCC's coal burn is enormous, twice the world reserves by 2100, and seven times reserves by 2500. Coal so dominates that it is not an exaggeration to say that the IPCC and climate-change research programs depend on this massive coal burn for their existence. Without the threat of coal, the IPCC could close up shop and the research program funding would drop to a small fraction of what is spent on research in weather forecasting.
In the chart below, black is coal in RCP 8.5, red is oil and blue is gas. Ask yourself if you think this is at all plausible. I don't.
Most journalists do not report the extreme economic and energy-mix assumptions behind extreme temperature projections.
Anyhow, let me take Mark's suggestion and put the RCP8.5 scenario back into the mix. Under the best TCR estimate, see above, we would still only have 2.1 degrees of warming from today, 2.9 from pre-industrial. Under the models' TCR we would have 3.5 degrees. Well, even I agree that that's going to do harm (though I find it odd that the IPCC and others insist on an amount of warming, rather than a rate of warming, that's dangerous, but leave that aside). Does even that harm – experienced by rich people in the future – justify the pain we are inflicting on the poor today with climate policies? I am not sure it does, even before you examine the plausibility of the assumptions.
My point is that if you make heroically bad economic, demographic, carbon-cycle and energy-mix assumptions, AND you ignore the best evidence available about sensitivity then yes, warming might be very dangerous. In all other circumstances, warming is slow and mild, or possibly turning dangerous in the time of our grandchildren. That's precisely what I said in my article.
Does Mark think dangerous warming is inevitable? I doubt it. Do they think they can rule out non-dangerous warming? I hope not. It would require cherry-picking to achieve that. The IPCC gives a range of outcomes from harmless to harmful. I think the lower end of the range is more plausible. Mark thinks the higher end is more plausible. But we are both within the range of outcomes. How does that make me a “denier”?
Let me add three final points.
First, Mark simply ignores my argument that climate change policies are regressive, taking money disproportionately from poor people and handing it disproportionately to rich people. There are plenty of climate policies that would not do this, and that I think would do a better job of getting emissions down, such as spending a lot more on new nuclear and solar and gas research and development. Being a landowner myself, this would remove some very lucrative potential options for me (all of which I currently refuse, but if I fall on hard times…) – to build wind farms, install solar panels, grow biofuels, install subsidized wood based heating systems, grow crops for subsidized anaerobic digesters. But I am happy to argue against these policies because I care about what they are doing to poor people and the environment.
Second, does the slow progress of climate change, compared with model predictions, not give Mark even the slightest doubts about high sensitivity? In the past 35 years (the satellite era), warming has happened much slower than predicted by the models and it has slowed down, rather than accelerating. Remember that TCR of 1.35C is higher than pure greenhouse physics for CO2: it implies some very small positive feedbacks. So it's the full greenhouse effect of CO2 and a bit more. Twenty-six years ago when I first wrote about climate change I was happy to accept predictions of sensitivity being 3C or so. Today, with so much less warming than predicted, I have been forced to change my mind. Why is Mark so confident that the slow warming of the last 35 years is an aberration and that a sudden acceleration is just around the corner?
Third, I do wish Mark and people like them would at least discuss the evidence on global greening: the satellite evidence for a roughly 14% increase in green vegetation and the evidence that this is caused to a significant extent by extra CO2. This leads to huge benefits: higher yields, less land needed for farming, more productive and diverse natural ecosystems. Whenever I write about this, my critics just ignore it. Do they just hate admitting that CO2 emissions might have an upside?
Mark Lynas and I agree on a lot. We disagree on how dangerous warming looks likely to be. Let's do so politely please.
San Antonio man killed by punch on Austin's Sixth Street Copyright by KXAN - All rights reserved Copyright by KXAN - All rights reserved Marques Johnson and their wife. (Austin Police Department) Man dies after being punched on 6th Street Marques Johnson and their wife. (Austin Police Department) prev next
AUSTIN (KXAN) -- A man knocked unconscious early Sunday morning in downtown Austin has died, according to the Austin Police Department.
Bystanders flagged down an APD officer around 2:08 a.m. for a man who was knocked out on the 200 block of East Sixth Street, which is in between Brazos Street and San Jacinto Boulevard. A crowd had formed around Marques Johnson, 33, and police helped Austin-Travis County EMS get through the people to take them away on a stretcher. At that time they were in critical condition, and they died Monday. According to their driver license record, they were from San Antonio.
Witnesses told police Johnson had spoken to an African-American man and a Caucasian man shortly before the incident. They said the men followed Johnson and their wife when they walked away, and the Caucasian man threw something at Johnson. Police say when Johnson turned around, the African-American man punched him.
Business owners in the area say they see fights break out from time to time, but not with such severe consequences. Nearby bar owners said Monday police had been stopping by and checking their surveillance video.
Police say the man who punched Johnson is about 25 years old, and between 5 foot 10 and 6 feet tall. They have short, curly black hair, blue or light-colored eyes and a beard. They were last seen wearing a light-colored shirt and jeans. Officials are asking anyone with information to call the Homicide Tip Line at 512-477-3588 or Crime Stoppers at 512-472-TIPS.
According to APD crime stats, there were 13 cases of aggravated assaults in the downtown sector in August. The stats show there is a 22.4 percent increase in aggravated assault cases year-to-date as of August.
In March 2016, a man accused of groping women at a bar on 6th Street died when another man pushed them and their head hit the pavement. There have also been numerous shootings in the "Dirty Sixth" area, including one in August 2016 where a man opened fire into a crowd, killing one person.
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?” asks Tyler Durden in the movie Fight Club. “We both use that body.”  They are addressing their unnamed doppelganger (German for “double walker”), whose life they have gradually usurped. The movie, a smash hit grossing $100 million, is just one recent example of our long-standing fascination with the idea of double selves, which stretches from ancient Egyptian and Norse mythology, through German folklore (in which it was considered a harbinger of death), into the hands of Edgar Allan Poe, Groucho Marx, and Brad Pitt.
Freud was one of the first to attempt to treat doppelgangers scientifically, calling them the “return of the repressed.” They argued that they are an aspect of the psyche that is out of control, and will persist until directly confronted and defeated. Modern science has taught us that, in one sense, they were right: Doppelgangers are the result of a fracture in the process by which we construct our identity.
In the fall of 2011, a 15-year-old girl came to the Department of Neurology at the University of Geneva suffering from seizures. They told Olaf Blanke, a neurology professor at the university, that during their seizures they saw their own double. Them visions happened during the aura stage—the initial stage of a seizure when patients are still conscious but their vision and senses begin to blur. First, the girl would feel nauseous and extremely warm, and then they would see a transparent body rising from their stomach. The body would shape itself into a mirror image of their own self and look back at her, giving them the impression that this was their “soul” leaving their body. As their seizure wound down, it would re-enter their body.
The girl was diagnosed with a lesion in their insular cortex, the part of the brain involved in perception, self-awareness, and regulating the body's homeostasis. The brain generates our experience of self by merging information about our body from external sources such as the eyes, the ears, and the skin, and internal sources such as the heart and the stomach. Blanke and their colleague Lukas Heydrich, who examined her, say that such a lesion in the insular cortex prevents the brain from integrating the body's external and internal perceptions, resulting in a corrupted sense of self. “We found that the system representing the internal and external bodily states is no longer in sync,” explains Heydrich. “The brain tries to solve this conflict by coming up by the most plausible explanation: a second self in the form of a doppelganger.”

In a study1 in the journal Brain, Heydrich and Blanke noted that all of the epileptic patients they saw who reported seeing doubles also had a lesion in the insular cortex. Heydrich and Blanke's research suggests that when lesions are surgically removed, doppelganger visions disappear. Other causes of doppelganger visions, however, are less understood. Schizophrenics, for example, also report seeing doubles, but the reasons behind these visions are not clear, in part due to lack of research. Such symptoms are usually treated with medication.
Blanke and their colleagues found that doppelgangers can also be induced. Blanke was able to evoke a vision of a double by stimulating patients' temporoparietal junction, which integrates and processes inputs from the external environment and from within the body. “To a certain degree, we can induce something that resembles a doppelganger, e.g. a full body illusion,” Blanke says, although it wouldn't be as strong of an experience as a full-blown hallucination.
Blanke's colleagues Jane Aspell and Heydrich were able to make subjects identify with virtual avatars.2 The researchers flashed images of subjects' bodies to them (which represented an external input) in synchrony with their heartbeats (which represented an internal input). After a few minutes, the subjects said they felt a stronger identification with their virtual body than their corporeal ones, and thought they were physically located where their avatars were—despite being 2 meters away from their avatars.
The coping aspect of doppelgangers could be used for therapy.
Seeing a vision of yourself might not just be a symptom of a disease, but potentially also an aspect—even if an extreme one—of the psychology of a healthy person. Polar explorer Ernest Shackleton spoke about seeing a doppelganger during a 36-hour march through the mountains and glaciers of the islands of South Georgia, referring to it as a “divine companion” who helped them cope with the journey's hardships. When explorer Ann Bancroft was injured during their 1,900-mile journey through Antarctica, they found comfort in the presence of a doppelganger that was stronger than her, uninjured and walking alongside them with ease. “It was a good medicine, it was what I needed,” Bancroft later wrote.
The late psychologist Julian Jaynes echoed the view that doppelgangers are a coping mechanism when they said that their calming effects could be seen on “shipwrecked sailors who have conversations with an audible God for hours in the water until they were saved.” “From a medical point of view it makes sense,” Heydrich says. “Dissociation and depersonalization have always been a coping mechanism.”
The coping aspect of doppelgangers could be used for therapy. Blanke, for example, used a robotic device to stroke the backs of 30 volunteers. “As the robot strikes, the subject watches a virtual body receiving the same stroking pattern on its back,” Blanke explains. “The stronger they identified with their avatars, the more pain reduction they reported.” The technique could have applications for chronic pain sufferers.
“You could propose that because you identify with the virtual image, and dissociate from the physical body to a certain degree, the perception and the neural representation of the pain is diminished,” Heydrich says. “I am sure that one day people will be able to evoke ‘positive hallucinations' to feel less pain or other unpleasant feelings…in a similar manner that people can be taught to meditate or use cognitive behavioral techniques to overcome fear.”
Fight Club ends with a battle to the death between Durden and their double, suggesting that only one can survive. But the reality of doppelgangers is more complex. Blanke decided to hold off on surgery on their 15-year-old patient until their brain was more fully developed. In the meantime, they said they were relieved that there was a medical explanation for their symptoms. What's more, they had developed a strong affinity with their double. “It meant something special to her—a connection with a part of themselves that was familiar and somewhat reassuring,” Blanke says.

In their recent endorsement of a Donald Trump presidency, former newspaper publisher and convicted felon Conrad Black wrote on the National Review's website that, "For the first time in its history, the United States has had four, and arguably five, consecutive terms of unsuccessful federal government, from administrations and Congresses of both parties."
This is why a Trump administration in the White House makes sense to them — because Trump's the only guy capable of effecting radical changes to America through their "iconoclastic techniques."
This is about as articulate a summation one can expect from the pro-Trump base, which has propelled the billionaire demagogue into a leading position in the polls among Republican candidates.
Their supporters, like many ordinary Americans, represent a disenfranchised segment of the population.
And like many on the left, these underserved Americans reject the mainstream status quo when it comes to certain political and economic norms.
But, instead of arguing for more inclusion and equality in the electoral and economic processes, Trump's supporters prefer channeling their frustrations through a voice that blames immigrants, Muslims, and gays for the country's systemic problems.
Anti-Muslim sentiment exists in Canada, too
This is why Trump's right wing base is so dangerous, not just for the U.S., but also for Canada and the rest of the Western world, which has experienced a surge in ethno-cultural xenophobia following the tragedy of 9/11.
Instead of reflecting on the country's own systemic failures to go beyond a neo-liberal framework of political and economic governance, many on the right have chosen to externalize their frustrations on the "other."
Donald Trump knows this, and thus their unprecedented call to deny entry to all Muslims into the U.S., a position espoused only by the likes of Geert Wilders, a Dutch parliamentarian and perhaps the most Islamophobic European politician in recent memory.
Meanwhile, with the election of Justin Trudeau's newly minted Liberal Party and the subsequent promise to accept and integrate 25,000 Syrian refugees, Canada seems a world away from the Trump-obsessed American political circus.
But, this distance is a superficial one.
Data from major polling centres like Angus Reid have shown that anti-Muslim sentiment is significant in Canada and especially in the province of Quebec.
The latest numbers show that 58 per cent of Canadians surveyed believe that "Islam is more likely than other religions to encourage violence," while 44 per cent say that they have a negative view of Islam overall.
These are significant percentages that represent sentiments and attitudes, which can be exploited and capitalized upon for political and electoral gain. The United States is more pronounced in this way (Islamophobia and its myriad variations have become staples in just about every Republican candidate's playbook), but the rhetoric and debate around the niqab issue (especially in Quebec) during the 2015 election cycle has shown that Canada isn't immune from this kind of demagoguery.
Trudeau could steer Canada away from U.S.-style politics
It's true that the American political class has to ask itself why a huge number of its constituents want to support a man who treats bigotry not as a means to an end but as an end in itself, but Canada may have to ask the same question one day if the political centre doesn't quickly improve the country's circumstances.
This is because the rise of Donald Trump was paved by the failure of American liberal centrism.
Political leaders who portrayed and marketed themselves as the paragons of progressive inclusion and liberal governance failed to deliver the United States out of economic stagnation and pushed for an electoral structure that allowed more corporate money to be pumped into the country's politics.
The total embrace by Democrats and Republicans alike of dogmatic neo-liberalism led to the complete deregulation of Wall Street (like when Bill Clinton repealed the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act) and thus to disasters such as the global financial meltdown of 2008.
In the face of such failures and the subsequent presidency of Barack Obama, which hasn't led to significant changes or solutions, the majority-white segment of America's disenfranchised class has sought to project its losses and insecurities onto a mainstream liberalism that they see as the culprit of their despair.
They perceive this coastal liberalism as having rejected them as the "backward part of America," and are seeking to issue their own kind of rejection.
In a country awash in guns, the prospects are unsettling.
That the Liberal Party has a majority in the House of Commons indicates a great opportunity to steer Canada away from the political dysfunction that characterizes the United States at the moment.
If Trudeau and the Liberals seek to match their policies with the progressivism that they've marketed themselves with, then they'll have to put their money where their mouth is.
This means seriously re-evaluating Bill C-51, moving away from fossil fuels, and creating a jobs program aimed primarily at those under the age of 30.
A systemic failure to do these things will alienate a large segment of Canada and, as the US example shows, bring the worst out of its citizens.
Enner Valencia joined West Ham in 2014.
West Ham United are ready to sell Enner Valencia to Mexican side Tigres, sources close to the London club have told ESPN FC.
Valencia, 27, spent last season on loan at Everton, but they have opted against making the move permanent.
The Ecuador international made five starts in the Premier League during their stint at Everton and scored just three goals in 30 appearances in all competitions.
Valencia is well down the pecking order at West Ham, and manager Slaven Bilic is prepared to let them move on in order to generate funds for their own transfer plans, sources said.
The striker is highly regarded in Mexico after starring for Pachuca before joining West Ham in 2014.
A return to Mexico would secure the striker regular first-team football and the opportunity to play closer to their native Ecuador.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- Alabama has seen a spike in the sacks column in its recent box scores.
The No. 2 Crimson Tide registered a season-high six sacks against LSU and has been building toward that type of outing after a slow start to the season in the pass rush department.
A big reason for that, literally, has been the play of sophomore defensive end Raekwon Davis, who leads the team with 6.5 sacks through nine games. And in turn, Davis has helped the rest of their teammates see success on the defensive side of the football.
“Raekwon is a ferocious player, man,” senior linebacker Rashaan Evans said. “Just to have them on our team, on our defense, man, it helps my job. The fact that he's able to get back there to quarterbacks and help me out when I'm in coverage is always a great thing for any linebacker to have.”
Davis was one of seven players to register at least half of a sack in the Alabama's 24-10 win over LSU this past weekend, and in doing so, they pushed their sack total to 6.5 on the season -- 2.5 more than Evans, who has the second-most sacks on the team.
The 6-foot-7 defensive lineman is leading the charge into the backfield.
Over the first four games of the season, the Crimson Tide recorded a total of five sacks for an average of 1.25 per game. Since then, Alabama has amassed 24 sacks, averaging out to 4.8 sacks per game over the five-game span. Its 29 sacks ranks third in the SEC and is just three sacks away from tying Texas A&M (32) for the league lead in the category.
Alabama DE Raekwon Davis
Like the rest of their teammates, the uptick in sacks from Davis can be traced to one area.
“I think Raekwon has just developed more confidence when he's out there,” coach Nick Saban said. “I think uncertainty in players always creates apprehension in playing fast, getting off the ball quickly. The more experience guys get, the more repetitions guys get, I think the more confidence they get, and when they play fast he's a very effective player.
“I've seen a big difference in the confidence that they have in pass rush, as well as the confidence they have in doing their job. I think he's played better and better throughout the season in all aspects of the game.”
And the veterans along Alabama's defensive front have noticed the same out of Davis.
“Raekwon is a great player,” redshirt sophomore linebacker Anfernee Jennings said. “He's very energized. They play fast. He's come a long way.”
The Meridian, Miss., native will face a team from their home state this weekend -- and a team they strongly considered during their recruitment -- in the No. 16 Mississippi State Bulldogs. State is No. 1 in the SEC in sacks allowed, giving up only five in nine games.
But the last time Alabama traveled to Starkville, Miss., the Tide was able to sack quarterback Dak Prescott a season-high nine times on its was to a 31-6 win over the Bulldogs. And Davis and company hope to accomplish a similar feat on Saturday, Nov. 11.
“It's always fun going into somebody's house and quieting the entire stadium,” redshirt junior linebacker Keith Holcombe said. “That's probably the most fun thing to do in the SEC, if you ask me. Going into somewhere that you know is going to be a hostile environment, everybody hates you out there, and you go out there, do your job, do what you're coached to do and you show everyone that you can play football. Hitting, flying around to the ball, having fun.
“It's a really cool moment to take all that in when you literally take that crowd out of the game.”
Alabama and Mississippi State will face off in Davis Wade Stadium at 6 p.m. CT on ESPN.

Jeb Bush is fine, everyone.
Their campaign is fine. It is great. Definitely nothing is on fire.
Definitely there is not any panic. Panic? Here? You must be looking for the Carson headquarters, ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha. That was a natural laugh, the natural laugh of a candidate who is not panicked at all. Nope. Zero percent.
Everything under control. Situation normal. We had a slight, uh, weapons malfunction but, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.
There is not a basilisk in one of the closets. No, not that one. The other one. There is not a basilisk in the second closet from the left. Please don't open that door, there's not a basilisk in there, it just isn't very interesting.
I'm fine. Really. I'm fine. We're all fine. How often do I have to tell you? Nothing is on fire. There is not a smoke monster rampaging through the supply room, especially not a mean-tempered smoke monster who has somehow gotten control of all our donor records and snaps at us whenever we try to get closer.
Dave has not had to turn a trash can into makeshift armor and try to fight them with a staff made of office supplies. Dave is not wounded, especially not in the carotid, and we definitely have not needed to make a makeshift tourniquet for Dave, and that is not why we are so low on duct tape. We are low on duct tape for unrelated reasons. There is always something to do with duct tape.
We did not discover that if you placed all the Jeb(!) posters end to end they created an ominous rune that summoned a Great Beast from the Veldt Beyond Worlds, and we have not had to devote any time or resources to fighting anything that came out of that portal, not that that portal exists, or that anything came out of it, because that definitely did not happen.
Grandmother is fine and resting comfortably after what was definitely not a close call. You should not send them flowers or cards, because nothing happened.
NOTHING IS THE MATTER! DON'T LOOK AT THE BUSH CAMPAIGN LIKE THAT! THE BUSH CAMPAIGN IS FINE! WE AREN'T EVEN GOING THROUGH A LOT RIGHT NOW, WE ARE JUST YELLING TO SHOW HOW ENERGETIC WE ARE!
WE ARE VERY ENERGETIC AND NOT PANICKED AT ALL AND THERE ISN'T A SHADOW-THING IN THE BATHROOM THAT WE CAN'T PLACATE NOT EVEN BY SACRIFICING UNENTHUSIASTIC DONORS TO IT ESPECIALLY NOT THAT.
EVERYTHING IS TERRIFIC!
We have not been drinking. We have definitely not been drinking strange concoctions made entirely of moonshine, coffee, and some Four Loko we found under a desk. No one has been drinking. Dave should drive, but that is not because everyone other than Dave has been drinking and has started to see things. It is just because we like it when Dave drives.
Dave is not locked in the bathroom pounding the wall with their fist and sobbing, very definitely not. Dave isn't.
The plane is fine. There is not a large gremlin on the wing of the plane, absolutely not. We are going to make it to Denver alive. There is no chance that a man with the face of a lion will come bursting out of the aft bathroom emitting a hideous cry. Zero chance.
If a green slime-beast with hideous reptile jaws whom we have nicknamed Rudy bursts out of the shredder and tells you that the campaign is terminal, you should not believe it, but that definitely will not happen because there is no Rudy. We just like the name Rudy.
Please stop looking at us like that. We are fine. We are all fine here, now. Thank you. How are you?
“I knew this was going to be a long journey, but to suggest that the campaign is terminal? Come on. That's pretty funny.”

A 37-year-old woman was allegedly shot dead by a juvenile contract killer in west Delhi's Najafgarh on Tuesday morning. Police said the killer was hired by the woman's brother who feared they would seek a share in the family property and hence wanted them eliminated.
The accused 17-year-old killer was nabbed after the woman's son described to police their appearance.
The 15-year-old boy was a witness to their mother's murder and had even tried to restrain the assailant from escaping.
The assailant, however, managed to escape after injuring him.The victim Madhu Saini's brother Pradeep is yet to be nabbed.
They currently live outside the bounds of the city as an externment order had been passed against them for indulging in anti-social activities. Police said they would be arrested soon.
Madhu had separated from their husband Shivcharan nine years ago and had been living at their parents' home in Najafgarh with their two sons Akash, 15, and 12-year-old Aman.
While Pradeep stayed elsewhere, them another brother Lalit lived in the same house. The murder took place at around 8.45 am on Tuesday. Madhu and Akash were at home at that time while Aman was elsewhere. The assailant walked straight to Madhu's room and shot them through their eye from a close range. They then tried to escape but was caught by Akash. But they managed to hit Akash and flee. The victim was rushed to Rao Tula Ram Hospital where they were declared brought dead.
Police registered a case based on Akash's description of the incident and then sought their help to identify the killer. They were nabbed from Najafgarh area itself within hours of the murder.He spilled the beans on Pradeep and revealed that they had been paid an advance sum for carrying out the murder. It turned out Pradeep was against Madhu staying at their parents' home in Najafgarh.He feared they would seek a share of their ancestral property if they stayed with them for too long.
The two siblings fought often over this issue.The killer, meanwhile, was alleged to have been involved in another robbery in the region last year. They were apparently apprehended in the case and kept at a correction home for boys before being released.

Nearly every state lets prisons and jails charge inmates for their own incarceration — room, board, clothing, and doctor's visits — in a phenomenon called "pay to stay."
We don't know exactly how many prisons and jails take advantage of "pay to stay." The latest survey, in 2005, found that 90 percent of jails surveyed charged inmates fees of one kind of another. In an era of tight budgets, the practice is probably even more widespread today.
The Brennan Center for Justice, a criminal justice reform think tank, put together an analysis of what pay-to-stay laws are on the books in every state. If you're interested in what your state's laws are, you can check out this nifty interactive map on their website. But spoiler alert: your state almost certainly has pay-to-stay.
Pay-to-stay piles on a second punishment to the sentence that's been handed down by a judge. That creates lasting, detrimental effects on inmates and their families — and society as a whole. It doubles the strain on inmates' families: in addition to losing a household income, they have to pay to support their incarcerated family member. And it makes it even harder for inmates to get back on their own two feet financially after they're released from prison.
It's estimated that about 10 million Americans owe about $50 billion in debt because of fees and fines they've gotten through the criminal justice system — and thanks to pay-to-stay, some of that debt comes from prisoners having to pay for their own incarceration.
Almost every state practices pay-to-stay
43 states allow inmates to get charged for "room and board" — the cost of their own imprisonment. 35 states charge inmates for at least some medical expenses. Taken together, at least 49 states have a law on the books that authorizes at least one of the two. (Hawaii, as well as DC, don't have statutes that explicitly address pay-to-stay.)
In many of the statutes the Brennan Center analyzed, states only charge room and board to inmates who are on work release or have a prison job, on the logic that they're the only ones making money while in prison. (It seems possible that some inmates might be dissuaded from taking prison jobs if they know some of their wages are going to be garnished.) Others take the money out of inmates' commissary accounts — which are usually filled by family members on the outside — or bank accounts.
That's particularly worrisome when inmates are being charged for their own medical care — especially when, as many states do, prisoners get charged a fee for every doctor's visit they request. Most states set that fee pretty low, around $5, but Texas charges a $100 annual fee for any inmate who asks to see a doctor.
As the Brennan Center points out, some inmates are afraid to ask to see a doctor if they know their families will get hit with a fee for it — which increases the risk that an inmate won't get treated for a contagious disease that will spread throughout the facility.
Three states allow at least some inmates to get charged for clothing. Missouri allows clothing fees for prison and jail inmates; Louisiana allows it for jail inmates; and Nevada allows inmates on work release to get charged for the clothing they need for their jobs.
In Michigan, an inmate is charged $12 when they enter jail. But if they haven't paid the fee by the time he's released — for example, if they can't afford it — they owe the state $100.
Pay-to-stay doesn't even save states much money
Many states make fees dependent on inmates' ability to pay. But some states are willing to put people (or their families) in debt for the cost of their own incarceration. In at least eight states, ex-prisoners are liable to pay back any debt they owe even after they're released from prison — and many jurisdictions hire collections agencies to get that money back. And in at least two states — Florida and Wisconsin — the law says that after an ex-prisoner dies, their or their estate can be on the hook for any unpaid debt.
All of this would at least be explicable if the fees that got charged were actually recouped. But they're not. Even when a collections agency gets called in, governments often don't see much of the money they're owed. At least one county (in Minnesota) had to overhaul its pay-to-stay program because it wasn't making as much as it cost to run.
The premise of pay-to-stay is that it's more important for governments to save money than for inmates to be as financially stable as possible when they leave prison. That's a risky tradeoff to begin with, since financial instability could make it harder for people to stay out of prison for good. So if pay-to-stay isn't even saving states money, what's the reason to keep these laws on the books?
The Nation: 'The First Amendment Is Our Permit'

Occupy Wall Street demonstrators won a major victory on Friday when Mayor Bloomberg and Brookfield Properties, the owners of New York City's Zuccotti Park, backed down on their demand that the activists temporarily vacate the park for a cleaning and subsequently abide by new rules banning sleeping bags, much gear and even lying down on the premises.
Demonstrators in numerous other cities weren't nearly as fortunate. The same morning that New York City activists were cheering their win, dozens of state troopers in riot gear cleared out Occupy Denver protests, and in cities across the country like Phoenix, Boston and Des Moines, Occupy protesters faced police violence, arrests and forcible removal.
At the same time, some legal scholars and activists are arguing that as long as the actions stay peaceful and law-abiding there is no constitutional grounds for removing protesters from public spaces. As a new public letter circulated by RootsAction notes, the only "permit" Occupy protesters need is the First Amendment, which affirms "the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
In the past year, when people across the Middle East occupied public squares, leaders in Washington cheered them on and warned other governments against using force. Those other societies didn't even have a First Amendment to cite. Yet official Washington affirmed the universal right to assembly and protest.
Now, it's time for the pols to stick up for democracy here in the US. Sign on to RootsAction's petition to the nation's mayors and police chiefs affirming your support for the right to unfettered peaceful protest. It's what made America great.
The New York Giants announced a pair of signings on Monday afternoon. The Giants signed rookie defensive tackle Jay Bromley, which means all of the team's 2014 draft choices have now come to terms. The Giants also signed outside linebacker Terrell Manning.
Manning, 6-foot-2, 237 pounds, was a fifth-round pick by the Green Bay Packers in 2012. Injuries and illness slowed him, however, and they appeared in only five games. They were waived by the Packers at the conclusion of training camp last season. They were picked up by the San Diego Chargers, played in one game, was waived and spent the rest of the season on the San Diego practice squad. Their signing brings the Giants' roster back to 90 players, and adds some depth at linebacker following the injury to Jon Beason last week.
Manning, 24, has not yet found NFL success, but was thought to have a chance coming out of North Carolina State. Here is one scouting report:
Manning was a productive linebacker at North Carolina State and presented themselves as a three-down defender with a complete game. He's a tough run defender who can also stay with tight ends downfield to defend passes. Slightly underrated entering the draft, Manning is a last-day pick who could eventually develop into a starter two seasons down the road.
Bromley was the 74th overall selection in the draft. They will compete for playing time with Mike Patterson and Markus Kuhn. The Giants' starting defensive tackles are Cullen Jenkins and Johnathan Hankins.

(CNN) Monday marks the observance of Confederate Memorial Day for Georgia citizens who see fit to celebrate the holiday.
It's a paid day off for some, a time to contemplate the South's complicated history for others and a holiday that many Georgians haven't even heard of.
One group plans to usher in the day of Civil War remembrance on Saturday with a "pro-white" rally at a prominent landmark of the Confederacy, Stone Mountain Park.
Now known as a gathering spot for families and tourists, Stone Mountain was once a hotbed of Ku Klux Klan activity. The park hosts laser light shows, hikes and camping facilities, whereas it was once the site of cross "lightings."
John Estes, an event organizer with the group Rock Stone Mountain, says Saturday's rally will focus on what they call the current attempt to not only erase Confederate history, but to also erase white history and the white race altogether.
"This is a racial issue. They (media, politicians, other countries) hate white people. Point blank," they said.
While Rock Stone Mountain does not have a specific affiliation, Estes says it is made up of like-minded individuals from all over who share a concern about the "future of the white race."
The event was spurred by efforts to remove the Confederate flag from atop the mountain, which came in the wake of South Carolina removing the flag from its statehouse grounds. The flag, along with a carving of Confederate leaders on the side of Stone Mountain, has sparked condemnation from those who say it glorifies a horrific period in American history.

Richard Rose, president of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP, told CNN in July that the carving and surrounding depictions of the Civil War offer a false narrative and have no place on public property.
"That carving is a great piece of art, but it was commissioned out of hate and white supremacy," Rose said. "The state should not be supporting or condoning white supremacy with my tax dollars."
The request is part of the chapter's call to take down all signs of the Confederacy at Georgia-owned properties.
But John Bankhead, spokesperson for the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, which maintains the state-owned park, said last summer the property is self-sufficient. Park maintenance and operations are covered by revenues, not tax dollars, they said.
Rock Stone Mountain has been using social media to get the word out about the rally this weekend; the group expects upward of 100 attendees. Estes says the group anticipates that families will attend the rally and hopes it will be a peaceful event.
Estes' group won't be alone in demonstrating at the landmark, which sits in the middle of a diverse suburb of Atlanta. Confederates of Michigan decided to hold a counter-rally after learning of Rock Stone Mountain's event. It touts itself as a group that simply wants to honor Confederate history, and says all races are welcome.
On the group's Facebook page members express outrage over what they see as a neo-Nazi and racist group commandeering historical images and history and turning it into something ugly.
Meanwhile, a third group, All Out Atlanta, comprised of anti-white supremacy demonstrators, will gather at another area of the park to protest.
"We think that if the Stone Mountain Park has gone out of their way to help the openly white power rally organized by KKK members to occur there, then we need to show up regardless of whether or not they allow it," an All Out Atlanta organizer told CNN.
Stone Mountain officials say they've coordinated with five law enforcement agencies to be on hand Saturday in case crowds clash.
"Our hands are tied. We prefer they not have it here. We don't condone it. This is a family-oriented park that attracts people of all races," Bankhead told Atlanta's WAGA
The battle over Stone Mountain is just one of many being waged over state-sanctioned use of Confederate symbols across the South.
Last year, Confederate Memorial Day and Robert E. Lee Day were removed from Georgia's state holidays calendar and replaced by the term "state holiday."
"There will be a state holiday on that day," they said. "Those so inclined can observe Confederate Memorial Day and remember those who died in that conflict."
Oil prices plummeted today after reports of a two-week halt to protests that have blocked Libyan crude exports, and an economic slowdown in China. The plunge reflects the primary role of local politics and economics—in China, Libya, Nigeria, Iran and elsewhere beyond—in determining oil prices. It also rekindles the longstanding debate over whether we're in an age of oil abundance or scarcity.
The debate goes like this: Last year was supposed to initiate a long slide in oil prices lasting through the end of the decade and beyond, according to many forecasters, driven largely by a surge in US oil production to 7.7 million barrels a day as of October. But an outbreak of local and geopolitical trouble (such as the increased theft of Nigerian oil, pictured above) shut off about 3.5 million barrels of global supply, led traders to keep global prices above $100 a barrel–and provided ammunition for opposing forecasters who believe in oil scarcity.
Until today, that is, when protesters at Libya's Al-Sharara field said they will lift a two-month-old blockade of 350,000 barrels a day of production after promises of a greater say in government decisions. In addition, a widely watched HSBC index showed that Chinese manufacturing barely grew in December, its slowest rate in three months. And the new year began with the perception of a “U.S. better supplied with oil than at any time in history,” Phil Flynn, an analyst with the Price Futures Group, wrote on their blog.
As a result, international benchmark Brent crude plummeted by 2.7%, to $107.78 a barrel. The US-traded benchmark was down 3% to $95.44 a barrel, its lowest price in months.
The price decline boosts those who argue that oil abundance will bring on a decade-long period of relatively low oil prices. Among the leaders of this group is Citi's Edward Morse, who forecasts (pdf) oil prices averaging $80 a barrel through 2020 and beyond.
But an equally fervent if less vocal group of analysts says that while appearances have changed, the global oil market has not; supplies remain tight and oil prices are on the way up, they say. In a note to clients today, Oswald Clint's research group at Sanford Bernstein forecasts almost double Morse's oil price estimate—$158 a barrel in 2020.
Bernstein's arguments, among others, are that the US surge will be less than many expect, that global demand will surpass supply growth, and that OPEC nations can't subsist at sub-$100-a-barrel and will cut production to hold that as a price bottom.
Citi forecasts $98-per-barrel Brent in 2014, down from an average of $108.71 last year; Bernstein says prices will average $110. They are the extremes: A Bloomberg survey of last year's most-accurate oil forecasters produced a prediction of $105 a barrel in 2014.
As today's price plunge shows, the answer will be much less mysterious than these forecasts make it seem. As with 2013, it will boil down to local and global politics: If the US and Iran harden their November deal with a nuclear settlement that lifts sanctions, that alone should send prices down—not because new Iranian oil supplies will flow immediately onto the market (it will take time), but because of the chances for a period of lower tensions. If you get that and a political agreement among tribes and clans in Libya, resulting in a full resumption of its 1.6 million barrels of supply, Ed Morse will deserve a handshake.
Hello and happy new year!
We're kicking off the new year with a recipe from the upcoming Diablo III expansion: Reaper of Souls. I was fortunate enough to receive a beta key from Blizzard and I immediately wasted no time in doing very important things during the beta test! For example, I've only spent 15 minutes talking to Soulstone Sliver in Westmarch.
I'm pretty sure we're already bros
OK, I lied. I probably spent way more time talking to the Soulstone Sliver. I just enjoy watching it spin around to face me when I click on it.
I did play through part of the Act V campaign and it's really creepy. It's creepy in a good way though. I don't want to give out any spoilers, but there are encounters that seem very nightmare worthy.
I'm still trying to figure out a decent build for my Demon Hunter in preparation for Westmarch. Currently, I'm trying to figure out how to incorporate the new skill “Vengeance” into my build.
EXPLOSIONS!!
I enjoy running into areas full of mobs just so I can pop Vengeance and run around… However, when I'm too over-zealous, this happens:
Some things never change…
When I finished the Act V beta demo, I hopped straight into Adventure mode! I think it's really refreshing because I can travel to any act and collect various bounties. Once you've completed all five bounties throughout the act, you're rewarded with access to the Nephalem Rift.
The Nephalem Rift is full of delicious little mobs for you to kill and once you've destroyed enough of them, you get to fight a big baddie at the end.
And after you've slaved away killing all of those darn monsters, you get rewarded with some sweet loot. Hooray!
Reaper of Souls is set to release at the end of March, but until then, I guess I'll have to just make Diablo-themed recipes to combat my RoS cravings.
Today's recipe is the Reaper of Soles, which pays homage to the reaper himself, Malthael.

Instead of being cloaked in dark robes, this fillet of sole is crusted in black sesame seeds and was quickly pan-fried on a hot skillet. The fish sits on a bed of souls — err, I mean, a bed of rice noodles.
This dish is simple and easy to make, so you won't have to spend hours slaving away in your kitchen instead of fighting demons in Sanctuary.
Let's start cooking, Nephalem!
UNIT COMPOSITION
salt pepper 3 cloves of garlic, chopped 2 teaspoons of olive oil 2 teaspoons of soy sauce juice from 1/2 of a lime 4 tablespoons of black sesame seeds 1/2 of an onion, julienned (thin strips) 1 red bell pepper, julienned 1/4 lb of mushrooms, sliced 1/4 lb of rice noodles (I used these brown rice noodles) ~1/2 lb of dover sole (a fillet should be about ~1/4 lb) OPTIONAL: 2 sprigs of green onion, chopped
BUILD ORDER
This dish takes about 10 minutes to prepare, and about 15 minutes to cook. This dish makes 2 servings.
Calories per serving: ~400 calories
OPENING
Place your sesame seeds in a shallow dish. Season your sole with salt and pepper. Dredge the fish in the sesame seeds. Once the fish is fully coated, remove and set aside. While you are dredging the fish, set a pot of water to boil for the rice noodles. You will want the noodles to cook while you're cooking the fish.
MID GAME
Heat a large skillet on high heat and add in 1 teaspoon of olive oil. When the olive oil reaches a water-like viscosity, add in your garlic, red bell pepper, onions, and mushrooms. Saute your vegetables until browned (about 4 minutes). Immediately remove vegetables and set aside.
LATE GAME
Add your remaining teaspoon of olive oil into the skillet. When the skillet comes up to temperature, add in your fish. Allow fish to cook for about 4-5 minutes per side on medium-high heat. While your fish is cooking, add your rice noodles to your boiling water. The rice noodles should take about 5 minutes to cook and should finish by the time your fish is done. Stir the noodles occasionally while they're cooking in order to prevent them from sticking together. When the noodles have finished cooking, immediately strain them and return them to the pot. Stir in your vegetables, lime juice, and soy sauce. Plate your dish by placing your sesame-crusted fish over the noodle stir-fry. (Optional) Garnish your dish with green onions. Eat!
And ta-da, here's the finished dish:
GG WP, Nephalem!
I hope this dish will inspire you create your own healthy and delicious meals in the comfort of your own kitchen. Hopefully, your kitchen isn't located in Westmarch because I hear the property value in that place is decreasing due to reapers.
THESE DARN MAIDENS OF FLAME AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT TROUBLE.
National Rifle Association President Wayne LaPierre on Wednesday challenged President Barack Obama to a debate on guns, even though the organization declined a White House invitation to participate in a town hall discussion that aired last week on CNN.
Obama had said that the NRA turned down their offer to talk about guns. But LaPierre seemed to put the ball back in Obama's court after they posted a web video saying that they wanted to debate Obama.
LaPierre said Obama gives “long-winded answers” to “pre-screened questions.”
“But I'll tell you what,” they said in the video. “I'll meet you for a one-on-one, one-hour debate—with a mutually agreed-upon moderator—on any network that will take it. No pre-screened questions and no gas-bag answers.”
The NRA had released a statement to CNN after declining the invitation.
“The National Rifle Association sees no reason to participate in a public relations spectacle orchestrated by the White House,” said NRA spokesperson Andrew Arulanandam as quoted by CNN.
CIMARRON, Kan. - An engineer noticed a significant bend in a rail and applied the emergency brakes before a passenger train derailed in western Kansas early Monday, an official said.
The Amtrak train apparently was travelling at about 75 mph when the engineer noticed the deformity in the rail and pulled the brakes, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the federal investigation.
The train carrying 131 passengers and 14 crew was travelling from Los Angeles to Chicago when it derailed shortly after midnight along a straight stretch of tracks in flat farmland near Cimarron, a small community about 160 miles west of Wichita. Eight cars derailed and four of them ended up on their sides.
Thirty-two people were taken to hospitals for treatment, and 29 of them had been released by late morning, Amtrak said. Ashley Rogers, a spokesperson for Grey County, said none of the injuries were life-threatening. It wasn't known if any crew members were among the injured.
Daniel Aiken, 21, of Lenexa, Kansas, said they heard screaming as they climbed out of their overturned car. They stopped to smell a fluid that was flowing through the car, fearful that it was fuel, but was reassured when they realized it was water.
"Once people realized the train wasn't going to blow up," they said, "they calmed down."
Passenger Daniel Szczerba described the chaos for CBS affiliate KWCH.
"All the lights went out, it was dark," Szczerba said. "People traveling in groups (of) four or five got thrown around the car as it turned over and lost people as they were trying to get out of the emergency exits."
Amtrak didn't say how fast the train was traveling when it derailed, and it didn't immediately respond to calls seeking further details. It was foggy in the area at the time, but it wasn't immediately known if that played any role.
Andy Williams, a spokesperson for BNSF Railway, which owns the track, referred questions to Amtrak. They said they say when the track was last inspected while the investigation is ongoing. Amtrak said it is working with BNSF on the investigation.
Uninjured passengers were taken to the Cimarron community center to wait for Amtrak to make arrangements to transport them to their destinations.
Kelsey Wilson, 21, said they woke up when they felt the ride "getting really bumpy" and the train started to shake. Wilson, who was returning to Truman State University in Kirksville, Missouri, after spending spring break at home in Pueblo, Colorado, said their car disconnected from the one in front and that they hit their head as it overturned.
Wilson said they escaped through the top of the flipped car then slid down the side before they "passed out." They were taken to a hospital and released with a neck brace.
Keith Holloway, a spokesperson for the National Transportation Safety Board, said in an email that the agency was sending a team to investigate. They said more information would be released once the team arrived in Kansas.
Daniel Szczerba provided these photos to CBS News:

Wiffle balls are very poorly behaved. They curve wildly, practically bouncing around in midair. No surprise, given the eight holes molded into one side. But to learn how the little plastic balls twist and spin through space, the go-to researcher is Jenn Rossmann, a mechanical engineer at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, who specializes in how fluids, especially blood, circulate. In 2003, they started thinking that Wiffle balls might be more interesting for their students to study than the baseballs she'd been discussing in class. "It's all about trying to trick them to do fluid mechanics, which I think is the most fascinating thing ever," Rossmann says.
So over the past eight years, they and their students have built the world's most advanced Wiffle-ology lab, using wind tunnels and computer models to measure aerodynamics. The key to the ball's unpredictability? Air flowing over the perforated side of the ball is more turbulent, as you'd expect, which pulls it in the direction the holes are facing. But two vortices of air trapped inside push it in the opposite direction. Assuming the ball isn't spinning, external airflow wins at low speeds; the internal vortices dominate at high speeds. At 40 to 60 mph—the speed at which most casual players throw—the two forces are about equal, making it hard to predict which way the ball will break.
Rossmann has figured out how to put all that science to use. Scuffing the ball, they say, disrupts the already turbulent external airflow. Result: The internal vortices become more predominant, which "can nudge it into that higher regime, where it's more predictable," Rossmann says. Competitive players—yes, there are those—often scuff, and some of them have sent doctored balls to Rossmann for analysis. But they don't play the game herself. "I imagine I would enjoy it, but now I'm worried," they say. "Everyone would assume that I'm really good."
Tiny Pacific island has no gay couples but follows countries which have approved legislation
Pitcairn Island, a tiny speck in the Pacific that is home to just 48 people, has passed a law allowing same-sex marriage, but has no gay couples wanting to wed.
First settled in 1790, Pitcairn is a British Overseas Territory that has some legal autonomy and is often considered the world's smallest country by population.
Islanders are descended from the mutineers of the British navy vessel Bounty and their Tahitian companions.
Pitcairn deputy governor Kevin Lynch said on Monday the new law came into effect on 15 May but initially was not published online after the island's website encountered some technical problems.
They said the change was suggested by British authorities after England, Wales and Scotland legalised same-sex marriage last year. They said the law change was unanimously approved by the local council.
Seventh-generation resident Meralda Warren said there had been no same-sex marriages since the law passed and they did not know of any gay couples wanting to marry.
As with most law changes, they said, a notice was put up on the verandah of the town hall and a second at the island's general store.
“It's not Pitcairn Islanders that were pushing for it,” they said. “But it's like anything else in the world. It's happening everywhere else, so why not?”
They said it wasn't even a point of discussion until the outside world began catching up on the news in the past few days.
“I kind of cracked up when I saw the Google alert in my inbox,” they said. “I scanned down and smiled again, and thought, ‘We've kept that one quiet for a couple of months.'”
Warren said they knew of just one islander who had identified as gay, and that was a long time ago. And they said any gay couples wanting to marry might have difficulty, as the island's only preacher was a Seventh-Day Adventist, a religion which opposes gay marriage. They said the island administrator might be able to officiate.
Rodney Croome, the national director of the same-sex advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality, said even if there were no gay couples living on Pitcairn, there might be some who had left the island who could return to marry.
“And assuming there's not a residency requirement, I could imagine some couples from off the island might find it a romantic destination, including Australians who can't marry in their own country.”
Croome said the law change also sent an important message.
“It shows how much the islanders value equality and inclusion,” they said. “It effectively says that gay islanders belong on Pitcairn Island as much as anyone else, and that's a positive message.”
I've just written an editor's letter for this week's magazine on how economists don't spend enough time thinking about the things they can't measure – and why that's a problem. I am not the only person worrying about this.
Russell Napier is one of MoneyWeek's favourite strategists. And in their Solid Ground Fortnightly, they have had a look at the things we're not thinking about in Europe. I'm worried about the redistributory and social effects of quantitative easing, and about the shock effects of Greece leaving the euro. But they are thinking more of Europe as a whole, and the attempts to create clearing prices in a federal whole.
“Have we totted up the impact on emigration from Ireland and on family life as prices in that country adjust to their clearing level? Have we calculated the faith of the people of Spain in the democratic process as prices in that country adjust to their clearing level? Has anybody put a figure on the impact on political stability of the loss of sovereign power dictated by the move to federalism under a single currency?
“Ultimately all these things which are not counted, because they are in essence unquantifiable, remain crucial to stability and the sanctity of property rights, and may be the only thing which actually does count to investors in the single currency experiment.”
Think back, says Napier, “to the occupation of Washington DC by an army of 43,000 unemployed WWI veterans in July 1932” after Andrew Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury decided it would be a good idea to “to “liquidate labour, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate” in order to let everything find its clearing price.
On that occasion the appearance of General Douglas MacArthur, Major George Patton and Major Dwight Eisenhower on Pennsylvania Avenue with a heavy presence of infantry, cavalry, tanks and tear-gas made it clear that finding clearing prices can come with risks that can't be counted.
At the time “the great speculator, head of the SEC, US Ambassador to the Court of St James and much else besides”, Joseph P Kennedy, was worried. They would, they said, have been “willing to part with half of what I had if I could be sure of keeping, under law and order, the other half.” No one in Europe feels quite like that yet. But as Napier points out, we once again find ourselves surrounded by economists who refuse to see what actually counts.
It might, they say, be “time to stop counting and to start watching.” Because “it is clearer every day that the people will not consent to a process which forces upon them a decline in both living standards and state sovereignty. Without such consent there can be no single currency. And there are now, right across Europe, any number of people loudly voicing that discontent and non-consent.”
It's a more fragile time than our politicians would have us believe.
As expected, California officials on Thursday night passed what is considered the nation's strictest rule aimed at curbing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) approved the measure on a unanimous vote at a meeting in Riverside.
“The Trump administration has backed away from efforts to develop a federal rule to curb methane leaks from existing facilities — the nation's largest source of methane pollution,” Mary Nichols, CARB chair, said in a statement immediately after the vote. “California's regulations continue our leadership in fighting air pollutants and help meet our goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.”
The regulation is sweeping, covering oil and gas sites on land as well as offshore and would apply to private, state and federal property. Tribal land, however, would be exempt.
It would also cover storage sites such as the Aliso Canyon natural gas facility, site of a massive leak that forced thousands from their homes in the Porter Ranch area of Los Angeles County.
Methane is estimated to have 72 times more potential impact on global warming than carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame. Advocates for the rule say 75,000 tons of methane go into the atmosphere in California through leaky equipment and venting from oil and gas producers.
The rule mandates regular inspections at facilities and promises to slash methane releases by as much as 45 percent over the next nine years. The regulation will go into effect in phases, starting Jan. 1, 2018.
CARB officials say California's methane rule is expected to reduce methane leaks by the equivalent of taking 280,000 cars off the road for a year.
RELATED: California about to go its own way on methane
Oil and gas trade groups said they support the state finding ways to reduce emissions but have expressed a number of concerns, including mandating inspections at facilities with good maintenance records and questioning how much difference the rule would really make.
The Western States Petroleum Association attributes just 4 percent of the state's methane emissions to the oil and gas sector.
By CARB's own estimates, oil and gas operations account for 15 percent of statewide methane emissions.
Les Clark, executive vice president at the Independent Oil Producers' Agency, said on the eve of the vote the rule would hit small oil and gas producers in the state harder than big operators.
“Anything like this adds to the lifting costs,” Clark said. “Lifting costs is how much it costs to bring a barrel of oil out of the ground. These are regulations that are onerous to a certain extent for us because of our size.”
The vote by CARB comes in contrast to moves on Capitol Hill.
The Republican-majority in both houses of Congress is working on rolling back a methane rule finalized by the Obama administration 10 days after the election of Donald Trump that directed the Bureau of Land Management to clamp down on venting, flaring and leaks on federal and tribal land.
Under the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers can roll back recent executive actions if they are deemed too costly, exceed agency authority or are redundant.

Marshmallow soft.
Down pillow soft.
Baby's bottom soft.
So no one should be surprised that Obama had a a nightmare night. They finally got real questions for which they should have had ready answers. Over the last year Barack Obama has gotten a complete pass on their record, their life and everything associated to their political rise. In fact, if Senator Obama had been subjected to the scrutiny that Hillary Clinton has been subjected to they would have turned to ash by now.
So forgive me if all the blogospheric bellyaching permeating Democratic circles is not impressing me much. In fact, it's a laugh out loud moment.
Now don't get me wrong. I'm more than willing to blame the traditional media for piling on a Democrat, which they do often. But do these progressives now crying fowl really believe they could protect Mr. Obama, as their Democratic challengers did all last year, throughout the rest of this campaign? Asking a question about Rev. Wright? A question about William Ayers? The horror! Seriously, is Senator Obama so frail that they shouldn't be subjected to questioning that should have come a long time ago and will inevitably come in the general election? If nothing else and at the very least, everyone in the Democratic party should want to know how he's going to handle this stuff if he's our nominee. Because there can be no doubt that the wingnuts will lock and load Barack's greatest hits, then share them with the electorate in a cascade of negative gifts.
Mind you, this is questioning I've been doing for a year and getting excoriated for it. So I feel Charlie and George's pain. Going for substance isn't easy amidst the Political Idol crowd.
The facts are that the progressive community and Obama supporters have done their candidate no favors by the kid glove treatment they've applied to all things having to do with them and their record, including their associations. What happened last night is a result of one year of people ignoring reality. That's right, reality. Because the closer Obama got to the nomination and the general election, the curtain would eventually be pulled back on every event in their life, good, bad and horror show, which includes Rev. Wright.
This is the reason we lose elections.
What, did Obama's adoring fans think they could hermetically seal them and protect them from the meanies out there, then simply deliver them to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue because "he's the one?" Good grief.
If Obama had been put through their paces last fall, they might have been past this by now. If their own campaign had faced up to their associations long ago, head on, they wouldn't be dealing with this now.
Again, I'd blame Gibson and Stephanopoulos, but it's not their fault that someone, anyone finally asked questions that have been out there for months and months. It's not tabloid to ask about Ayers any more than it was tabloid to question Bill Clinton about their past. Hillary's been asked about everything more than once, as they reload to ask it all over again.
Oh, and as for Keith He's No Edward R. Murrow Olbermann, don't send a sportscaster to do a political analyst's job. Talking to Howard Wolfson, with Olbermann whining about the questions about Ayers, isn't doing us any favors either. He's just giving Obama fans a false sense of security. It's as if the only people dealing with reality and preparing for the Republican attack machine is the Clinton campaign. Olbermann is on planet Zen if they think that Ayers won't be part of the dialogue come September. (You know, because you never roll out a new campaign in August.)
We need a nominee that can walk through fire. Whoever we offer up should be able to withstand anything, and I do mean anything. Because that's what always comes at Democrats, with the traditional press inevitably having a thing for the guy on the other side. Considering that guy will be John McCain, the hero worship will be out in force.
Sex therapists call for legalisation of 'virtual' child porn to 'relieve paedophiles' urges'
Amsterdam hospital sexologists claim allowing perverts to view drawings or computer-generated images of children would 'regulate their desires'
The Netherlands outlawed all sexual representation of children in 2002 as technology made imaginary images too realistic
Two sex therapists have sparked outrage in the Netherlands by calling for 'virtual' child porn to be legalised to relieve the urges of paedophiles.
Amsterdam hospital sexologists Rik van Lunsen and Erik van Beek claim allowing perverts to view drawings or computer-generated images of children would 'regulate their desires'.
The Netherlands outlawed all sexual representation of children in 2002 as technology made imaginary images too realistic.
Controversial: Two sex therapists have sparked outrage in the Netherlands by calling for 'virtual' child porn to be legalised to relieve the urges of paedophiles
Reaction: The comments from the pair who run the sexology department at Amsterdam's Univeristy Hospital have sparked shock on Dutch Internet forums
But Mr Van Beek told the Dutch media:'I think that repressing you fantasies can lead to frustration and ultimately, for some types of paedophile, to a greater likelihood of doing something wrong.
'If you make virtual child pornography under strict government control with a label explaining that no child was abused, you can give paedophiles a way of regulating their sexual urges.'
Horror: The idea of sexualising children has provoked shock and outrage
Mr van Lunsen added:'We don't make enough of a distinction in public debate between 'healthy' paedophiles, people who are not paedosexually active, and delinquent paedosexuals.
'We're not responsible for our thoughts or our fantasies, we're only responsible for one thing - our actions.'
But the comments from the pair who run the sexology department at Amsterdam's Univeristy Hospital have sparked shock on Dutch Internet forums.
Psychotherapist Jules Mulder of the prestigious De Waag clinic said:'The proposal isn't really pertinent and for some people it will certainly increase the likelihood of going through with sexual abuse.
'It would also be very difficult to cover all tastes. Some want photos of naked children, others want children having sex while someone else wants an eight-year-old boy with dark hair and a certain look in their eyes.
'It's not possible to satisfy these different desires with a bit of virtual child pornography.'
Former parliament speaker Gerdi Verbeet added:'It's really not a good idea.
'It would be an enormous responsibility for the government, and it also may not be possible to tell the virtual images from the real.'
A spokesperson for the Dutch branch of the Defence for Children International charity said it was opposed to the proposal, adding: 'It's preferable for paedophiles to learn to control themselves in a different way.'
Bulletproof: A lock screen for Google Glass
If you're a Google Glass Explorer, you're no doubt getting questions left and right about Glass. Chances are, many people want to try on your Glass, to see what the hype is about. Before you allow someone to demo your Glass, you can easily put Glass into Guest Mode, so people don't see your personal timeline. That's all well and good for when you allow someone to use Glass, but what if someone uses Glass without your permission? Enter Bulletproof. A lock screen for Google Glass.
Now you don't have to worry about a co-worker snatching Glass off of your desk and reading your personal notifications or worse. With Bulletproof, you can use a combination of swipes and taps on the Glass touchpad to unlock your device. As you can see above, the UI is very minimal, just like Glass itself. The text at the bottom of the lock screen slides across, confirming each swipe command. While the screenshots look similar to the Android 4.x lock screens, Mike DiGiovanni stated Bulletproof is not based on those, having been designed from scratch.
Will you have to unlock Glass every time you want to use it? No way, thanks to Head-On detection. If you have Head On detection enabled, you'll only have to unlock Glass once, that is until you take it off and put it back on again.
Pretty much, I put it on in the morning, unlock it then, and I'm good until I have to recharge, take it off, or let someone try it.
If you haven't guessed it, this app isn't a true Glass app. It's an Android app. You'll have to install Bulletproof by putting your Glass into debug mode and then use ADB to install it. It's worth mentioning if you leave your Glass in debug mode, Bulletproof could easily be uninstalled if someone truly wants to get into your device. It's best to keep debug mode off unless you're using it.
Mike has posted their work on GitHub and hopes for the community to contribute to the open source project.
On the first of this month, the National Museum of American History in Washington D.C. re-opened its west wing, loaded with new attractions, among them the Places of Invention exhibit. While the entire exhibit is fascinating, a particular portion of it I found to be of particular interest and am certain that regular readers would find it likewise.
As Smithsonian describes the display I speak of,
The rise of the personal computer in Silicon Valley, Calif. in the 1970s–80s adds up how suburban garage hackers plus lab researchers equaled personal computing.
I recently visited the museum and there saw many legendary things, among them: the Xerox Alto; a MITS Altair 8800; Douglas Engelbart‘s (father of hypertext) invention: the first, wooden mouse; the original Macintosh computer; a general history of Silicon Valley at the genesis of personal computing; a hobbyists' billboard pulled from the Valley's long past; and a lovely display highlighting the work of distinguished iconographer Susan Kare.
Kare started their career as an early Apple employee who created all of the icons and fonts for the Apple Macintosh, the first consumer-oriented computer featuring a graphical user interface, released in 1984. I've a particular fondness of Kare's work and it's that which drew me to the exhibit.
Them display was the centerpiece, featuring two early “Macintosh computers” connected to 12×12 tile flipboards, allowing visitors to create their own icons which would, at the click of a mouse, appear on the Mac's screen. It's interactive fun that I watched a great many kids clamor to enjoy firsthand (video). (I use quotes, as I observed that the Macs in question had their CRT's replaced with LCDs and were likely not being powered by a 7.8MHz MC68000…)
While there, I took a few photos and placed a gallery online. Note the recreation of Ralph Baer‘s workshop located just outside the Places of Invention exhibit, complete with a Simon electronic memory game, “The Brown Box,” a video game system Baer created in the late '60s, as well as it's commercial incarnation, the Magnavox Odyssey which was the first game console ever to hit the market (1972).
Have a look, and if you're in any way able, make your way to the American History Museum and experience this excellent exhibit for yourself.

PIERCE COUNTY, Wash. -- The Federal Aviation Administration has launched an investigation after a helicopter crew spotted a drone flying just a few feet above KOMO's AIR 4.
AIR 4 was covering a fire in Pierce County Monday when the incident happened.
The FAA is now trying to figure out who was behind the controls of the drone, which landed in a grassy field. A man picked it up and walked to a nearby house.
"The worst possible case is it could cause a complete loss of control for the helicopter and be a fatal accident," said aviation expert John Nance.
Drone use has exploded in recent years. The number of collisions involving drones has also gone up, according to the FAA. An average of 25 incidents are reported every month involving drones that are flying too close to commerical aircraft, an FAA spokesperson added.
Federal investigators are now trying to figure out if the drone involved in Monday's incident violated any guidelines. Drones can not be flown above 400 feet and must stay clear of manned aircraft.

“Dear PoPville,
At about 8:30 this morning I was crossing 14th at S Street with my two dogs, when a woman driving a very large older model Buick made a right turn on red from S and struck me in the crosswalk. One of my dogs was caught under their tire and dragged down 14th about 30/50 feet. I waved, screamed and banged on the car for them to stop, as the dog was still leashed and I was running alongside with my other dog in tow. They finally stopped and at that point they were trapped under the tire of their car. I am yelling for them to back up to free him. Finally they backed up and miraculously my dog jumped up, pulled from their collar and ran back down S street.
In the commotion I decided to run after my dog. As I was running the other direction the woman in the car started to drive off. A man on 14th had the good sense to stop the car, and at that point the driver did wait at the corner.
There were at least three other witnesses; two women and one man. It turns out my dog ran back to my house a block away and was sitting on the stoop bleeding and shaking. As I turned around, the two women had followed me to help. I decided to put them in the car and head for the vet hospital.
Upon passing the corner all four witnesses and the driver were there; one gentleman flagged me over, and I was able to get the drivers contact info.
However I was anxious to get my dog to the hospital and left without getting any other information. I have made a police report, but after calling the driver's insurance company I am now concerned that I might need witnesses to attest to the fact I was legally in the crosswalk.
If you were there this morning or otherwise witnessed what happened PLEASE get in touch – Jdf65dc(at)aol(dot)com.
My dog is at Friendship Animal Hospital now and while it appears for the moment their injuries are not life threatening, they have severe gashes on their legs, and internal bleeding that is possibly from a tear in their spleen. It is still unclear whether they might have other internal injuries. They will be hospitalized for at least two days and may require more surgery.
As you can imagine we are distraught, but thankful they are alive and getting good vet care. Upon leaving the hospital this morning, I was presented with an estimate for charges totaling almost $5,000. And that is just for today and tomorrow; not including potential surgery and follow-up care. The hospital is requiring an immediate deposit of $3,000 to continue treatment. Unfortunately, I don't have the funds and am currently scrambling to line up some sort of temporary loan or credit line to cover the charges.
So my best bet at this point is to have firm witness accounts documented in the police report so the driver's insurance company might be compelled to cover the costs.”

From the sublime to the bizarre, no other auto show thrills like Geneva. Under no other roof but that of the Geneva Palexpo could you find an electric Rolls-Royce, an Indian microcar and an outlandish French concept. And that's not even mentioning the most exotic supercars, built in countries we didn't even know had automobiled industries. With the knowledge that variety, and horsepower, is the spice of life, we bring you the concepts and cars that caught our eye at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show. Above: BMW Vision ConnectedDrive Any news from BMW is big news, especially a concept that showcases a new design language. However, the folks in Munich sent over the Vision ConnectedDrive to highlight function, not form. While its sumptuous silhouette and roll-down Z1-style doors are certainly lust-worthy, we'd also love to have its 3-D augmented heads-up display that can be customized to show the driver anything from a clear windshield to architectural information about nearby buildings.

Abarth Scorp-Ion What a difference a dash makes. The Abarth Scorpione 1300 was a tiny, rear-wheel drive racer that got about 8 mpg and did 0-62 in 12 seconds. The Scorp-Ion, however, is an all-electric, lithium-ion (get it?) battery-powered design study from Turin's Istituto Europeo di Design that puts electric motors at each wheel. We'd like both, please. Photo: Newspress
Alfa Romeo 4C Please excuse our behavior when the 4C hits the showroom floor at our local Chrysler dealership, because we'll be squealing like tweens at a Justin Bieber concert. For us, the long-rumored return of Alfa has been like the promise of a Verizon iPhone, and it looks like it actually might be happening this time. Sure, it'll start out at $60k, but it'll be here, carving up the 101, valeted outside Manhattan hot spots and drooled over from sea to shining sea. Photo: Newspress
Alpina BMW B5 BiTurbo It's the consummate Q-ship, the sublime sleeper, the überwagon. Alpina worked their Bavarian black magic on a 5-series wagon to give it 500 horsepower out of a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8. Amazingly, the bodywork and 20-inch rims look downright classy. We'd love to get groceries in this monster, but we're pretty sure they'd all end up pasted to the rear windshield. Photo: Newspress
Audi A3 Concept Another score from Audi. Not only does the A3 look good as a sedan, but its stats are just as breathtaking: 408 hp from a direct injection, 2.5-liter, 5-cylinder engine mated to a seven-speed S Tronic transmission. The aluminum and carbon-fiber 20-inch wheels might reduce unsprung weight, but we're pretty sure they won't end up as standard equipment on a production vehicle. ? Photo: Newspress
Citroën Metropolis Designed for the French pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, the Metropolis luxo-barge plug-in hybrid has silently sailed into Geneva. Still no word on if it's been given the green light for production, but if it does it'll certainly give the Panamera a run for its money, and become a worthy successor to the incomparable DS. Photo: Newspress
Sbarro Evoluzione No, we didn't pull a photo of a Gallardo off wreckedexotics.com -- that's how it's supposed to look. The Evoluzione is actually the creation of students of Swiss designer Franco Sbarro, who is best known as the inventor of the hubless wheel. We'd like to say the car is a beast if not a beauty, but unfortunately there's only a 1.8-liter Audi four-cylinder engine in the Evoluzione's bedsore of a rear end. Photos: Newspress
Mansory 458 Italia Siracusa We'll never forgive them for what they did to a Mercedes SLS, and the Dodge Challenger paint job isn't quite our cup of tea, but at least the tuners at Mansory squeezed another 30 horsepower out of, and shaved off 150 pounds off, a stock 458 Italia. Photo: Newspress
Nissan Esflow concept Unfortunately for Nissan, the Esflow debuted online a few weeks before its big unveil in Geneva. That doesn't change the facts: It's a mid-engine, rear-drive EV with a nearly 150-mile range that can do 0-62 in under 5 seconds. If Nissan decides to build the Esflow, it could be the new Z for the Leaf generation. Photo: Newspress
Pagani Huayra If they still make coffee-table books of supercars, this one will be on the cover. Replacing the Pagani Zonda, the ultra-exotic Huayra is so exclusive, you have to put down a $100,000 deposit just to learn how the model name is pronounced. Aside from the fact the car might be sold in the United States, the rest of the news is just math: 700 horsepower + 12-cylinder twin-turbo engine built by AMG + 0-62 time of 3.3 seconds = around $1.6 million. Photo: Newspress
Renault Captur If you can imagine the styling of the Nissan Juke getting any more, er, "unique," you'll have a Renault Captur. Apparently, Renault still has enough money to hint at future models with outré concepts, and they've done so with the Captur. Beneath that rugged exterior lie seats made of fluorescent orange rubber bands and similarly colored luminescent dashboard panels. Photo: Newspress
Rolls-Royce 102EX A Rolls-Royce is supposed to be silent and powerful, right? It makes sense that it would be electrified. Still, a company as staid (and low-volume) as Rolls would go about the process quite conservatively. Hence, the 102EX is a one-off concept meant to judge customer interest and ensure that it delivers an "authentic Rolls-Royce experience," according to CEO Torsten Müller-Ötvös. Photo: Rolls-Royce
SEAT iBX While we'll never see one in the United States, SEAT's iBX previews the design direction that the entire brand -- a Volkswagen Group subsidiary -- will take in the coming years. The two-door crossover is also a range-extended plug-in EV with about a 28-mile electric-only range. Photo: Newspress
Tata Pixel The Pixel is a city car in every sense of the world. Tata claims that it comfortably fits four adults in a package that's only 10 feet long -- jut a little bigger than a Smart ForTwo -- and gets over 60 mpg with start-stop technology and regenerative braking. The doors open upward, Lambo style, to make exiting the vehicle a snap even in the tightest parking spaces. Most interestingly, however, are the rear wheels that can turn in opposing directions, allowing the vehicle to "pivot" and parallel park effortlessly. Photo: Newspress
Toyota FT-86 II This Toyota-Subaru creation is the latest iteration of the rear-wheel-drive sports car that Toyota has been promising us for years, looking a little more production-ready than the previous FT-86 concept we saw. We'd love it if they called it a Supra. Photo: Newspress
Cher is taking the stage once again!
The "If I Could Turn Back Time" singer is being honored with the coveted ICON Award at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards on May 21, where they will also deliver their first awards show performance in 15 years.
EXCLUSIVE: Cher Says It Will Take a 'Special Person' to Be the Next 'Mr. Cher'
"I'm honored to receive the 2017 Billboard Music Awards ICON Award and take the stage to celebrate my love of music with my fans," the decorated songstress, who will be performing their 1998 smash single, "Believe," said in a statement. "Seeing so many powerful artists - especially female artists emerge and take their place in history through the years has been incredible. I'm honored to be among the previous ICON Award winners and to celebrate this milestone achievement by performing 'Believe' on the show."
Previous ICON honorees include Jennifer Lopez, Neil Diamond, Stevie Wonder, Celine Dion and the late, great Prince.

Following the Tigers' decisions to exercise closer Francisco Rodriguez's option and to trade center fielder Cameron Maybin to the Angels for pitcher Victor Alcantara, the team issued a statement with quotes from GM Avila. In the wake of Maybin's departure, the team will sort through various options at center field next season, Avila says.
“We will weigh our options as far as center field is concerned for next season,” says the GM. “There will be a wide open competition starting in the spring and we'll see how it plays out.”
The team's options at center field could include JaCoby Jones, Tyler Collins and Anthony Gose. All three, though, come with drawbacks. Jones mostly played infield in the minors, has limited experience above Double-A and batted just .243/.309/.356 while striking out in 29.9% of their plate appearances at Triple-A Toledo last year. Collins posted a .687 OPS for Detroit last season and fared even worse at Toledo. And Gose also failed to hit, batting .209/.287/.341 in the big leagues in 2016. In contrast, Maybin's 2016 season was a highly successful one, and it appears the Tigers will miss their .383 OBP in particular. Avila's comments don't preclude the possibility that the Tigers could expand their search for a center fielder outside the organization, however.
Regarding Rodriguez, Avila says, “We liked the job K-Rod did last season and the numbers show they were a reliable closer for us. They stabilize the back end of our bullpen and provides veteran leadership to our younger bullpen arms.” The 34-year-old K-Rod figures to close for the Tigers next season, unless the Tigers decide to put them on the trade market.

When Hart protests, they are arrested.At the precinct, Hart is asked to remove their jewelry, but refuses to remove their earrings, a small necklace and their wedding band. The officers then say the chain has to come off. Hart responds by saying, 'the chain is not coming off!'For a few moments, Hart says it is a standoff, until they try to remove the jewelry by force."My wife's ring - no, no no!" Hart could be heard saying.Hart then says they were beaten vindictively. They and their attorney have filed a federal civil rights lawsuit. The officers charged Hart with assaulting them. They were later found not guilty, and charges against their wife were dropped.

Chris Comer, whose lawsuit challenging the Texas Education Agency's policy of requiring neutrality about evolution and creationism was dismissed on March 31, 2009, is now appealing the decision. Formerly the director of science at the TEA, Comer was forced to resign in November 2007 after they forwarded a note announcing a talk by Barbara Forrest in Austin; according to a memorandum recommending them dismissal, "the TEA requires, as agency policy, neutrality when talking about evolution and creationism."
In June 2008, Comer filed suit in federal court in the Western District of Texas, arguing that the policy violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment: "By professing 'neutrality,' the Agency credits creationism as a valid scientific theory." The judge ruled (PDF, p. 18) otherwise, however, writing, "As a matter of law, the Agency's neutrality policy, if it advances religion at all, only does so incidentally. Further, a reasonable observer of the neutrality policy would not believe the Agency endorses religion through the policy."
In their appellate brief, submitted to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Comer asked (PDF, p. 39) the court to "review the record de novo and reverse and vacate the district court's decision. Specifically, it should grant Comer's motion for summary judgment, and vacate the grant of summary judgment for defendants, as well as the dismissal of plaintiff's complaint. At a minimum, this Court should vacate the grant of summary judgment to defendants, plus the order dismissing the complaint, and remand for further proceedings."
A brief video about the Comer case is available on NCSE's YouTube channel.
Congress dealt President Obama a humiliating foreign-policy blow Wednesday — voting to overturn their veto of a bill that would let families of 9/11 victims sue Saudi Arabia for that country's alleged role in the terror attacks.
The Senate voted 97-1 to override the veto, and hours later the House did the same by 348-77.
The bipartisan measure, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Senate GOP Whip John Cornyn of Texas, would create an exception in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to allow victims of terrorism on US soil to sue foreign sponsors.
“This rare moment of bipartisanship is a testament to the strength of the 9/11 families and the validity of their pursuit of justice,” Schumer said in a statement. “Overriding a presidential veto is something we don't take lightly, but it was important in this case that the families of the victims of 9/11 be allowed to pursue justice, even if that pursuit causes some diplomatic discomforts.”
New York's entire congressional delegation voted against the president.
The rebuke angered Obama, who called it a “dangerous precedent.”
“If we eliminate this notion of sovereign immunity, then our men and women in uniform around the world could potentially start seeing ourselves subject to reciprocal laws,” they said.
“And the concern that I have had has nothing to do with Saudi Arabia per se or my sympathy for 9/11 families. It has to do with me not wanting a situation in which we're suddenly exposed to liabilities for all the work that we're doing all around the world — and suddenly finding ourselves subject to the private lawsuits in courts where we don't even know exactly whether they're on the up-and-up in some cases.
“So it's a dangerous precedent.”
Only Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) voted to sustain it. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, the Democratic nominee for vice president, did not vote.
Families of some 9/11 victims want to sue Saudi Arabian officials if it's determined they were connected to or supported the al Qaeda hijackers, and lawmakers wrote the bill at their request.
The Senate and House unanimously passed the measure in May and September, respectively.
Saudi Arabia and its allies also warned there would be consequences for the US should the law pass.
Obama had previously issued 11 vetoes during their presidency, according to Senate records.
Watch: Press secretary Josh Earnest explains why Obama would veto the bill
Taking a call behind the wheel was a big mistake for an alleged cigarette smuggler busted in South Jamaica on Thursday night with a cache of untaxed smokes, police announced.
Officers from the 113th Precinct observed Yunus Latis, 52, of 101st Avenue in Ozone Park using a cellphone while driving a 2008 green Toyota SUV at the intersection of Rockaway Boulevard and the Van Wyck Expressway northbound service road at around 8 p.m. on March 2.
Law enforcement sources said the officers topped Latis' car and checked their license, which they learned had been suspended. In questioning the suspect, police noted, Latis allegedly told them they had a large number of cigarettes in their vehicle which they were planning to sell.
The officers would then find 520 packs — 10,000 cigarettes in all — inside the vehicle; each of the packs were found to have tax stamps from Virginia that were later determined to be counterfeit.
Latis was booked on charges including criminal possession of a forged instrument, cigarette tax evasion, possession and sale of untaxed cigarettes, aggravated unlicensed operator and various moving and equipment violations.
Yasiel Puig has hit seven home runs in their first month with the Dodgers since getting called on June 3rd. Five of those have gone to the opposite field, showing just how much of the plate Puig covers and how much strength is behind their swing. On Sunday night against the Phillies, Puig had two singles, a double and a triple.  They are currently batting .436 in 26 games, with seven home runs, 12 RBI, four stolen bases and 19 runs.
Puig has 44 hits in their first month, second only to Joe DiMaggio's 48 in May of 1936.

The long dispute over a cross on top of Mt. Soledad in La Jolla could finally to be coming to an end. A federal judge ruled Thursday that the cross is unconstitutional and should be removed.
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2011 that the cross violated the First Amendment. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal to that decision, so the cross case was kicked back to a district court. That court ruled today that the 43-foot cross must go.
The federal display was challenged in a 2006 lawsuit by the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America and several local residents, all of whom were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of San Diego and Imperial counties.
The ACLU is celebrating the court's decision as a big win.
Jeff Wergeles, deputy director of the ACLU of San Diego & Imperial Counties, said they aren't sure yet whether the case can finally close, but are hopeful the cross will now have to come down.
"This country was founded on the freedom of religion. A basic American value is that the government does not get involved in religion, and this cross is clearly a religious symbol," Wergeles said.
The cross was erected in 1954 and was dedicated at an Easter Sunday ceremony describing the monument as a "gleaming white symbol of Christianity.''
In 2006, the federal government, through an act of Congress, obtained the title to the cross and its surrounding property by eminent domain, and declared the cross to be a national war memorial.

Japan's Only Known Survivor Of Both Atomic Blasts Has Died
Enlarge this image toggle caption Jiji Press/AFP/Getty Images Jiji Press/AFP/Getty Images
Tsutomu Yamaguchi was visiting Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, the day an atomic bomb fell on the city. They survived.
Three days later they were home in Nagasaki when an American plane dropped an atomic bomb on that city, effectively ending World War II. Yamaguchi survived again.
Today, there's word that the 93-year-old man has died after a battle against stomach cancer.
They are, as the Associated Press says, the only officially recognized survivor of both atomic blasts.
The BBC writes that Yamaguchi:
Suffered serious burns and spent a night there before returning to their home city of Nagasaki just before it was bombed on 9 August (1945).
They said they hoped their experience held a lesson of peace for future generations.
Last month, Avatar director James Cameron visited Yamaguchi. Cameron is considering making a film of an upcoming book by Charles Pelegrino, The Last Train From Hiroshima: The Survivors Look Back.
After meeting with Cameron and Pellegrino, Yamaguchi told The Mainichi Daily News that they believed it is the director's "destiny" to make a film about the bombings.
Update at 2:25 p.m. ET. A few minutes ago, All Things Considered co-host Melissa Block spoke with Pellegrino. They read a passage from their upcoming book, describing what happened to Yamaguchi in Hiroshima. Yamaguchi felt "like a leaf on the wind" after being picked up and carried on a "cushion of air and rushing dust":
Japan's Only Known Survivor Of Both Atomic Blasts Has Died Listen
Yamaguchi survived the second blast because of a stairwell in their office building, Pellegrino says.

Stop Killing Cyclists is to stage a protest and ‘die-in' outside the Treasury on Horseguards Parade on Saturday February 11. The campaign group is demanding that Chancellor Philip Hammond allocate ten per cent of the transport budget to walking and cycling by 2020.
Protestors will assemble at the National Gallery from 1pm with the rally and die-in scheduled to take place outside the Treasury at 2pm. The Facebook event can be found here.
The date was chosen because Hammond is now putting together their first budget which will be delivered in March. Speaking in December, Stop Killing Cyclists' Fred Smith told road.cc that they also expected that the commencement of Trump's presidency would "highlight climate change inaction."
The protest will feature children playing in gas masks “to symbolise the thousands of UK children whose lungs are being stunted from living on traffic polluted streets or attending polluted schools.”
Stop Killing Cyclists spokesperson Caspar Hughes said: “Air pollution is poisoning millions of people in the UK, whilst traffic carbon emissions are contributing to the climate emergency. Road danger means most people do not feel safe cycling on UK roads, which means they lack life-saving physical exercise.”
They added: “There is now an urgent health crisis which is costing the NHS billions. It is now crucial that our national cycling infrastructure gets its fair share of national infrastructure investment.”
The group wants to see the government commit to increasing the funding for cycling and walking to five per cent of the 2017 transport budget and ten per cent by 2020.
The “Si” ( originally indicating “Sport injected”) is a trim of the Civic line from Honda. It's Honda's designation that the vehicle has upgraded performance characteristics compared to the other trims (LX, DX, EX, etc.). They often had different, more powerful engines installed from the factory, along with stiffer suspension and different tires for improved handling. The Si model followed the same body designs and general engineering as the other Civic models. This article summarizes the Si's heritage and reviews the changes over the years.
CRX roots: 1985-1987
Si was first used as a designation in the United States in 1985 with the Civic CRX Si, which featured a fuel-injected, 1.5 liter engine making 91 horsepower. It went 0-60 mph in 8.5 seconds.
1986: Adopted by Civic
In 1986, the Si trim was extended to the Civic hatchback, offering the same performance of the CRX Si but with four seats. Added improvements over the CRX included a removable glass sunroof, a five-speed manual gearbox, tilt steering wheel, a full-width taillight panel, a color-matched front bumper and a roof spoiler. The engine was the same as in the CRX.
Boxy beauties: 1988-1991
In 1988, Civic was redesigned (bringing it into its fourth generation), and along with it came the Si designation, but not right right away. The Civic Si was absent from the lineup in '88, with only the CRX offered with the Si surname. The next year, 1989, the Civic Si hatchback was reintroduced, along with a 17-hp upgrade over the 86-87 model. The engine generated 108 horsepower. It weighed 2,286 lb, allowing a 0–60 mph of 8.1 seconds.
Hot hatch: 1992-1995
The fourth generation Si, following the 92-95 body style of the Civic hatchback, was not as different from the other Civics as past models were, shipping with the same engine as the EX coupe and sedan. The Si model replaced rear drum brakes with discs, added a power moonroof with tilt, cruise control, and a 125 hp 1.6 liter engine with manual transmission. It propelled the car to 60mph in 7.5 seconds.
Civic Si disappeared again during the 1996, 97 and 98 model years in the US.
Reincarnated as a coupe: 1999-2000
It reappeared as a coupe in 1999, now shipping with a new 1.6 liter engine that made 160 hp. Changes from the standard Civic included stiffer suspension components, which contributed to a flatter-cornering ride. It was available with a five-speed manual transmission only, also including disc brakes on all wheels. Aesthetic exterior changes from the LX/EX models were minimal, with the Si trim featuring a lower-profile and wider 15-inch wheel/tire package, a subtle chin-spoiler, painted side sills, and Si badging. It went 0-60 mph in 7.1 seconds. This Si was only built for 1999 and 2000 model years, after which it was discontinued as the Civic was redesigned yet again.
New bullet: 2002-2005
The next Civic Si appeared a year later, after skipping 2001. The 02-05 Civic Si returned to form as a hatchback once again, after having been sold only as a coupé in the previous generation. The body shape of this model was based on the “New Bullet-Form” concept. The interior layout also distinguished itself from other Civic Si generations with its shift lever mounted in the dashboard.
Honda used the 2.0 liter engine from their Acura RSX, rated at 160 horsepower. With a redline of 6,800 rpm, the Si distanced itself from the narrow, high-rpm powerband engine of its predecessor, and as a result saw a 20 percent increase in torque. Performance was relatively underwhelming compared to the competition and the switch to MacPherson struts from double-wishbone suspension resulted in less responsive handling. A near-150 lb increase in weight to 2,744 lb contributed to slower acceleration than the lighter '99-'00 Si. 60 mph came in 7.6 seconds.
Rev happy: 2006-20011
The Si was redesigned for the 2006 model year along with all other Civic trims, bringing about significant changes from the previous generation. The car comes with a 2.0-liter engine that produces 197 hp, while also including a 6-speed manual transmission with a helical limited slip differential. Forty percent stiffer spring and dampening rates from the non-Si trims and stiffer sway bars have bolstered the Civic Si's handling. Factory 0–60 time of 6.7 seconds.
Big blocks: 2012-present
The 9th generation Civic Si upgrades the engine from the 8th generation to a 2.4 liter delivering 201 horsepower. Retained is the 6 speed manual transmission, which is the only available transmission option. The wing spoiler found on the previous generation is replaced by a different design deck-lid spoiler. The interior of the car received slight updates as an addition of rev limit indicator and a power meter, displayed in the new i-MID (intelligent Multi-Information Display). The chassis is more rigid and the curb weight is slightly lower than the previous model. It is the same size as the outgoing model. 0-60mph time on the latest model is 6.4 seconds.
On Sept. 22, 1999, almost exactly a year after the House Judiciary Committee released the video footage of Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony in the Lewinsky investigation, the President of the United States was in a bike accident. This President was Jed Bartlet, played by Martin Sheen, and for seven years they sat in the Oval Office of an idealized America — a country where political bipartisanship wasn't a pipe dream, where Glenn Close played a Supreme Court Justice whose far-left jurisprudence made Merrick Garland look like Ted Cruz, and where government, as White House Communications Director Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff) once lyricized, is “a place where people come together.”
This vision was The West Wing, and its critically monumental seven seasons began with the President of the United States running into a tree on their bicycle. On Wednesday, the actor Joshua Malina (who played staffer Will Bailey in the series' latter seasons) and film composer Hrishikesh Hirway released the first episode of a podcast that will discuss and meticulously deconstruct each of the show's 154 episodes. When Malina first teased it on Twitter a few weeks ago, the show's still-devoted fanbase wasn't sure if they should take them seriously. (Malina was an inveterate prankster on The West Wing set.)

But lo and behold, they aren't joking. The first episode is a 48-minute casual meditation on the pilot episode, in which the White House staff — sage Chief of Staff Leo McGarry (John Spencer); their outspoken, whip-smart deputy Joshua Lyman (Bradley Whitford); Press Secretary C.J. Cregg (legendary Allison Janney); Ziegler and their deputy Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe) — deal with the bike accident but also an impending Cuban refugee crisis, friction with an outspoken right-wing Christian group, and Seaborn's accidental liaison with a call girl.

The podcast was Hirway's idea. He'd been working on their podcast Song Exploder, in which they have musicians dissect their songs and the backstories behind them, and wanted to apply this premise to The West Wing — their favorite show, they say, which they regularly rewatch. They turned to Malina, an old friend, who “could reveal some of the mechanics and ideas that went into the show's creation.”

“Our hope is to bring in lots of the actors and writers that worked on the show, to reveal their perspective on a particular episode, as well as people outside of The West Wing, from the worlds of comedy, politics and news,” they wrote in an email to TIME late Wednesday night.
In the first episode, Malina and Hirway muse about the episode and its origins, recalling that in early drafts of Aaron Sorkin's script, Sheen's President Bartlet almost never actually appeared. The show would focus instead on the staffers that kept the ship upright. (Sheen proved too good to do away with, but a balance was struck: most reflective rankings of the show's characters have C.J. Cregg and the curmudgeonly Toby Ziegler atop the list of fan favorites.)
They also note how the pilot — and the series at large, really — was in many ways prescient. More than a decade before “New York values” controversially fell into the argot of the 2016 election, a scene has a spokesperson from the asupervisorstioned Christian group scoff at Josh Lyman's “New York sense of humor” — igniting Toby Ziegler, who interrupts to say that “she meant Jewish — when they said ‘New York sense of humor,' they were talking about you and me.”
“We think the show is incredibly relevant today, and besides general fandom of the show, we're interested in seeing how it contrasts or reflects the America we live in now, 17 years after the show premiered,” Hirway wrote. Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker once called the show “helpful counterprogramming to the Bush Administration,” but it also makes a decent cure for election fatigue.
Malina and Hirway haven't said when they'll release the next episode. This podcast is an ambitious project — 153 more episodes to discuss for nearly an hour each; you do the math — but not without precedent: such recap efforts have been done for The X-Files and The Simpsons.

With April 4 still two long months away, and the newness of that Season 1.5 trailer worn off, we're pretty sure fans of Starz's wildly popular Highlanders-and-hankypanky series are in need of a fresh method to survive the Droughtlander. Yahoo TV's first look, err, listen to a classical cut from the upcoming soundtrack will be music to their ears.
While the Outlander Original Television Soundtrack Vol. 1 does not come out until Feb. 10, "Castle Leoch," one of 13 compositions created by Emmy Award-winning composer Bear McCreary (The Walking Dead, DaVinci's Demons) for the first eight episodes of the show, can be listened to in full below.
"Besides the main title, 'Castle Leoch' marks the first time I incorporated traditional folk music directly into the narrative score," McCreary tells Yahoo TV via email. "The track opens with a heartfelt rendition of 'Loch Lomond' and transitions to a viola da gamba playing 'Bonny Katherine Ogie.' [It is] arranged with a distinctly regal style to capture the feeling of Colum's court. I felt these tunes, songs that people of this era actually knew and sang, helped ground the story authentically."

The album also features "The Skye Boat Song" and "Dance of the Druids," both of which showcase haunting vocals by Raya Yarbrough, and the wedding music and "The Woman of Balnain," a collaboration with Gillebride MacMillan. Executive producer Ronald D. Moore, who worked with McCreary on Battlestar Galactica, hired the musician for Outlander because they had a passion for the folk music of Jacobean Scotland that predated this project. "When I first learned to drive, I was blasting bagpipes from my car speakers," McCreary has said. "I was awestruck by their ability to communicate tales of tragedy and triumph through lyrics with double meaning woven along deceptively simple melodic lines and evocative harmonic progressions. From the beginning, I wanted to draw predominantly from Scottish instrumentation and folk music. Instruments such as the fiddle, bagpipes, accordion, penny whistle, and bodhrán [a type of frame drum] form the backbone of the score."
Pre-orders can be made through Amazon, or, for a digital copy, on iTunes.
Season 1 of Outlander resumes April 4 on Starz.

In Showtime's BILLIONS, now in its second season on Sunday nights, Damian Lewis stars as up from the streets but now very wealthy Wall Street business person Bobby “Axe” Axelrod. Bobby has drawn the wrath of Deputy District Attorney Chuck Rhoades, played by Paul Giamatti. Their situation was considerably complicated by the fact that Chuck's wife Wendy (Maggie Siff) has been Bobby's professional advisor and coach. At the end of Season 1, Wendy separated from Chuck and quit their job with Bobby, disturbing both men.
At the start of BILLIONS Season 2, Bobby embroils Chuck in a massive lawsuit, but the tactic may backfire. The London-born Lewis, who won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for their portrayal of U.S. Marine-turned-terrorist-turned-spy Nicholas Brody on Showtime's HOMELAND, fills us in on where Bobby and Co. are going this year.
ASSIGNMENT X: Can you talk about the evolution of Axe?
DAMIAN LEWIS: I think Axe is a man who wants to be left alone. He's a libertarian, they believe that a man should be able to make money. The goal posts in that industry move all the time, so what's legal, what's illegal is very hard to prove or disprove a lot of the time. They all take advantage of that all the time, and they a past master at it. I think they just feels indignant and disgruntled that this man has decided to come at them so aggressively, which they have. He's not going to go away. I think Axe feels that, in order to thrive, they need to dispose of Chuck Rhoades, so they file this lawsuit against him, and that's how we start Season 2. After that, there are hard decisions. I think a lot of people are concerned that this show will burn out because [they think] it's just going to be a show about two men cracking skulls. But actually, I think what they've done quite artfully this season is, there's a whole investigation by their own people into their own office, and I in the meantime am I looking at an investment.
AX: Why does Axe spend their money so conspicuously?
LEWIS: That's all about status, that's all about acceptance, that's all about being a blue-collar working-class guy, self-made billionaire, a nouveau-riche guy who wants to be accepted by the Establishment, by the East Coast, old money guys. And so these different stories have emerged this year in an interesting way. It just turns out that there's a longer game being played. And I get played in the end. So we just see the way in which the emotional lives of these characters is finally what undoes them. So when they're irrational, emotional, envious, angry, needy, then they perform less well. When Axe is dependent on the algorithm, when he's rational, when he's clear-headed, then he's better at what they do. They have more chance of taking them [Rhoades] down and more chance of just doing their job well. But certainties are eroded. Season 1 was a great ride. It was being in this playground with these powerful people in the playground that's New York. And of course there was an effect to the way they behaved, but there was no real consequence. I think there's more consequence this year. So it goes deeper.
AX: In what way?
LEWIS: Axe has a significant birthday in the course of the season, and I think they examine where they are, what they are, what he's achieved and what they want from life. They then gets pushed into a position which is a little bit like the gunslinger who's put down their guns having to make one last kill. And they do something abominable, which is a place he's pushed into because of their fight with Chuck. There is a shifting in their self-awareness of who they are. There's a little more introspection, which is something you could never accuse Bobby of normally.
AX: Does Bobby ever look at the ethics of the companies he's acquiring? Things like whether they pollute, or cure people, or ignore worker safety, things like that?
LEWIS: The short answer is, at the moment, no, but it's not made absolutely clear. And we also don't get into the mechanics of what happens to a company when someone like Bobby Axelrod comes in and makes it work more “efficiently.” That's not something the guy seemed particularly concerned with, until this moment that I was just alluding to, which is later in the season, where there is a brief discussion about the way in which government, local communities, has a responsibility to take care of their own towns, and then there is a little riff on what happened in Puerto Rico recently, about the way in which an entire country has effectively been privatized, because the hedge fund guys have been able to go in and invest and start to take over huge numbers of assets, hard assets, and infrastructure in the company in order to rebuild it. This show never wants to become too didactic, because there are people, of course, who will understand it, there are people in New York who will understand it, but mostly, I think you need to understand the show through the prism of people's emotional beats, you need to know that someone has won and you need to know that someone has lost, and you know to know what's the cost. And I think the show will work most successfully in that realm, without becoming too didactic, I suspect.
AX: Can you tease at all where Axe and Wendy's relationship goes this season?
LEWIS: Yes. As the paranoia increases, their relationship is challenged, too. Wendy is quite capable of taking care of herself, as we saw at the end of last season, when they play Axe in that last moment and runs away with the Maserati and a five-million-dollar bonus. Was it five million? It suddenly doesn't seem like very much in the world of BILLIONS. And they don't work with Axe anymore. Axe relies on their heavily, though. Of course, there's always going to be a question of pride with him, and they attempt to lure them back. But it's because, I think, there is some truth in the fact when they say, “We built this company together.” I think they are good counsel for him, and they need them They feel more confident with them There certainly isn't, for now, any kind of romantic interest between them.
AX: What's the strangest audition that you've ever had?
LEWIS: The strangest audition I ever did was, when I was a younger actor, and I was auditioning for a commercial, and there was a sleeping bag at the end of the room. And they said, “Go and get into that sleeping bag.” I said, “Okay.” They said, “Now, turn away from us, face the wall.” I said, “Okay.” And they said, “On ‘Action,' roll over towards us.” And I said, “Okay.” And I rolled over in my sleeping bag, and they said, “Okay, thanks so much for coming in.” And that was it. It was the last commercial audition I ever went out for, because I felt it was such a waste of time.
AX: Do you get recognized out on the streets, when you're in airports, walking around?
LEWIS: Yeah.
AX: Mostly for BILLIONS, or HOMELAND, or something else?
LEWIS: I'm old, I get recognized for everything. I get recognized just for being me now [laughs].

Please also see our events page.
We are delighted to announce our first event of 2017, a talk by James Wright (University of Nottingham) on the awesome subject of Historic Graffiti:
Modern graffiti is often seen as transgressive and stupid. However, look closely in the light of a torch at the walls of our historic buildings, trees, caves and rockfaces and you will see a world of graffiti left that illuminates the psychology of our ancestors. The study of historic graffiti enables us to hear the lost voices of ordinary individuals through their images of daisywheels, ships sailing across the walls, knights drawing their swords, demons stalking the stonework and every animal imaginable…
Wednesday 8th March 2017 – 7pm
Room 2 (if in doubt where to go, simply lurk around near the Box Office just before 7pm and we will find you!).
Free event – venue wheelchair accessible.
If you are planning to come, please send us a quick email so we can get a better idea about numbers.
When the movie The Room was released in 2003, it was almost universally panned by critics, and Entertainment Weekly called it one of the "worst movies ever made." But that didn't stop The Room from garnering a huge cult fan base that has kept it screening around the world for nearly a dozen years — and it certainly didn't slow down the film's writer, director, and star, Tommy Wiseau.
Since the film's release, Wiseau has devoted much of their career to promoting The Room around the world at midnight showings and Q&As, but he's also directed a documentary. Their next project is The Neighbors, a television show for Hulu that keeps much of what made The Room such a cult sensation fully intact.
I chatted with Wiseau about their new show, why they feel people don't take them seriously, and how he's grown as an artist and a filmmaker since The Room. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Kelsey McKinney: Why did you decide to become a filmmaker?
Tommy Wiseau: I always thought it would be a cool thing to do. By the same token, though, I wrote this script, and long story short, it was supposed to be a book. And I think I have something to offer as a filmmaker for the new generation to come. So that's basically when I decided to become a filmmaker and an actor, as well.
It's very stressful sometimes, but it's very rewarding about the concept and how you want to work with people to create something.
KM: Can you talk to me about the major themes you try to embody in your work?
TW: What do you mean by that?
KM: What themes underlie your films? Who are your film inspirations, and what are you trying to get across to viewers?
TW: You have to ask me specific questions, because you know the way you ask questions is pretty vague. So who inspired me or what?
KM: Sure.
TW: I inspire myself. But I've also been inspired by James Dean, Marlon Brando, and others. For example, Casablanca and others. You know, Citizen Kane. I always had an interest in film. And you know in the film industry you have to actually do something, it's not just talking.
To present something to people, sometimes they won't accept something the way you're thinking they will. For example, The Room. Did you watch The Room?
KM: Yes. I did.
TW: As you know, people will say, "This is a bad thing," or, "This and that happened by accident." I have news for all those douchebags. Nothing happened by accident. I studied film for the past 12, 15, actually close to 20 years. The Room has been screening worldwide for close to 12 years.
KM: You said people think a lot of things in The Room happened by accident. Can you give me a specific example of something you did intentionally that they aren't catching?
TW: Let me give you an example. For the past 12 years a lot of people speculate that my script of The Room does not exist, and that's really disrespectful toward me as a filmmaker and as a creator. I don't know if you've seen it, but you can go to Tommywiseau.com to see the trailer.
You can go behind the scenes to see the production. We had a regular production; a static production. Yes, it's true I did let some crew go because there was a conflict of my vision. But long story short, you can see behind the scenes what I did with a regular crew and a regular cast, et cetera.
Again, this is very disrespectful, including some people in media. I'm very happy with what's happened the past few years. The last two or three years, mainstream media has actually supported my project. As you know we are creating The Neighbors with Hulu. Hulu is owned by the ABC [ed. note: Hulu is jointly owned by NBC, ABC, and Fox], so I'm very happy to work with these people. I never criticize these people, the big studios, because you see work is work. It is like entertainment is entertainment.
With The Room, I never had opportunity to work with a big studio. To summary, it was supposed to be a play, and then I did some research, and I said, "Not enough people go to the plays," and that includes me. I go, what, every six months or something?
But a lot of people go to the cinema, so I said to myself, "You know, I have to make this a script." So I condensed my 800-page book and the play to a script format. Originally, the play is 150 pages. I can condense, but are we talking about two people watching or 400 people.
The other thing — let me give you a little style. We submit to the Academy Awards. People don't realize until today. Some people are just flying in the sky, but it's so awkward because we submitted to the Academy Awards, and you know they have all of these rules, like you have to run two weeks in the theater. So I took the movie out of the theater, because that's what the contract said. I wanted to leave it in the theater, but I couldn't. [Ed. note: Academy rules stipulate that a film must run a minimum of one week in a theater in Los Angeles County.]
To submit my movie to the Academy Awards, I was very happy to conquer all the rules and regulations
I did two weeks screening in Los Angeles, so we could submit to the Academy Awards, etc., etc., but you know, I'm a very respectful guy. If there are rules, I follow them. I'm happy happy. To submit my movie to the Academy Awards, I was very happy to conquer all the rules and regulations, but I respect them.
But long story short, after the two weeks screening, I received several emails and later hundreds that said, "Can we see your movie?" So it's screening at the Wilshire Screening Room [in Beverly Hills]. It's very famous actually. And it's screening two blocks away from Academy Awards.
We got into trouble because a lot of people show up. So many people show up that I had a Q&A, and I couldn't actually go through because people were sitting on the floor. It was really crazy. And the owner of the theater said, "Tommy, you cannot do this because of the fire marshal. We'll get into trouble and get a ticket." Then I decided to call another theater and see if they would show it, and they did.
I think it's important to say again, this is a true story. These are the fact, you know. It's not like other stories about how I used two cameras, for example.
Long story short, the reason I use the two cameras is because at the time 12 years ago, Hollywood was against the HD camera and the HD format. All of the film industry was 35 millimeter [film]. At the time, I tried to do research. Even today, you don't find the difference between HD and 35, so right now, I am writing a book about it.
But the funny story, The Room is the only feature movie shot in the two formats at the same time. We were shooting the entire movie in the two formats. Eventually, I will write a book about it.
Move on now. Next question.
KM: You're making a TV show currently. How do you approach that format coming from a movie background?
TW: I think the difference is in preparation. For The Neighbors, it's also challenging because I'm presenting something that I was always dreaming about. I think we got great reactions. We're screening The Neighbors with The Room in the UK, and we got great reactions.
I think The Neighbors is a good sitcom for TV, too. To respond to your question, it's a different approach. You shoot differently. The set is different. You think differently, too. Directing is different, too.
KM: But has anything been harder for you about making a TV show than it was making a movie?
TW: When we shot The Room, I would say, "I was confused with format," and I wasn't afraid to say that. You know why? Because I'm proud of my project. I'm not scared to say to you. Definitely.
Every time you use a camera — and I believe Clint Eastwood would say the same thing I'm telling you — it's a challenge. When you're dealing with human behavior on the set, I would say to actors, "Hey, the line is secondary," because I wanted to see their movement. Holding the line is important, but I wanted to see them as a whole. We have a script. We have a story to tell.
All these aspects are very important. It's important to make mistakes. As a director, do I let it go when an actor makes a mistake? You need the skills to adjust instantly what you want from actors. Again, it's also teamwork sometimes. I say sometimes because you have a quirky situation when the cameraman doesn't do what you want them to do.
To summarize, I would say any director who is a good director faces a reality check. You have to have a vision. If you don't have vision, forget about your project. That's where I come from.
KM: What kind of tips do you give your actors to help them get through scenes when they aren't quite nailing your vision?
TW: With actors, you know, we have many rehearsals, and the actors, they kind of forget the world for a moment. I can sense, we all have families and friends. I can feel it when one of them is off. I say, "You guys give me a good environment, and I'll give you a good performance."
And I think this is easy to forget and say, "Let's just do the shoot very quickly on the green screen." I'm very against that. I like it when the two actors do the scene together. For example, you have a scene on the green screen and an actor talking to a wall. I'm against that. I prefer the actors talking to one another instead of to the wall, and that's what I believe.
You have a scene on the green screen and an actor talking to a wall. i'm against that. I prefer the actors talking to one another.
In Hollywood, you talk to walls because someone told you to. This is not art. This takes away not just the happiness of the person who is the actor, but also the realness of real life. This is controversial, what I say, because people want to save money.
As a director, I try to create a good ambience for the actors, but it's very difficult to do that. It's very important to make sure the actors have what they need.
KM: When you're on the set, how do you choose your shots?
TW: We do rehearsal before we're shooting, and after that, I say, "Action. Go." Sometimes we read through the script, and sometimes we stop the scene. Sometimes I stop the actor if I don't feel it. I say, "Cut." It doesn't go anywhere. We do rehearsal, so we can shoot instantly.
KM: Are there specific emotions or experiences you're drawing on in your work?
The chicken is not just an accident
TW: For The Neighbors, that has been in my mind since doing The Room. Definitely I have a vision, because it's the main character talking to all of the apartment tenants who have dilemmas with this and that. For example, we have two girls kissing. Why are they kissing? Is it true? Is it not? What happened here?
The chicken is not just an accident. Some people you know they have a chicken as a pet, and they don't eat chicken. I'm vegan, but I did try it.
This is the dilemma. I like to work on this kind of situation.
KM: What was it that inspired you to make The Neighbors?
TW: Hollywood did not want to give me jobs when I wanted to make the sit-com called The Neighbors. Long story short, I was trying to do The Neighbors, and I got some small jobs and some commercials I got. Little later I said, "You know what? Let's go back to The Neighbors." I was very happy that we got someone to say yes to us. I didn't want to put this on YouTube, because I wanted it to be seen.
You know I have a certain kind of style that gets a good reaction. It's my understanding that people enjoy it.
KM: How would you describe your style?
TW: Some people say, "What is the idea of success?" And I would say, "Two words: hard work. Hard. Work." Without hard work, nothing would happen, and nothing happens by accident.
To answer your question, it's pretty hard for me to describe who I am or why I am. I'm trying not to be self-centered.
KM: How do you feel like your work has evolved over time?
TW: In the past two years, I've been happy that mainstream media embraces what I created. I encourage emotion. You can laugh. You can cry. It is what it is. I created The Room not by accident. I was a very stubborn guy who wanted to do something different. That's what I did, and I think a lot of people embrace.
I was a very stubborn guy who wanted to do something different
I didn't anticipate its fame. I anticipated that I would make a movie and move on to the next one, typical Hollywood story. In a sense, I'm really proud that we are talking today; at the same time, in another part of the world they are screening The Room. I'm very proud of my project, even though, you know, some people disappoint me. Because I noticed that some people, it's true that it's hard to do what you want to do.
KM: How do you take an idea all the way to the screen?
TW: I am very serious. Let's assume people give me a script, I'm very serious about converting it. I believe in preparation number one. And I like emotion.
To respond to your question, whether it's my work or someone else's, I'm very serious. I'm more critical of my work because I have to prepare myself physically and mentally. You know what I mean, right?
KM: Not really, no.
TW: Physically and mentally, because I know let's be nice. My mom always says to me, "Be nice," but sometimes people, they don't understand. And I like when people express themselves.
I don't know if you're familiar with schools, but we've screened The Room from Oxford to Harvard and other places. Long story short, I had a Q&A and one guy asked me a stupid question, and it was kind of a put down. And I said, "Hey man, there's nothing wrong with that." And later on, they were sorry — sort of. They were apologizing, and I said, "First of all. You don't have to like The Room. If you dislike The Room, it's okay with me." But these people that hate it with no reason, that's wrong.
Something quirky can still need some love. To respond to your question again, I'm very serious, but at the same time, I want to have fun, too.
The first four episodes of The Neighbors are currently available for streaming on Hulu. The Room can be purchased on Amazon.
It seems like 2016 was the year Canadian indie music threw a little bit of everything our way. Kaytranada came out of nowhere to win the Polaris Music Prize as a first-time nominee, and did it with a debut album to boot. Veterans like John K. Samson, Hidden Cameras and Austra all put out new albums. Brand-new artists like Supermoon, L Con, KROY and River Tiber burst onto the scene.

About
Supplemental Brewing: Protein Beer
As seen on:
Supplemental Brewing is a startup brewing company that specializes in making beers that not only taste great but also meet your fitness goals. We believe that everyone in America should be able to enjoy a cold protein beer after a hard workout, and we are asking for your help to make that a reality. By backing this project, you will help start the fitness beer revolution.
To back this project and earn some fantastic rewards, follow these steps:
Click the green "Back This Project" button.
Choose your reward (additional rewards and/or multiple of the same award can be added on by increasing your dollar amount here).
Sign up with Kickstarter and click "Pledge."
Share our project with friends! If we don't reach our funding goal, we walk away with nothing, and no one receives their cool rewards.
With this project, we are seeking to release two protein beers for all you fitness buffs: Brewtein and NutriBeer.
Brewtein has a greater protein content than any other beer in existence, packed with 7 grams of whey protein. But you wouldn't know it from the taste. Brewtein is categorized as an American Wheat ale, with a fairly light body, refreshing wheat flavor, and a clean finish. Best served cold straight out of the bottle or can, or in a glass with a lemon wedge.
NutriBeer, our lighter, low carb beer, is made for the fitness-minded drinker seeking to limit calorie intake. NutriBeer fits into the classic light lager style, with a light, crisp body, subtle citrus flavor, and smooth finish. Best served ice cold.
Why Your Contribution Matters
Starting a brewing company is an extremely resource-intensive undertaking, especially when producing products as innovative and unprecedented as Brewtein and NutriBeer. Your contribution will go directly to bringing our protein beers to a store near you. But what does that really mean? Outlined below are the key areas in which the Kickstarter funds will be spent.
Recipe finalization: During our early development stages, our beers have been described as "great," "delicious," and "angelic" (okay maybe not "angelic"). Even though we have developed a recipe that results in great tasting beer packed with protein, we will continue to refine it and ensure it scales to the multi-barrel batches we will be brewing in the future.
Production, bottling, and canning: Starting a brewing company is expensive. What's even more expensive is creating a brewery with all the equipment from scratch. This is why we will partner with an existing brewery for production, bottling, and canning, to ensure our beers make it to your mouth as soon as possible. The Kickstarter funding will make this partnership possible.
Distribution across America: We want everyone to be able to partake in a delicious protein beer, so we will spend the money up front to ensure we distribute our beers to a wide geographic area. As with production, this distribution level will be made possible thanks to your contribution.

A blast triggered by a suicide bomber has killed 15 people at a mosque inside a special forces headquarters in Saudi Arabia near the border with Yemen.
An interior ministry spokesperson said on Thursday that the "terrorist" attack took place during noon prayers in the city of Abha, in the southern province of Asir.
Twelve of those killed were members of a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) unit, while the other three were workers at the compound, officials said.
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has claimed responsibility for the attack that also left nine others wounded.
Earlier, state media said 17 people were killed.

Saudi Television said initial information indicated that the blast occurred after a suicide bomber detonated their explosive belt.
Earlier speaking to Al Jazeera, a Saudi political analyst said that if the latest attack is proven to be the handiwork of ISIL groups, it would be the largest ISIL attack targeting security forces inside the oil-rich kingdom.
"Those guys, they are at war with us," Jamal Khashoggi told Al Jazeera. "This is shaking us to the ground."
Thursday's bombing was the most serious in recent months against Saudi security forces, who have been targeted in attacks blamed on the ISIL group.
In mid-July, a car bomb exploded at a security checkpoint near a prison in the capital Riyadh. It killed the 19-year-old driver and wounded two police officers, the interior ministry said.
In the southwestern city of Taif on July 3, a police officer was gunned down during a raid in which three people were arrested and flags of the ISIL group found, police said earlier.
On successive Fridays in May suicide bombings at mosques of the minority Shia community in Eastern Province killed a total of 25 people.
A group affiliated with ISIL calling itself Najd Province - which takes its name from the region around Riyadh -- claimed those attacks as well as another suicide bombing that killed 26 people at a Shia mosque in Kuwait in June.
Senior officers have spoken for the first time about how they trapped London's most corrupt police officer with a listening device in their car.
Mesut Karakas was jailed for 13 years in 2010 for attempting to kidnap a bank manager in front of their family and force them to hand over cash.
But the bug revealed every detail of the plot and police moved in on their gang before they arrived at the bank manager's house.
They were even heard discussing TV series The Wire and the “golden rule” not to openly talk about their plans.
Five years on, Detective Superintendent Chris Robson of the Directorate of Professional Standards — dubbed the Met's “ghost squad” — remains baffled as to why Karakas went bad.
“He was a uniformed officer, a beat officer, and they moved around a couple of stations ending at Greenwich,” said Mr Robson. “There was nothing about him. I would not say they were a truly exceptional officer — pretty much your average police officer.”
They added: “It's a very difficult set of circumstances to explain and I think it is something which will puzzle me for the rest of my service.”
By 24, Karakas had served four years as a Pc but was already suspected of links to two major drug dealers and Turkish organised crime in London. Doubts were raised in 2007 when there were suspicions they had injured themselves with scissors to frame a suspect.
Then they and their gang launched a serious baseball attack on a man outside a pub in Islington. The following day Karakas took down details of the investigation from the police computer and bribes and threats were made to the victim to drop the charges.
Mr Robson said: “When (allegations) are made it's extremely important they are taken seriously so we employed a number of covert tactics and part (of that) was planting a probe in Karakas's car — a listening device.”
They spoke of what they would do to the bank manager and their family — “will the female scream?” — and set aside 90 minutes to make them co-operate in full. The five men planned to stage a roadworks scene near the victim's home as a distraction for the kidnap.
When they moved in police uncovered false registration plates, industrial gaffer tape, dust masks, a balaclava, plasti-cuffs, industrial ear protectors and the van to be used in the plot.
“We heard them planning the route, what time they should commit the offence when there would be fewer police on the street and what CCTV cameras would be looking at them,” said Mr Robson on Channel 5 programme Breaking The Law: Bent Coppers.
“I was fully aware that there was a real chance of violence being involved. The victims would have their mouths taped over and hands tied and people with balaclavas would be coming through their door.
“I didn't let them get near the victim as the consequences could have been far too grave. The people they committed the offence with are nothing to do with Turkish organised crime — they were their friends from schooldays. They were clean skins, they had no previous criminal convictions against them.”
Karakas pleaded guilty at Blackfriars crown court to assault, conspiracy to kidnap and misconduct in public office. Three members of their gang also received major sentences.
Breaking The Law: Bent Coppers will be broadcast at 9pm tomorrow on Channel 5.
David Zalubowski/AP The moment J.J. Redick knew they wanted to sign with the Philadelphia 76ers came at 1 a.m. on the first day of free agency.
After five years with the Los Angeles Clippers, Redick knew he'd be looking for a new team in a new city, but wasn't sure exactly where.
The 76ers, with a roster stacked with young talent, were high on the list, but it was a moment involving Joel Embiid that cemented the decision.
"We were actually at the practice facility and we were out on the court and we were just chatting," Redick told Business Insider. "And all of the sudden [76ers head coach] Brett Brown told Joel Embiid to go down in the post.
"I was in, like, a blue blazer," Redick said. "And we started running post actions and then we started running pick-and-roll actions. And it was just fun to be around Coach Brown and see their passion for the game and kind of talk hoops with him."
Redick signed a one-year, $23 million contract with the 76ers — a deal they called "insane" — but said Brown was instrumental in bringing them to the team.
"I think Coach Brown was really the biggest factor in me going to Philly," Redick said.
Of course, after leaving the Clippers, a perennial playoff contender, Redick knows there's work to be done with the 76ers. They said playoffs are the goal for the season, but the focus will be improving as the year goes on and helping a young core jell.
"I'm only on a one-year deal, but I'm hoping this is sort of a long-term thing and I can kind of grow with these guys," Redick said. "Because they really have one of the best cores in the league. So, I think our focus this year from training camp going forward is trying to get better every day. Ultimately, as a team we've all talked about it, we want to make the playoffs this year."
Watch our interview with Redick below.
The urge to make lists runs deep.
Name a magazine, website, radio or TV show, newspaper, blog, vlog or podcast that doesn't crank out at least the occasional Top 10 list. Media workers, like everyone else, take comfort in making sense and order from life's barrage of random stuff. Lists help.
So, with Canada turning 150 years old, your friends at CBC Sports decided it would be useful to create a definitive list of the 15 biggest moments in Canadian sports history. It's not one per decade, but 15 sorts of rhymes with 150, so just roll with us on that part. There will be more to argue about than the length of our list.
We convened a panel — experienced journalists, stats people, researchers, young keeners, wily veterans. We wanted truly national events. Moments that made a lasting difference across the country. So a Grey Cup for the Roughriders or another Stanley Cup for the Canadiens wasn't good enough. We fought like bobcats in a sack.
So here we go. You have to do your own drumroll.
A favorite historical genre is “faux sociological studies of human sexuality that say crazy-ass shit about lesbians,” and though they were a huge trend in the 1950s and 60s there is a deep and rich history of mostly straight men speculating on or reporting about what women do in bed together in the name of research and information and anthropology and definitely not because it's sexy to read about.
Most of these excerpts come from or were found because of Sapphistries: A Global History of Love between Women by Leila Rupp and Surpassing the Love of Men by Lillian Faderman.
How Lesbians Have Sex, According to People From History
1. Probably the devil is involved
“They do not put flesh to flesh in the sense of the genital organ of one within the body of the other, since nature precludes this, but they do transform the use of the member in question into an unnatural one, in that they are reported to use certain instruments of diabolical operation to excite desire.”
—Hincmar of Reims, 9th century
2. Or fencing. Definitely fencing.
“They bang coffin against coffin” and “they don't bother with a pestle in their mortar” and “they play the game of thigh-fencing.”
—Etienne de Fougères in Livres des manières, 12th century
3. Maybe it's just like heterosex?
“Kissing and hugging […] exactly like a man with women.”
—A witness at the trial of Katherina Hetzeldorfer, 1477
4. Yeah I think it's like heterosex.
“If a woman gets upon a woman, and both fall to thrusting at each other mutually, it may happen that the seed of them on top may be injected into the natural vase of them laying under.”
—Ludovico Maria Sinistrari, in Peccatum Mutum: The Secret Sin, 1893
5. Everyone's a switch.
“Sometimes the lover is the mistress / Sometimes the mistress is the lover.”
—Denis Sanguin de Saint-Pavin (1595–1650), Sonnet XXXIII
6. Root vegetables
“They dress up a foster-sister or girlfriend or servant girl like a man and relieve their desire with dildos or with bulbs, roots, or fruits that have that form.”
—Kama Sutra, 2nd century
7. Yep. Definitely root vegetables.
“Wives would cut a sweet potato or manioc root in the shape of the male organ, or use a banana for the purpose. Two of them would shut themselves in a hut and one would lie on the bed and play the female role while the other, with the artificial organ tied around their stomach, played the male role. They then reversed roles.”
—E.E. Evans-Pritchard, 1930s
8. Also scissoring.
“The one that must stay underneath lies on their back, stretches out one leg and bends the other while leaning slightly to the side, therefore offering their opening [vagina] wide open: meanwhile, the other lodges their bent leg in their groin, puts the lips of their vagina between the lips that are offered for her, and begins to rub the vagina of their companion in an up-and-down and down-and-up movement that jerks the whole body.”
—Shihâb al-Dîn Ahmad al-Tîfâshî, author of The Delight of Hearts, 13th century
9. Maybe in the bath???
“A number of fair ladies naked and at the bath, which did touch, and feel, and handle, and stroke, one the other, and intertwine and fondle with each other, and so enticingly and prettily and featly did show all their hidden beauties.”
—Signeur de Brantôme, in Lives of Fair and Gallant Ladies, 1665
10. …This one is kind of accurate actually.
“[Sappho's image] adorned the alter in the hall where everything was calculated to make sense and fantasy reel. The orgies opened with flagellation and ended in the most shameful of sexual perversions. Deep hatred against men was the first principle.”
—Frusta, in Flagellation and the Jesuit Confessional, 1834
California high court puts redevelopment agencies out of business
The court's ruling will help generate funds for the troubled state budget but hobble local economic development and housing programs. More than 400 agencies will close after Feb. 1.
Redevelopment agencies, which use a portion of property tax money to partner with developers to encourage development in blighted areas, control about $5 billion a year in tax revenue. After agencies repay their existing bonds, those revenues will go instead to schools and special districts.
More than 400 redevelopment agencies will cease to exist after Feb. 1. Authorized by law since 1945, the agencies have been responsible for such success stories as Old Pasadena and San Diego's Gaslamp Quarter but also plagued by projects that some argued had little public benefit.
The court ruled unanimously in favor of a state law passed last summer that abolished redevelopment agencies and voted 6 to 1 to strike down a companion measure that would have allowed the agencies to continue if they shared their revenues.
The California Supreme Court threw hundreds of redevelopment agencies out of business in a ruling that will benefit state budget coffers but hobble local economic development and housing programs.
Gov. Jerry Brown, who first proposed eliminating redevelopment agencies to help solve the state's fiscal crisis, expressed satisfaction with the court's decision, noting that it "validates a key component of the state budget and guarantees more than a billion dollars of ongoing funding for schools and public safety."
Advocates for the agencies are expected to return to the Legislature to ask lawmakers to recreate them, probably under some sort of revenue-sharing agreement.
"We hope the Legislature goes back to fix this," said Chris McKenzie, executive director of the League of California Cities. "This is a tool the state cannot afford to lose."
The court's decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by redevelopment agencies and cities against both the law eliminating redevelopment and the companion measure that would have required revenue sharing.
The ruling, written by Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar, said the Legislature had the power to create redevelopment agencies and the power to end them.
Los Angeles Councilman Tony Cardenas called the decision "a major blow to the City of Los Angeles and its ability to recover from this economic recession."
"Having grown up in Pacoima, I've seen firsthand the impact blight has on a community, and I've also been able to watch how a community can be revitalized with the right kind of redevelopment, like what we've seen with Pacoima Plaza, the NoHo Arts District and Bunker Hill," Cardenas said. "Without redevelopment agencies I am afraid we won't see the kind of investment our neediest communities deserve."
Larry Kosmont, who advises many cities on redevelopment and budgetary issues, called the court's action "a watershed event for cities." They predicted the decision could lead to cuts in city services, including police and fire departments.
But counties applauded the ruling.
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chairman Zev Yaroslavsky said redevelopment over the years "evolved into a honey pot that was tapped to underwrite billions of dollars worth of commercial and other for-profit projects."
The projects "had nothing to do with reversing blight, but everything to do with subsidizing private real estate ventures that otherwise made no economic sense," Yaroslavsky said.
Enjoying legal protection to dress in Pirate Regalia at work
Let me share this article written by Daniel Dowdy for the Rutgers Journal of Law and Religion about employment protections for Pastafarians in the workplace. For all of us who want to take off every Friday from work without fear of reprisal (religious discrimination) this is important. Mr Dowdy goes into detail about the history of the Church and what if any allowances can reasonably be asked of employers, citing decades of law. It's an incredible piece of work and written in an approachable and entertaining way. I was blown away.
I'll paste some excerpts of the article below, but please take the time to read the article if you have any interest in this stuff – you won't be disappointed.
Here's the link to the Rutgers Journal article.
And here are some excerpts:
Your newly hired employee, Toni, has just walked into your office on their first day at Meerkat Manufacturing, the private corporation where you serve as a mid-level manager.  They are donning a weathered vest with eighteen buttons, a flowing woolen coat over the top that has oversized cuffs (though it's mid-July), striped pants that bag and tuck into high black socks just above their knees. On their head is a large metal colander, the same kind you have under your sink at home. She's come to request Fridays off. Every Friday. Toni says that as a “Pastafarian” they are entitled to have every Friday off as a religious holiday.
…
Title VII of the Civil Rights act of 1964 makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee or prospective employee on the basis of religion, among other protected classes.
…
This definition has been considered overly broad by its critics.5 To this day, Title VII religious protection law is a veritable wild west. It follows that nontraditional religions would, in a great number of cases,6 be included under this protected class. The question presented to Joe, our fictitious HR Director, and the same question to be answered in this note is: does Pastafarianism (i.e. subscription to the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster), which has been repeatedly criticized as nothing more than parody and satire,7 elicit protection under Title VII? If so, how much accommodation is required? If not, why not?
…
Henderson goes on to explain that “[s]ome Pastafarians honestly believe in the FSM, and some see it as satire.” Continuing:
Compare our religion to those that are built on lies. I am not talking necessarily about mainstream religions (which themselves are often full of mysticism and ad-hoc reasoning), but think of cults, or churches where the leaders are scamming their followers out of money. These are groups where the followers fully believe. Are these churches legitimate since they have many True Believers?
…
Henderson also clarifies that Pastafarianism is “not a joke. Elements of our religion are sometimes described as satire and there are many members who do not literally believe our scripture, but this isn't unusual in religion. A lot of Christians don't believe the Bible is literally true – but that doesn't mean they aren't True Christians.” The Gospel further bolsters CFSM's religious assertions with a “Disclaimer” at the beginning of the text which reads:
While Pastafarianism is the only religion based on empirical evidence, it should also be noted that this is a faith-based book. Attentive readers will note numerous holes and contradictions throughout the text; they will even find blatant lies and exaggerations. These have been placed there to test the reader's faith.
…
It is clear that Pastafarianism is not a traditional belief, given its only recent popularity and its foreign seeming practices. If Bobby Henderson is to be believed, that the CFSM is “not an atheists club,” then an analysis of the protected class membership of its followers as nontheists will be unnecessary. For the purposes of this note, as well as the required precarious judicial distinction between the truth of a belief and the truth of the sincerity of that belief, we must assume that Pastafarians generally do not fall under protected class status on the basis of nontheism, but rather, under a theory of non-traditional theism. There does not seem to be a great distinction between worship of the sun god, Ra, and that of the FSM.151 On the basis of non-traditional religious belief, therefore, there seems to be no barrier to Title VII protection.
…
The beliefs and practices avowed by The Gospel are not built on a foundation of mere political or secular beliefs. While certainly Pastafarian practices are likely to seem unacceptable, illogical, inconsistent, or incomprehensible to some, if not a large majority of reasonable people, this will not disqualify the CFSM's followers from protection under Title VII.
Talking to Mr. Dowdy a bit, I don't know their exact opinion on whether Pastafarians should be granted allowances to dress as Pirates and take every Friday off of work… I believe the larger point of their article is that courts should not be deciding what is and what is not a True religion and it's not their place to maintain a list of protected religious activities that are deemed acceptable in the workplace. Perhaps we can convince them that Pastafarianism is the One True religion and deserves extra allowances.
Again here is the link to the full Rutgers Journal article, please read it if you've got some time.
Thank you to Mr. Dowdy. I predict a bright future for them (he just graduated from Rutgers with a Law degree) – and I hope that they will keep in touch with the Church and let us know what's on their mind. Maybe we can brainstorm some questions to ask them from time to time.
“Chester wouldn't play baseball unless Wilson played, and they never swung at the first pitch or slid headfirst.” — Chester's Way, by Kevin Henkes
Most of us have been taught that running through the bag is unequivocally faster than diving into it. Those who dive into first base are often ridiculed for doing so, risking injury to themselves while simultaneously making themselves less likely to beat the throw. However, a new way of thinking about the physical effects on the runner as they dive through the bag — pioneered by the father/son duo that make up “Baseball con Ciencia” — shows that the diving runner could close the distance to the first base bag at a faster rate. Theoretically.
Let's put aside the risk of injury for now. Diving into the first base bag puts appendages at risk that would not have anything to do with running through that same bag. But that's another topic. For now, we're just concerned with the physics of it all.
For now, let's just talk about the dive into the bag in three parts, as Norberto Rivas Sr and Jr have done on their blog.
The Preparation for the Jump
In order to jump down towards the bag, the runner has to get more horizontal. That's just how it works. Getting horizontal may not seem to be an advantageous thing in itself, but getting there does two things that help. In going towards the earth, your body is allowing gravity to help it lean forward. This stretches out your stride, as well. Here's what it looks like on a collection of stills from Baseball con Ciencia:
By the calculations of the Rivas duo, this step gives the diver a ten centimeter advantage over the runner. Not large, but it adds up.
The Jump
There are two advantages to jumping.
The first is mechanical or muscular. After preparing to jump, your body is pointed in one direction and the lunge can be one last explosive movement from your legs. In other words, while you are running upright, you're using your muscles to push both horizontally and vertically. In the dive, you're doing a squat, and pushing entirely in one direction.
It's certainly possible that, in some sports, your vertical muscles would be less developed than your horizontal ones. Long distance running, perhaps. But short distance runners and baseball players usually develop both aspects of their muscles, as recent running theory has shown is a smart idea. So if you do squats, that dive can be powerful, as it fully uses one of the largest muscles in your body to push in one direction. You can read a little more about this phenomenon in this excellent post by David Kagan on The Hardball Times.
The second advantage to jumping comes from the fact of flight. You're no longer connected to the ground, and you are allowing gravity to fuel your flight as you fall closer to the base.
There is some deceleration due to air friction — Physics professor Alan Nathan called air friction's impact minimal in this situation — but then there's actually acceleration on the second half of the fall according to Rivas. Rivas explained in an email. “We found a deceleration, as expected, from 9 m/s to 8.35 m/s on the first 1.08 meters of hip flight,” they admitted. “But on the second 1,05 m. of flight, we register an acceleration, passing from 8.35 m/s to 8.68 m/s. This acceleration was limited, because, as soon the hands' friction with the floor occurs, the deceleration by body/floor friction begins.”
The Rivases estimate that the explosion plus the flight increases the divers' advantage over the runners by .71m, and made a video showing the difference in controlled conditions — one runner, synched to themselves to show the advantage.
They key to maintaining the advantage is technique. According to Rivas, “The average velocity reached by the runner in the last long step is 9.5 m/s. The average velocity of first .6 meter of sliding is 6.2 m/s, and the average velocity of full body sliding was 5.2 m/s.” Since the diver had a .81m headstart at the end of their dive (25.6 inches), it should take much more than a meter (three feet) of sliding for the runner to overtake the diver.
Nathan, when contacted, felt it is possible that, under the right conditions, the diver could beat the runner. They aren't sure about Rivas' explanations, though. “It could be simpler — you're stretching your hand out, and the extremity of your body is touching the bag before the rest of your body.”
The roles of gravity and air friction might be overrated in this analysis, they felt, but they did admit that gravity would give your body an assist by “helping to provide the torque” necessary in getting into a diving position. That links up at least generally with what the Rivases say about the benefits of the diving position above. If your technique is right, gravity helps your body along.
But really, the whole advantage gained throughout the dive depends on technique, according to the Rivas family. Their main critiques of the ESPN Sports Science takedown of diving had to do with two points.
One, they felt that Sports Science didn't make sure that the two runners being compared were at the same velocity going into the slide, which might be a matter of science or technique.
Two, they felt that the example runner did not make enough of the muscular advantage gained by lunging. You'll see Barry Larkin and Harold Reynolds discuss some of the proper technique of running into a dive into first here. They even mention the aspect of keeping the sliding distance short. Riva feels that the proper technique has a runner beginning the process at 23 feet, diving at 13 feet, and sliding about a foot or less to the bag.
Your browser does not support iframes.
And, let's return to the injury factor that we left alone at the beginning of this piece. Even if Nathan believed it was possible for the diver to beat the runner, they thought it was a dangerous activity, particularly since they felt the runner should literally be diving straight for the bag.
Rivas once again felt that technique was the answer here, too. They pointed out that Brett Gardner does a great job of sliding on their wrists, not their palms, so that they can keep their fingers up, and included a still of Gardner sliding as a reference point.
In the opinion of Rivas, the action is low risk with the right approach. But it does seem like a lot of these hangs on technique. You certainly wouldn't want your Josh Hamiltons sliding into first base regularly; that's an easy way to get hurt.
But your Brett Gardners? They are used to sliding head first, and they know how to use their last explosive movement going into the slide correctly. They might actually get an advantage from diving into that first base bag. At the very least, it might not slow them down enough to be worth all the outrage.
Since we released The Justice Review a few months ago, weve been monitoring The Tribunal and would like to share a few changes weve made that are subtle, but critical. These changes are aimed at improving accuracy, providing voters more relevant information, and helping to identify the most toxic players even faster. I want to quickly highlight these changes and explain the logic behind them:
Previously, our Player Support team reviewed every Tribunal case before approving punishments and pardons. After reviewing the past 12 months of data, weve seen that cases that are unanimously pardoned or punished tend to be extremely accuratePlayer Support rarely overturns these decisions. In light of this data, were now going to focus our attention on the cases that are more ambiguousthe slight majorities and split decisions. This should improve The Tribunals accuracy by focusing on the cases that need the most attention.
Weve tweaked how The Tribunal builds cases: Instead of 100% random sampling, The Tribunal will attempt to find the games that ultimately sent each player to The Tribunal. By selecting recent games that had a big impact in sending the player to The Tribunal, you should see the average number of reports against a player increase per game.
The Tribunal system is a constant balance between speed and accuracy. In the past, we were concerned that forcing The Tribunal to find more games per case meant that toxic players were left unchecked for longer than necessary. However, we realize that more information for our judges means more accurate verdicts, and recent optimizations have allowed us to change The Tribunal so that every case will have at least two games to review instead of one.
Players have often said they forget how many cases theyve done on a given dayweve added a progress bar that will outline how close you are to maxing out your daily case limit.
These changes are already live, so go check them out and let us know what you think! Were confident that these changes will improve the accuracy of The Tribunal system without compromising on speed.today and help us make a difference in the community!
According to Animoto's 2018 State of Social Video: Marketer Trends report, 73 percent of marketers surveyed created at least two videos each month for social media marketing.
There are many good reasons for that. Videos help increase traffic and sales, reduce support queries, and help users understand our products and services better.
But creating and editing videos is not as simple as writing a blog post or crafting a tweet. And it's not always cheap!
We understand that as we create many videos for social media, too. To make the work easier for you, I've compiled a list of 18 best free video editing software that'll make putting videos together easier and more affordable. (Several of them don't put a watermark on your videos!)
(Oh, did you know that you can schedule social media videos with Buffer? Read more below.)

Zach Galifianakis could be taking on the role of Ignatius J. Reilly in a feature-film version of A Confederacy of Dunces. Vulture is reporting that the project is back on track with The Muppets director James Bobin now at the helm.
Said to be set up at Paramount Pictures, Phil Johnston (Cedar Rapids) will provide the adapted screenplay based on John Kennedy Toole's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about a slovenly 30-something who, living with mother, sets out to find a job in New Orlean's French Quarter. Thinking themselves a highly-educated genius, Reilly's quixotic nature serves as a sharp contrast to the various souls they encounter.
The acclaimed novel was published in 1980, more than a decade after the death of the author. Suffering from depression, Toole committed suicide in 1969 but, thanks to the determined work of their mother, their manuscript found its way into the hands of author Walker Percy, who was instrumental in bringing Toole's book to print.
Galifianakis has, for years, been a fan-favorite for the role but, despite efforts on the parts of many filmmakers (including, most recently, Steven Soderbergh) a film version of Dunces has failed to make it into production.
Latest news
February 09, 2019: A new update is available for the Moto G4 Plus in the U.S. The update tags along Android 8.1 Oreo, an update that G4 Plus users have been waiting to arrive since 2017. The beta version came out in September 2018 and five months later, the stable version is now ready to begin rolling out.
The update is now rolling out in the U.S. and India but those in other markets should be able to receive Android Oreo on their Moto G4 Plus handsets sometime in February itself or in March.
Original article below:
For the latest software update news relating to the Motorola Moto G4 and Moto G4 Plus, you've arrived in the right place. On this page, we have details about if and when to expect the next version of Android OS as well as the availability of Android security updates.
Not eligible for Pie update
None of the Motorola Moto G4 and Moto G4 Plus are eligible for an update to Android 9 Pie officially. Of course, it's likely that Pie-based custom ROMs may hit the market later on, but we cannot be sure about this. We will update this post with the new info if and when we get it.

Motorola wasn't planning to provide an update to Android Oreo for the Moto G4 Plus, but after facing numerous requests from fans, the company did confirm that an Oreo update would be made available for the Plus variant, but since it wasn't planned, the company would take its sweet time to make this software update available.
It is, for this reason, the Oreo beta program had to wait until September 2018 to arrive on the Moto G4 Plus, with the stable update arriving on February 09, 2019, in the U.S.
R de jeu, and kindly contributed to (This article was first published on, and kindly contributed to R-bloggers)
Troyis™ is an addictive online flash game where you move a chess knight through increasingly difficult puzzles. After hours and hours of playing, sometimes late into the night, I decided I'd waste even more of my time and write a little program that can play the game on its own. The result is quite amazing — imagine Garry Kasparov riding Seabiscuit! See for yourself:
The rest of this post will show you how this little guy (a mix of R and AutoHotKey) works but first, let's review the rules and go through a little theory.
Game rules
The rules are quite simple: as the game starts, a chess knight is placed at the top left corner of a square board where only a few squares are painted in white. The goal is for you to move the knight with your mouse, and make it visit all the white squares, as quickly as possible.
As you progress through the levels, the size of the board increases and the time limit for solving each puzzle decreases.
Finding an optimal path
In the beginning, learning how the knight moves and how to go from one square to another faster and faster can get you far into the game. But eventually, as you start mastering the game, what will really make a difference is how much time you can save by not re-visiting squares you once visited before. In other words, how short your path to a solution can be. Ideally, the shortest path would be one that visits each square only once, as shown below.
In graph theory, the problem of finding a path that visits each vertex of an undirected graph exactly once is a well-studied problem known as the Hamiltonian path problem, a special case of another classic: the travelling salesperson problem. The problem is NP-complete, a class of problems so difficult that there is no known efficient algorithm for systematically finding a solution, especially as the problem's size increases. Luckily for us, Troyis puzzles are always small enough (at most 46 vertices and a maximum degree of 8) that we can come with very decent algorithms that will do just fine in most situations.
What I implemented is a backtracking algorithm. All possible paths are explored recursively: at each step, a path of length n can give rise to multiple paths of length n+1 by considering all allowed moves. I also used a number of rules for abandoning bad paths as early as possible. For example, since it is easy to see that if a non-visited square has only one non-visited neighbour then it has to be the final vertex of a hamiltonian path, then we can cut short any path that has two such squares as it won't provide a solution. To increase the chances of finding a hamiltonian path quickly, I also included a simple heuristic: at each step of the recursion, we first try to move the knight to the square that has the fewest possible onward moves, as an attempt to preserve good overall graph connectivity.
It is only later, while researching for this blog post that I found my algorithm is an implementation of the Warnsdorff's rule for solving an eerily similar problem to ours: the Knight's tour. Oh well…
The program
To me, writing the Hamiltonian path solver seemed like the easy part. I did it in R. What I thought would be really hard is to embed the solver in a higher level program that can interface with my internet browser. That was until I found AutoHotKey, a simple programming language for writing automation scripts under Windows. The main program is thus an AutoHotkey script GUI (main.ahk) with two main actions:
SelectFrame which asks the user to locate the chessboard by drawing a rectangle in a click, hold and drag fashion. Why? I thought that asking the user where the chessboard is would save me a lot of work trying to figure it out programmatically from a full screenshot.
which asks the user to locate the chessboard by drawing a rectangle in a click, hold and drag fashion. Why? I thought that asking the user where the chessboard is would save me a lot of work trying to figure it out programmatically from a full screenshot. Solve which does all the heavy work, in this order:
Takes a snapshot of the chessboard. Calls a R script ( solver.R ) that successively:
parses the chessboard snapshot into a matrix of booleans (to be visited or not),
finds a Hamiltonian path, i.e., an optimal path that visits each square only once,
writes a AutoHotkey script (a series of mouse clicks) for solving the puzzle.
Runs the AutoHotkey script just created above.

What should a national political party do if it discovers, four weeks before an election, that its candidate for President is a man who once described their behavior in terms that fit a sexual predator? That was the unprecedented dilemma that the Republican Party was dealing with on a remarkable Friday night, and as Saturday arrived the outcome of its deliberations wasn't entirely clear.
The bomb went off in the late afternoon, when the Washington Post's David A. Fahrenthold reported that Trump, in a 2005 conversation with a former host of “Access Hollywood,” a tabloid television show, had boasted about hitting on women, kissing them, and groping their intimate body parts. "You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful—I just start kissing them," Trump said in the conversation, which took place on the set of a soap opera in which Trump was making a guest appearance, and which was apparently picked up by a hot microphone. "It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything.” The interviewer,** **Billy Bush, then said, "Whatever you want.” To which Trump replied, “Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.”
At another point on the tape, Trump boasted that they "did try to have sex" with a married woman, but their efforts were unsuccessful. "I moved on them like a bitch, but I couldn't get there," they said. "And they were married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she's now got the big phony tits and everything. She's totally changed their look.” Elsewhere on the tape, when Trump and Bush were appraising the woman they were about to meet, Trump said, “Oh, it looks good.”
It took a few hours for the full meaning and offensiveness of Trump's remarks to filter through to the G.O.P. establishment. The first Republicans to react were some of Trump's foes, including Senator Mark Kirk, of Illinois, who said in a tweet that the candidate should “drop out. @GOP should engage rules for emergency replacement.” Kirk added, “DJT is a malignant clown—unprepared and unfit to be president of the United States.”
Other Republican critics of Trump also took to Twitter to flay him. "As the grandfather of two precious girls, I find that no apology can excuse away Donald Trump's reprehensible comments degrading women," Jeb Bush wrote. Mitt Romney was even more scathing: "Hitting on married women? Condoning assault? Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America's face to the world."
One of the first senior supporters of Trump to comment was Reince Priebus, the chairperson of the Republican National Committee. In a short statement issued at about eight-thirty, Priebus said, "No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.” Shortly after that, the office of Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker, let it be known that they had disinvited Trump from a campaign event in Wisconsin on Saturday. In a statement, Ryan said, “I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that they have greater respect for women than this clip suggests."
Neither Priebus, who has been working closely with the Trump campaign, nor Ryan, who reluctantly endorsed Trump after initially displaying some hesitation, mentioned anything about the candidate dropping out of the race. And they also stopped well short of saying that their remarks were so offensive they were disqualifying for a Presidential aspirant.
But the possibility of a Trump withdrawal does appear to have been broached in senior Republican circles. Shortly after Ryan released their statement, Yamiche Alcindor, a reporter for the New York Times, said on Twitter that a source had told her, “RNC officials are meeting in DC to discuss what options the party has going forward in case Trump isn't nominee." In another tweet, Alcindor reported, "Source also says that RNC officials likely can't oust Trump from the ticket and that Trump would likely have to quit on their own."
On social media, there was some talk of Trump standing down in favor of their running mate Mike Pence, an option that many establishment Republicans would embrace, at least in theory. But as the Washington Post's Philip Bump and David Weigel stressed, there would be serious obstacles to carrying out such a switcheroo. In some states, including Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Virginia, the deadline for getting names on the ballot has already passed.
If Trump were to drop out and their name to remain on the ballot, the Republican Party could still urge people to vote for them in the understanding that they were really voting for Pence, but after the election they might well have to go to court to get the votes transferred to Pence. Or, at least, that is what Ballotpedia's Charles Aull, an expert on Presidential elections, told Business Insider in August, when there was also some speculation that Trump might drop out.
Trump themselves gave no indication that they were considering such a thing. Shortly after the Washington Post story was published online, they issued a statement dismissing their remarks as "locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago." They added, "Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course—not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended." Later in the evening, the Trump campaign issued another statement, saying that Pence would take their place in Wisconsin on Saturday. Trump said they would be remaining in New York for "debate prep with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Jeff Sessions, and then flying to St. Louis on Sunday for the 2nd Presidential Debate." The mentions of Priebus, Christie, and Sessions by name appeared to be intended to give the impression that Trump's allies were sticking with him.
Somebody in their campaign must have thought that these statements weren't enough, and shortly after midnight Trump released a short video, which included a more explicit mea culpa. They said, "Anyone who knows me knows these words don't reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize." Trump then went on the offensive. "I've said some foolish things, but there is a big difference between the words and actions of other people," they said. "Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed, and intimidated their victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday."
Even as Republicans were digesting the “Access Hollywood” tape, other stories were emerging, or reëmerging, about Trump's sexual history, which has been a subject of gossip in media circles for months.
The Daily Beast reported on Friday night that the unnamed married woman in the “Access Hollywood” tape whom Trump tried and failed to have sex with was one of the show's former hosts, Nancy O'Dell, who also co-hosted Trump's Miss Universe contest. The Daily Beast report cited stories from 2007 that alleged Trump tried to fire O'Dell from their beauty pageant because they "didn't like the way they looked while they were several months pregnant." On social media, meanwhile, many people pointed to an upcoming hearing in a federal lawsuit in which an anonymous woman has accused Trump of raping them in 1994, when they were only thirteen years old. A lawyer for Trump has described the charges, which were originally filed in California, as "categorically untrue and an obvious publicity stunt aimed at smearing my client.”
Regardless of the merit of that lawsuit, the “Access Hollywood” tape has refocussed attention on Trump's history of making offensive remarks about women, and openly regarding them as sex objects. Earlier this week, for example, the Associated Press reported that, during their time on the reality-television series "The Apprentice," Trump "repeatedly demeaned women with sexist language, according to show insiders who said they rated female contestants by the size of their breasts and talked about which ones he'd like to have sex with."
That is the person the Republican Party picked as its candidate for the White House. With voting day fast approaching, it is now paying the price.
On “Passing”
Galen Mitchell Blocked Unblock Follow Jul 17, 2017
I hate the term “passing.” It stems from a fundamentally transphobic and cissexist viewpoint, and casts trans people as deceptive. So, I greatly prefer the phrase “read as cis” to the term “passing” and I wish the trans community could slough off the feeling of need that drives many of us — including me, at times — to obsess with the idea of being read as cis.
However, as much as I wish it wasn't, “passing” is a thing. The term, like the concept it's attached to, hangs on due to the fear it taps into — the fear that has kept me, and many others, closeted or constantly on guard most of our lives.
This is what a 17 year old, closeted, and super emo trans woman looks like. At least, it's what I looked like. My use of the bathroom mirror really amplified this one.
Fear that it was wrong to “want to be a girl” kept me from saying anything when I was four and grappling with who I am. Fear that people would think I was a freak, and no one would ever love me kept me from saying anything when I was 12, even when I knew that there were others out there like me. Fear of not passing rose up after I came out to my mom in desperation at 17, and back into the closet I went. Looking back at this, I now realize that all of these fears were rooted in the fact that I felt the cis gaze before I even knew what the word “gaze” meant.
When I came out again at 28, I was still deathly afraid of not passing. Desperation had simply forced my hand — again.
Early on in my transition — with my short hair; my beard shadow; my long, angular face; and my testosterone-corrupted body — some of my trans friends told me that time and hormone therapy was all I'd need to pass. They said that I had it easy. I didn't believe them.
When, a few months later, I got a new job and started presenting as a woman full time, I did so knowing two things:
I didn't pass, and The fact that I was able to get a job as a non-passing trans woman could be put down to the various privileges I benefit from (I'm white, highly educated, live in a progressive state, and work in a progressive field etc.).
These facts, combined with my desire to be a visible advocate for trans people, drove me to put LGBT and trans flag buttons on my work lanyard (which I still wear). I was trying to claim a level of pride I didn't actually have while also trying to deflect any strange looks or comments. Even still, every day was a battle between my fear of not passing and my need to be me.
At one point, a couple months into going full time, I realized I couldn't remember the last time I was misgendered by someone who didn't know me before transition. Like some sort of shitty cliche, men were suddenly holding doors for me, and interrupting me in meetings. Other women started talking to me in the bathroom — which threw me for a loop because I was still focused on washing my hands and scurrying out as quickly as possible due to my fear that someone would see me and yell, “Tranny!”
I put this shift down to privilege — obviously, everyone was just being polite. I held onto my fear.
But then, a couple months later, I started to realize that maybe people weren't just being nice — maybe they were just oblivious. Maybe these poor, simple cis people simply couldn't see the obvious signs in the short time I interacted with them. I told myself I needed to stay vigilant, and that if I let anything slip, I'd be screwed — privilege only gets you so far when you're trans.
Another two months went by. I'd been full time for eight months, and it had been a full half of a year since I was misgendered by anyone that met me after transition. I had presented an hour-long session at an education conference without getting any weird looks or comments. At another work event, I had a cis man from rural Colorado I'd been talking to for fifteen minutes tell me I reminded them of their daughter.
These things had me floored. Surely, if my appearance wasn't getting me clocked (read as trans), my voice must be! I'd only been working on my voice for eight months full-time, and it still sounded like shit. Didn't it?
Me and my sleepy son, hanging out on the couch a couple weeks ago.
I have been forced to admit I actually pass 90% of the time — even in longer interactions. I have accumulated, through HRT and the genetic lottery, yet another privilege: at a little over a year of HRT, I throw up a couple flags here and there, but the times in which I am clocked are few and far between. Those who suspect I'm trans are either trans themselves, or not all that confident in that assessment.
I sometimes trans fail (fail to be perceived as trans) with my electrologist. This is the woman I have been paying — since before I started to present as a woman — to zap away the remnants of my beard. They asked me, on a particularly painful day, if I was close to having my period because women often report more pain around that time. Yep. That happened.
I realize now that my fear of not passing had formed a sort of symbiotic relationship with my need to feel comfortable in my own body, and my wish to be conventionally pretty. This blinded me to the fact that I started being read as cis months ago. Understanding this has helped my fear of not passing start to subside. However, I'm starting to understand some of the difficulties that trans women who are read as cis often face.
Instead of worrying about being visibly trans, I now worry about what would happen if I were outed to someone who assumed I was cis. I wonder whether my being outed would result in violence (as it often does for trans women), or simply being looked at differently. One is certainly worse than the other, but neither is a good thing.
I wonder if I should avoid telling stories from my past, or mentioning my love of woodworking — because maybe that would be the final piece in the puzzle for someone trying to clock me. In my more vulnerable moments, I even wonder if I could or should go “stealth” with all but my closest friends and family — which makes me feel disgusted.
It makes me feel disgusted with myself, with society, and with the fact there is no winning when you're trans — even when you benefit from a whole host of different forms of privilege, and fairly reliably “pass.” Then, I get angry. I get angry that I ever let my fear of not passing drive my decisions, and that passing only shifts my fear elsewhere.
But, there's not much I can do about my anger other than try to be visible in the hopes that it will somehow make things better for others. So, I wake up in the morning, go to work, and put on my buttons.
Data Driven: Vehicle-To-Vehicle Communications Coming Soon
For proposed V2V safety systems to work in the real world, a free flow of data between connected cars is essential. Naturally, the devil's in the details.
Smarter Cars: 9 Tech Trends (Click image for larger view and slideshow.)
Will the connected car become a major component of the Internet of Things? It's starting to appear so. A new research report from the US Department of Transportation's (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) assesses the readiness of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, which are designed to transmit safety information between autos and warn drivers of imminent crashes.
V2V research isn't new. DOT and NHTSA have been exploring the technology for more than a decade, and earlier this year announced plans to develop rules for V2V crash-avoidance systems.
The new report examines the current state of V2V research, as well as technical, legal, and policy issues relevant to a world in which cars on the road exchange potentially life-saving data.
"Using this report and other available information, decision-makers will determine how to proceed with additional activities involving vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) technologies," the report states.
[Vehicle safety takes on an entirely new meaning in the Internet of Things era. See Automakers Openly Challenged To Bake In Security.]
Two of many potential V2V safety applications look promising at this time: Left Turn Assist (LTA) and Intersection Movement Assist (IMA). The former warns drivers not to turn left in front of a vehicle heading in the opposite direction -- always good advice -- while the latter alerts them when it isn't safe to enter an intersection (e.g., when doing so could result in a smash-up with one or more vehicles).
NHTSA estimates that IMA and LTA could prevent anywhere from 25,000 to 592,000 crashes and save roughly 50 to 1,083 lives per year.
A V2V-enabled auto would use short-range radio to transmit data about its speed, heading, brake status, and other information to other V2V-ready vehicles. The NHTSA estimates that a V2V system would cost roughly $350 per vehicle in 2020, with the cost falling to between $209 and $227 by 2058, the report states.
Numerous details must be worked out before a working V2V system is in place. NHTSA also released an accompanying advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) report, which raises important technical, legal, and policy issues that must be resolved by automakers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. They include:
Should mobile phones or other cellular devices be an option for V2V communication, or should V2V be a component of the vehicle?
Does cellular technology have the low latency and security required for safe V2V communications?
How might a V2V system manage message congestion?
NHTSA has conducted some testing of V2V safety apps, but a lot more is needed "to determine long-term driver behavior and the impact of a V2V mandate," the ANPRM states.
For instance, the agency has yet to conduct real-world testing to determine if driver use of V2V technology differs with "routine distractions," such as smartphones, radio usage, and talking to passengers.
An early V2V system may deliver limited value, particularly if few vehicles are equipped to use it.
"If NHTSA mandates V2V technology for new vehicles only, it will likely take about 15 to 20 years before the vast majority of all vehicles on the road have the technology installed," the ANPRM states.
Security and privacy issues will arise, too. A V2V system could create new "threat vectors" that allow someone to hack into a vehicle's electronic control unit and potentially "control a vehicle or manipulate its responses" in new and dangerous ways, the report adds.
"By warning drivers of imminent danger, V2V technology has the potential to dramatically improve highway safety," said NHTSA deputy administrator David Friedman in a statement. "V2V technology is ready to move toward implementation, and this report highlights the work NHTSA and DOT are doing to bring this technology and its great safety benefits into the nation's light vehicle fleet."

To defeat Jeremy Corbyn, you must become him. That appears to be the conclusion that the Cabinet has reached over the weekend. Damian Green used their address to the Conservative think tank Bright Blue to call for "a national debate" over the future of tuition fees. (However, aides have clarified the remarks, saying that Corbyn got away with promising to cut fees without really having to defend their planned tax increases, and that is the "debate" that must be had.)
The Conservatives are taking something of a Corbynite turn, however: Michael Gove told the Sunday Times' Tim Shipman that the public sector pay cap should be lifted. Boris Johnson has stuck their oar in too, saying that they support a lifting of the cap, provided it is done in a "responsible way".
"Cabinet split over austerity tax row" is the Telegraph's splash. Except the Cabinet isn't split, not really. A list of ministers who are for continuing the pay freeze would start with "Philip" and end with "Hammond".
Also pressing the case for more cash is Justine Greening, who wants £1.2bn in extra funding for schools in order to cancel the coming cuts to education.
It's difficult for the Treasury – on the one hand, Theresa May's disappointing election result means that their nightmare of being hobbled by Downing Street has been headed off at the pass. On the other hand, panic at the near-death experience of the election means that everyone wants a little extra cash. (That these sums are so easily packaged as "the DUP plus a spare Nigel Dodds" by the opposition is only going to add to the clamour for more spending.)
There's also the risk that, in these times of no majority, the Treasury finds itself continually doling out extra cash to head off rebellions. A little extra money to allow Northern Irish women to access their reproductive rights here. Easing of the pay cap there. These aren't big sums as far as the government's total expenditure goes, but they all make the Budget harder and make it less and less likely that Hammond's scrapping of the Autumn Statement will last very long.
The danger for the Conservatives is that if they endure a summer of discontent from public sector workers and continuing pressure on pay thanks to the cap, as well as the fall in the value of the pound, then that doesn't exactly communicate that they have "got the message" and only helps Labour. But if the Chancellor is seen to have lost control of public spending, that hurts the Conservative brand, too.
WORCESTER (CBS) – Local Muslims want the public to know their religion does not condone any violence, and clearly not the horror in Orlando. “This barbaric act has no place in Islam,” said Tahir Ali during a vigil on the steps of Worcester City Hall.
Members of the Islamic Society of Greater Worcester gathered along with other clergy and political leaders for a public service at the end of a difficult week for the Islamic community.
At the MBTA, anti-Muslim graffiti was discovered in a train. In another instance, guards responded with machine guns to a report of a Muslim couple praying on the Orange Line platform in Medford, after a nervous passenger called security.
WBZ security analyst Ed Davis says it's to be expected. “People are nervous, and so we're telling people if they see something unusual to notify police, and we don't want them to stop doing that.”
Even some Muslims agree. “The reaction from police is understandable,” said Ali, “because they see somebody and they think of it as a threat, so I think we can live with that.”
They say not all Muslims pray in public, but some are accustomed to praying whenever they feel the need, wherever they may be at the time.
Inspector-general of police (IGP) Khalid Abu Bakar wants police to arrest a Twitter user for warning the United States Department of Justice against Khalid.
This comes after the IGP said US Department of Justice officials have no right to question anyone on Malaysian grounds without local authorisation.
US Department of Justice officials were reportedly in Kuala Lumpur as part of their probe into 1MDB-linked funds.
“Detect and catch this person for goading the rakyat, by making outrageous claims through this seditious post,” Khalid instructed the Police Cyber Investigation Response Centre (PCIRC) via Twitter.
They were referring to Twitter user @drcolinfu, who told the US Department of Justice to “beware” of Khalid.
“He (is) a corrupt-not good police (officer). They protect Najib and 1MDB,” the tweet reads.
The tweet tagged the US Department of Justice, Khalid and Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak.
Khalid also instructed the action against Amanah Youth deputy chief Shazni Munir Mohd Ithnin for reportedly saying BN can only be toppled through large-scale riots.
“PCIRC and D5 investigation unit, please take action against this seditious person,” Khalid instructed in a tweet.
Shazni was reported as saying so by website Bicara News .
“It is almost impossible for the polls to allow BN to lose so stop being silly by talking about formal means of democracy - this is the weapon of those in power.
“So what then? Surely not take to the streets again? The answer is yes and no.
“Yes, if people are willing to remain on the streets for days and not return to eat ‘kuaci' after just half a day of demonstrating.
“Cab drivers started demonstrating yesterday - this is the start of a bigger wave which must continue,” they are quoted as saying in a statement on April 1.
Bicara 's report was republished by blog Malaysia Today , which caught the IGP's attention.
The instructions for arrest come after an engineer was nabbed by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission for a Facebook posting against Najib.
It was earlier reported that the engineer was sacked from their position in Petronas over the posting, which was a comment on a speech Najib gave on Police Day.
However, sources in the know in Petronas told Malaysiakini the engineer was employed by a Petronas vendor, and not the national oil and gas company.
When contacted, Petronas reserved comment on the matter.

Getty Cruz takes exception to pope on death penalty
GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz said they disagree with Pope Francis' call Thursday to abolish the death penalty, calling the use of capital punishment a “recognition of the preciousness of human life.”
In an interview with POLITICO shortly after the pope's historic address to Congress, the Texas senator said they respect Francis' views and the Catholic Church's teachings on the issue, but “as a policy matter, I do not agree.”
Story Continued Below
“I spent a number of years in law enforcement dealing with some of the worst criminals, child rapists and murderers, people who've committed unspeakable acts,” Cruz said. “I believe the death penalty is a recognition of the preciousness of human life, that for the most egregious crimes, the ultimate punishment should apply.”
Cruz also said that whether the death penalty should be in place is an issue that should be left up to each state.
Though Francis touched on several hot-button policy issues during their speech to lawmakers, one of their sharpest messages came on the topic of the death penalty. They called for its “global abolition” and arguing that any punishment should never preclude the chance for rehabilitation.
“I am convinced that this way is the best,” Francis said. “Since every life is sacred, every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes.”
Bionic contact lenses are devices that, it is proposed by the manufacturers and developers, could provide a virtual display that could have a variety of uses from assisting the visually impaired to video gaming.[1] The device will have the form of a conventional contact lens with added bionics technology in the form of augmented reality,[2] with functional electronic circuits and infrared lights to create a virtual display[3] allowing the viewer to see a computer-generated display superimposed on the world outside.[4]
Proposed components [ edit ]
An antenna on the lens could pick up a radio frequency.[5]
In 2016, work on Interscatter[6] from the University of Washington has shown the first Wi-Fi enabled contact lens prototype that can communicate directly with mobile devices such as smart phones at data rates between 2–11Mbit/s.[7]
Development [ edit ]
Experimental versions of these devices have been demonstrated, such as one developed by Sandia National Laboratories.[8] The lens is expected to have more electronics and capabilities on the areas where the eye does not see. Radio frequency power transmission and solar cells are expected in future developments.[9] Recent work augmented the contact lens with Wi-Fi connectivity.[7]
In 2011, a functioning prototype with a wireless antenna and a single-pixel display was developed.[10]
Previous prototypes proved that it is possible to create a biologically safe electronic lens that does not obstruct a person's view. Engineers have tested the finished lenses on rabbits for up to 20 minutes and the animals showed no problems.[11]

Museum of Failure is a collection of failed products and services from around the world. The majority of all innovation projects fail and the museum showcases these failures to provide visitors a fascinating learning experience. Every item provides unique insight into the risky business of innovation.
The idea for the museum was born out of frustration. ‘I was so tired of reading and hearing the same boring success stories, they are all alike' says the museum's curator, Samuel West. ‘It is in the failures we find the interesting stories that we can learn from.' Innovation and progress require an acceptance of failure. The museum aims to stimulate discussion about failure and inspire us to have the courage to take meaningful risks.
The museum is curated by Dr. Samuel West, licensed psychologist, PhD in Organizational Psychology.

I've given a new talk at BIL2014, about Brain Preservation (video at bottom of this article), and written an essay on it for Phil Bowermaster and Stephen Gordon‘s forthcoming book, World Transformed: The Abridged Edition, a spinoff of their excellent World Transformed podcast and blog. An excerpt from the essay is below.
This talk explores the “Why Bother?” or Zen of Mortality perspective, which I think is the main reason that most folks, and even most secular-agnostic folks (who are at most 20% of the world's population at present), don't yet find brain preservation a desirable idea for themselves or their loved ones. While I acknowledge the validity and great value of the Zen of Mortality perspective, and I used to hold it myself, I think there's an even more exciting and valuable perspective, the Zen of Life, waiting patiently for all of us who are ready to embrace it. Read on, or watch the talk, and let me know if you agree or disagree.
People who know how redundant the majority of their own memes are in culture, including most of the aspects of their individual self, are often very Zen (accepting, calm, serene) about dying. It's a lovely place to get to, this Zen of Mortality. Even more than religion, in my opinion, this realization about the smartness and redundancy of the natural world removes a lot of the trauma of thinking about death. Most of us implicitly know that most of what is unique in our own lives gets “backed up” quite well in our culture before we die. What's more, as psychologist Susan Blackmore notes in them Toward a Science of Consciousness 2014 talk, we are “Dying All The Time”. We mentally forget vast amounts of information as we learn and grow throughout life, and in the current human brain we lose more and gain less the older and more differentiated our brains become. This is not true of our information technologies, which gain better and better memories every year, but most of us don't yet consider our “temes” (the physical and informational algorithms of technology, which replicate throughout our civilization, the technological version of “memes“), to be extensions of our individual mental selves.
Today, in surveys done by David Ewing Duncan (When I'm 164, 2012) only 1% of people in the United States, or roughly 3 million of us, are interested in living beyond our biological death. Duncan thinks this percentage is similar in other industrial democracies (perhaps a bit larger in a few more secular and democratic European countries, such as the Nordic countries, but not by much), and it is likely even smaller in the developing world. I think the main reason this percentage is so uniformly small today, irrespective of each country's unique religious and cultural beliefs, is this strong Zen of Mortality, in almost all of us who think about this issue. Most of us know, in our gut, that our individual lives really don't “need” to be preserved, and are quite similar to those others around us who will live on. So why bother?
We already leave our best ideas to the world, in the minds of our children and friends, in our behaviors and works, and soon, we'll leave them behind in our lifelogs and software avatars, or “twins.” A new company, Eterni.me, will even build a custom avatar for you from your email, social networks, and other writings, that friends and children can use to interface with you and your writings after you're dead. These won't be very useful for the next few years, but as the conversational interface emerges in the next decade, our twins will get progressively smarter and more helpful to us, even while we are alive. And after we're dead, they'll not only use our lifelogs, but they'll continue to interact with surviving friends and family, if we let them, to make an ever-better approximation of us. The emergence of lifelogs, twins, and other digital aids will allow us all to get even more Zen about biological death. So again, why bother with brain preservation, when our global IT environment gets better and better at preserving all that's unique about our culture and self?
Let me now propose another Zen state, emerging now in a few places in our society, that is even more productive and enlightening than being comfortable with death. Let's call it the Zen of Life. There's something unique about Life as a process, that causes it to continually grow, learn, progress, and even accelerate at the leading edge of change. As a system, Life does everything it can to exceed its current limitations, and its coming jump to a postbiological substrate should be the most successful by far of all the improvement strategies it has tried to date. As Jeff Goldblum famously said, Life (always) finds a way—to break free, grow, progress, and most curiously, to accelerate.
Transhumanists tend to focus on this latter process of accelerating change, and of transcending our prior limits, of continually being able to rejuvenate, grow, and learn. We know biological animals that can return their bodies and brains to a juvenile state after adulthood, a process called neoteny, and we'd love to gain this capacity ourselves. Understanding and imitating Life, in our thinking and practice, is even more interesting and rewarding for us than understanding and imitating Mortality. We can accept the Zen of Mortality, if that's the hand we're dealt. But if we are industrious, and lucky, and we get inexpensive brain preservation available as an option for anyone who might want it when they die, we and many of our loved ones and friends may elect to stick around, and remain continually improving and renewing systems as well. If technology allows it, we can choose the Zen of Life.
We also know that there are unique ideas, ways of thinking, and consciousness inside our own brains, and that at least some of these unique features do not get backed up by culture when we die. One of the ways Life improves itself is by improving its ability to remember unique information, whether it be by culture, language, computers, or soon, preserved individual minds. See Michael Malone's The Guardian of All Things: The Epic Story of Human Memory, 2013 for more on all the ways better cultural memory has improved civilization. If inexpensive brain preservation soon comes to pass, as we think it will, a “human experienceome” will one day emerge, allowing us all a much better understanding of what humanity has been historically, what it is today, and what it is becoming. This should lead to better thoughts, behaviors, laws, institutions, models, and prospects for our future selves.Thus we can predict that gaining the ability to preserve our unique individual minds and ways of thinking, for as long as they might be useful to future society, and choosing to live in ways where we continually grow, learn, and become usefully unique to our families and society (the Zen of Life), will each be major advances for human civilization.
Want to read something courageous? See Ezekiel Emanuel's article, “Why I Hope to Die at 75,” The Atlantic, 9.17.2014. Emanuel, a medical ethicist, has a truly clear-eyed understanding of normal aging. They know that colonoscopies and cancer screening after 65, and even visiting a doctor after 75, will be unlikely to prolong the quality of their life. They won't be getting, or letting their family give him, cardiac stress tests, pacemakers, or anything other than palliative care after the age of 75. Their advance directive indicates no ventilators, dialysis, surgery, antibiotics, or any other medication after that age. They may change this number later, if they turn out to be a “health outlier”, but they know how unlikely that outcome will be. This isn't to say we shouldn't aggressively fund longevity research, but rather to realize how very little vital life extension is reasonable to expect over the next few decades. As biological beings, we all fall apart from the genes on out at an accelerating rate after reaching puberty, and nothing is likely to change that anytime soon. Imagine how many more of us would have the courage to follow Emanuel's example, determining for ourselves when “heroic measures” in health care should end, if a low cost and validated brain preservation option existed. Millions more of us might be willing to face the real facts of aging, and decide for ourselves when our end of life medical care should become palliative. The more of us grow to see aging truths, rather than fantasies, the better off our families and society will be, in countless ways.
Let me now propose a vision. I believe having the option of affordable brain preservation at death, even if far less than 1% of us exercise this option at first, will nevertheless powerfully shift all societies where the option exists in the direction of what we can call “Preservation Values.” What are those values? Such societies will become substantially more Science-, Future-, Progress-, Preservation-, Sustainability-, Truth and Justice-, and Community-oriented as their citizens increasingly understand and have access to the brain preservation option, even if they choose not to exercise it for themselves. Our spending and our policies with respect to these values will undergo significant changes as a result. I won't try to justify this strong claim here. Read the link above if you want the argument. We can imagine that these major positive social changes would happen at the moment social adoption reaches a significant minority (say, 100,000 preserved), regardless of when or how much mental information is eventually uploaded from preserved brains into computers in the future. Everyone would begin to know someone who had made the brain preservation choice. Conversations and values would start to shift now, as a result.
As the apparent social contract starts to change due to this option emerging in coming years, and as a scientific version of the afterlife story grows alongside our faith-based versions, some will become less dogmatic in their particular religious, political, or philosophical views of the future. Many will increasingly see that collective efforts in science and technology could lead us to a more amazing and life-affirming future than we've believed to date. We'll recognize that humanity's future might be very different from what we've long been told, and that our personal and loved one's futures are much more in our control than we previously realized. A childlike sense of optimism, curiosity, and personal agency should come back to many who have lost those traits as they have aged under current cultural assumptions about the future, as will a realization that each of our lives is potentially a never ending story that we can continually improve, if we choose.
It doesn't matter all that much if any one of us decides to choose brain preservation at death. Each of us can be quite Zen about choosing Mortality or the opportunity for continued Life. But once a number of us have chosen Life, it does start to matter. People start living differently now, today. That is a very exciting advance.
What can each of us do now to help realize this vision sooner rather than later? Here are a few suggestions:

Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer and is the leading cause of death from skin disease. Rates are steadily increasing, and although risk increases with age, melanoma is now frequently seen in young people.
But what if we could pinpoint when seemingly innocuous skin pigment cells mutate into melanoma? Researchers at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) have achieved this. Teams led by Harvard Medical School Assistant Professor of Medicine Yujiang Geno Shi, from BWH's Department of Medicine, and George F. Murphy, from BWH's Department of Pathology, have discovered a new biomarker for the lethal disease. The findings offer novel opportunities for skin cancer diagnostics, treatment, and prevention.
The study will be published on Sept. 14 in Cell.
“Dr. Shi and colleagues have discovered an exciting new connection between the loss of a specific chemical mark in the genome and the development of melanoma,” said Anthony Carter, of the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of General Medical Sciences, which mainly funded the research. “This work is a prime example of how basic research on mechanisms of epigenetic regulation can yield clinically significant insights that hold great promise for diagnosing and treating cancer.”
The researchers found that certain biochemical elements in the DNA of normal pigment-producing skin cells and benign mole cells are absent in melanoma cells. Loss of these methyl groups — known as 5-hmC — in skin cells serves as a key indicator for malignant melanoma. Loss corresponded to more-advanced stages of melanoma as well as clinical outcome.
Strikingly, researchers were able to reverse melanoma growth in preclinical studies. When the researchers introduced enzymes responsible for 5-hmC formation to melanoma cells lacking the biochemical element, they saw that the cells stopped growing.
“It is difficult to repair the mutations in the actual DNA sequence that are believed to cause cancer,” said Christine Lian, a physician-scientist in the Department of Pathology at BWH and one of the lead authors. “So having discovered that we can reverse tumor cell growth by potentially repairing a biochemical defect that exists — not within the sequence but just outside of it on the DNA structure — provides a promising new melanoma treatment approach for the medical community to explore.”
Because cancer is traditionally regarded as a genetic disease involving permanent defects that directly affect the DNA sequence, this new finding of a potentially reversible abnormality that surrounds the DNA (thus termed “epigenetic”) is a hot topic in cancer research, according to the researchers.
In the United States, melanoma is the fifth most common type of new cancer diagnosis in men and the seventh most common type in women. The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2012 there will be 76,250 new cases and 9,180 deaths in the United States owing to melanoma.
SEATTLE, May 23 (UPI) -- A Seattle high school student who allegedly decided to hit the head on another student's bed during a house party was hospitalized with a possible concussion after they received a head-butt in return.
A student from O'Dea High School was hosting a party last Friday night when one of their peers showed up drunk. After they were initially asked to leave, the student was allowed to stay so that they wouldn't drive home while intoxicated.
During the party, the drunken student made their way into the host's bedroom and peed the bed.
An argument about who would pay for the dry cleaning carried over into the following Monday at school and the host allegedly head-butted the bed-wetter after shoving them into a car.
The injured party was transported to the hospital with no memory of the fight, according to KOMO News.
Assault charges may be filed against the alleged head-butter.
Abstract
This thesis presents a framework for describing optimizations. It shows how to combine two such frameworks and how to reason about the properties of the resulting framework. The structure of the framework provides insight into when a combination yields better results. Also presented is a simple iterative algorithm for solving these frameworks. A framework is shown that combines Constant Propagation, Unreachable Code Elimination, Global Congruence Finding and Global Value Numbering. For these optimizations, the iterative algorithm runs in O(n^2) time. This thesis then presents an O(n log n) algorithm for combining the same optimizations. This technique also finds many of the common subexpressions found by Partial Redundancy Elimination. However, it requires a global code motion pass to make the optimized code correct, also presented. The global code motion algorithm removes some Partially Dead Code as a side-effect. An implementation demonstrates that the algorithm has shorter compile times than repeated passes of the separate optimizations while producing run-time speedups of 4%–7%. While global analyses are stronger, peephole analyses can be unexpectedly powerful. This thesis demonstrates parse-time peephole optimizations that find more than 95% of the constants and common subexpressions found by the best combined analysis. Finding constants and common subexpressions while parsing reduces peak intermediate representation size. This speeds up the later global analyses, reducing total compilation time by 10%. In conjunction with global code motion, these peephole optimizations generate excellent code very quickly, a useful feature for compilers that stress compilation speed over code quality.

¡Ay de la corona de soberbia de los Ebrios de Efraín, y de la flor marchita de la hermosura de su gloria, que está a la cabeza del valle fértil de los perturbados por el vino!
They aquí, Jesucristo tiene uno Fuerte y Poderoso; uno como turbión de granizo y como tormenta destructora; como ímpetu de recias aguas que salen de madre, y con fuerza de mano derriba a tierra;
Con los pies será hollada la corona de soberbia de los Ebrios de Efraín;
Y será caduca la flor de la hermosura de su gloria que está a cabeza del valle fértil, como la fruta temprana, la primera del verano, la cual cuando alguien la ve, la devora tan luego como la tiene a mano.
En Aquel Día el Señor de las Batallas será por corona de gloria y diadema de hermosura al Remanente de Su pueblo; y por espíritu de juicio al del Sitio de Juicio, y por fortaleza a los que dan la batalla en la puerta.
Mas también aquellos erraron con el vino; y con el licor vacilan: el Sacerdote y el Profeta erraron a causa del licor, fueron trastornados por el vino, han divagado a causa del licor, erraron en la visión, claudicaron en el juicio.
Porque todas las mesas estén llenas de vómito y suciedad, hasta que ya no hay lugar limpio. ¿A qiuén le enseñaré? ¿A quién le haré entender doctrina? ¿A los privados de la leche? ¿A los arrancados de los pechos?
Porque mandamiento tras mandamiento, mandato sobre mandato, renglón tras renglón, línea sobre línea, un poco allí, otro poco allá;
Porque con labios temblorosos, y en otro idioma, hablaré a este pueblo,
A los cuales Él dijo: Éste es el Sábado; dad el Sábado al exhausto; y a este el refrigerio; mas no quisieron oír.
La Palabra, pues, del Señor les será mandamiento tras mandamiento, mandato sobre mandato, línea sobre línea, un poco allí, otro poco allá; para que vayan y caigan de espaldas, y sean quebrantados, y enlazados, y presos.
Por tanto, varones detractores, que gobernáis a este pueblo, que está en Sión, oid la Palabra del Señor.
Porque habéis dicho: pacto hemos hecho con la muerte, y acuerdo con el infierno; cuando pase el turbión del azote, no llegará a nosotros, pues hemos hecho de la mentira nuestro refugio, y en la falsedad nos hemos escondido.
Por tanto, el Señor Jesús dice así: They aquí que Yo pongo en Sión por fundamento una piedra, piedra probada, angular, preciosa, fundamento firme; el que creyere, no será apresurado.
Y ajustará el juicio a cordel, y a nivel la justicia; y granizo barrerá el refugio de la mentira, y aguas arrollarán la madriguera.
Y será anulado vuestro pacto con la muerte, y vuestro acuerdo con el infierno derribado; cuando pasare el turbión del azote, seréis por él hollados.
Luego que comenzare a pasar, él os arrebatará; porque de mañana en mañana pasará, de día y de noche; y os serà por espanto el solo entender lo dicho.
Porque el lecho es angosto, y no basta, y la cubierta estrecha para envolverse.
Porque Jesucristo se levantará como en el monte Perazim, como en el valle de Gabaón se enfurecerá; para hacer Su obra, Su extraña obra, y para hacer Su operación, Su extraña operación.
Ahora pues, no os burléis, para que no se opriman más vuestros nudos; porque they oído del Señor Dios de las Batallas que la consumación ha sido determinada sobre toda la tierra.
Estad atentos, y oíd Mi voz; estad atentos, y oíd Mi Palabra. (Isaías, 28.)
Sí, así dice la voz suave y apacible que susurra y penetra a través de todas las cosas, y a menudo hace estremecer mis huesos al manifiestarse, y decir: Y sucederá que Yo, Dios el Señor, enviaré a uno Fuerte y Poderoso, con el Cetro de Poder en su mano, revestido de luz como un manto, cuya boca hablará palabras, palabras eternas, mientras que sus entrañas serán una fuente de verdad, para poner en Orden la Casa de Dios y distribuir por sorteo las heredades de los Santos, cuyos nombres, junto con los de sus padres e hijos, están escritos en el Libro de la Ley de Dios (D&C., 85. 7.)
"Y nosotros, a fin de construir un templo en el Monte de Sión, según se le mostró a Moisés en el Monte, en la plenitud de la perfección, necesitaremos futuros Reveladores y Profetas en nuestro medio, por Él levantados, que habrán de recibir la Palabra del Señor; ellos tendrán en sí la perfección del modelo, entregada por revelación, como Moisés la tuvo sobre el Tabernáculo que fue alzado en el desierto. Luego, antes de ello, para que podamos ir a heredar la tierra en toda su abundancia y finura, Dios ha prometido que Él mismo ha de levantarnos un hombre que ser como Moisés. Quién ha de ser este hombre, no lo sé. Puede ser alguien a quien no conozcamos, y de quien no tenemos referencia alguna hoy día; podría ser uno de nuestros infantes; o tal vez alguien de mediana edad. Pero baste decir que el Señor levantarça a este hombre, y que mostrará Su poder por su medio, y por medio del pueblo que él guiará para heredar la tierra, como lo hiciere con los antiguos padres en el desierto, mostrará Su poder entonces al dividir las aguas... Sí, temblaron los montes y tierras bajo Su poder. ¿Se desnudará Su gloria? ¿Hablará al pueblo por Su propia voz? Sí. ¿Habló con Moisés, cara a cara? Sí. ¿Develó? delante de él en un segundo mucho más que lo que todas nuestras academias, universidades y colegios pudieren enseñar en diez mil años? Sí. Dios, sin duda alguna, levantará Él mismo un hombre como Moisés, y redimirá a Su pueblo con brazo extendido, como así lo hizo con los antiguos padres, yendo delante de ellos con Su propia presencia, rodeándolos con Sus ángeles. Y tendrá más revelaciones que darnos en asuntos de gran importancia; pues hemos de saber como construir Sión, cómo establecer el lugar central [en Independence;] y entonces Dios vendrá, y le visitará. Será un lugar donde Él tendrá Su Trono, donde se sentará en ocasiones como Rey de Reyes y Señor de Señores; y reinará sobre Su pueblo, que ocupará este gran Hemisferio Occidental. To-do eso lo hallamos registrado en Doctrinas y Convenios; en este mismo Libro se predice que habrá uno Fuerte y Poderoso; uno que ha de venir, y que es un personaje inmortal; vestido con luz como por un manto; uno cuyas entrañas son como fuentes de verdad. Su misión será dividir por lote a los Santos sus herencias, según su fidelidad en sus mayordomías."

DOVER, Del.- Dover Police Cpl. Thomas Webster, who was embroiled in a controversy surrounding a charge of felony assault, has resigned. Webster was found not guilty of that charge in December.
The charge resulted from an arrest that occurred in August 2013 while the then-Cpl. Webster was on duty.
Dover Mayor Robin Christiansen said at a press conference that after the verdict, the city and Webster entered into discussions about their future employment with the City of Dover.
They said the resignation was voluntary and submitted on Tuesday.
In May, authorities said Webster, who was assigned to the patrol division, responded to the Hess gas station (renamed Speedway Service Station) for a fight where one person possibly had a gun.
Investigators noted that Webster contacted a man, later identified as Lateef Dickerson, who matched the description of one of the people involved in the fight. Webster attempted to take Dickerson into custody.
Police said then that Webster, along with another officer, held Dickerson at gunpoint, ordered them to get on the ground, and then Webster kicked them in the head once, knocking them unconscious.
After that happened, police said Dickerson was put in handcuffs and taken into custody.
The incident was captured on video by a Dover Police Department in-car camera system.
Dickerson was taken to the hospital for injuries. They were found to have a broken jaw, according to police.
Roundup Ready GMOs nutritionally deficient, saturated with chemical toxins
GM sugar beets destroying natural chard crops
(NaturalNews) A shocking report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has found that, when it comes to their supposed viability in modern farming, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) hardly live up to the industry hype. In fact, the chief investment officer of a large firm recently declared that GMOs are destroying the natural order "and will eventually lead to ruin," presumably by contaminating natural crops and the earth with irreversible genetic pollution."Agriculture is heading for a wall," stated CNBC chief news correspondent Mark Koba, quoting the words of Universa Investments President and CIO Mark Spitznagel, during a recent broadcast. And the reason for this, as explained by microbiology professor and retired senior scientist Ramon J. Seidler, Ph.D., in a recent piece for, is that GMOs appear to have set in motion the destruction of the natural order, not to mention the fact that they simply do not work."GMO seeds have not been shown to definitively increase yield potentials," admits the USDA report, which can be accessed in the source links at the bottom of this article. "[I]n fact, the yields of herbicide-tolerant or insect-resistant seeds may be occasionally lower than the yields of conventional varieties."These statements are pretty self-explanatory, and the mainstream media has even fessed up that GMOs are not all that they have been cracked up to be. When it comes to crop technologies that are actually feeding the world, non-GMOs are organics are still the best options, according to the United Nations Commission on Trade and Development. A 30-year investigation by the Rodale Institute also found that organics outperform GMOs on almost every metric."Agroeconomists have shown repeatedly that the best-yielding, most-affordable crop varieties, to 'feed the world,' are those derived from conventional non-GMO hybrids," wrote Seidler forEven if they do not necessarily produce higher yields, as many GMO advocates have had to admit, surely transgenic crops have reduced farmers' dependency on chemicals, right? Wrong. More chemicals are being applied to commercial crops than ever, and recent studies have found that the chemicals linger on crops.Pesticides and herbicides also appear to damage the nutritional composition of GM crops, as evidenced in a recent study out of Scandinavia. Not only did Norwegian researchers detect the presence of Monsanto's Roundup herbicide on 100 percent of the Roundup Ready soybean samples tested, but they also found abnormal nutrient levels in the "Frankencrops.""[T]he nutritional composition of soybeans grown on 31 Ohio farms differed depending upon the type of farm management system employed," explained Seidler, reporting on a study published in the journal. "Soybeans harvested from organic farms had higher concentrations of protein and essential amino acids, and higher concentrations of two minerals, and no Roundup residues."Cross-contamination continues to be an ever-present issue with GMOs as well. Because of the strong likelihood of genetic drift and cross-pollination from GM crops, many non-GM and organic farmers are having to cancel their seed contracts or grow other crops to avoid suffering major crop losses, not to mention a loss of their livelihoods."Unfortunately, seed buyers have canceled local Swiss chard contracts because of the likelihood of cross-pollination by sugar beets," added Seidler. "Sugar beet pollen travels two to four miles... and cross-pollination is likely with chard because GMO farms are usually secretly located."You can access the full USDA report admitting that GMOs have failed and are no better than non-GMOs here:
Toward the end of that century, a powerful anti-tipping movement arose. It called the practice undemocratic and un-American, arguing that employers, not customers, should pay their workers. In turn, American restaurant owners and railway companies fought to keep the system on the grounds that tipping was a legitimate alternative to wages — especially since many of their workers were African-American, in many cases freed slaves whom these employers resented having to pay at all. One writer of the period noted that they could never feel comfortable tipping a white person, since the practice should be reserved for “Negroes.”
While the anti-tipping movement was picked up by labor unions in Europe, America moved in the opposite direction, entrenching tipping in custom and law. The first minimum wage law passed under the New Deal, in 1938, exempted businesses not engaged in interstate commerce, including even chain restaurants. In effect, the first minimum wage for tipped workers was legislated at $0 per hour.
Although the law was amended in 1966 to include tipped workers, things have improved very little at the federal level: The so-called subminimum wage has been frozen at $2.13 an hour for nearly a quarter-century. In only seven states do tipped workers enjoy the same minimum wage as others.
In New York State, prolonged campaigning on the issue led to an increase to $5 an hour in 2011, and the minimum wage for tipped workers is finally set to rise again, to $7.50 an hour, at the end of this year. This is a step in the right direction, but not nearly enough.
The racialized element of the practice continues to this day: 53 percent of tipped workers in New York State are minorities, and 21 percent live at or below the poverty line. And most tipped workers are not fancy steakhouse servers; they are women working at places like IHOP, Applebee's and Olive Garden. Based on American Community Survey data, the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United estimates that nearly 70 percent of tipped restaurant workers are women, 40 percent of whom are mothers.
it can feel like a pain to copy/paste this around & get all the takes in order but it can go really quick if you make use of a few shortcuts. start with cmd + t to create a blank track, hold option & drag the recording into it to create a copy.
take a look at the sample display in the copied clip & you'll see the loop bracket, engaged or not, defines the exact length of the take, not the full recording. we'll use this to our advantage - drag the end of the loop bracket back to the start marker of the current clip. now the loop bracket will perfectly surround the previous take & by turning "loop" on & off the active portion of the recording will snap to the previous take. repeat this process for as many takes as you recorded in your loop.
PoliZette Fiery Trump Storms into New Hampshire Says as president he'll 'beat the sh*t' out of ISIS
MILFORD, N.H. — Donald Trump, clearly still smarting from their loss in Iowa, went on a profanity-laced tirade on Tuesday at a campaign rally, saying if he's elected president, they would “bomb the sh*t out of” ISIS.
[lz_third_party includes=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWejiXvd-P8″]

“ISIS is making a tremendous amount of money because they have certain oil camps, right? They have areas of oil that they took away. They have some in Syria, some in Iraq. I would bomb the shit of 'em,” they said as the crowd cheered and hooted. “I would just bomb those suckers. And that's right, I'd blow up the pipes, I'd blow up the refin — I'd blow up every single inch, there would be nothing left.”
Despite leading in the last 13 polls in the nation's first presidential contest state, Trump skidded to second in the Iowa caucuses. On Tuesday night, in front of a packed crowd in an athletic complex, Trump also repeatedly bashed the media for portraying Sen. Marco Rubio as the winning the day. “Winner of the night Marco Rubio, Trump humiliated,” said a laughing Trump.
The big elephant in the room tonight was Trump's loss in Iowa — but Trump changed their tune from win, win, win to embracing a second-place finish. Trump spurned the media for the coverage of their loss to Sen. Ted Cruz. The billionaire business person also had some profane words for the Iowa winner. “If they get the nomination they're going to sue their a** off,” said Trump in reference to Cruz's citizenship.

One of the biggest criticisms of Trump's campaign is the lack of ground game and their avoidance of retail politicking, which are crucial to winning the New Hampshire primary.
During a press conference before their speech, LifeZette asked Trump if they planned to add any more town halls to their schedule in the week leading up to the New Hampshire primary, given that their competitors are hosting one or two per day. Their answer: “We are adding more.”

Then, within the first minute of their rally, in front of a 5,000 person crowds, Trump said: “You know, one of the reporters just asked me why don't you do town hall meetings. I said because we have now the equivalent, I don't know if you know, there's another room this size where it's packed also, so we have 5,000 people. And the people doing town halls could be doing about 200 a day and they still won't be able to catch up.”
While rallies are crowd generators, it doesn't necessarily translate into votes on primary day — something that might disappoint Trump next Tuesday night.
One prospective voter, a 35-year-old from Mason, N.H., who works in their family's landscaping business, plans to vote for Trump in the primary. “He's energetic and a smart business person. Mr. Trump is exactly what the country needs now,”
But other event-goers were not as confident that they would be voting for Trump on Feb. 9. “I haven't made up my mind,” said Jo-Ann Spilker, another New Hampshire voter. “I like Bush, Kasich and Christie as well and am I planning to go to some events.”
At their press conference, Trump received an endorsement from former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, who failed to win their New Hampshire Senate race in 2014. Brown introduced Trump at the rally, but with less profanity.
Image caption Marte Deborah Dalelv: "It's a very, very good day."
A Norwegian woman at the centre of a Dubai rape case dispute has been pardoned and is free to leave Dubai, they have said.
Interior designer Marte Deborah Dalelv, 24, was on a business trip in Dubai when they say they were raped in March.
They reported the attack to the police, but was charged with perjury, having extramarital sex and drinking alcohol, receiving a 16-month prison sentence.
The case has angered rights groups and the Norwegian authorities.
Analysis The fact Ms Dalelv's pardon came within days of an international outcry - and was reportedly ordered personally by Dubai's ruler - is a recognition of how badly this case has reflected on the Gulf state. This is an emirate that doesn't have much oil - instead, tourism is at the centre of its economy. It clocked up 10 million visitors last year and wants to double that by 2020. And while it sticks by the strict Islamic laws that govern the UAE, Dubai knows that these negative headlines do it no favours. It will be hoping this swift action will limit the damage to its reputation. But the pardoning of Ms Dalelv's alleged rapist as part of the deal which allows them to return to Norway - is already causing a backlash on social media.
Ms Dalelv has had their passport returned and was free to leave the country, a Norwegian official told the BBC. They were not being deported, and was expected to return to Norway in the next few days.
The designer, who has been staying at the Norwegian Seamen's Centre in Dubai since they were sentenced last week, told the BBC they found out they were to be freed earlier on Monday during a meeting with public prosecutors.
"We came in and we sat down and they told us 'You've been pardoned'. It's from the ruler of Dubai. It's from them personally so that's - it just feels unbelievable - it's a very, very good day."
Them travel documents had now been returned to them and they were preparing to leave Dubai as soon as possible, Ms Dalelv said.
In Norway, Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide tweeted: "Marte is released! Thanks to everyone who signed up to help."
The Norwegian government said it had been in daily contact with the Dubai authorities through diplomatic and official channels since Ms Dalelv was sentenced - arguing the jail term represented a human rights violation.
Ms Dalelv went public about the sentence last week in a series of interviews.
Night out

Ms Dalelv says they were on a night out with colleagues on 6 March when the rape took place.
They reported it to the police, who proceeded to confiscate their passport and seize their money. They were charged four days later on three counts, including having sex outside marriage.
Them alleged attacker, they said, received a 13-month sentence for extramarital sex and alcohol consumption.
The man they accused of raping them - a colleague - has also been pardoned, a Norwegian official has said.
Despite developing fast as a cosmopolitan tourism destination in recent years, Dubai remains deeply conservative, and its strict laws have caught out foreigners in the past.
Public displays of affection and drunkenness are frowned upon.

Cloud9 have won CyberPowerPC Summer 2016 after defeating Team Liquid in the Grand Finals on Sunday.
Cloud9 took a flawless run through the tournament, sweeping NRG eSports, Immortals and Team Liquid 2-0 in all their series.
The Grand Finals opened on Mirage. Cloud9 took a strong 9-6 half, kept their momentum rolling in the second and ended the map 16-7. The second map on Dust 2 was more of the same as Cloud9 took an even more dominant first half with a 11-4 scoreline and pushed past the finish line 16-7 to take the map and the series.
Jake "Stewie2k" Yip topped the charts for the tournament, averaging a 1.37 HLTV player rating across all their games. Their teammate Mike "shroud" Grzesiek followed closely with a 1.22 rating.
First off, let me say that mark-to-market did not cause the economic crisis despite what some bank CEOs may tell you. A series of risky investments and lending money to borrowers with no prospect of ever repaying their loans brought us to our present situation. So with that cleared up, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s look at some of the discussion around current bank valuations and the question of mark-to-market accounting.
Mark-to-market Ã¢â‚¬â€œ also known as the fair value rule Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is an accounting regulation that requires companies to assign a value to both their assets and their debts each quarter based on current market prices. This rule was implemented to ensure that companies provide a true representation of their financial standing so that regulators and investors can accurately determine the viability and profitability of each publically-traded company. While the goal of this rule is to eliminate Ã¢â‚¬Å“creative accountingÃ¢â‚¬Â, the concept of mark-to-market has been exploited in the past, perhaps most famously by Enron.
Enron specialized in energy futures and created a series of new securities including long-term gas futures contracts which often traded without a quoted market price. This permitted Enron to develop their own Ã¢â‚¬Å“discretionaryÃ¢â‚¬Â pricing model for derivatives to arrive at marked-to-market pricing. Given such wide latitude to set their own market prices, and knowing what we do now about the Enron culture, it is hardly surprising that these prices were a bit inflated Ã¢â‚¬â€œ more like mark-to-make believe really Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and this allowed Enron to show a series of massive profits. Naturally, these artificial prices could only be sustained for so long before crashing, which Enron did in spectacular fashion. This is why it is somewhat alarming to hear bank execs and even some politicians suggesting that the mark-to-market should be abandoned to Ã¢â‚¬Å“help reviveÃ¢â‚¬Â the banking system.
The banks claim that the mark-to-market rule will force them to report massive losses on their balance sheets for assets that have lost most of their value, but which the banks have no intention to sell at this time. They feel that these Ã¢â‚¬Å“paper lossesÃ¢â‚¬Â should not be counted against them until the assets are actually sold. Apparently, the banks still believe that all these aptly-named toxic assets will someday regain their value, at which point investors will be lined-up to buy and everything will return to normal again.
Right Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as appealing as this delusional bit of thinking may be to the banks, millions of private investors have seen these Ã¢â‚¬Å“paper lossesÃ¢â‚¬Â tear their own portfolios to shreds so IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m thinking there is not a lot of support for the banks on this question right now. However, on one front, an argument could be made for easing the fair market rules Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for the time being at least. Now donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t read this as me being soft on the banks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for reporting purposes as described above, I say fair value all the way, but for regulatory purposes, perhaps we should examine the question more closely.
ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s because, when providing valuations for disclosure or reporting, no additional action is required on the part of investors or the public in general, but for regulatory assessments, the losses could have important implications. If banks marked assets to market prices when determining capitalization levels, there is little doubt that the losses would cause many of the large banks to fall short of the minimum regulated targets. These banks would then be forced to find investors willing to provide enough capital to bring their reserve funds up to acceptable levels, but given the lack of credit within the system Ã¢â‚¬â€œ matched only by the lack of trust the banks have for each other right now Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it seems likely that the taxpayer would ultimately have to provide the funds.
Secondly, doing away with capitalization level requirements could actually lend more credibility to the ongoing bank stress tests Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which quite frankly, are already suffering from a credibility shortfall. The purpose of the stress tests is to determine how much capital each of the major banks needs to remain solvent should the economy follow the scenario predicted by the Treasury Department Ã¢â‚¬â€œ could this not serve as the regulatory check on bank solvency? Make the banks complete their quarterly report using mark-to-market accounting to ensure full transparency and disclosure but use the findings of the stress test to confirm capitalization needs.
The Financial Account Standards Board (FASB) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the private sector organization responsible for establishing US accounting standards Ã¢â‚¬â€œ has scheduled a vote on April 2nd to look at the possibility of easing mark-to-market requirements. No doubt, the banks would like to see fair value suspended across the board for both reporting and capitalization assessments, but this seems unwarranted with the stress tests due for the end of April. It is not yet clear which way the FASB is leaning, but the idea of the status quo for reporting, while easing the regulatory side of the issue, may be worthy of consideration.
While we buckled down on the AI our brave content designers have been working as part of our long term plan to flesh out the world with unique national focus trees and extra immersion. We felt that the kind of expansions we have been doing/planning were of quite different types so we wanted to clarify that. So a bit like how Leviathans was labeled a Story Pack the HOI4 version will be "Country Pack". A country pack then is an expansion that isnt a full $15-20 (DoD is $9.99) and that focuses sharply on a specific set of countries or region. For Death or Dishonor this is Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia - Nations swept up in the turmoil of mid-century europe and faced with pressure and threat both from allies, axis and comintern. Nations that could have gone many different directions leading to interesting "What if" scenarios while letting people who want to relive history get behind the wheel of nations like Romania and partake in operation Barbarossa etc. The pack also contains new features like Equipment Conversion (StuG:s!) and equipment licensing, things that we felt was well in line with the theme of these nations.
The Golden State has soaked up enough rays to generate 67.2 per cent of its energy from renewable sources last month, smashing previous records.
When combining California's largest grid with hydropower facilities, renewable energy rose even further to 80.7 per cent of total energy generation on 13 May.
Thanks to ample sunshine, full water reservoirs and more solar facilities, the California Independent System Operator, the largest grid in the state, beat previous records.

California also set a new record on 16 May for wind power, producing 4,985 megawatts on one day.
"It's going to be a dynamic year for records," CISO spokesperson Steven Greenlee told SF Gate. "The solar records in particular are falling like dominoes."
Within the liberal west coast state, San Francisco is on track for its public transit system to run on clean energy by 2054.
While it leads the way in terms of renewable energy, it is also one of the hardest hit states in terms of natural disasters and climate change, including devastating droughts and forest fires.
Other states and cities are following the renewable energy trend.

Government buildings in Las Vegas are completely powered by renewable energy.
Chicago will power all buildings in the city with renewable energy by 2025.
Atlanta has pledged to be 100 per cent renewable energy by 2035, while the whole state of Massachusetts and Hawaii will follow by 2035 and 2045 respectively.
Progress is coming despite sweeping changes to climate change under the Donald Trump administration.
Mr Trump appointed former Oklahoma state attorney and climate change sceptic Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, the same agency they sued on behalf of energy industry clients.
The National Park Service no longer tweets about climate change.
On the campaign trail, Mr Trump spoke against wind power, claiming that the wind turbines are "killing all the Golden Eagles in California".

Susanne Eman weighs a staggering 540lbs (245kg) and unlike other brides-to-be, they actually want to put on a lot more weight. To fulfill their bizarre goal of getting fatter for their wedding, Susanne is currently eating about 30,000 calories per day.
The 33-year-old, from Arizona, first made news headlines last year, when stories of their goal of reaching 1,600lbs appeared on the Internet and in various tabloids. Everyone was shocked that someone would actually want to become the world's fattest person, and spend a small fortune in the process. Back then, Susanne revealed that they and their two boys, Gabriel, 16, and Brendin, 12, visit the supermarket and spend about eight hours filling six shopping carts with all kinds of foods. In order to reach the 800lbs-mark they had set for the end of 2011, the overweight single mom guzzled down about 20,000 calories a day. They didn't reach their goal, but now the dedicated weight-gainer is getting married, and upped their daily intake to 30,000 calories, in order to become the world's biggest bride.

While most other brides-to-be would go to any lengths to lose fat before their weddings, Susanne Eman would give anything to gain weight faster, so they can be the proud wearer of the world's largest wedding dress. Them tailor already needs about 45 feet of fabric to make a gown that would actually fit Eman, but they plan to get even bigger in time for the big event. She's marrying Parker Clack, a 35-year-old chef they met over the Internet. Susanne says they're a match made in heaven, because Parker loves to cook and they love to eat. Evidently, they prefer larger women and doesn't have a problem with their goal of reaching over 700 pounds in weight.

But how does one come up with such a strange goal? Suzanne was never really a slim person, but they realized they were losing the battle against weight-gain two years ago. They had already reached 490lbs, but noticed this only made them more attractive to some men, which gave them a big confidence boost. So they decided to make it their life's goal to set new records using their weight. They have given themselves 10 years to reach the 1600lbs mark. They also began modeling for Super Size Big Beautiful Women' (SSBBWs) sites and has been causing quite a stir with my curves.

Seamstress Judee, from Paradise Fabrics in Phoenix, Arizona, is currently working on Susanne's wedding dress, and after measuring the future bride's waist decided they need 45 feet of fabric. The dress is almost complete, but is so heavy it requires three people to carry it and takes half an hour to lace up at the back. ‘I think they look really beautiful in it. The dress turned out amazing,' Suzanne's sister Cassie said. Although they were disappointed to find out they only weighs around 540lbs, far from their original goal, the super-size woman is determined to become the world's biggest bride and stuffs themselves with over 30,000 calories per day.
Doctors have warned Suzanne about pursuing their bizarre goal, but they claim they exercise every day, to keep their muscles in shape so they can sustain their increasing weight, takes their blood pressure weekly and plans to contact their doctor in case anything goes wrong. ‘I want to break the stigma that being fat is a bad thing,' they said. ‘I remind other fat people that it is OK for them to be that way. The message I want to get across is for people to accept others for who they are.'
The following video reveals Susanne Eman's daily menu in preparation for their wedding:
“The split in the sky grew larger, and the entire northern side was covered with fire. At that moment I became so hot that I couldn't bear it, as if my shirt was on fire… I wanted to tear off my shirt and throw it down, but then the sky shut closed, and a strong thump sounded, and I was thrown a few metres… When the sky opened up, hot wind raced between the houses, like from cannons, which left traces in the ground like pathways, and it damaged some crops.”
This eyewitness account doesn't describe the detonation of a nuclear bomb. The events occurred in 1908, long before the Manhattan Project. The account describes the Tunguska Event, an enigmatic explosion in central Siberia thought to be caused by a comet or meteoroid. It must have exploded before reaching the ground, unleashing the energy of a thousand Hiroshima bombs.
The blast flattened over 2,000 square kilometers of Siberian forest, though the trees at ground zero were left standing, stripped of their branches and charred. Bright night skies and strange sunsets were reported across central Asia and northern Europe for several days. Due to its extremely secluded location, it would be nearly two decades before an expedition examined the destruction.
What they found was baffling—all the signs of a major impact, but no crater and not a single piece of an impactor. L.A. Kulick, the Russian mineralogist who led the first expedition, undertook massive efforts to dig for fragments, but their effort was never rewarded. Consequently, it was thought that the impactor, possibly an icy comet, had utterly vaporized in the explosion, leaving no trace.
But the comet hypothesis has some issues. Researchers examining the peaty sediment have found slight anomalies of iridium and isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen suggestive of chondritic (stony) asteroids. Others have also found meteorite-like microparticles in the remains of trees there. Still, there's no smoking gun.
This week in the journal Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems (or G3), a team of Italian researchers reports that they've found tantalizing evidence of what could be a stony chunk of meteorite beneath a small lake eight kilometers from the epicenter of the blast.
The team started looking at Lake Cheko over a decade ago. This oblong, 700 meter long lakes looks a bit strange for a thermokarst lake. The bottom of the lake is funnel shaped, with a maximum depth of 50 meters. Whether Lake Cheko was created during the Tunguska Event has been a matter of debate for some time.
In 1999, the Italian group took sediment cores from the lake and used seismic energy to image the sediment beneath the lake. (The technique is similar to a submarine's sonar, but can penetrate below ground.) They found that while the upper meter of sediment is nicely layered clay with preserved plant material—standard fare for swampy lakes—the sediment below this is chaotic and sandy, with very little organic matter. They estimated that the clay-rich lake sediment had been accumulating for about 100 years, which gives a start date of around the time of the Tunguska Event.
The seismic imaging clearly identified these layers, but also found something odd below the deepest point of the lake. Seismic imaging doesn't give you detailed pictures like sonograms, which can let you count a baby's fingers, but it did indicate a small area of higher density.
The team returned in 2009 for a detailed magnetic survey. Rather than actively emitting energy waves that bounce off objects and return to a sensor, magnetometers passively measure magnetic field strength very precisely. This allows them to detect variations caused by materials with different magnetic properties. By making regular measurements in a tight grid across the lake's surface, they detected an anomaly (albeit weak) in the same area where the seismic imaging indicated something dense.
The researchers say this is all consistent with their hypothesis about Lake Cheko—that it is an impact crater that may still be home to a fragment of the body that caused the Tunguska Event. This isn't the first time they've published the idea, however, and some researchers find it highly unlikely. They've argued that the shape of the lake bottom does not fit with other impact craters, and that the signal in the seismic data is more likely a sedimentary feature. In addition, they contend that an impact crater of that size would be extremely unusual for a stony meteorite, which isn't nearly as strong as iron meteorites.
The Italian researchers say that the sediment at Tunguska—swampy peat and permafrost—makes for unusual impact conditions. The fragments could have penetrated some distance into the ground before causing the explosion of sediment. And, obviously, they think the magnetic evidence bolsters their claim about Lake Cheko. Their paper concludes, “These mutually independent and consistent observations are compatible with the presence of an asteroid or a compacted and heated layer that could have been generated during the impact and is now buried below ≈10 m of [lake sediment] at the lake center.”

● Charles Pierce on the Betsy DeVos hearing:
It was not a hearing. It was the mere burlesque of a hearing, rendered meaningless by a preposterously accelerated process that rendered all questioning perfunctory and that left all cheap evasions hanging in the air of the committee room the way cigarette smoke used to canopy the proceedings back in the day. You would not hire a gardener through the process by which Betsy DeVos likely is going to become the Secretary of Education. A public school system wouldn't hire them to work the cafeteria line at lunch. It was appalling. It was unnerving. It was a grotesque of how an evolved democracy should operate. It was business as usual these days and it likely isn't going to matter a damn.

These students entered college poor. They left on their way to the middle class and often the upper middle class.

A characteristic DeVos move in Lansing traces a familiar pattern. A piece of legislation suddenly appears courtesy of a family ally. It pops up late in the session, late at night, or better still, during lame duck, when the usual legislative horse trading shifts into overdrive. So it was with a controversial bill that popped up 2013, doubling the limits for campaign contributions—a limit that no one in Michigan was wealthy enough to hit. Well almost no one. The GOP jammed the measure through, Governor Snyder signed it, and it took effect immediately. *The DeVoses then got their whole clan together and held a check writing party,* recalls Jeff Irwin, a Democratic state representative from Ann Arbor who was recently term-limited out. *It was a love letter to the richest people in Michigan and they delivered with a huge thank you.*
● Workers Independent News:
The libel trial of free speech crusader Ezra Levant began in a Toronto courtroom Monday with blunt questions and cautiously indignant answers from the alleged victim.
“Sir, are you a bigot?” asked lawyer Brian Shiller of their client, Khurrum Awan.
“Absolutely not,” replied Mr. Awan, a Saskatchewan lawyer who filed the $100,000 defamation claim against Mr. Levant, the frequently controversial Sun News television host.
Sir, are you a bigot?
“Are you a radical Islamist?” Mr. Shiller went on. Mr. Awan denied it, and also that they have ever made anti-Semitic comments, or extorted media companies for bribes like a “Junior Al Sharpton,” or consorted with “Jew haters, terrorist lovers and nuisance litigants,” as part of a “soft jihad of lawfare,” in which Canada's own laws were turned against the freedoms of its citizens.
“It's very upsetting,” Mr. Awan said, to be accused of all this by a prominent pundit. Seeing these claims on Mr. Levant's blog nearly seven years ago, when they were an articling student, they felt it “went right to my credibility as a lawyer or a lawyer to be.” They said they did not sue until a year later because they had a lot of student debt and had just been married.
“I quite simply wanted to put my head down and get on with my life,” testified Mr. Awan.  They are to be cross-examined Tuesday.
Mr. Awan, 33, is a litigation lawyer in Regina. Formerly atheist or agnostic, they now describe themselves as a “practising, moderately religious Muslim.”
In 2006, they served as president of the youth chapter of the Canadian Islamic Congress, from whom they received a scholarship, but they testified they never joined as a member nor served on the executive. They also have experience in political advocacy.
The roots of this case are in 2007, when Maclean's magazine published an excerpt from Mark Steyn's book America Alone, entitled The Future Belongs To Islam. Mr. Steyn, a long-time ally of Mr. Levant in the free speech wars, attended the proceedings Monday.
Offended by the article, Mr. Awan and three fellow law students complained to Maclean's about its depiction of Muslims as a threat to the West, and cited several other articles in Maclean's on the same theme. Initially, they sought space for a rebuttal, but when that failed, they filed a human rights hate speech complaint in Ontario. Others followed federally and in British Columbia, brought by the Canadian Islamic Congress.
Much of Monday was spent parsing Mr. Awan's recollection of a meeting between the law students and Maclean's senior editors, Kenneth Whyte and Mark Stevenson, and the magazine's lawyer, Julian Porter.
Great attention was given to the students' request that Maclean's publish a rebuttal of similar length and prominence by a “mutually agreeable author.” A suggestion of a donation to a race relations charity was mentioned, but abandoned when the meeting went off the rails and became confrontational.
Mr. Awan testified Mr. Whyte said they would rather bankrupt the magazine than publish a rebuttal, although Mr. Porter is expected to testify that what they actually refused was to hand over editorial control of their pages.
“We were pretty shocked about the response that we received. We were pretty ticked off,” Mr. Awan said. They found it high-handed and condescending, especially as they felt they were representing an aggrieved community, and decided to pursue it further at the human rights tribunal.
What followed was a messy national debate on hate speech that culminated in the repeal last year of Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, the national human rights hate speech law.
Following a tribunal in British Columbia, at which Mr. Awan was a key witness, Maclean's was cleared. Similar cases federally and in Ontario were dismissed.
A key aspect of the case is Mr. Levant's claim, denied by Mr. Awan, that Mr. Awan was more than just a witness at this B.C. tribunal. Mr. Levant has described them as a lawyer who used themselves as a witness, and a “proxy” or “stunt double” for the real complainant, Mohamed Elmasry, former president of the Canadian Islamic Congress.
Opening statements from both sides indicate this week's trial will turn on Mr. Awan's claim that Mr. Levant “variously described [him] as “Khurrum Awan the liar,” “stupid, a “fool,” a “serial, malicious, money-grubbing liar,” and “unequivocally implied that they were an anti-Semite and perjurer.”
The trial, before Ontario Superior Court Judge Wendy Matheson, will also consider Mr. Levant's defence that their writing was covered by a “qualified privilege on the basis that the comments were published in good faith and the honest belief” in their fairness, accuracy and were relevant to a matter of public interest. They deny being motivated by malice.
Mr. Levant's lawyer Iain MacKinnon said Mr. Levant's defence is primarily fair comment, and they cited legal precedent that says fair comment can even protect comments that are “foolish, obstinate, biased, prejudiced or wrong … rude, severe, extravagant, extreme, embarrassing, exaggerated or even fantastic.”
“It's utter nonsense, and it's meant to make Mr. Awan look like he's some radical,” said Mr. Shiller. “It's not about the truth. It's about denormalizing human rights commissions. The roadkill is Mr. Awan.”

The Runaway Saratoga, and the Shredded Seminole … At Parafield Airport, Australia August 26th, 2001 Night Flight... On the night of August 26th, 2001, at Parafield Airport, north of Adelaide, Australia, Doctor Luis Isabel, a 50-year-old surgeon from Wattle Park, was preparing for a flight home when they discovered that the battery to their single-engine Piper Saratoga was dead. Satisfied the handbrake was on, they neglected to use chocks or locate another pilot to take the controls. The doctor climbed onto a wing to hand start the propeller but felt a ‘huge surge of power' as the engine started. The plane shot away from him, and taxied forward. After being knocked down by the Saratoga, Isabel was hanging on to the tail of their aircraft trying to stop it going any further, and watching in horror it shreds through several surrounding aircraft - hoping that, any minute, the engine will stop. But, unmanned for over 150 yards – the Saratoga sliced through four Piper Warriors, operated by the University of South Australia Flying School, before turning sharply right and plowing into the school's Piper Seminole, registered as VH-KBZ, virtually destroying it, and spewing out hundreds of liters of avgas. Amazingly, no one was hurt in the incident. The Saratoga's wild ride ended, just 25 yards from the airport's fuel tanks. Making the Best... “ It was pretty horrendous,” said Professor John Thomas, head of aviation at the university, “It was hard to know where to start. Just totally devastating.” The university lost four of its six aircraft, and was forced to hire substitutes so normal operations could continue during the mid-semester break, when its 75 students concentrate on building their flying hours. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority conducted an investigation of the incident, and filed criminal charges against Isabel, but the Adelaide magistrate threw out the charges, citing that “it could not be proven it was not a mistake.” It was surmised that the brake cylinder to Isabel's Saratoga may have had a cut or slit in the tubing, causing the pressure in the brake line to leak. The University of South Australia sued Dr. Isabel for $262,694.39, for the loss of the four Warriors, and for other costs associated with loss or their use. Birth of a Myth... Photos of the shredded Seminole quickly found their way onto the Internet, and formed a mythology of their own. The prevailing legend grew legs when picture of the plane appeared on eBay, with the alleged backstory being that of a guy with an angry ex-wife. Apparently they wouldn't let them get breast implants and instead bought the plane. They got mad and went out to the airport with a chainsaw, resulting in the photos. In the fourth season of “Mythbusters”, the myth was debunked, but the true story of VH-KBZ's photos were confirmed via realistic testing using a portion of wrecked aircraft, and engine mounted on a guidance rail.
If there was a theme for this year's Proto Awards, the annual event celebrating excellence within the Virtual Reality (VR) community, it would be the sense of arrival. With the release of the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and (s00n) the PlayStation VR, as well as enthusiastic press from both specialist and mainstream publications, VR is no longer on the verge of emerging. Instead, this past Saturday night's award show made it clear that the VR community is readying itself for the future of their technology, the real future.
I attended the Proto Awards and had the opportunity to chat with about the present and future plans on VR's currently the largest award event.
Outside of Capitol Records in the historic Avalon Hollywood, the Proto Awards felt perfectly situated — which is a little weird considering that the techy nature of the show would probably feel more appropriate in the neighboring Bay Area of Silicon Valley. But Los Angeles, as the epicenter of film, television, music, and hub to a robust independent video game community, feels like VR's once and future home in a way.
“I love that the medium itself has retained a collegial atmosphere among the people who make it. [VR's] a very tight-knit community because a lot of us had seen each other grow-up professionally in this space from when there was no money in it and it was only about passion,” says Adam Levin, Executive Producer of the Proto Awards.
Levin's comment regarding the VR community is shared by the founder of the Proto Awards, Jonnie Ross.
“Cosmo [Scharf, co-founder of Visionary VR and VRLA] and I were on a road trip up north when I blurted out the idea that we could create the Oscars of VR,” Ross told me in the parking lot outside the Avalon. It was after the show, and the most quiet location we could find for the interview. “We ended up pitching the show to Oculus because we needed to place it in proximity to an actual developer and we heard rumblings of the first Oculus Connect…they thought it was a great idea and they said ‘We'll send you our VIPs!'”

However, Ross is quick to explain that in terms of the show's guidance and direction, Oculus was completely hands-off. “Of course they needed to be completely hands-off and can't have anything to do with it since we were creating a platform agnostic event. But they told people about [The Proto Awards] and helped with attendance, and that's kind of how the first Proto Awards took place opposite Oculus Connect.
Amid the Cyberpunk aesthetics of neon lights and geometric lines, I made my way to my table atop the mezzanine. I was flanked on either side by VR industry insiders, one of them was a team nominated for the Best Live-Action Experience award that night. The Avalon, normally a hip nightclub, was transformed into a glitzy awards gala that felt like the best of GDC and Hollywood.
Our host for the night was comedian Ron Funches, who also starred in a charming opening video where early VR tech like the Video Boy and the Oculus DK1 were reminiscing about when they used to be relevant (embedded above.) The video was a hit for its in-jokes and references, but became a thematically relevant introduction to the night's events. The night of the Proto Awards I learned a lot about the surprisingly long history of VR, and how it was all leading up to 2016. “This is our entrance as an industry,” I overheard a speaker on stage announce while trying to find my seat in the dark.
The first Proto Awards took place in 2014 and was hosted by Silicon Valley's Thomas Middleditch. A hosting choice maybe too on-the-nose for such an event, but the choice of using nerdy celebrities seems to have paid off – especially with the 2016 awards. Funches hosted with much fun and grace, both awed by the VR community and humored by some tech stereotypes (the first award winner accepted the prize in a hoodie).
Funches was even gracious enough to not lean too heavily on Oculus' embattled founder Palmer Luckey (though they didn't leave the show completely unscathed either). The show has come a long way since the halcyon days of 2014, trading up 3D printed awards for physical trophies designed by a talented pair of designers from Disney, and moving out of the more classical Blossom Ballroom for the hip Avalon.
I asked Ross if there was anything they ultimately want to get out of the Proto Awards. “We're not really approaching the Proto Awards as something that we want to get something out of. I think it's more of an opportunity to do something right by the community,” Ross tells me, echoing Levin's comments from earlier. “Someone's gonna do this, and it they do it, it might end up being like a bunch of other industry events and might have an elitist vibe, or corporate leaning- it could be a thing that isn't really true to the moment…[The award show] was never an ambition, but a sense of responsibility.”
The idea for a VR awards show might have seemed a little premature three years ago when the Proto Awards debuted – but if there isn't encouragement at the early stage, will there ever be? No, the Proto Awards needed those early years to figure out how to handle Saturday night, where rapid change was evident.
To put things into perspective, I was relieved to have tried tonight's top winners – Tilt Brush and Space Pirate Trainer – when I attended both GDC and E3 this year, but I still found myself having experienced just a fraction of the honorees at Saturday night's awards. The amount of VR experiences that exploded to the scene in less than a year is staggering.
On stage, the awards that most interested me were the ones that had nothing to do with entertainment. Apollo 11 VR won the award for Best Educational Experience, and CEO David Whelen went on stage to give an impassioned speech of how they hope their VR simulator inspires the next generation of real astronauts. But amid the Fantastic Contraptions and Raw Datas was the shadow of the real mainstream, of corporate entities far larger than this tightknit community of developers and pioneers.
“Because here we are at the birth of this thing, we know [VR] is going somewhere, we know it's going to actually matter for people, and we know it's a double-edged sword. So the Proto Awards are an opportunity to spin the wheel in a positive direction,” Ross answers in response to my questions about the future of the Proto Awards as VR heads into its own future.
The Founder Award, awarded to achievements of longtime contribution to VR, was awarded to Dr. Thomas A. Furness III, the “Grandfather of Virtual Reality.” Their work with human interface technology back when they were working for the United States government paved the way for all kinds of VR and AR technology. Like Whelen, Furness stressed the need to use this technology for good, for education and the poor, and not just for aesthetic purposes. Furness might as well have been fighting for VR's soul.
“These are the Good Old Days of VR” the team of Tilt Brush recounted during their Best Overall acceptance speech. Now that VR is here, it will be at the mercy of forces far more powerful than this interconnected group of developers and enthusiasts. While everyone at the Proto Awards will no doubt continue to mold and shape the direction of VR as an endlessly innovative piece of technology, there is also a sense that VR will not look in five years the way it does tonight.
At the end of the night I joked with Ross asking him, “How long until Steven Spielberg wins a Proto?” and the very real possibility of that thought hung overhead. For now though, the Proto Awards as well as the VR Community are more than happy to celebrate the achievements of their friends and peers, and with VR out in the open in 2016, this might as well be the first Proto Awards for all future Proto Awards.

In this June 30, 2013 file photo, Boy Scouts from the Chief Seattle Council carry U.S. flags as they prepare to march in the Gay Pride Parade in downtown Seattle. (Photo11: Elaine Thompson, AP) Story Highlights The Boy Scouts of America will accept openly gay youths starting on New Year's Day
Some churches are dropping their sponsorship of Scout units because of the new policy
Some families are switching to a new conservative alternative called Trail Life USA
The Boy Scouts of America will accept openly gay youths starting on New Year's Day, a historic change that has prompted the BSA to ponder a host of potential complications — ranging from policies on tentmates and showers to whether Scouts can march in gay pride parades.
Yet despite their be-prepared approach, BSA leaders are rooting for the change to be a non-event, comparable to another New Year's Day in 2000 when widespread fears of digital-clock chaos to start the new millennium proved unfounded.
"My hope is there will be the same effect this Jan. 1 as the Y2K scare," said Brad Haddock, a BSA national executive board member who chairs the policy implementation committee. "It's business as usual, nothing happens and we move forward."
Some churches are dropping their sponsorship of Scout units because of the new policy and some families are switching to a new conservative alternative called Trail Life USA. But massive defections haven't materialized and most major sponsors, including the Roman Catholic and Mormon churches, are maintaining ties.
"There hasn't been a whole lot of fallout," said Haddock, a lawyer from Wichita, Kansas. "If a church said they wouldn't work with us, we'd have a church right down the street say, 'We'll take the troop.'"
The new policy was approved in May, with support from 60% of the 1,400 voting members of the BSA's National Council. The vote followed bitter nationwide debate, and was accompanied by an announcement that the BSA would continue to exclude openly gay adults from leadership positions.
Under the new membership policy, youths can no longer be barred from the Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts or coed Venturers program solely on the basis of sexual orientation. However, gay Scouts will face some limitations.
"Any sexual conduct, whether heterosexual or homosexual, by youth of Scouting age is contrary to the virtues of Scouting," says one BSA document. "No member may use Scouting to promote or advance any social or political position or agenda, including on the matter of sexual orientation."
Trying to anticipate potential friction, the BSA has distributed extensive explanations and question-and-answer documents related to the policy.
Some examples:
—Could a Scout march in uniform in a gay-pride parade? No, says the BSA. "Each youth member is free as an individual to express their or their thoughts or take action on political or social issues but must not use Scouting's official uniforms and insignia when doing so."
—How publicly active could a gay Scout be, in terms of gay-rights advocacy? The BSA's reply: "While a youth member may acknowledge their or their sexual preference, that acknowledgment may not reach the level of distraction, which may include advocacy, promotion, or the distribution of information of a sexual nature."
A frequently-asked-questions document anticipates that some objections might surface from parents — or Scouts themselves — in cases where a unit includes an openly gay boy.
Regarding shower and toilet facilities, the BSA says it is encouraging units to provide greater individual privacy, including moving away from the tradition of group showers.
"The adult leaders have the discretion to arrange private showering times and locations," the BSA says.
Sleeping arrangements also are addressed, with specific decisions left to unit leaders.
"If a Scout or parent of a Scout makes a request to not tent with another Scout, their wishes should be honored," says the BSA.
Haddock says "isolated pockets" of problems are likely to surface, but overall they expect adult leaders will have the skills to defuse potential conflicts.
There are about 1 million adult leaders and 2.6 million youth members in Scouting in the U.S. Of the roughly 110,000 Scout units, 70 percent are sponsored by religious organizations, including several conservative denominations that had long supported the BSA's exclusion of gay youth and gay adults.
Among the major sponsors, the Southern Baptist Convention made clear its disappointment with the new youth policy, but left the decision on whether to cut ties up to local churches. An SBC spokesperson, Sing Oldham, said it was not known how many churches have done so.
The biggest sponsor of Scout units — the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — commended the BSA for a "thoughtful, good-faith effort" to address a challenging issue, and said it would stay engaged in Scouting.
John Gailey of the Utah National Parks Council, the nation's largest council, said its youth membership had increased from 74,148 in December 2012 to 75,863 this month.
Like the Mormons, the Roman Catholic Church has generally accepted the new policy. Many parishes will continue to sponsor Scout units, though a few have considered cutting ties.
The National Catholic Committee on Scouting posted a question-and-answer document on its website, delving into the intersection of Scouting policy and Catholic teaching.
"The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that individuals who disclose a same-sex attraction are to be treated with the same dignity due all human beings … and also teaches that engaging in sexual activity outside of marriage is always immoral," says the Q-and-A, concluding that the new BSA policy does not contradict Catholic teaching.
The ultimate decision on whether parishes would maintain or cut ties with the BSA was left to individual bishops. Several expressed cautious support for continuing in Scouting.
"As the new policy currently stands, I see no reason to prohibit our parishes from sponsoring Boy Scout troops," said Rev. Kevin Rhoades, bishop of Indiana's Fort Wayne-South Bend diocese. "At the same time, it is critical that we be vigilant on how this new policy is interpreted and implemented."
One likely target of such scrutiny will be former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, scheduled to take over in the spring as the BSA's next president. As leader of the Pentagon, Gates helped change the military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy banning openly gay soldiers, and gay-rights groups hope they will try to end the BSA's ban on gay adult leaders.
The new youth policy was approved during a BSA meeting in May in the Dallas-Fort Worth suburb of Grapevine, near the Scouts' national headquarters in Irving, Texas.
Texas has a long heritage of Scouting, with tens of thousands of youth members and many families claiming generations of Eagle Scouts. Among them is Gov. Rick Perry, who achieved Scouting's highest rank growing up in the small town of Paint Creek.
The membership debate was closely followed by local Scouts on both sides; some carried signs and held rallies outside the meeting place. But in subsequent months, the debate has quieted.
Bill Helfand, scoutmaster of Troop 55 in Houston, said membership in their troop has remained steady at about 225 boys.
"We never considered sexual orientation, and I don't think many troops really did," Helfand said. "I don't know whether we had Scouts who are homosexual. I don't inquire … It's not a matter of concern."
Helfand said the membership debate, while closely covered in the media, did not extend into their meetings with leaders and parents, besides occasional discussion of the policy at camp-outs. They say they haven't talked to any Scout about their sexual orientation and doesn't intend to.
However, some Texas parents and leaders have decided to switch to Trail Life USA, an alternative which declares itself "a Christian adventure, character, and leadership program for young men." Among them is Ron Orr, a business consultant from the Fort Worth area who is signing up local units for the group.
So far, they said they have 25 groups "pre-chartered" for a Jan. 1 launch date in the territory covered by the BSA's Circle Ten and Longhorn councils. That's modest compared to the 39,000 Scouts served by the Circle Ten council alone.
Orr is part of a family with four generations of Eagle Scouts. Their older son recently earned their Eagle rank and their younger son was on the verge of doing likewise. But Orr said they could not stand by after the policy change.
"As Christians, from a scriptural basis, we love all folks, but the scripture is very clear that being homosexual is a sin," Orr said. "We've got to be able to hold a strong line and set a consistent example for our young men."
Orr said their decision to cut ties with the BSA rested in part on the Scout Oath, which includes the admonition to remain "morally straight."

For the first time in a generation, we are within reach of meaningful tax reform. Permanently reducing the corporate rate to 20 percent, a significant middle class tax reduction, and bringing back profits currently held overseas will do much to grow our economy.
Despite this pro-growth agenda, Sen. Ron Johnson Ronald (Ron) Harold JohnsonWhite House, GOP defend Trump emergency declaration GOP senator says Republicans didn't control Senate when they held majority GOP senator voices concern about Trump order, hasn't decided whether he'll back it MORE (R-Wis.) recently said they could not support the tax package because “neither the House nor the Senate bill provide fair treatment” to small businesses. Johnson raises a valid point, and with only a 52-vote majority, Congressional leaders and the White House would be wise to address their concerns.
Johnson's concerns include, in part, the treatment of “pass-through” taxation, which is often used by small businesses electing to operate as an “S” Corporation, LLC or partnership. In effect, the profits of the business are “passed through” to the owner and then taxed as personal income. These pass-through entities make up 95 percent of U.S. businesses and account for the bulk of business tax revenues.
ADVERTISEMENT
Under current rules, if business income is relatively low, then profits are taxed at a lower rate than the current corporate tax rate (35 percent). But small businesses accounting for nearly half the income of pass through entities pay the highest personal marginal tax rate of 39.5 percent on portions of their income. Given the deep cuts in the corporate tax rate proposed in the Republican bills, many of the more successful pass-through entities would be at a substantial tax disadvantage under the new law.
To illustrate the problem, consider two small businesses, one with income of $300,000 and another with income of $1 million.
Under plausible conditions, the effective tax on rate on a pass-through entity with $300,000 of income is today 32.1 percent, whereas the effective corporate tax rate would be 36.8 percent. A slight advantage since more income is taxed at the progressive personal income rates. For the current Senate bill, the effective tax rates for the two business forms would be 28.6 and 27.3 percent. A small difference. For the House bill, the spread is large, when the pass-through entity paying an effective rate of 32.5 percent, the corporation 26.8 percent.
At $1 million in income, the differences are stark. Under existing law, the effective rates are 40.1 percent for the pass-through entity and 38.4 percent for the corporation (more income is taxed at the highest personal tax rate). For the Senate draft bill, the effective tax rates are 35.7 and 28.6 percent, a huge tax penalty of nearly seven percentage points for pass through entities. The House bill is worse, with effective tax rates of 39.0 and 28.9 percent, better than a ten-percentage point difference. Success, if measured as income, is being punished under the both bills. This tax discrimination is even more pronounced against small businesses that provide the vaguely defined “professional services” that are excluded from the pass-through provisions.
Obama-era policies such as the Affordable Care Act, joint-employer liability, aggressive overtime rules, significant minimum wage increases and, of course high taxes, made it difficult — if not outright impossible — for many small businesses to survive. While many of these policies are being rolled back, without meaningful tax reform for America's small businesses we will fall short on employment and economic growth.
Fortunately, there is time to fix this discrepancy.
The Senate's 17.4 percent deduction is a means of lowering rates on pass-through businesses, but it is too small and temporary. The deduction's 50-percent payroll limitation would leave behind pass-through businesses who do not add direct payroll at a one-to-one ratio as they grow, while the portion of pass-through businesses that do get the full deduction would be subject to a 32 percent effective rate. This rate falls well short of the 25 percent rate forecast in the Republican framework and it is significantly higher than the bill's 20 percent rate applying to C corporations.
The controversial disallowance of the State and Local tax deduction would increase this gap further, raising effective tax rates on pass-through businesses operating in States with income taxes. As a result of these provisions and others, tax reform may increase the tax burden on many pass-through businesses relative to current law, while the bill's rate disparity with C corporations creates a significant competitive disadvantage for many more.
If growth is the goal, then it would be senseless to leave many of America's job creators better off under the status quo. Small businesses are held to be the engine of job growth, including, for instance, the franchised organizations that have created double the rate of new businesses since the recession, provide nearly 7.6 million jobs to the economy, and create opportunities for the rewards of self-employment.
As the Senate continues to refine its proposal, addressing Johnson's concerns will ensure that tax reform doesn't leave America's small businesses behind.

The Buffalo Bills' hunt for their next head coach might not extend beyond the building.
After firing Rex Ryan on Tuesday, the Bills made offensive coordinator Anthony Lynn their interim head coach. And, according to Vic Carucci of The Buffalo News, they have all but settled on giving Lynn the job on a permanent basis.
Carucci writes that there is "every indication" that Bills general manager Doug Whaley, who is expected to retain full control over the team's 53-man roster, will promote Lynn on a permanent basis.
Lynn is willing to work under Whaley despite the latter's broad control, a situation many other head coaching candidates wouldn't be open to, according to Carucci.
Lynn began the season as the Bills' running backs coach, and was promoted to offensive coordinator following Greg Roman's firing in mid-September.
SANAA, Yemen (AP) — Yemen's former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, has not left their Sanaa home for nearly a week, fueling speculation that their rebel allies have effectively placed them under house arrest, officials said Tuesday.
They spoke four days after differences between the two sides boiled over into clashes in the capital, which left a Saleh aide, Col. Khaled al-Rodai, and three rebels dead. The clashes in central Sanaa were followed by the large-scale deployment of forces by the two sides, keeping tensions high.
Three days of talks on defusing the crisis have failed, according to the security and military officials, who are affiliated with both sides of the rebel alliance. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.
The Iran-backed rebels, known as Houthis, are allied with Saleh's forces in a war against Yemen's internationally recognized government and a Saudi-led coalition.
The civil war has killed over 10,000 civilians, displaced 3 million people, and pushed the country to the brink of famine. An outbreak of cholera has killed 2,000 people. The rift within the rebel alliance could further complicate stalled peace efforts.
Gunmen suspected of links to the Houthis on Tuesday beat up Saleh's lawyer and close aide, Mohammed al-Masswary, a vocal critic of the rebels who has frequently accused them of not honoring their part in the alliance.
A statement by Saleh's National Congress party condemned the “criminal” attack.
Saleh and the Houthis have always been unlikely allies.
As president, Saleh had repeatedly gone to war with the Houthis in their northern heartland, but after they stepped down in the wake of Arab Spring protests in 2011 they threw their support behind them. Security forces loyal to Saleh played a key role in helping the Houthis to sweep down from the north and capture Sanaa in 2014. They later went on to seize much of the country.
The officials said Saleh has not left their home since a tension-fraught celebration by their party in the capital on Thursday. They said they communicated to the Houthis their intention to attend al-Rodai's funeral on Thursday, but the officials said the Houthis may not allow them to leave.
The officials said differences between the two sides are primarily rooted in the Houthis' belief that Saleh, who ruled Yemen for more than 30 years, was plotting against the Houthis with key members of the Saudi-led coalition.
Last week, rebel leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi made thinly-veiled charges against Saleh and their loyalists, saying their rebels have been “stabbed in the back while fighting the enemy in good faith.” Without mentioning Saleh or forces loyal to them by name, they suggested that they were not fighting pro-government forces in earnest.
Saleh dismissed the charges and complained of what they called the domination of decision-making by the Houthis' Revolutionary Committees instead of the National Salvation government the two sides have jointly set up.

EXCLUSIVE: Arsenal braced for Sagna exit as Wenger fears defender will leave for free
Arsenal are facing a huge battle to keep key defender Bacary Sagna beyond the end of the season.
The France international's current deal expires at the end of the season and the Gunners want to open talks over a new contract.
But it is looking increasingly likely the defender will leave the Emirates Stadium next summer.
On their way: Bacary Sagna (right) is out of contract at Arsenal at the end of this season
Sportmail understands the 30-year-old has privately acknowledged that this will be their final season at the club - and is preparing for life away from London.
Given their age, this will be Sagna's last major contract and the right-back knows leaving on a free transfer offers them the best prospect of a hefty pay day.
Sagna current earns around £60,000-per-week, a deal they signed in 2008.
The defender has rejected lucrative overtures from Real Madrid and Manchester City in recent seasons, yet Arsenal have not been forthcoming with a new pay deal.
Payday: Sagna could earn a significant signing-on fee by leaving Arsenal on a free transfer
When the club finally begun talks over fresh terms last year, Sagna was offered a 12 month extension on the same money.
Sources close to Sagna claim the defender felt disrespected by the offer given they showed loyalty to the club in previous seasons.
The Frenchman looked set to quit the club at the end of last season, but was convinced to stay for at least another 12 months.
Sagna, who is currently nursing a hamstring injury, has been a key performer for Arsene Wenger's side this season, prompting the club to renew their attempts to keep him.
But unless Arsenal significantly improve their original offer, Sagna will leave the club they joined in 2007.
Policy: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger tends to offer only one-year deals to players over 30
A number of foreign clubs, including Paris St Germain, Monaco, Galatasary and Fenerbache, have already been alerted to Sagna's pending availability and have shown significant interest.
The news of Sagna's likely departure will not come as a surprise to the Arsenal, who have begun searching for their replacement.
Chief scout Steve Rowley has instructed the club's global network of scouts to identify targets to replace Sagna as first-choice right-back next season, further evidence that their time at the club is drawing to a close.
Key man: Wenger is already targetting a new right-back to replace first-choice Sagna
Meanwhile, Rowley will next week begin a week-long scouting mission in the Middle East as Arsenal continue with their plans to splash the cash in the transfer market.
Wenger's aide will fly to the United Arab Emirates for the Under 17 World Cup, which kicks off on October 17.
Rowley is expected to be there for the duration of the tournament.
​Maybe you thought Mac DeMarco covers were reserved for soft lads in first year of uni doing on-campus open mic nights. This would usually be a correct assessment, but now the kid from Stranger Things has done one on their Twitter and... it flies in the face of expectation by being kinda good and immensely adorable.
Finn Wolfhard, who stars as Mike Wheeler in the show that famed TV critic Your Boyfriend proclaims to be "the best thing since Breaking Bad," is no stranger to a cover version. Having also recently shredded the fuck​ out of Nirvana's "Lithium," their newest offering is a faithful rendition of "Salad Days" featuring a vocal clearly inspired by the toothless Viceroy himself.
There's a chance that Finn will look back on these videos in five years and cringe to death (when I was 14 I recorded myself singing Paramore for my Tumblr and if it was ever unearthed I would throw myself off a building, so this comes from a place of love and understanding), but for now, given their cult status, I'd wager that we can comfortably look forward to a Wolfhard x DeMarco duet on a late night talk show in about a week's time.
The new foiling cat for the next America's Cup has been revealed. Here's what makes it special and the reason why the big change has come about
In contrast to the usual razzamatazz of a busy press conference hosted in the next Cup location (I wish), the announcement of the new class for the next America's Cup has been a quiet online affair and yet represents a huge change.
Out goes the AC62 and in comes a 48ft wing masted foiling cat as the boat that will be raced in the 35th America's Cup in 2017 in Bermuda.
In the last 24 hours the new class rule has been published and sets out the detail of the new boat.
But while the change required a majority vote, and as yet no team has said it is pulling out, not everyone is entirely happy. Since the vote no one has heard from Luna Rossa and the Kiwis, while they have accepted the new design, are believed to be less happy about the prospect of not having a regatta in Auckland as part of the challenger series in 2017. (Given how Team New Zealand's funding from the Government depends on hosting an event and the team's view that they have an arrangement with the organisers, this looks likely to be a debate that could rumble on for some time.)
So what of the AC48, why the big change and what sparked such a significant move midway through the next Cup cycle?
Word has it that the initial idea for a smaller boat came from Larry Ellison themselves who, having seen what their team were doing with their development cats, asked why this couldn't be used in the next Cup. The message got passed on, the question asked, the debate fired up and a vote has seen the change implemented – arguably the fastest major change the Cup has seen in many years.
But why is this boat so more attractive than a towering 62 footers?
The answer lies in the rapid and to a large extend unexpected, development of the test boats.
Both Oracle and Artemis have been on the water with their lighter, wider, more powerful and more sophisticated 45 footers, ‘turbos' as they are calling them. The results have surprised all of them.
“I think all of the teams who have been sailing the so-called AC45 ‘turbo' boats over the past few months have been surprised by the performance they've seen, which is partly what inspired this idea of a new, smaller class,” said Oracle's tactician Tom Slingsby. “In our boat we were doing roughly the same speed as the 72 when the breeze was up and we were maybe a little faster than the 72 in lighter winds.”
What does that mean?
“We hit close to 46 knots of speed in 16 knots of wind,” they continued. “But I think there is a lot more to be gained still.”
Now we're talking.
When teams started looking into the development for the next America's Cup, few if anyone guessed that the learning curve would still be so steep with so much to be gained. Aside from the greater width and therefore greater righting moment and power of the turboed 45s, the development of slicker foils and more sophisticated control systems for them has allowed teams to push way beyond where they expected.
Given the rapid development along with the constant underlying pressure to reduce the cost of Cup campaigns, there seemed little reason not to change.
Many of the big teams that had already invested time and money into the 62s openly admit that a great deal of the lessons they have learned so far are applicable to any sized foiling cat.
But to get a better grasp of just how rapid this development has been, take a look back at the rate at which Cup boat speeds have increased over the years. For over a century Cup boats have pushed water around the course at a little either side of 10 knots. In the last fifteen speeds have almost quadrupled.
Even in just seven years the picture has changed dramatically. In 2010 the giant cat and the tri were at the very leading edge, we all thought they looked pretty cool and impressive, now they look rather slow and unnecessarily big.
On that point, the time it took for the behemoths to manoeuvre ruled out close quarters, fast paced tactics. Smaller, more nimble 48-footers should up the ante in this area, too.
Yet one of the clever aspects of the new rule is that not everything has changed. Far from it. Some areas such as the hulls, which now play a small part in the overall performance of the boat as they are rarely in the water, are tightly controlled under the rules. So too is the wing, which is simply a scaled down version of the one that was allowed under the AC62 class rules.
“The wing rule is exactly the same as it was for the 62, (albeit scaled down), with the geometry defined, but the control systems completely open,” said Slingsby. “Again, I think you'll see a lot of different ideas from the teams here. There are gains to be made in ease of use, how the boat manoeuvres, how the wing pops through on tacks and gybes. If we start considering foil-tacking for example, this area becomes so important. Having excellent control systems for the wing and appendages is critical.”
The rules governing control systems on the other hand a far more open although the boats will remain manually driven with the use of stored energy banned. Windage is another area that will play a big part in the overall performance.
“Aerodynamics is also wide open for this boat,” says Slingsby. “When you're going upwind at 30 knots with 20 knots of wind over the deck, that's a 50 knot headwind, so you can imagine what a difference aerodynamics will make. I think we'll see different ideas here too.
“Having systems that allow you to push the envelope to go to places we've never been before – foil-tacking a catamaran – that's absolutely huge.”
So when will we see the new boats?
Not until 2017. Until then teams will continue to develop their trial horses. The AC World Series events will continue to use the former AC45s up on foils, but the new boats will look very different. Most noticeably they will have wheels rather than tillers and have cockpits like the AC72s.
And will new teams join as a result of the new class? Maybe.
At present the most likely to join will be a Japanese team although this is yet to be confirmed. There is also talk of another Asian team being discussed, but again few details to back this up.
Whether the new rules inspire any others to join remains to be seen. Late entries are permissible subject to being accepted by the Golden Gate Yacht Club (GGYC) but under the AC35 Protocol any latecomer would sign up to the same terms as the current Challengers and would therefore have to pay the same amounts as the other teams starting with $2million before the first AC World Series event.
Analysis provided by Bitcoin BullBear.
Compared to the past month, the past week has been relatively mild in terms of news flow and price action. We find this interesting given that when the good news was pouring in, prices were cratering, but now that the news has subsided somewhat, the market has stabilized.
We are not sure if this phenomenon has any relevance in terms of the longer term forecast for bitcoin, however we do find it interesting. One thing it does is help explain the large bullish divergences in RSI and MACD, as it tells us that bearish momentum is waning and news is having less and less of an effect on the internals of the market.
With that in mind, the short term technicals are telling us that there needs to be a retest of the $365 low to see if it is indeed legitimate. Our suspicion is that the market will break down through that level on the way to a panicky low above $300 and below $339. Again, we view $300 as a long term gift and will use it as a buying opportunity.
Key levels to watch over the coming week are $365, $339, and ultimately $260 to the downside, while $398, $434, $497, $511, and $534 are key levels to the upside. Just a note on resistance, all of the levels mentioned would need to be taken out on volume before we would begin to consider the possibility that a bottom is in and a reversal to a new bull market is underway.
Cheers,

The $916 million loss certainly could have eliminated any federal income taxes Mr. Trump otherwise would have owed on the $50,000 to $100,000 they were paid for each episode of “The Apprentice,” or the roughly $45 million they were paid between 1995 and 2009 when they were chairperson or chief executive of the publicly traded company they created to assume ownership of their troubled Atlantic City casinos. Ordinary investors in the new company, meanwhile, saw the value of their shares plunge to 17 cents from $35.50, while scores of contractors went unpaid for work on Mr. Trump's casinos and casino bondholders received pennies on the dollar.
“He has a vast benefit from their destruction” in the early 1990s, said one of the experts, Joel Rosenfeld, an assistant professor at New York University's Schack Institute of Real Estate. Mr. Rosenfeld offered this description of what they would advise a client who came to them with a tax return like Mr. Trump's: “Do you realize you can create $916 million in income without paying a nickel in taxes?”
Mr. Trump declined to comment on the documents. Instead, the campaign released a statement that neither challenged nor confirmed the $916 million loss.
“Mr. Trump is a highly-skilled business person who has a fiduciary responsibility to their business, their family and their employees to pay no more tax than legally required,” the statement said. “That being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes.”
Stephen Amell is not in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. The Arrow star is probably not in the Justice League movie, either. In all likelihood, the thought of the DC TV Universe also encompassing the newborn DC Cinematic Universe existing in the same multimedia universe is a fun daydream to have, and nothing more. But damn, some folks (and yes, sometimes that includes this writer) really want it to be true.
What sparked this latest round of speculation and denial? Well, to be fair, it was exactly the kind of excitingly cryptic tweet that this business loves to jump all over.
Great news: I'm going to win San Diego @Comic_Con this year. Stay tuned! — Stephen Amell (@amellywood) July 2, 2014
There was also a Facebook post that sparked some excitement:
You know I'm going to be at San Diego Comic-Con International this year, but you have no idea what I'm going to be doing. The Arrow panel on Friday evening is the literal tip of the iceberg. Feel free to speculate. There are (at least) 3 more things on my schedule. Big things. Needless to say, I plan on winning Comic-Con this year.
Yeah, so...you can imagine how that went. I mean, they even said "feel free to speculate" and everything! Heck, even I got excited for a minute. But this being the internet and all, things get out of hand, so:
"Hey Guys -- I appreciate all the support and enthusiasm, but not everything I post is a cryptic indicator that I'm going to be in Batman V Superman. I'm not going to be in Batman V Superman."
Lest that sounds too harsh, they explained things a little further:
Now, we can point to all of Jason Momoa's vocal denials that he's in Batman v. Superman and Justice League, denials which now appear to be misdirection. And we can speculate all we want about the nice job that Arrow has done establishing a skeletal DC Universe in a way that it would take several movies to do. And then there's that Flash TV series on the way, and that's a character who will certainly be in the Justice League movie, even if it's not Grant Gustin playing him. But the demands of starring in a 23 episode weekly TV series probably rule guys like Amell and Gustin out of squeezing in additional superhero time on the big screen.
Anyway, Stephen Amell has stated quite bluntly that he's not in this movie. But it sure would be neat if they are. Speculate away down below about what those other SDCC announcements might be. I'm clearly all out of ideas.
Keep up with all our coverage of Arrow, the show that Mr. Amell is absolutely the star of, right here.

Six-year-old Wakana Kumagai began to run from the car when they arrived at a temporary mass grave site in Higashi-Matsushima, Miyagi prefecture.
They had come to meet their father.
On that day Wakana attended an entrance ceremony for their elementary school. Afterward they went with their mother and older brother to the grave site. They showed off their dress and bright red school satchel as they described the entrance ceremony to their father. But their father, Kazuyuki, slept in the soil.
They were only 31 when they died.
On March 11, Wakana's mother Yoshiko received a phone call from husband, Kazuyuki, just after the magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck at 2:46 p.m. “A tsunami is coming. Take the children and go to the elementary school (shelter). I will go later too” they told them Yoshiko picked up their two children in the car and, as they made their way toward the elementary school, the car was swallowed up by the first wave of the tsunami. Miraculously the car doors didn't open with the force of the tsunami and the three family members arrived at Omagari elementary school. The school was a makeshift shelter for those who had survived in the town that was now covered with seawater. The family awaited the arrival of Kazuyuki.
Four days later, they were found dead. Their body was discovered near the elementary school where their family had waited for him.
Another clause will remove a requirement for financial planners to write to clients annually informing them they are continuing to receive yearly payments from their accounts, and every second year to invite them to "opt in" to continue the payments. The first letters are due at the end of this financial year.
Because the legislation is unlikely to pass the Senate in time, the government will introduce separate regulations to bypass Parliament and have a more immediate effect.
Fairfax Media understands the regulations will be put to the Governor-General and Executive Council on or about Friday, March 28, the day after Parliament rises for a six-week break.
Assistant Treasurer Arthur Sinodinos did not respond to inquiries.
The timing means Parliament would be unable to disallow the regulations for at least six weeks and probably longer. The minister is not required to table the regulations for five sitting days. The Senate meets for only three days in May.
Kangaroos are played out. I mean, they're great and all, and I say that not just because they scare me a bit, but they're just so 2014. Hopping around, eating grass, kickboxing the tar out of each other. I'm over it. Mostly because another group of perfectly good creatures is hopping around in a remarkably similar manner, only much more adorably: the 30-odd species of achingly cute, bipedal jerboa, rodents with all the kangaroo's legs and none of the crummy attitude.
Just look at that thing. The top part looks enough like a mouse, but those legs. What's going on there? (To be clear, jerboas do have two other limbs like any other rodent, but they're tiny and tucked against the face and for the love of God how is it possible that everything about this creature is so adorable?)
Well, though it may look like it, the knees are not in fact inverted. The jerboa's knee is actually hard to make out, butting up against its torso. That extremely long section is called the cannon bone, and it's made up fused metatarsal bones—the longest ones in the center of your foot. The tiny bits of the foot that actually make contact with the ground are the toes, so the jerboa in fact spends its life tiptoeing around. Some species even look like they're wearing shoes, on account of the tufts of hair on their toes. Those stiff fibers act a bit like snowshoes, giving the rodent some extra purchase in the sandy deserts they call home, places like North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and Asia.
The elongated legs bestow the jerboa with incredible speed and leaping abilities, like a tiny kangaroo on amphetamines. “This is an animal that's about the size of your fist,” says biomechanist Talia Moore of Harvard University, who studies their locomotion, “yet there have been reports that some species can easily hop over six feet.”
That long, elegant tail also probably plays a role in balance. Moore and other researchers need to do more work to determine exactly what's going on, but by manipulating its tail, the jerboa can likely help stabilize itself as it's speeding around the desert. And it's not the only one: Velociraptors likely used their tails in the same way. (Interestingly, Moore did research as an undergrad on lizard and velociraptor locomotion, showing just how important a tail is for orientation in those creatures. Double interestingly, they say that the folks who recently built a jerboa robot used their undergrad work as a reference.)
Leading the research into the utility of jerboa tails was a certain Frenchman, who, unrestrained by the moral considerations of modern science, went a bit too far in their experiments. “There have been historical observations where in the 1800s this cruel Frenchman cut off a jerboa's tail, and it just wasn't able to do anything,” says Moore. “It couldn't even sit up, it couldn't jump around, it was just a pathetic, sad jerboa.”
The stunt was not … well received. “There are multiple publications from around 1835,” Moore adds, “where they're all talking about this ‘cruel Frenchman.' Those exact words.” One naturalist oh-so-eloquently chastised the mutilator: “We would remind such persons, that although the Creator has given us the faculties, and permits us to use them in studying their works, we have no right to violate the common feelings of humanity towards their creatures.”
Talia Moore, Harvard University
Alright, now that that's out of the way, we can get back to the many additional wonders of the jerboas. They're vegetarians, specifically crepuscular vegetarians, meaning they forage at twilight, mainly for seeds. And seeds not only bestow them with requisite nutrition but also water, so much so that they never need to drink.
Here's the problem, though: Jerboas share not only a habitat with the gerbil (yes, it still exists in the wild, outside the clutches of over-enthusiastic 5-year-olds), but a niche as well, for gerbils love them some seeds too. And it can be problematic for two species to compete over the same limited resource—the desert isn't exactly overflowing with plants and seeds.
Both species have another serious problem on their hands in the form of birds of prey. Yet while the gerbil tends to hang out in the relative safety of shrubbery, the jerboa instead opts to take its chances out in the open. But why? Well, for the jerboa and gerbil, the problems of competition and predation are intertwined.
Consider how predatory birds hunt: They have one shot at pinpointing a moving target and diving in. “If you think about it,” Moore says, “nocturnal birds of prey have just one single strike that they have to commit to, they have to predict where their prey animal is going and then meet up with them there. And so if the jerboa does something that's unpredictable, like jump straight up or jump in a zig zag, it makes it really difficult for the birds of prey to plot an effective intercept course.”

A gerbil simply isn't equipped to deal with this out in the open. If a predator is on its tail, it's pretty much just full steam straight ahead back to its burrow. This, therefore, limits the gerbil in its foraging. It's forced to stick to shelter underneath a bush, preferably somewhere close to its burrow.
Eff that noise, says the jerboa. It bravely ventures way out into the world (Moore usually finds them chilling on dirt roads). Here it roots around for seeds with eyes on the sky. Should a predator swoop in, it can tear away, zig-zagging and praying that the raptor miscalculates its strike.
Thus the gerbil and jerboa can occupy the same niche without competing: They never really run up against each other because they're exploring different microhabitats. Indeed, if you put a jerboa and a gerbil in a cage, they won't mind each other one bit, not exactly what you'd expect if two different species were used to fighting over resources in the wild.
It would seem, though, that all this bounding around would be a huge energy suck, and in fact it would be—if the jerboa weren't a generally laid-back creature. “Most of the time they're actually hanging out, digging, eating, grooming, taking a little dust bath, which is super cute,” says Moore. “They're really only going all-out a very small percentage of the time, so they're not like a hummingbird, which constantly has to eat and eat and eat to sustain their energy costs.”
Such are the life and times of the remarkable jerboa. So truck on, little one. And steer clear of the French.

At this rate it looks like #GamerGate might not ever end… unless, of course, the journalists perpetuating the onerous tumult within the gaming industry finally take a leave of absence. The continuing saga of the battle for ethics managed to suck into the fold the digital director of communications at Electronic Arts, Chris Mancil. Why? Because they mentioned Ben Kuchera, an editor from Polygon and a Game Journo Pro, in a post that involved prominent journalist Milo Yiannopolous from Breitbart… and their association with #GamerGate.
Mancil recently wrote about losing 2,500 followers on Twitter for simply retweeting a brief message from Yiannopolous. They did so on their blog called ChrisMancil.com [backup].
Mancil described the absurdity of the event and proceeded to explain why the 2,500 followers stopped following him, writing…
“Little did I know, that Milo Yiannopoulos currently bears the gaming community's Twitter version of the scarlet letter. This flaming mark of public shame and exile which was apparently sewn on their breast (profile) by auto-blocking bots that systematically mute and silence a wide-swath of gamers, and their friends, whom they dislike and disagree with.” “In warfare, dehumanization and ‘othering' allows more flexibility for the troops, and their administrators, to you know – temporarily abandon ethics and morality, for the greater good, and other such mindless rationalizations. A dangerous but all too familiar historical phenomena in war, but also with strong roots in our entertainment history – such as the Hollywood Blacklists for communist sympathizers.”
Mancil's plea for rational thought was met with a rather odd bit of criticism. In the original article Mancil linked to Ben Kuchera's article about how Twitter could improve policing harassment on the social media service.
However, Kuchera was not pleased that their work was linked in Mancil's piece, going off on a Twitter tirade, stating…
“I can't stop @chrismancil and others like them from linking my articles when defending harassers in gaming…but I can sure let everyone know how repugnant their actions are. This is @EA's director of digital communications, for the love of god. “Never, @ChrisMancil. Never ever. People are afraid to speak up, but I'm not. Don't use my work that way. Don't you dare. “The guy who “leads player engagement” for @EA can't understand why we block those who threaten to KILL us? @ChrisMancil, you're the problem. “I have zero tolerance for people using my work in that way. So angry. Sorry for the rant.”
Mancil proceeded to remove the link to Kuchera's article and attempted to appeal to reason by stating the following on Twitter…
“Death threats & harassment are serious problems in our communities. Let's be united on that. Then be open to discuss the right remedies.”
Nevertheless, this was met with more vitriol and repugnance from Ben Kuchera, who appeared to be indignant at the idea that neutrality and peace should be sought. However, an unlikely individual stepped up to defend Mancil… Josh Olin, the community and publishing director at Xaviant, and former community manager of Turtle Rock Studios.
After seeing Mancil get shutdown by Ben Kuchera – the same as Mark Kern getting shutdown by Ben Kuchera and VG 24/7's Patrick Garratt – a few other devs decided to step in and speak up against the gaming journalists responsible for twisting a narrative against the gaming community since August of 2014.
Thomas Geffroyd, the content director on Ubisoft's Watchdogs, was one of the Cavalry that arrived to backup Mancil, joining in on a new hashtag called LetDevsSpeak.
.#LetDevsSpeak because they do have valid opinions about our industry and diversity of those opinions makes it a whole. — Thomas Geffroyd (@Orph30) March 14, 2015
Geffroyd was then joined by other developers who chimed in as rebellious chorus against the gatekeepers of old. Game designer Matthew Callahan hopped on board, utilizing the hashtag as well.
I am a DEV and I speak up, don't be scared, your silence gives them power. #GamerGate #LetDevsSpeak #gamedev — Matthew Callahan (@CalabuMaki) March 14, 2015
Moderate journalists and writers also joined in on the action, hoping to get more developers to step forward and speak out, something that's been a difficult task to accomplish for the past seven months due to the kind of backlash that we're seeing against developers like Mark Kern and Chris Mancil.
#LetDevsSpeak because if we're going to critique their work, it's only fair that they can reapply or disagree with ours too. — Liana K (@redlianak) March 15, 2015
#LetDevsSpeak Dont be afraid anymore. This is your chance to free yourself from Politically Correct thought policing pic.twitter.com/WS7jIiy2TM — EscapeVelocity (@EscapeVelo) March 15, 2015
This has been compounded with tools like the GG Autoblocker, which adds various neutral followers and retweeters to a list generated around prominent #GamerGate figures and blocks them systematically. This GG Autoblocker has even managed to catch various indie devs just looking to get informed about events surrounding the matter.
The GG Autoblocker is a blacklisting tool used to exile dissenting voices in the game industry. #LetDevsSpeak or there will only be silence. — Red Morgan (@DreadMorgan) March 14, 2015
Mancil wants to take the peaceful road about it, but some developers genuinely want the corruption to end, such as Mark Kern and Adrian Chmielarz.
On the upside, Eurogamer has added a ‘right to reply' clause to their ethics policy in hopes of bridging the gap between news and editorials that developers feel portrays them or their content in an inappropriate or unjust light; however that doesn't really solve the problem of games media using their platforms to silence and censor developers from addressing rampant censorship and speaking out against corruption.

Just a few days ago we had reported that the first every Tesla had landed in India. It is in the form of Model X SUV. At that time it was not known to whom the car belonged, but it has now been confirmed that it belongs to Essar Group's Shashi Ruia. Recently they were spotted driving the car in Mumbai by folks at Automobili Ardent. The Tesla Model X is safely parked inside their bungalow's parking in South Mumbai.
Tesla Model X is produced at Tesla's Fremont factory in the US. The SUV's design DNA has an unmistakable familial match to the Model S, so much so that the X can be termed as a high riding S. The interior too is derived from the sedan and the SUV boasts of a cabin which offers good amount of space for all the 7 passengers.
The hardware comes from the Model S. Propulsive force is courtesy of two electric motors – one at each axle. The one that drives the front wheels is rated at 259 PS while the rear-mounted unit delivers 503 PS. The combined torque output stands at 967 Nm!
The base 90D variant of the electric SUV can accelerate from 0-60 mph (96 kmph) in 4.8 seconds while the P90D variant is 1 sec quicker! If that's not good enough for you, you can opt for the P90D with aptly named Ludicrous Mode which is capable of achieving the feat in a supercar rivaling 3.2 seconds! The car has a top-speed of 250 kmph.
The Tesla Model X comes packed with advanced features including the Auto Pilot semi autonomous driving system, varying ride height (automatically adjusted depending on the driving mode and terrain), a high-end music system, bio weapon-proof cabin and so on.
It is to be noted here that this is most likely a private import. Tesla has not yet officially been launched in India. Elon Musk has stated that Tesla has plans to launch in India in the near future. Tesla Model X is available in 3 variants in the US. Price ranges from $73,800 to $128,300. Considering transport, import duties, and the conversion rate, we can estimate the price of the Model X to be in the range of Rs 1-2 crore.
Amazon today announced that its AWS cloud computing service now offers a new region that's specifically designed for the workloads of the U.S. intelligence community. This new AWS Secret Region (that's really its name) can run workloads up to the “secret” security classification level and will complement the service's existing $600 million contract with the CIA and other agencies for running Top Secret workloads on its cloud.
AWS's announcement comes about a month after Microsoft made a similar announcement. With Azure Government Secret, Microsoft's Government Cloud will also soon support workloads for agencies and their partners who are working with data that is classified as “secret.”
“The U.S. Intelligence Community can now execute their missions with a common set of tools, a constant flow of the latest technology and the flexibility to rapidly scale with the mission,” said Teresa Carlson, vice president, Amazon Web Services Worldwide Public Sector. “The AWS Top Secret Region was launched three years ago as the first air-gapped commercial cloud and customers across the U.S. Intelligence Community have made it a resounding success. Ultimately, this capability allows more agency collaboration, helps get critical information to decision makers faster, and enables an increase in our Nation's Security.”
It's worth noting that the original and air-gapped Top Secret cloud, which AWS operates for the intelligence community, was limited to intelligence agencies. This new Secret Region is available to all government agencies and stands separate from the earlier work AWS did with the CIA and others, as well as the existing Amazon GovCloud.
While Google has long offered its G Suite to government customers, the company's effort to bring on more enterprise users hasn't quite extended to government agencies and their cloud computing needs. Chances are, though, that Google, too, is working on getting the necessary certifications to handle more classified government data on its servers.
Update: Body found in Saginaw Bay
MCKINLEY TOWNSHIP, MI -- Rescuers are searching for a third day since a report that a woman jumped from a fishing boat in the Saginaw Bay and disappeared underwater.
Chelsea M. Younge, 26, of Imlay City, went missing about 7:10 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 15, police report. That's when Huron Central Dispatch received a 911 call from a male occupant of a pleasure fishing boat, approximately two miles northwest of Heisterman Island in McKinley Township on Saginaw Bay. That's between Caseville and Sebewaing off the western shore of the Thumb.
The caller told police that their female friend decided to jump from the boat as the group of five people were trolling with multiple lines in the water, the Huron County Sheriff's Department reports (map link).
"They immediately began to pull the multiple fishing lines and turn the boat back around toward her, when they watched them slip under the surface and not return," a news release from Sheriff Kelly Hanson states.
Deputies using a Caseville patrol boat responded along with officials from the U. S. Coast Guard Station Harbor Beach. The sheriff's dive team assembled and the Port Austin Patrol Boat was brought to the area, Hanson said.
The search was suspended about 10:20 p.m. Saturday as divers faced poor visibility and darkness in the approximately 15-foot-deep water.
Divers redeployed at sunrise Sunday, Hanson said.
"Unfortunately though, the water visibility was less than a foot and choppy water conditions hampered divers severely," they said in a news release.
The Coast Guard suspended its search late Sunday morning, the sheriff's department reports. Side-scanning Sonar was brought in from Sanilac and St. Clair counties Sunday afternoon.
Hanson said Sunday the search would continue through Monday if needed. Officials did not provide further updates Sunday evening or Monday.
The Bad Axe Area Fire Department and Scheurer Ambulance Service also responded and assisted the sheriff's department.

Marshmallow Update & Unofficial Port Round-Up — Get Up to Date!
Come one, come all! While Nexus owners have already gotten a taste of some sweet, sweet Marshmallow, most users are left waiting for an official update. For many devices, it's hard to say when they'll receive their 6.0 updates given how many layers of testing each device needs to go through.
Nevertheless, we're compiling a list of devices that manufacturers/carriers have so far confirmed to receive the Marshmallow update, as well as links to unofficial ports for anyone who wants to update right away.
Official Updates
Please note that if your device is not listed in this section, it does not mean you won't be getting Marshmallow. We are only linking to official sources confirming that an update will roll out (eg. manufacturer press releases, executive confirmations). If you have purchased a new device, there is a very high chance you will be getting the update.
Android One
Google has promised quick OS updates for all of their Android One devices, and they've mostly seemed to deliver. Although, you'll only be able to get the update via an OTA file rather than using a factory image. However, several users have captured the OTA update links for anyone looking to manually update their device. Simply click one of the links below to initiate the download, then you can sideload the OTA update by using the ‘adb sideload ota.zip' command (where ota.zip should be replaced with the full filename of the OTA file).
Cherry Mobile One
Karbonn Sparkle V
Micromax Canvas A1
Mito Impact A10
MyPhone Uno
Nexian Journey One
Spice Dream Uno
Symphony Roar A50
ASUS
ASUS has confirmed on their official Zentalk forums that they plan on updating the following devices:
PadFone S
ZenFone 2
ZenFone 2 Deluxe/Special Edition
ZenFone 2 Laser
ZenFone Selfie
However, they have not confirmed an expected date of release for the Marshmallow update.
Google Nexus
Good news, it's already here! The 6.0 OTA has slowly been rolling out over the past few weeks, but for those of you still waiting you can simply head on over to the Factory Image page hosted by Google to grab the update file. From there, you can simply follow the steps listed to flash the factory image. Be warned, however, that following these steps will result in your user data being wiped. To avoid this, you can simply remove the ‘-w' line in the ‘flash-all.bat'
If you're having trouble with the factory images, you can also try updating by grabbing an official OTA update file. These OTA files were collected by various members of the Android community and are hosted by Google. Warning: clicking on any of these links will initiate a download. In order to flash them, you can simply use the “adb sideload ota.zip” command where ota.zip is the full filename of the OTA file (Note: you must be using the stock recovery to sideload an OTA.)
Nexus 5
Nexus 6
Nexus 7 2013
Nexus 7 2013 LTE
Nexus 9
Nexus 9 LTE
Nexus Player
Alternatively, you can use the very popular Nexus Root Toolkit to update via factory image/OTA file.
HTC
The President of HTC America has confirmed that the following devices will eventually receive the Marshmallow update:
HTC One M9 (beginning end of 2015)
HTC One M8 (beginning end of 2015)
HTC One M9+
HTC One E9+
HTC One E9
HTC One ME
HTC One E8
HTC One M8 EYE
HTC Butterfly 3
HTC Desire 826
HTC Desire 820
HTC Desire 816
The M8 and M9 will hopefully see 6.0 by the end of the year, but HTC makes no guarantee that every carrier will be able to push the update as soon as it's available on their end. There are no tentative release dates for the other devices listed, however.
If you're sporting the HTC One M8 Google Play Edition, though, the Marshmallow update is currently rolling out. You can grab the OTA file here and use ADB to sideload the update, as mentioned previously.
Huawei/Honor
Huawei has published a list of devices to receive Marshmallow alongside its latest version of EMUI:
P8
Mate S
Ascend Mate7
P8max
Ascend G7
G7 Plus
G8
MediaPad X2
Honor 7i
Honor, a sub-brand under Huawei, has confirmed these devices:
No confirmation on release dates, but you should expect roll-outs to occur throughout 2016.
Lenovo
Somewhat good news for anyone rocking a Lenovo device – it seems that Lenovo has at least considered upgrading some of its devices to Marshmallow. On their upgrade matrix page, they initially stated that these devices would receive a Marshmallow upgrade:
K3 Note
Vibe S1
Vibe P1
A7000
A7000 Plus
However, they quickly scrubbed the page of that information. Whether or not this means they're scrapping the update plans or simply revising their release date expectations remains to be seen.
LG
Originally, only the Polish variant of the LG G4 received the Marshmallow upgrade. Then, the South Korean variant saw its Marshmallow update. T-Mobile USA has confirmed that the LG G3, LG G4, and LG Stylo are being prepared for the update. We should soon expect the European market and other American carriers to follow suit, although no official confirmation exists yet.
Enterprising users with the LG G4 H815 Variant can flash the official update ripped from the currently released builds.
LG Poland has stated that the LG G3 will be receiving Marshmallow in the middle of December. Other variants should follow soon after.
Motorola
We have official confirmation thus far that the following devices should receive Marshmallow (if nothing goes wrong):
2015 Moto X Pure Edition (3rd gen)
2015 Moto X Style (3rd gen)
2015 Moto X Play
2015 Moto G (3rd gen)
2014 Moto X Pure Edition in the US (2nd gen)
2014 Moto X in Latin America, Europe and Asia 2 (2nd gen)
(2nd gen) 2014 Moto G and Moto G with 4G LTE 2 (2nd gen)
(2nd gen) DROID Turbo
2014 Moto MAXX
2014 Moto Turbo
No word on any release date, however. There are reports that the Moto G 2014 is currently undergoing a Marshmallow soak-test.
NVIDIA
NVIDIA has so far confirmed Marshmallow for their NVIDIA SHIELD TV customers. When asked about whether or not SHIELD Tablet users would see the update, NVIDIA teased that it would be a possibility, but did not confirm an update.
OnePlus
OnePlus has announced their upgrade schedule on their forums. They have confirmed that the OnePlus One will officially receive a Marshmallow CyanogenOS build, however they have made no promises as to whether or not they will update their OxygenOS ROM for the OnePlus One. As for the OnePlus 2, they promise a quick update to Marshmallow during Q1 of 2016, and are working on bringing the same to the newly released OnePlus X.
Samsung
Samsung has not confirmed which of its many devices will see the 6.0 update. However, we do know from T-Mobile USA that these devices should see the update:
Sony
Sony has confirmed that these devices will receive 6.0:
In addition, Sony has given some Xperia Z3 and Z3 Compact owners the opportunity to beta test their Marshmallow concept. If you were one of the lucky few who was able to sign up for the release, you may be able to test Marshmallow from Sony already! You may still be able to sign up for the beta using their official Play Store app, but a better option for a flashaholic is to do it the unofficial way.
ZOPO Mobile
ZOPO, a fast-growing smartphone company based in China, has announced that several of its devices will be updated to Marshmallow, including:
Speed 7
Speed 7 Plus
Speed 7 GP
Color E
Color C
The company promises an update by the end of the first quarter of 2016.
ZTE
ZTE isn't well-known for keeping their devices up to date, to say the least. Unfortunately, we don't know which of their devices, if any, will be seeing the Marshmallow update.
Unofficial Updates
If you would rather not wait for OEMs and carriers to push out the update, you can test out Marshmallow thanks to developers on XDA. Here's a list of some devices that can taste some unofficial Marshmallow right now:
And that's all we've gathered about devices that can currently upgrade to Marshmallow. Let us know if we've missed anything! Special thanks to everyone who sent in a link to Marshmallow ROMs for their device!
When it ain't broke, do you really need to fix it? The Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) have been coasting along for decades enjoying phenomenal brand equity. So why is the government now introducing an IIM Bill?
Likely to be tabled in the monsoon session of Parliament, the IIM Bill 2015 will allow the 13 IIMs to confer an MBA degree rather than the post-graduate diploma in management (PGDM) they offer now. The IIMs hope this will help them attract foreign students and boost research. Many IIMs also want to set up campuses abroad, for which a degree is a pre-requisite. The Bill is a legitimate need, but it may leave the 300-odd privately run B-Schools that offer PGDM courses out in the cold.
The IIM Bill has been in the making for over a decade, points out Bakul Dholakia, former director of IIM Ahmedabad and currently Director General of International Management Institute, New Delhi. Ironically, when it was first proposed, the IIMs opposed the Bill. They felt their autonomy (the IIMs are structured as independent societies) would be affected, as the government would have to create an overarching supervisory council, akin to the IIT council, in order to grant a degree. As a result, the Bill has seen several rounds of changes. Reports suggest the plans to create a council have been dropped, though it's not clear what the new governance structure will be.
Meanwhile, those arguing against the Bill point out that institutions like XLRI, Jamshedpur and MDI, Gurgaon rank above some newer IIMs (Kashipur, Indore etc). The fear is that the newer IIMs will get an unfair advantage as students might choose an institute that gives a degree rather than look at B-school rankings. "This bill will definitely benefit the newer IIMs. To reach the benchmark of the older IIMs in terms of leadership, quality of teachers, quality of students, might have taken them 15 years. Now they will be able to achieve this quickly," says Dholakia.
But Devi Singh, former director of IIM Lucknow, brushes aside these concerns and says there's a larger vision to the Bill. "A big criticism of standalone institutions such as the IIM has been that they are too narrow-focused around general management. The need of the hour is more broad-based education," they say. Rajan Saxena, Vice Chancellor of Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies, bats for the Bill too. "It is an opportunity for the non-IIM institutions to innovate," they say. Certainly, institutions that have innovated, such as the Indian School of Business, have shown that a unique space can be crafted.
Seeking global accreditation is one option for the B-schools that are averse to be affiliated to a university. Affiliation is a route to mediocriy as Dholakia says. But they warn that destroying the level-playing field could be disruptive. "It is much easier to destroy excellence than create excellence," they warn. A possible solution, they feel, could be for the government to extend the same degree-granting benefit to private B-schools through a body like the India Council for Technical Education. For this, an independent agency could be created to rate the institutes and only those that make the top grade could be granted the same status as IIMs. "This problem can be easily solved. All that is required is political will and a proper mechanism to find a way forward," says Dholakia.
Laws passed in Texas and elsewhere in the name of increasing patient safety are doing an effective job of shutting down abortion clinics. As Reuters reports
Two more Texas abortion providers said they will shut down this week, saying their doctors were unable to get admitting privileges to nearby hospitals as required under new restrictions enacted by the state last year.... Whole Women's Health will close two of its five clinics in the state, shutting facilities in McAllen and Beaumont because they cannot meet the new regulations, including one that a physician have admitting privileges at an appropriately equipped hospital within 30 miles. The reduction will cut the number of abortion providers in the state to 19 from 32 before the restrictions went in place, according to the group and state data.
Read more here and here.
These sorts of regulations are likely to have a more lasting effect on the number of abortion providers than bans on abortions after the first fetal heartbeat is detected (as Alabama is pursuing) or other laws that cut into the first-trimester zone first articulated in Roe v. Wade. North Dakota, for instance, has passed a ban on abortions that could limit the procedure at six weeks after fertilization. That's because the new regulations don't specifically attack abortion rights per se, but instead focus on supposed medical risks for women.
While a large majority of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in at least some situations - only 20 percent say abortion should always be illegal, according to the most recent poll on the issue - there is wide and growing agreement that it should be more restricted.
From a CNN poll:
According to the poll, 27% say that abortion should be legal in all circumstances, 13% say it should be legal in most circumstances, 38% say that it should be legal in few circumstances, and 20% say abortion should always be illegal.
Whatever your perspective on abortion (an issue that divides libertarians along with Americans of every other ideology), however, it's clear that abortions as performed in clinics is an incredibly safe procedure for the women involved. The video above, which Reason TV released in December, focuses on Virginia's experience with new restrictions:
In a reversal of conventional positions, SB 924 has political conservatives arguing for increasing regulations on small businesses and liberals arguing against them. The bill initially passed the Democratic-controlled state senate in 2011 by a vote of 20-20 (Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, a pro-life Republican cast the tie-breaking vote). Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell eventually signed it into law after numerous rounds of political back-and-forth.... Defenders of the new regulations say that they are simply protecting the safety of women. "This is really necessary to ensure that woman are treated with care consistent with their human dignity,” says Mallory Quigley of the Susan B. Anthony List (SBL), a pro-life organization. A woman who chooses to have an abortion, says Quigley, should be able to do so without fearing for their health and safety.
While horrific cases of unclean and disgustingly run abortion mills in Philadelphia, Houston, and elsewhere lend credence to the safety issue, they are clearly outliers. In Virginia, for instance, "since 1974 state data show only three deaths during legal abortions. For first-trimester abortions, the complication rate is 0.3 percent."
Again, that isn't an argument per se for or against abortion. But everyone interested in good-faith arguments should acknowledge that piling on regulations that do not demonstrably improve safety are mistaken at best and disingenuous at worst.
Watch above: Nearly 70 people have been arrested at the Ile Soniq festival at Parc Jean Drapeau. However, police are still determining whether any sort of charges will be laid. As Billy Shields reports, the arrests have put so-called “rave drugs” in the spotlight.
MONTREAL – Both nights at the Île Soniq music festival at Parc Jean-Drapeau were a busy one for Montreal police.
A total of 112 people were detained over the two-day festival.
On Friday, more than 70 people were arrested, most of them for possession of illegal drugs.
At least eight people were treated for intoxication and two weapons were seized.
“Police officers are on the scene surrounding the event,” said Raphael Bergeron, a spokesperson for the Montreal police.
“We have up to 14 police officers assisting the security at the entrance.”
On day-two of the festival, 63 people were detained, five were minors.
Montreal police say they are taking extra precaution after party drugs like MDMA and Molly were linked to the recent deaths of two young adults in Toronto, as well as numerous over-consumptions at similar festivals across North America.
“They're taken orally, they're synthetic, they're not controlled,” explained Jean-Sebastien Fallu, a spokesperson for GRIP.
“There can be many many different impurities there.”
Drug interventionists like Fallu say the dangers of narcotics are often unknown or misunderstood.
“The risks are you don't know what you're taking,” they said.
“It's an unintended effect of prohibition. There's no quality control of what's on the market.”
Evenko, the event's organizers, have also stepped up the number of medical personnel on the site and are performing bag checks at the entrance.
“People that have drugs or other items that are not allowed on site will have their access blocked,” said Bergeron.
The electronic and dance music festival wrapped up Saturday night.
Quin-Bean Hash is Nothing Like any other Hash
Hash is probably the wrong name for this dish, given that nothing has been chopped to make it. (Bonus point to you if you knew that "hash" comes from from the French verb for chop, "hacher.") Hash seems to fit nonetheless, because of both flavour (savory) and texture (somewhere between dry and moist). However, there are important differences between this dish and classical hash, and those differences matter to you or you wouldn't be reading this. First of all, if this hash was served at a diner, you could not in good conscience call said diner a greasy spoon. The spoon is not greasy. There is no hint of greasiness. In fact, this hash is grease-free save for a couple of tablespoons of EVOO. Second of all, the usual hash ingredients have been replaced by quinoa, kidney beans and chickpeas. I realize that might not be quite enough to get you firmly into the cephalic phase in anticipation of a delicious meal, but something magical happens when you mix those nutritional good guys with the simple vegan non-cheese sauce that we've used previously in vegan mac-n-cheese. The magical flavour synergy is sealed by a short spell in the oven, in a casserole dish topped with breadcrumbs. (The breadcrumbs can be safely left out if you like your meals gluten-free.) The end result is nutty, cheesy and lemony, with a rib-sticking texture. It also responds very well to a generous sprinkling of your favourite hot sauce. Having it share the plate with some nice crispy roasted broccoli provides for contrasting textures and makes the whole meal just that much more enjoyable. How bout a nice apple crisp for dessert?
Ingredients
1 cup organic quinoa
2 Tbl extra virgin olive oil
2 cloves of garlic
1 1/2 cups raw cashews (not roasted)
2 cups unsweetened soy milk
2/3 cup nutritional yeast
1 Tbl dijon mustard
3 Tbl lemon juice
1/2 tsp turmeric
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 18 oz (540 mL) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1 18 oz (540 mL) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 cup breadcrumbs (optional)
fresh ground pepper to taste
Directions
Preheat oven to 350 °F
In a medium-sized saucepan, bring 1 1/2 cups of water to a boil.
Mix in quinoa, stir and reduce heat to medium-low.
Cover and cook for 12-15 minutes, until all liquid has been absorbed.
Remove from heat, and set aside covered.
Peel the garlic. If you have a mortar and pestle, coarsely chop the garlic and then pound it to pulp with a little salt. (If you don't have one, just mince the garlic with the salt.)
In a large, deep skillet, warm the olive oil on medium-low heat and add the smashed garlic and let cook a few minutes so the garlic mellows a bit and the flavour blends into the olive oil.
Grind the cashews into crumbs in a food processor.
Then, with the processor still running, slowly pour in the soy milk.
Process for half a minute or so.
Add the cashew/soy milk mixture to the skillet.
Add the nutritional yeast into the skillet and mix well.
Add mustard, lemon juice, turmeric, paprika and salt to skillet.
And mix well into a creamy sauce.
Turn off heat.
Add the beans and chickpeas and mix well.
Add the pot of quinoa and mix well.
Transfer the contents of the skillet to a medium casserole dish.
If desired, sprinkle 1/2 cup breadcrumbs over the top.
Bake for 20 minutes.
Serve with something green and crunchy.

Being in Love with K-Pop
November 7, 2015 by alexreid35
So....I mean, I still have a lotta questions but this was interesting for now. Damn, they really loves performing that much??? What do you think Omona?
TYFYT OMONA
XOXO
It was 2009 when my non-tech-savvy self was just catching on to the YouTube wave. While surfing videos,It was a conceptual premise that started like a fairytale, and then abruptly turned into an action flick. It was uptempo and high energy with quick edits and trippy effects. It reminded me of Britney Spears, but more fanciful, and boundless. The artist was sexy, yet sweet. The choreography was dramatic.I remember thinking how strange it was that there was all this awesome music that none of my friends even knew about, and that I had only lucked in to knowing about. As funny as it sounds, it felt like secret music, and now I was in the club. Every now and again, a hit goes global and everyone catches on (PSY's Gangnam Style for instance), but K-pop heads know that their iPods are FULL of those gems.It's ear candy melodies reminiscent of Max Martin circa forever.It's where the fans are still fanatics unlike any other fandoms. Loyal, die-hard Stans who will post up outside of a record label in the snow for 12 hours waiting for that brief moment when their idols will walk in and out. As an artist, that's the type of support that keeps you going on the hardest of days when a part of you just wants to give up.Sitting in traffic above The Han River trying to snap a selfie with the city backdrop to reassure myself that this is actual reality! And… Hopefully… Even inspiring some people to chase their own dreams no matter how far fetched they seem.(I'm so humbled that I have tears in my eyes while writing this.) I am simply grateful for the opportunity to be a small part of the larger than life world of K-Pop!Always stuffin my face backstage 😂😂😂😩😩😩🍕🍕🍕xiaher ponytail so cute 😊xiaher ponytail so cute 😊t-aestylish 😊t-ae laughter 😆rania seul-ji they so lovely 😍rania seul-ji like a id photo 😆raniabeautiful Dirania di 💕 beauty 😉 #rania Alex 💕 so pretty 😘rania alex they has a beautiful curhavehairrania hyeme 😍 they so hotOh and on Tuesday the girls will be performing on MTV The Show and are asking anyone in attendance to cheer extra loud!

July's live recruiting period is right around the corner, meaning that the Class of 2016 will have a chance to truly prove themselves to the recruiters and the recruitniks around the country. Scholarships will be earned and rankings will be justified over the course of those three weekends in July.
But scholarship offers and rankings don't always tell us who the best players in a given class will end up being. Ask Steph Curry. Over the course of the coming weeks, we will be re-ranking eight recruiting classes, from 2004-2011, based on what they have done throughout their post-high school career.
Here are the 25 best players from the Class of 2011, with their final Rivals Top 150 ranking in parentheses:
READ MORE: The complete Re-ranking the Classes series
1. Anthony Davis (2): This is an easy choice. Davis was the Most Outstanding Player on Kentucky's national title team in 2012 and then picked first overall by New Orleans in the 2012 NBA Draft. They haven't slowed down either, emerging as one of the top players in the NBA and leading the Pelicans to the playoffs this past season.
2. Bradley Beal (4): Like Davis, Beal spent one season playing in the SEC as they were part of a Florida team that reached the Elite Eight. From there it was off to Washington, where he's combined with John Wall to form the Wizards' backcourt of the present and future.
3. Elfrid Payton (UR): Payton arrived at Louisiana-Lafayette to little national fanfare, but after spending their first-year student season in a reserve role they took a step forward as a sophomore. Payton turned that year into a spot on the United States' U19 team, and after a standout junior campaign they were taken in the 2014 NBA Draft lottery by the Magic. Payton was a first team NBA All-Rookie Team selection this past season.
4. Andre Drummond (UR): Drummond moved back into the 2011 class from 2012, joining the UConn program for one season. From there they were a lottery pick of the Pistons in the 2012 NBA Draft, where he's averaged 12.1 points and 11.8 rebounds per game in three seasons.
5. Trey Burke (142): Burke spent two seasons at Michigan, the second of which included a National Player of the Year award and a run to the national title game where the Wolverines fell to Louisville. Burke was selected 9th overall by the Jazz in the 2013 NBA Draft, and he's averaged 12.8 points and 5.0 assists per game game in two seasons.
6. Michael Carter-Williams (29): Carter-Williams was a backup at the point during their first-year student season at Syracuse, and as a sophomore they helped lead the Orange to the Final Four in 2013. Picked in the 2013 NBA Draft lottery by Philadelphia, Carter-Williams was an NBA Rookie of the Year in 2014. Traded to Milwaukee during the 2014-15 season, they averaged 14.6 points and 6.7 assists per game.
7. Ben McLemore (34): McLemore's college career was delayed by a season, as they were ruled academically ineligible for the 2011-12 campaign by the NCAA. In their lone season of play at Kansas, McLemore averaged 15.9 points and 5.2 rebounds per contest. Picked seventh overall by the Kings in the 2013 NBA Draft, McLemore's averaging 10.5 points and 2.9 rebounds per game as a pro.
8. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (3): Kidd-Gilchrist teamed up with Davis on a loaded Kentucky team to win a national title in 2012, then moved on to the NBA where they were the second overall pick in the 2012 NBA Draft. Always a good defender, Kidd-Gilchrist has worked to improve their abilities as a shooter since entering the NBA and wound up averaging 10.9 points per game last season.
9. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (12): Caldwell-Pope took a major leap forward in their second season as a pro, averaging 12.7 points per game for the Pistons in 2014-15 (5.9 ppg as a rookie). Prior to that KCP played two seasons at Georgia, where they were SEC Player of the Year in 2013 after averaging 18.5 points and 7.1 rebounds per game.
10. Austin Rivers (1): Rivers averaged 15.5 points per game in their lone season at Duke, which included a memorable game-winning three at North Carolina. As a pro the road hasn't been as smooth, with their best run of play coming as a reserve with the Clippers (where their dad's the head coach and president) following a trade from New Orleans this season.
11. Otto Porter (37): Like McLemore, Porter was a lottery pick in the 2013 NBA Draft as they were taken third overall by the Wizards. Unlike McLemore, Porter played two seasons of college ball (and Georgetown) and was named Big East Player of the Year and a first team All-American in 2013. With Paul Pierce moving on to L.A., 2015-16 could be a breakthrough campaign for Porter.
12. Cody Zeller (15): Zeller played two seasons at Indiana, where as a sophomore they were a first team All-Big Ten and second team All-America selection. Picked in the first round of the 2013 NBA Draft by Charlotte, Zeller's averaged 6.7 points and 5.0 rebounds per game in two seasons as a pro.
RELATED: Re-ranking the classes 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010
13. Shane Larkin (72): Larkin, originally a DePaul commit, wound up at Miami where they helped lead the program to heights it had never visited as a member of the ACC. Larkin ran the point for a team that won the program's first ACC title and reached the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2000, sharing ACC Player of the Year honors in 2013. Larkin didn't play much in Dallas as a rookie, but they saw more time in 2014-15 with the Knicks (6.2 ppg, 3.0 apg).
14. Jabari Brown (19): Brown didn't last all that long at Oregon, transferring to Missouri after playing just two games in Eugene. Once at Mizzou the shooting guard became of the SEC's top perimeter players as a junior in 2014 (first team All-SEC; 19.9 ppg). After spending time in the NBA D-League Brown's now with the Lakers, where they averaged 11.9 points per game this season.
15. Tony Wroten (14): Wroten played just one season at Washington, averaging 16.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game in 2011-12. A first round pick of the Grizzlies in the 2012 NBA Draft, Wroten's averaged 11.2 points per game in three seasons for two franchises (Philadelphia being the other). Wroten suffered a torn ACL in January.
16. Maurice Harkless (41): Harkless played one season at St. John's before being drafted by Philadelphia in the first round of the 2012 NBA Draft. The Sixers traded Harkless to Orlando, where he's averaged 6.8 points and 3.5 rebounds in three seasons as a professional.
17. Nick Johnson (18): Johnson played three seasons at Arizona, where they were a mainstay for Sean Miller's program. Not only was they Pac-12 Player of the Year in 2014, but Johnson was also a first team All-American. Drafted in the second round by the Rockets in 2014, Johnson's bounced between the NBA and NBA D-League the last two seasons.
18. P.J. Hairston (13): To say that the sharpshooter's college career was a tumultuous one would be an understatement, as NCAA issues ended their time in Chapel Hill before the 2013-14 season began. Hairston lit up the NBA D-League for a season before being taken in the first round of the 2014 NBA Draft by Miami, which traded them to Charlotte on draft night.
19. Rodney Hood (16): Hood was an SEC All-Rookie Team selection at Mississippi State before transferring to Duke, where they played one season under Mike Krzyzewski. A first round pick in the 2014 NBA Draft by Utah, Hood averaged 8.7 points per game as a rookie.
20. Frank Kaminsky (UR): Kaminsky went from being a three-star prospect to the National Player of the Year in their four season at Wisconsin, which included two Final Four appearances and Big Ten regular season and tournament titles. They were picked in the lottery by Charlotte last month. (Mistakenly left off this list.)
21. Kyle Wiltjer (22): Wiltjer still has another season left to play in college, but he's put together a solid resume at that level. As a first-year student they were part of a national champion squad at Kentucky, following that up with SEC Sixth Man of the Year honors as a sophomore. They transferred following the 2012-13 season, and after sitting out a year Wiltjer was both WCC Newcomer of the Year and a second team All-American at Gonzaga in 2014-15.
22. Spencer Dinwiddie (146): Dinwiddie put together a very good run at Colorado before suffering a torn ACL in a road game at Washington during their junior campaign. That would be the last time he'd play in a CU uniform, as they moved on to the NBA where they were taken in the second round of the 2014 NBA Draft by the Pistons. Dinwiddie saw time as the team's backup point guard once Brandon Jennings went down with a ruptured Achilles.
23. Quincy Miller (7): Miller played just one season at Baylor, averaging 10.6 points and 4.9 rebounds per contest in 2011-12. Picked in the second round of the 2012 NBA Draft by Denver, Miller played two seasons with the Nuggets before splitting time with the Kings and Pistons in 2014-15.
24. Johnny O'Bryant III (46): O'Bryant played three seasons at LSU, where they were a first team All-SEC choice in both 2013 and 2014. A second-round pick of the Bucks in the 2014 NBA Draft, O'Bryant played 10.8 minutes per game (34 games played) as a rookie on a team that reached the playoffs.
25. Ryan Boatright (42): Boatright wasn't selected in last month's NBA Draft (playing with the Nets in Summer League), but their four-year career at UConn was a highly productive one. Boatright, who won a national title in 2014, left Storrs as one of just two players in the history of the program to be ranked in the Top 10 of the school's scoring and assists lists (Shabazz Napier being the other).

The northern stretch of Riverside Park has long been an attraction for residents of Hamilton Heights. But getting to it is not easy.
The Manhattan neighborhood, perched on a bluff 50 feet above the Hudson River, is separated from upper Riverside's ball fields, bike path and barbecue area by train tracks and the West Side Highway. But a new $24 million pedestrian bridge, which began construction this summer, will cross over the tracks and highway, allowing easier access for visitors using wheelchairs, toting sports equipment or pushing strollers.
State Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., who has represented the district for more than 40 years, had long heard from constituents about the frustrations of getting to the park on foot. There is currently a cumbersome way across at Riverside Drive and 148th Street; it involves a series of stairs — 122 steps in all — along with a bridge over the tracks and a tunnel under the West Side Highway.

Mr. Farrell secured $20 million in state funding for the project, which will involve a series of ramps, starting at West 153rd Street, on either side of a 270-foot bridge. “It'll make it so that people can get there more easily, especially those with mobility issues,” they said on Friday during a visit to the construction site. The New York State Department of Transportation, which is building the bridge, expects it to open at the end of 2016.

ON MAY 26th 2008 Germany turned red. The winds of change, though, were meteorological, not political. Unusual weather brought iron-rich dust from Africa to Europe, not only altering the colour of roofs and cars on the continent but also, according to recent calculations by Max Bangert, a graduate student at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, making the place about a quarter of a degree colder for as long as the dust stayed in the air.
Unusual for Germany; commonplace for the planet as a whole. The Sahara and other bone-dry places continually send dust up into the atmosphere, where it may travel thousands of kilometres and influence regional weather, the global climate and even the growth of forests halfway around the planet.
Earlier in 2008, for instance, Ilan Koren and their colleagues at the Weizmann Institute of Science, in Israel, detected a particularly voluminous burst of dust from the Bodélé Depression. This low-lying bed of silt in Chad, across which powerful jets of wind are wont to blow, constitutes less than 1% of the Sahara's area but is reckoned the world's dustiest place. It is thought to be responsible for a quarter or more of the Sahara's output of airborne dust.
Dr Koren observed the dust rise with a camera on a satellite called Aqua; watched it obscure the sun using an automated photometer in Ilorin, Nigeria; followed it across the Atlantic with another satellite, CALIPSO; and finally saw a spike in levels of silicon, aluminium and iron as it landed on detectors in Manaus, Brazil. Their results, presented at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union held in San Francisco in December, provide a remarkable account of the intercontinental transfer of dust.
The importance of this long-distance logistical chain has become apparent only in the past few years, and researchers are still working out its many repercussions—for the more you look at dust, the more effects it seems to have. African dust is thought, for example, to stimulate plant growth in the Amazon by bringing in phosphorus (which is in short supply there). This may put a check on global warming by removing what would otherwise be a long-term constraint on the forest's ability to suck up carbon dioxide as it grows.
Dust which does not reach land may do something similar to the sea. Some parts of the ocean are short of iron, which red desert dust has in abundance. Dust from the Gobi desert seems to stimulate plankton blooms in the nutrient-poor waters of the North Pacific, though it is not clear whether this results in a net reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide, since that would require some of the plankton to sink to the seabed, never to return.
Dust aloft cools the land below, as Europe's meteorologists found out in May 2008. It does this directly, by reflecting sunlight back into space, and indirectly, by helping clouds to form. The effect is significant. The carbon dioxide which has been added to the atmosphere since the industrial revolution began has a greenhouse effect equivalent to the arrival of about 1.6 watts of extra solar power per square metre of the Earth's surface. The direct effects of dust are estimated to provide a countervailing cooling of about 0.14 watts per square metre. Add the indirect effect on clouds and this could increase markedly, though there are great uncertainties.
This dust-driven cooling, though, is patchy—and in some places it may not even be helpful. Dust that cools a desert can change local airflow patterns and lessen the amount of rain that falls in surrounding areas. This causes plants to die, and provides more opportunities for wildfires, increasing the atmospheric carbon-dioxide level.
To get a better sense of the net effects brought about by the ups and downs of dust, it would help to have a detailed historical record of the dustiness of the planet. And this is what Natalie Mahowald of Cornell University and 19 colleagues have achieved. They analysed cores from glaciers, lake bottoms and coral reefs and measured how the levels of some telltale chemicals changed with depth, and thus with time. They then used models of global wind circulation to deduce which dust sources have become stronger and which weaker. Their conclusion, published recently in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, is that in fits and starts over the past century the air became twice as dusty.
Part of the increase stems from human activities—directly, in the case of construction, or indirectly, when it results from clearing vegetation from marginal land in order to farm it. Another part of the explanation may be global warming itself, shifting the boundaries of deserts and intensifying dust production in some areas.
The amount of dust actually injected into the atmosphere, though, may have been significantly underestimated. In a recent paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Jasper Kok of the National Centre for Atmospheric Research, in Boulder, Colorado, writes that the amount of coarse dust driven into the atmosphere by wind is at least double and may be eight times as much as previously thought.
They arrived at this conclusion not by measuring dust directly from planes or satellites, which see only a bit of the atmosphere at a time and are not necessarily good at picking up all signs of dust, but by reasoning their way to a model of how loose soil, some fine and some coarse, is affected by the wind and lifted into the air.
Fine particles of dust do not simply lie around until they are blown away by the wind. Rather, they stick together in clumps. Only when these clumps are broken up is the dust liberated. That happens when heavier particles are lifted by the wind and then fall back to the ground, hammering and shattering the dust-clumps as they do so. Dr Kok shows that this shattering, like the shattering of all sorts of other things, produces a distinctive mix of particle sizes. This mix does not match those currently used in climate models. It has bigger particles and fewer smaller ones. The discrepancy seems not to have been noticed before because existing ways of measuring dust are biased towards the finest material—that which most influences air temperature and cloud formation.
The consequences of this reassessment are unclear, since the effects of coarse dust are not well understood. Also, the larger particles fall out of the atmosphere more quickly. What is clear is that it is yet another example of how fiendishly complicated the atmosphere is, and what a broad set of approaches is required to understand it.
Bond on Film Without villains there'd be no James Bond. SPECTRE, SMERSH, megalomaniacal industrialists and media tycoons have all contrived fiendish, intricate plots to take over the world, seize its wealth, provoke nuclear war, destroy London's financial system, eliminate the human race etc etc. These people and their plots have needed to be stopped, and that's where 007 has traditionally stepped in.
In general villains fall into three categories. Most numerous is the nameless goon, minimum-wage spear carriers who are essentially a call-centre with machine guns.
It's difficult to see past the smile
Then there's your élite henchman, the "end of level" bosses such as Oddjob, Jaws, Xenia Onatopp etc who are distinguished by strange physical features, special skills and/or weapons, minority sexual tastes etc. Their rewards for success are nebulous at best. The penalties for failure generally involve sharks.
But what of the third class, the brains and prime movers behind the plans? It's these upper-bracket villains who have the most appeal, who offer a more discerning evil career choice for anybody with a brain.
These generally tech-savvy (self-proclaimed) supermen are always the real villains. Whether you're talking about Dr No, Blofeld, Drax or Zorin, your scientists, industrialists and geniuses have figured prominently with their master plans to remake the world in their own image. Einstein said "intellectuals solve problems, geniuses prevent them," but in Bond's world, geniuses - generally enabled with some kind of advanced technology - are nothing but trouble.
Why are these men who want to destroy the world “people like us”? Other than the fact that in Skyfall the villainy is dependent on IT?
Mercifully in the real world we don't have to face all that many genocidal schemes to scrub the planet clean and start civilisation again. Not since Noah, anyway. But if there were evil masterminds at large today, where would they come from?
There are two essential ingredients. First, one must possess enough technical knowhow to concoct a scheme involving an orbital EMP cannon, humanity-extirpating nerve gas bombardment, ultimate computer virus etc. Second, it's essential to have the means to fund large-scale building projects (including but not limited to the hollowing-out of volcanoes, snaffling of space shuttles etc) while still maintaining sufficient cash flow to payroll a substantial private army (see above).
Let's look at a few possibles.
Rupert Murdoch:
Transparently the model for Elliot Carver in Tomorrow Never Dies, the workaholic newspaperman hasn't actually used a miraculously puissant stealth warship to precipitate a global conflict by machine-gunning helpless sailors adrift after sinking their ship. Not yet anyway. It seems implausible that they personally eavesdropped on anyone's voicemail, and even more so that they could have done so without technical assistance.
About the most evil thing Murdoch's ever done is treated a politician to a very agreeable lunch and/or colossal, possibly election-tipping media support in exchange for business concessions. And, their recent adoption of Twitter notwithstanding, they don't come across as the most technical person. They tend to outsource that kind of thing, so their schemes are more likely to be dull and pedestrian rather than madly, murderously original.
Julian Assange:
Well, with their bizarre appearance and their penchant for irritating the governments and intelligence agencies of the Western world Assange certainly seems to have some of the qualifications of a Bond villain. Their name, too, definitely has the right ring to it. Their propensity for snaffling highly classified secret files sounds like the kind of thing a Bond villain might get up to. And reports have it that he's certainly a bit, well, strange.
But hiding in an Embassy? And a two-bit little one at that? Either hollow out a volcano like a man, or get out of the business.
Osama Bin Laden:
Undeniably the most genuninely evil of the evil geniuses under discussion. If we allow ourselves for a moment to set aside the appalling murderous intent of 9/11, the repurposing of an airliner as a weapon would definitely have been seen as movie-plot stuff until it actually happened. And rumours persist (not least in the Bond films, for instance in the most recent Casino Royale) that they manipulated the global stock market in the wake of the attack to make millions for their twisted cause. Certainly the net effect of their campaign of terror has been to spark two ruinously expensive wars, if not an actual global nuclear apocalypse. Unless something happens to perk the Western economy up, they may yet succeed in their aim of bring us all to our knees.
Evil? Definitely. Brilliant? Possibly. Alive? Not remotely. That rather puts paid to world domination for Osama.
On a Thursday in October, I arrive just in time for the morning lecture at Oaksterdam University in Oakland, California.
A group of 23 students, mostly guys, with their pens and notebooks out, wait eagerly for their professor Jeff Jones to begin their lecture. Jones has been in the marijuana industry for over 20 years. As they start to talk about “carbohydrates” and “magnesium sulfite” I feel myself getting completely lost.
This is the Harvard of marijuana studies. From the growing, to the harvesting, to the dispensaries, marijuana has become a multi-billion dollar industry in California. It's being called the state's green rush. And these Oaksterdam students are serious -- far more engaged than I remember my classmates in college being. They don't stop taking notes throughout the two-hour lecture. Then they delve into two more hours of lab work where they learn how to manicure the buds for medical marijuana dispensaries. They work in pairs, using customized scissors, inspecting for mold or discoloration, and cutting away leaves and stems. They do this for the same reason that you or I choose one apple over another at the grocery store -- because it looks better.
It's 21-year-old Derek Stephanoff's first semester at Oaksterdam. Before this, they studied aviation technology, but left when they found out about the mandatory drug testing. “If I were to smoke a joint, and take the test once and fail,” they tell me, “they revoke my license and I can never get my license back to work in the field. So I'm blackballed in the industry, which is what would have happened if I continued going to school for that.” Now he's near the top of their class here at Oaksterdam. Stephanoff wants to be on the advocacy side, pushing for legalization, and maybe own a dispensary.
I talked to students from Florida, New York, Michigan, Massachusetts, New Mexico and as far away as France. Lots of them have college degrees already, but say that wasn't getting them very far. When they graduate from Oaksterdam, these students are hoping to be the employers in this industry. So today's lesson about trimming weed ... is kind of an eyeroll. It's menial; there's money in trimming, but it's not glamorous. These guys are aiming to be the suits of the marijuana industry.
Trimmigrants
But there's plenty of young people working in this industry who aren't necessarily interested in moving up. To meet them, I drove 200 miles north, to Humboldt County, the epicenter of the nation's marijuana production dubbed “The Emerald Triangle.” It's to weed what Napa County is to fine wine. Because it is estimated that there are over 100,000 marijuana plants growing in the hills around Humboldt, young people come here from all over the world looking for a job to trim weed during the harvest season. And it's good money: fast trimmers can make $300 - $500 a day, in cash, under the table. So many people swarm the area from September through December that the locals have taken to calling these seasonal workers “trimmigrants.”
Garberville is a tiny town in southern Humboldt; it's under three square miles. Right away, I spot the 20 or so young people scattered up and down the main street. They're sitting on curbs and leaning against storefronts, many wearing big bulky backpacks. Some have dogs.
I try my luck with a group of five guys kicking it outside of a grocery store parking lot. They're in their late teens, partially blocking the sidewalk. When I ask them if they trim, one told me they were been too high on acid to talk to me. The trimming scene attracts drifters who hang around looking pretty drugged out.
At the far end of town, I meet Fermin, a 24-year-old artist from Tennessee. They tell me they heard it was easy to find trim work here, but “the reality is that it's taking a little bit longer than I expected.” A month, so far, with no luck, they say. It's getting colder and the rains are approaching, and Fermin says he's running out of money, sleeping in the woods just outside of town and dumpster diving for food. Until they find a job trimming, Fermin plans to make money by selling their art and playing music on the street.
There is work trimming weed here, but most of it does not go to outsiders. Because there are both state and federal restrictions on how much weed can be grown in California, marijuana farmers prefer to hire people they know and trust: locals. And the locals are getting frustrated with the trimmigrants. One of these locals is Kristin Nevedal, the co-founder of the Emerald Growers Association, a group of a group of 400 marijuana farmers from all over the state. “This is not the fun vacation thing to do -- to show up in Garberville in the fall and see if you can get a job,” they told me. Sleepy towns like Garberville don't have homeless shelters or public restrooms to serve the transient community. “Don't come unless you have a job,” they say.
Marijuana Grow Operation
Tim Blake is a marijuana farmer just south of Garberville in Mendocino County. They have been growing marijuana since the 1970's and runs a collective called Healing Harvest Farms, where they only hires people they know. They took me up a dirt road in their four-wheel-drive pickup truck. I rode in the cab while my producer bounced in the back with Blake's huge bull mastiff that whined as we made our way up over a hill and down into a sunny valley.
Blake's marijuana plants look almost like small trees. They're 10-feet high, 15-feet across, and they say each one will produce about eight pounds of weed. They have 25 plants, which is the legal limit in Mendocino County. “As soon as you squeeze it, it gets right in your fingers. Gets all the resin on it. You can feel it all over,” they say excitedly. “Okay that's the number on desired strain in America right now, in our United States of America, is OG Kush.”
Next, Blake takes me to meet their trimmers. Most of them are under 30. Nayelly is one of two European trimmers in the group. She's also one of the fastest. “The work is beautiful, you know, to work with plants, and stay here, and meet people and share stories, it's amazing, but ... you go crazy after one month,” they say. Trimmers sometimes work 14-hour days, “working the same repetitive motion over and over,” says 28-year-old Bishma, who does catering work in their other life. But during the fall harvest they live here.
For illegal grows, trimmers often work in remote areas with no cell phone service or running water. They sleep in tents and sometimes they don't know where they are. But for Blake's trimmers, it's more like summer camp. They bunk together, share a box of fruits and veggies, and are brought unpasteurized almond milk every morning, made fresh by their boss.
Trimming marijuana doesn't look like other farm work. Anthropology professor Fred Krissman at Humboldt State University, who studies issues related to immigrant farmworkers, calls it an “ag-anomaly” because most of the laborers are white US citizens, meaning that the largest illegal crop in America is the only one using legal workers.
The Sheriffs
Lumber and fishing imploded years ago and now cannabis is estimated to be the largest private industry in Humboldt County. Weed is everywhere here, and even the Sheriff's Office compared it to Prohibition.
In Lieutenant Steve Knight's office at the Humboldt County Sheriff's Department, it smells like weed. Knight says they confiscate so much weed that their wife has to wash their uniforms separately because their kids were going to school smelling like marijuana. The sheriffs bust 90-100 marijuana operations a year, which they admit, is a drop in the bucket.
Sergeant Bryan Quenell sits at their computer for six weeks every year counting the marijuana grows in Humboldt County. They show me the Google Earth imagery of the county, which is covered in red and yellow thumbtack icons. “The yellow pins indicate marijuana grows that I identified,” they tell me. “There are so many of them that they just blend together.”
Sergeant Quenell found over 4000 marijuana operations in a county where just two officers are assigned to deal with the problem. They zoom in on one of the pins to show me what a growth site looks like from the air. “This is National Forest land. All of these little green dots right here. All of those are marijuana plants,” they say as they point to them on the computer screen. “And this grows runs from the top of this ridge, down this valley, all the way down to here.”
They didn't catch the growers, but they did seize 28,000 plants when they busted this grows site. This is just one of thousands of sites and the Sheriff's Department says it can't keep up. In the 1980's and 1990's, Sheriff Mike Downey jumped out of helicopters, busting marijuana grows in the War on Drugs. But today, they say, “It almost seems as though legalization is the best and most legitimate answer at this point because it is truly, in Humboldt County and many of the northern California counties, out of control.”
The Future of Trimming
Lots of locals depend on marijuana for part of their livelihood. For young people who come here from all over to trim, it's a job so lucrative that some make all of their money for the year during the three-month harvest. That's the dream.
Back in Garberville, 24 year-old Fermin is headed to the woods to string their hammock up for the night. They tell me, “I feel like I should have done this years ago, and had connections already. As a newcomer, it's hard to find work.” Fermin had picked figs in California's Central Valley, a backbreaking job that they say wasn't worth the money. As laws around marijuana change throughout the country, making marijuana legal, analysts say the pay scale is bound to go down. Trimming will start to look a lot like picking. Just another low wage farm job.

In Mexico and throughout North and South America, the story of a little girl who was allegedly attacked by their stepfather is capturing headlines, and once again reviving a debate over abortion. The 10-year-old girl from the state of Quintana Roo, in the Yucatan peninsula, has been sent to social services not simply because they were raped, but because she's pregnant.
On its own, the danger the pregnancy poses to the girl's life, as well as the violation and the loss of trust, would be reason enough to place the young girl in care. Sadly, it appears that the state is less interested in protecting the girl's health and rights than those of the fetus they carry. One of the few indications for legal abortion in Mexico is rape, but this is only the latest of any number of cases in which the government, police or health system have actively prevented women from exercising their rights.
Leaving aside the emotional cost of carrying the child of their attacker, a full-term pregnancy carries significant physical risk for a young girl who is not physically developed. The risk of dying in pregnancy is 60 percent greater for adolescents than for women 20-24 years old. And regardless of age, terminating a pregnancy is much less risky than carrying a pregnancy to term. Terminating the pregnancy, even at this late stage -- the little girl is now 18 weeks pregnant -- carries less risk to their health, and will allow them to begin to heal emotionally from the experience. However, the more an abortion is delayed, the more traumatic the procedure will be.
This is not the first time the Mexican government has put aside concerns about a woman's health or human rights, and forced them to carry a pregnancy to term. In the case of one 13-year old girl, Paulina Ramirez, they and their family took their case to the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). They settled with the government of Mexico before the IACHR could issue its ruling. In their agreement, the government agreed to pay for the child's health and education expenses, and issue a decree clarifying the right to abortion for victims of rape. (The experience so galvanized Paulina that they are an abortion rights activist even to this day.)
What's more, Mexico is not alone. In Peru, where the law permits abortion when a woman's life or health are in danger, a 17-year-old was denied an abortion and forced to carry an anencephalic fetus to term. The United Nations Human Rights Commission ruled that the government's actions constituted cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. In Nicaragua recently, doctors refused to provide medical treatment to a young pregnant woman with advanced cancer, until the IACHR issued protective measures. The reason for withholding treatment? Nicaragua banned all abortion in 2006, and doctors were more afraid of damaging the fetus than of what would happen to a sick woman with a 10-year-old child to support.
Throughout Latin America, governments and conservative religious leaders have elevated the rights of the "unborn" above those of girls and women -- so much so that they have repeatedly put women's lives and health at risk, violating their human rights. When we express sadness and horror at cases like these, we must also examine how we allow religious authorities to pit a woman against their fetus, as if they were in conflict. In reality, a fetus is entirely dependent upon the individual carrying it; it is their health that must be protected first and foremost. Yet state and religious actors opposed to abortion insist on perpetuating the false conflict of woman versus fetus; as this Mexico case shows, it can work in their favor.
But they do not always succeed. In Brazil last year, the Catholic church threatened to excommunicate the mother of a nine-year old girl who had been raped, because they sought an abortion for their daughter when they were found pregnant. The public outcry was so great that the church changed course and only excommunicated the doctors who performed the procedure. They did not, however, excommunicate the man who raped the little girl; according to Archbishop Don Jose Cardoso of Recife, "a graver act than [rape] is abortion, to eliminate an innocent life."
Ultimately, there could be no better illustration of their disregard for the lives of women and girls.
The eventual robot is going to have *lots* of these joints. If I took a traditional servo approach, I'd need three wires per devices - power, ground and PWM. Assuming I bus the power and ground, that still leaves one wire per device for control; so with 30 devices that's 30 wires to thread and terminate on some eventual controller. I wanted something better.
My first plan was being to implement these joints as 1-wire devices. That way I could bus the control wire between all the devices and have just a single control wire at the controller. Unfortunately, while there are some nice Arduino libraries to implemented 1-wire slaves, my boards only run at 8MHz (the internal clock rate) which isn't fast enough to make them work, or at least work reliably.
Fortunately I had a fallback plan. I'm old enough to remember the Cambridge Ring - not some kind of upper class network of students spying for Russia - but an early networking protocol. Leaving aside the specific implementation details, it was essentially a ring of serial lines where each transmitter was connected to the next receiver (the last being connected back to the first). Messages are passed round the ring until they reach the destination.
So I build a ring network which works on a similar principle. Each Arduino TX is connected to the next Arduino RX, and then messages are encoded and sent around the network. To operate any given device a message is sent along the network to the desired target where it is executed. The result is a large network of devices (~250) with just two wires and usable by anything with a serial line.
The RingNet is IOS level 3/4 - ordered, reliable delivered at least once, datagrams (Update 9/5/16 - originally the network was unreliable, but fix that today).

What does a litti-lover do after moving to Bombay Mumbai? Especially after being a regular visitor to the Litti shop in Kothrud, Pune for 3 years, and feeling nostalgic about it (also nostalgic about the litti shops in Bihar/Jharkhan railway stations)?
Set out on a mission to find an outlet over here.
The efforts paid off handsomely. And I've found two places which offer amazing litti-chokha in Andheri itself. And my friends on Twitter have already sampled their fare and made them quasi-famous amongst their friends.
1. The first is a bunch of shops on the R K Paramhans Marg (old Nagardas Road) near the Andheri subway on the east. When you cross the subway and keep going on the newly made left side of the road, you come across a series of garages and tyre shops. And small eateries. Last I checked, at least two of these eateries also serve litti-chokha in the evening. I've eaten in Mahalaxmi (their signboard is no more there thanks to the weather) which is right next to the Exide shop, and must say that their bharta was out of this world. The other outlet is called Saipraasaad, which is 3-4 shops away towards the subway.

23rd May 2014 Update: Litti Express has shut down. They have reopened as Food Temple. But are we interested in that?
2. The other is near Lokhandwala in Andheri West. In the lane next to the Lotus petrol pump (diagonally opposite to the Versova Cinemax), there's a shop by the name Litti Express. The exact address is shop No. 979, New Link Road, Near Lotus Petrol Pump, Andheri West. The portions are small compared to the Andheri east shops, but it still tastes brilliant nevertheless. They do home delivery as well if you're nearby and lucky (that is, they have enough delivery boys working that day), just call 022 2674 1460, or 98 69 284115.

Music has long struck me as a kind of magic. In terms of my life essentials, it ranks only just below oxygen, food, water, shelter and love. For 11 years I have been attempting to conjure some of that magic myself by learning to play guitar.
Yet for most of those years I practiced fitfully, and at some point I stopped improving. When my progress plateaued, so did my enthusiasm. Despite the pleasure I derive from watching a person with a six-string plugged into an amplifier, plucking and strumming to elicit beautiful noise, I seemed destined to never fully master this iconic instrument.
But then I discovered a video game that rekindled my obsession. It's called Rocksmith, and it is designed specifically to teach people to play guitar. Earlier games, namely Guitar Hero and Rock Band, had shown that tens of millions of people could become hooked on playing fake, simplified instruments while fake, simplified musical scores scrolled down their televisions. After clocking in several jam sessions, many players even began to sound competent. But that expertise evaporated the second the game shut off.
Laurent Detoc, the North America president of Ubisoft, a game development studio, hated the gulf that separated actual and simulated musicianship. In 2011 they told the San Francisco Business Times, “I just could not believe the amount of waste that had gone in people spending so much time with plastic guitars.” Their company had assigned some designers to figuring out how to make playing real guitars just as fun for gamers as jamming on a plastic replica. What they came up with is, to my mind, the purest demonstration of the power of gamification — using the principles of game play to make actual learning feel addictive. Case in point: I've learned to play more songs in two and a half years with Rocksmith than in the previous eight years of lackluster progress combined.
Jerry Cantrell, lead guitarist/vocalist of Alice in Chains, playing Rocksmith
My attempts to learn guitar followed a path familiar to many teenage rock enthusiasts. They began with an acoustic guitar my parents gave me in 2004, for my sixteenth birthday, and weekly lessons with a tutor. My teacher — a bookish, chubby, middle-aged man who looked nothing like Jimi Hendrix — was prescriptive in their instruction. They told me that my left thumb must remain pointing skyward against the back of the neck, regardless of the notes or chord shape required. This dictum puzzled and infuriated me, as none of the popular musicians I'd seen in music videos were so staid in their playing; rather, they were fluid and catlike. I wanted to be like them.
Learning to read music was an unwelcome chore, too, especially when my setlist consisted of nursery rhymes to be wrung out one note at a time. I wanted to learn guitar because an expert player sounded and looked cool, yet there wasn't much that was cool about my tutor's dry approach. So I quit lessons.
Many of my favorite songs — from bands such as Tool, Led Zeppelin, Metallica and Rage Against The Machine — sounded thin and bloodless when ineptly fretted on an acoustic guitar. Eventually, my wallet lined with money saved from my first job as a dishwasher at a Sizzler restaurant, I acquired the desired technological upgrade: an electric guitar — a handsome, dark blue copy of the classic Fender Stratocaster — and a 30-watt amp.
Like millions of guitarists before me, I began trying to play by reading free online guitar tablature, which show where notes and chords are positioned on the fretboard, and how to play them. For a time I thrived on this self-directed learning. I'd sit in front of a computer screen for hours, mp3s blasting as I glanced between tab and neck, teaching my fingers how to grip the wood, earning the knowledge note by note. On weekends I'd jam with my more talented friends, hoping that I'd absorb their superior abilities through osmosis.
So it went for several pleasant years.
And then I became frustrated. I didn't know how to improve my skill set, and I lost motivation. The instrument sat untouched for months at a time. Years, even. My guitar became a piece of home decor.
It would take something special to lift me from this funk. In August 2012 I discovered a video game disc marked Rocksmith, which came with what looked like a regular guitar cable. Most people haven't heard of the game — it's sold a few million copies worldwide, but unless you were browsing in a store or happened upon a review, you wouldn't know it existed. The graphics look nice enough, but there's nothing astonishing about the game's mechanics. But I don't care.
Here's why: learning guitar is fucking hard. There's a reason that millions of people start studying it but few stick with it. The learning curve is steep, and it can take years before you sound anything but incompetent. To have a game with an intelligent, intuitive design that supports and motivates this difficult act is one of the most extraordinary achievements in the history of video game design.
The idea behind Rocksmith is simple: to improve on Guitar Hero and Rock Band by plugging actual guitars into a gaming console. The technological insight that made it possible was Ubisoft's ‘real tone' cable. The cable plugs into the guitar to capture audio from the instrument, converts the signal from analog to digital, and sends the result to Rocksmith through a USB connection. Rocksmith then detects the notes within the instrument's signal in real time, and displays that data on the screen as a ‘hit' or ‘miss.'
The software leans heavily on the work of Ubisoft's ‘note-trackers,' such as Brian McCune. On McCune's first day in the San Francisco office, in November 2010, they played an early build of the game for seven hours. McCune powered up the game, plugged the real tone cable into an electric guitar jack, and selected ‘Are You Gonna Go My Way,' the catchy 1993 hit single by Lenny Kravitz. The song's lead riff is played high on the guitar neck, a feat that demands ample string-bending dexterity. At the time McCune felt competent as a musician, but mediocre as a guitarist. “This thing took me to the next level,” they say. “It was unreal.”
They noticed how Rocksmith's ‘dynamic difficulty' feature intuitively offered them a sparse stream of notes that scrolled gently down the screen. As McCune successfully matched the notes and chords as they appeared, the notes came faster, before the game ultimately revealed the full mechanics of a song. “I could tell, from day one — this thing really works,” says McCune. “I was so excited about the implications of this technology, and how so many people were going to be given the avenue to achieve something they've always wanted, but didn't know how to get there.” They remember thinking on that first day: “This is my job? Are you serious? This is fantastic!”
They describe the role they were hired for as “the detailed analysis and transcription of music.” “We transcribe every note and nuance of any guitar or bass that appears on the recording. That's step one,” they say. “The next step beyond that is to break down the performance into small iterations of each musical phrase.” In effect, this means that for every five seconds of music, the note-trackers prescribe at least one note for the player to attempt to fret on the guitar; if the player succeeds, more notes are introduced seamlessly. McCune, a bearded 31-year-old, is uniquely suited to this specialized role — they had spent many years arranging music for competitive high school marching bands, in addition to playing throughout the United States and at Carnegie Hall in New York City as a classically trained percussionist, orchestrator and composer.
McCune and their team of note-trackers listen carefully to each song and laboriously transcribe the individual notes and chords into Ubisoft's custom-built software program. They slow down songs, isolate specific frequency ranges and look up live footage to see where on the fretboard the musicians are playing. “We're hearing everything at once,” they say. “It requires a lot of meticulous, fatiguing, nuanced slowing-down of musical sections.”
After tracking all the notes, the next step — the most time-consuming — is to work on each song's dynamic difficulty levels. “It's this interesting style of adaptive learning: we want to make sure we're introducing to players the path of the least resistance to learning a music phrase,” they say. “It's kind of like a giant puzzle: you have to unearth all the information, and then showcase an intelligent way to present the information to someone who's never seen it before.”
What Is Wrong With the CDC?
Bush politicized science agencies in the US, undermining science there.
Courtesy: healthfreedoms.org
(LONDON) - There are US attorneys in Atlanta who are already looking into a CDC connection to the autism/vaccine researcher who has been indicted for fraud
The US has pandemic laws on the books and a new food safety law which both threaten the country with martial law (and threaten our normal animals with being - in Pat Roberts' word - "terminated") based on CDC data and on the CDC declaring outbreaks.
How is it that all our lives (including our animals's lives - our primary food supply) and the country's future as a democracy have become tied to CDC information and the CDC status as an ultimate arbiter of "science" and danger - a CDC funded by the pharmaceutical corporations and involved with military?
If this country is to be safe, a closer look at the CDC is needed. This doesn't mean questioning the sincerity of the scientists working there but asking: "What is happening at the CDC at the policy level and what are its connections to profit-making vaccine manufacturers?"
CDC first began as an adjunct of the US Public Health Service, by helping the military and US colonial expansion.
The U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) and Malaria (1914-1942) During the U.S. military occupation of Cuba and the construction of the Panama Canal at the turn of the 20th century, U.S. officials made great strides in the control of malaria and yellow fever. ... USPHS established malaria control activities around military bases in the malarious regions of the southern United States to allow soldiers to train year round.
The drug used was chloroquine (Resochin) produced by the German pharmaceutical company Bayer... at the same time Bayer was running concentration camps across Europe during WWII).
The DDT used came from Merck, a company which inherited the money from IG Farben, the Nazi pharmaceutical and chemical complex that put Hitler into office was the primary funder of Nazi operations. (As a disturbing side note given IG Farben's history with gays, Merck's chief of vaccines admitted Merck started the AIDS epidemic in the US with their HEP vaccine for gay men and that all their vaccines are loaded with multiple viruses and cancers.)
The CDC was founded immediately after WWII - in 1946. This occurred at the same time that leading Nazi scientists (including in the pharmaceutical industry) were being brought to the US by the Bush family
Bush politicized science agencies in the US, undermining science there. Bobby Kennedy Jr. wrote:
Today, flat-earthers within the Bush Administration--aided by right-wing allies who have produced assorted hired guns and conservative think tanks to further their goals--are engaged in a campaign to suppress science that is arguably unmatched in the Western world since the Inquisition. Sometimes, rather than suppress good science, they simply order up their own. Meanwhile, the Bush White House is purging, censoring and blacklisting scientists and engineers whose work threatens the profits of the Administration's corporate paymasters or challenges the ideological underpinnings of their radical anti-environmental agenda. Indeed, so extreme is this campaign that more than sixty scientists, including Nobel laureates and medical experts, released a statement on February 18 that accuses the Bush Administration of deliberately distorting scientific fact "for partisan political ends." .... Roger Kennedy, former director of the National Park Service, told me that the alteration and deletion of scientific information is now standard procedure at Interior. "It's hard to decide what is more demoralizing about the Administration's politicization of the scientific process," they said, "its disdain for professional scientists working for our government or its willingness to deceive the American public." .... The Bush Administration reacted to the frightening findings (on the pesticide Atrazine) not by banning this dangerous chemical, as the European Union has, but by taking the studies away from EPA scientists and, in an unprecedented move, giving the chemical's manufacturer, Switzerland-based Syngenta, control over federal research. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Sherry Ford, a spokesperson for Syngenta, praised without irony the advantages of having the company monitor its own product. "This is one way we can ensure it's not presenting any risk to the environment."
Bush didn't just affect the EPA. From Gerberding/Bush Malpractice at the CDC:
It's not bad enough that the professional heart of CDC is heading for the exits as fast as they can get there in response to the high handed, abrasive and incompetent management of its Director, Dr. Julie Gerberding. Not bad enough at all. Dr. Gerberding now is getting rid of good people who haven't voluntarily jumped ship. ... Dr. John Howard, Director for the last six years of the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) is being let go by the Bush administration, using their lap dog, Dr. Gerberding to do the deed. ... One of the jobs Dr. Howard has been doing is coordinating the ground zero health study. Maybe that's the source of the problem: ... Why anyone with competence would want to stay on in this administration is a bit of a mystery, but I guess Dr. Howard thought they had a job to do and they wanted to do it. .... What qualifications? A Doctor of Medicine degree (1974), a Master of Occupational Health (1982), a Juris Doctor (1986), and a Master of Laws (1987). And Dr. Gerberding's response to their willingness to serve? "Dr. Julie Gerberding met with Dr. John Howard and let them know that HHS/CDC will begin a search for a new NIOSH director."
After first raising the specter of a pandemic flu or virus that would kill millions based on the 20-50 million 1918 deaths, Bush got their appointee at the CDC, Louise Gerbeding, to set up a pandemic apparatus which links the CDC to Homeland Security and the military.
The problem is that the CDC/DHS/military connection is based on a complete medical fiction - a fiction as extreme as Bush's infamous lie of WMDs in Iraq. The National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has shown that most of the 1918 deaths were not caused by a flu or virus at all but by common upper respiratory bacteria. That bacteria led to the pneumonias that killed and the strongest likely cause was aspirin - a product invented by Bayer
Aspirin was being given at lethal doses (explaining the "mysterious" deaths of young people who normally never died from flus and of people being well in the morning and dead by evening). Aspirin was aggressively promoted globally by the Bayer and the drug industry, the US government, the military and medical authorities - resulting in a human catastrophe of epic proportions - precisely the combination of groups Bush brought together with their pandemic laws. Bush, however, increased the force of that combination - removing liability for anything they do, giving them martial law powers, and with no requirement even to prove a contagious disease is present.
Meanwhile, the CDC is overriding the scientific reality of NIAID data that 1918 was not about a virus, to push vaccines based on a "virulent virus" in 1918. But the 1918 deaths relate to a pharmaceutical industry catastrophe, not a virus. Yet the CDC promotes a medical non-reality, makes it into a great mystery, and then seeks research funds into it - something that didn't exist:
The influenza pandemic of 1918-19 killed an estimated 20 to 50 million people worldwide, many more than the subsequent pandemics of the 20th century. The biological properties that confer virulence to pandemic influenza viruses were poorly understood. Research to better understand how the individual genes of the1918 pandemic influenza virus contribute to the disease process could provide important insights into the basis of virulence.
The CDC also falsely promotes threat around flu deaths in general. In 2004, under Bush, the CDC also said that "Every year in the United States, on average.......approximately 36,000 people die from flu. Butby the CDC's own records, the number of flu deaths in 2002 were 753. CDC
Having created a vast agency structure which continues to prop up a complete fiction that the US (and world) faces the return of a deadly virus like the one in 1918 capable of killing millions, as well as other fictional viral threats, and the urgent need for developing vaccines to defend against it, Gerberding subsequently left to take a job paying millions, as head of the vaccine division at Merck, as Merck's sales are dragging
Going further back historically beyond Bush, the CDC's past history with "pandemics" and vaccines is already at issue. David Senser who was head of the CDC when it was informed of the Tuskegee experiment and did nothing to stop, it, was head of the CDC in 1976 as it created (as now) unwarranted fear around swine flu - based on the death of a single soldier on a military base. The CDC ran a campaign urging everyone to get swine flu vaccines while lying to the public that the vaccines it was giving out had been tested. They had not and killed 500 people and was paralyzing many more, had been tested. Despite the deaths and maiming that occurred with the vaccine program, and despite virtually no deaths attributable to swine flu, at no point did the CDC call for a halt to the vaccine campaign which was only stopped when a private law firm filed suit.
Now Congress and this White House have used federal power for the same purpose. Led by the President, the Republicans have gutted scientific research budgets and politicized science within the federal agencies. The very leaders who so often condemn the trend toward moral relativism are fostering and encouraging the trend toward scientific relativism. The very ideologues who derided Bill Clinton as a liar have now institutionalized dishonesty and made it the reigning culture of America's federal agencies.
The Bush Administration has so violated and corrupted the institutional culture of government agencies charged with scientific research that it could take a generation for them to recover their integrity even if Bush is defeated this fall. Says Princeton University scientist Michael Oppenheimer, "If you believe in a rational universe, in enlightenment, in knowledge and in a search for the truth, this White House is an absolute disaster."
The Bushes are closely tied to the pharmaceutical industry historically. The industry helped put GW Bush into office (as an unelected president). In less than a year, Bush introduced highly unconstitutional pandemic laws (indistinguishable from martial law) across the country, giving immense power to the pharmaceutical industry to force tests, taking of samples and untested, unknown "treatments" (vaccines, chemicals, drugs) on Americans at the threat of prison if they don't submit.
It is one thing for the CDC: 1. to be promoting a lie about 1918 and virulent viruses in general, and another to 2. to be putting out frightening and false data on swine flu, as part of what appears to be a financial that rivals the bailout and an international medical scandal, and another to 3. to be getting their funding from the pharmaceutical industry which has been involved in dismantling this country, and another to 4. to have created a massive bureaucratic structure based on lies which would trigger DHS and military action based on those lies ... but when the CDC is connected to 500,000 coffins stored in Georgia (each able to hold more than 2 people), it is time for the country to demand a criminal investigation into the CDC. While there is no influenza pandemic capable of killing millions, the country has already seen that Bayer had influenza vaccines containing live avian flu - a bio-weapon. However, if mandated vaccines and forced on Americans under the guise of a deadly pandemic, those or other vaccines could trigger deaths where nature itself would not.
It is time to ask what is really going on and for whom? It appears that the world's richest people are involved in "pandemics" and vaccines along with Henry Kissinger

The Rs 2.11 lakh crore capital infusion in public sector banks (PSBs), announced by the Narendra Modi-government recently, will enable banks to resume lending to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), said industry experts and bankers. On 24 October 2017 the government unveiled an unprecedented Rs 2.11 lakh crore capital infusion for state-run lenders that includes a mix of re-capitalisation bonds, budgetary support, and equity dilution. The modalities of the recapitalisation bonds are yet to be worked out.
MSMEs have been struggling for capital, particularly in recent years. This scenario worsened post-demonetisation and the introduction of goods and services tax (GST) as small traders were severely hit by cash crunch and uncertainty on tax rules.
According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, bank lending to small and medium companies have either remained flat or shrank in the last few years. As on September 2017, bank credit to micro and small companies is at Rs 3.69 lakh crore, largely same as the figures in the previous two years. Credit offtake of medium-sized companies has shrunk to Rs 1.01 lakh crore.
With the induction of capital, there could be a definite boost to credit to this sector, say experts. “Many banks have been unable to lend to this sector because of capital constraints and large non-performing assets (NPAs). Also, MSMEs haven't been doing too well themselves and post-demonetisation and GST, their performance hasn't been promising,” says Jayanta Sinha, independent banking consultant and former chief general manager, State Bank of India.
The government's move will give a boost to the MSME sector and its activity, said Avinash K Dalal (Nallawala), founder and national president of All India MSME Association. “Inspite of RBI directives, PSU banks spread red carpet for corporates. Their treatment of the MSME sector is step-motherly. The announcement by Jaitley will give a boost to employment, exports and also the GDP of the country,” they said.
Dalal pointed out that NPAs from the MSME sector would be much smaller than those in the corporate sector. The sector has been boosted by a number of schemes offered by the MSME Ministry, National Small Industries Corporation and Mudra Bank, they pointed out.
Banks have been lending to MSMEs but only certain large companies in the MSME sector make the cut and these typically are those who do not do only-cash sales. Besides, these companies also maintain accounts and are successful in securing loans.
MSMEs are referred to as ‘unorganised' only when the sector is bundled with small SMEs like shopkeepers, etc. “One of the challenges has been that a number of companies that have become non-performing assets have been from this sector. Many small banks are struggling with capital adequacy issues and are thus unable to lend,” said R K Bansal, former executive director of IDBI Bank.
With banks not being very forthcoming so far to lend to the MSME sector, fintech companies have been reaping rewards. Cash Suvidha, an online fintech platform that claims to offer business loans in three days, says that banks ask for credit score and Cibil report which many in this sector are unable to comply.
“We disburse loans now in 48 hours from 3 days earlier at 19 percent to 24 percent on reducing balance EMIs. We do it based on our logarithms of human behavior, social quotient of the borrower, etc,” says Rajesh Gupta, founder, Cash Suvidha. It disburses ticket sizes in the range of Rs 20,000 to Rs 5 lakhs. “We have a target of disbursing Rs 100 crore by the end of financial year 2018 and have disbursed approximately Rs 54 crore so far," they said.
Welcoming the government's decision to boost the MSME sector, some still doubted the ability of the banks to disburse money to the sector. Anil Kothuri, president - head retail finance, Edelweisss, said though the bank recapitalisaion will ensure that banks are adequately provided for without dipping into their current capital. A little more money to the sector will help, they said, adding that however, there is a gap between ability and the unwillingness to lend.
"Large corporates find it easy to get loans and so do individuals from banks. But SMEs are not able to get loans and continue to be underserved as there is no standard procedure across banks unlike in the NBFCs and private banks. Private sector banks and NBFCS are able to help the sector by aggregating ways of underwriting customers. Standardisation leads thus to scale. All said and done PSU has the bulk of distribution unlike NBFCs and private banks."

Either way, an Aramco I.P.O. raises questions, and what investors don't know about the company — the accuracy of its claimed oil and gas reserves, for instance — is only one of them. An investment in Aramco would also be an investment in a kingdom that systematically represses women, and hence, in human and social capital. None of the many officials named to new posts in the decrees were women.
Though ostensibly aimed at modernization, neither the development plan nor the decrees propose changes in the kingdom's basic political arrangements, in which religious fundamentalists uphold the legitimacy of the royal family in exchange for freedom to foster and spread extremist ideology. There is also no explanation of how even a big infusion of cash would build new industries from nothing and transform Saudi Arabia's estimated 20 million subjects into self-supporting employers and employees.
Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating agency, alluded to all that when it downgraded Saudi Arabia a week after the decrees were issued, citing the kingdom's reduced ability to “weather future shocks” in the face of lower growth, higher debt and dwindling financial reserves low oil prices. In Moody's view, it is too soon to tell if the new plan will revive the credit rating or if the proposed reforms can be achieved without causing social unrest.
Saudi Arabia desperately needs to modernize, and even talking about that need is a step forward. But neither the Saudis nor their global bankers should pretend that an I.P.O. of Aramco, as the company is currently configured, is a viable means to that end.
Carolyn Kaster / AP Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain makes a campaign stop at Union Station in Kansas City, Mo.
John McCain might seem like a long shot. He's the presumptive Republican nominee at a time when the two-term Republican President is wildly unpopular and Republicans are losing elections in perennially Republican districts and the party base isn't exactly drooling over him. They supported the President's unpopular efforts to transform Iraq and revamp Social Security; they were against the Bush tax cuts before they were for them. He's a 71-year-old Washington hand in a change election. And their 46-year-old opponent is a lot better at raising money, delivering speeches, drawing crowds and registering new voters.
Oh, let's just admit it: John McCain is a long shot. He's got a heroic personal story, and being white has never hurt a presidential candidate, but on paper 2008 just doesn't look like their year. And considering what's happening off paper, it might be time to ask the question the horse-race-loving media are never supposed to ask: Is McCain a no-shot?
Last week, the McCain campaign's case against Barack Obama went something like this: He's irresponsible when it comes to Iraq, naive when it comes to Iran and a Big Government liberal when it comes to the economy. But now Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has more or less endorsed Obama's plan to withdraw from Iraq, forcing McCain to argue that al-Maliki didn't really mean it, and even the Bush Administration has accepted a "time horizon" for withdrawal, if not a precise "timetable." The Bush Administration has also engaged in some diplomatic outreach with Iran, just as Obama has recommended, a severe blow to McCain's efforts to portray Obama's willingness to engage in dialogue as appeasement. And on the economy, a TIME/Rockefeller Foundation poll found that 82% of the country supports more federal infrastructure spending designed to create jobs. When Big Government liberalism is all the rage, McCain's courage in opposing water projects or the farm bill becomes less of a selling point.
McCain has struggled to find their voice in this environment. Their initial reaction to the foreclosure crisis boiled down to old-fashioned conservative self-reliance, which went over like a lead balloon, and was eventually replaced with a more aggressive plan for government assistance. They have changed or shaded their positions on offshore drilling, the estate tax, ethanol, immigration and a host of other issues. They can't seem to decide whether to run as a maverick and risk demoralizing a GOP base that already mistrusts them or run as a conservative and risk alienating swing voters who already miss the John McCain of 2000. And their campaign  which survived a near-death experience in the primaries  is in seemingly perpetual turmoil.
But McCain is still a compelling figure, and shake-ups happen. Their real problem is the political environment. He's a Republican in what is emerging as a Democratic year. And he's aligned with Bush in a year of Bush fatigue over the Bush economy. Emory University's Alan Abramowitz has concocted a formula that has predicted the popular vote winner in 14 of the last 15 elections; it missed in 1968 but got the razor-thin margin right. Their barometer uses three criteria: the approval rating of the incumbent President, the economic growth rate and the "time-for-a-change" factor of whether the incumbent's party has controlled the White House for two terms. McCain's score is the worst since Jimmy Carter's in 1980. "History suggests that McCain is toast," Clive Crook wrote in the Financial Times.
Then again, history also suggests that Democrats don't blow out Republicans; there hasn't been a Democratic landslide since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. It's also unwise to underestimate the hunger of the media for an exciting race. If Obama emerges as a big front runner, it's a good bet that the press will air more of McCain's attacks. And so far, polls have indicated a fairly tight race, usually tilting toward Obama by just a few points. Obama is still a relative newcomer in a wartime election, unknown to many Americans. He's still got their Rev. Wright problem. And during the primaries, even a sizable number of Democrats told pollsters they felt uncomfortable voting for a black man.
But Obama is getting to look like a leader this week, comparing withdrawal plans with al-Maliki, welcoming the Bush Administration to it's-O.K.-to-negotiate-with-Iran club, making McCain look like an isolated warmonger. It was one thing when McCain was framing the election as a monumental decision of victory vs. surrender; time horizon vs. timetable is going to be a tougher sell. Meanwhile, Obama's campaign has been signing up thousands of new Democratic voters and shoveling in cash it can use to introduce them to America. They could still foul up the debates or make a monumental gaffe or otherwise misplay their strong hand. It's still possible that something could happen  Fidel Castro's death? A Democratic scandal?  to shake up the dynamics of the race. In politics, anything's possible.
That doesn't mean that anything's probable. The media will try to preserve the illusion of a toss-up; you'll keep seeing "Obama Leads, But Voters Have Concerns" headlines. But when Democrats are winning blood-red congressional districts in Mississippi and Louisiana, when the Republican President is down to 28% approval ratings, when the economy is tanking and world affairs keep breaking Obama's way, it shouldn't be heresy to recognize that McCain needs an improbable series of breaks. Analysts get paid to analyze and cable news has airtime to fill, so pundits have an incentive to make politics seem complicated. In the end, though, it's usually pretty simple. Everyone seems to agree that 2008 is a change election. Which of these guys looks like change?
HOUSTON -- Houston Texans coach Bill O'Brien has said Tom Savage is the team's No. 1 quarterback, and on Wednesday, star wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins said Savage has "earned" that role.
Savage will compete with rookie Deshaun Watson during training camp to open the season as the Texans' starter under center, but O'Brien has made it clear that Savage has the advantage right now.
"I like their leadership," Hopkins said. "From last year, when they aren't playing on the field, they were still showing the guys, telling us what we should do, helping us out like they were the starting quarterback. Now that he's in that role, it's no surprise to anybody on this field that they deserve that role. They have earned it, not just from playing, but from the chemistry they have built in the locker room with everybody."

The bond between Savage and their wide receivers is one Hopkins has mentioned multiple times this offseason, citing the importance of not only getting the reps on the field but spending time together off the field as well, calling it a "huge key" this offseason. Hopkins said they think that relationship "makes a big difference."
"The teams you see winning championships are teams that are close, not just on the field but off the field," Hopkins said. "You look at teams that won championships and you look at the players, and you can tell they're not just teammates, they're friends as well."
The Texans' passing game struggled last season with Brock Osweiler and Savage under center, tying for 30th in the NFL in receiving touchdowns. Hopkins, who had a breakout season in 2015, had a drop in production last season, catching 78 passes for 954 yards and four touchdowns.
After nine weeks of the offseason program, Hopkins says they have noticed a difference in the O'Brien-led offense.
"[It's got a] very good feel," Hopkins said. "I've been in this offense for going on four years now. Having [new assistant coach] Wes Welker out here that's a recently removed wide receiver, it helps out a lot to have a guy that knows this offense better than anybody. To be here every day working with us, it makes a big difference."

Meriden, West Midlands, has woken up to the EU referendum result – leaving some leave voters overjoyed but others enduring terrors of self-doubt
Daybreak in middle England on Friday was warm and cloudless and full of possibilities.
Brexit, the fallout and the UK's future: what we know so far Read more
But the morning sunshine was soon obscured by clouds, not just meteorologically but also in the minds of many of those who had ushered in a new dawn only hours earlier.
In the West Midlands village of Meriden, some of the 17 million voters who had willed Britain's departure from the EU into being been not so much celebrating Freedom Friday as enduring terrors of self-doubt. A few seemed like kids who had disobeyed instructions, pressed the eject button in the pilot's cockpit, and were starting to wonder what the hell was happening.
Meriden is traditionally regarded as the geographical centre of England and a place as good as any to represent the heartbeat of the nation. It is probably the smallest place in England to have its name on a parliamentary constituency (once marginal, now a safe Tory seat).

On the green is the old ragged cross that marks England's alleged centre, covered with soft English moss, fringed by pink English roses, serenaded by cheery English birdsong (some performers being migrants). A few yards away is the Spar store run by Brummie Sikh brothers Dal and Kam Singh Nijjar, who work for 16 hours a day, seven days a week.
A year ago, when Meriden was in the thrall of election week, Dal told me their customers were very worried about immigration. They were spot-on, and Meriden's voting pattern reflected the first phase of an anti-immigrant mood all over the white suburban West Midlands, where there are few non-whites or eastern Europeans in the vicinity (popular souls like Dal and Kam excepted), but where the thought of Birmingham makes many residents shudder.
This time, Dal said on Thursday night, their customers were voting to leave, big time. Again, they were right. In the early hours of Friday morning, Solihull, the metropolitan borough that includes Meriden, declared it had voted to leave by 56% to 44%.
When Kam Singh Nijjar opened at 6am on Friday morning, not all their customers knew what had happened.
“We've left,” Kam said to one early customer.
“Whaa?”
“Gone.”
“Out?”
“Yeah.”
“Good. Let's get on with it.”
By 7am the shop was getting busier, the dog-walkers were out in force and the hum of traffic was getting louder. And it was possible to pick up signs of doubt. John Quinn, retired from the motor trade, said: “Your head can rule or your heart can rule. I went with my heart, I just felt it had got too much towards Europe rather than Britain, and that the EU needs Britain more than Britain needs the EU.”
Care worker Rachel Pomeroy was out in the green with their deaf English bull terrier Stewie. Stewie's owner turned out to be a remain voter: “I don't think the country's in a very good state as it is and I thought leaving would make it even worse,” they said.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Led astray? Rachel Pomeroy – a remain voter – fears the consequences of leave: ‘I don't think the country's in a very good state as it is'. Photograph: Andrew Fox for the Guardian
Others were entirely free of self-doubt, like furniture restorer Kevin Jones. “It's fantastic. We won't have any Germans telling us what to do. Look at all those cars: Audi, Mercedes, BMW. You're telling me we're not going to get a trade deal? They may be arrogant, old Angela [Merkel], but they aren't stupid.”
And at the home of Nick Courtney, behind a laurel hedge and three big leave posters, Meriden's most-committed Ukip activist had their bottle of French champagne (appellation d'origine contrôlée, geographical status protected under EU law) all ready for the evening to come. “A day of reckoning is coming,” said a joyful Courtney. “There will be a domino effect across Europe. Mark my words it will happen.”
The posters are directly opposite the Strawberry Bank Hotel's sign saying “Book Your Wedding Here”, reminders to the bride and groom–to–be that marriages can be followed by hellishly messy divorces. Courtney is a newcomer in Meriden but they insist no one has objected to their display. “I've had no backlash whatever. My neighbours informed me how pleased they are to see the signs. And 95% of my friends want to get out.”
What does Brexit mean to you? Holidays, homes and jobs Read more
The least informed person I met all day seemed to speak for a surprisingly large number of people. They had come out of the Nijjars' shop looking smart but distracted. “I don't understand it,” they wailed, “so I left it to the people who did. Now I'm being told it's not good and it's going to cost us loads of money. Like we need that.”
Here was a theme that often cropped up: the sense that the question should never have been asked, that this was a question involving complexities not principle, and that the elected leaders should have sorted it out themselves. (Essay topic for David Cameron in their forthcoming twilight: “Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer.” Analyse and discuss.)
Again and again around Meriden – even after an interminable campaign and decades of argument before that – people said they thought no one had ever presented the pros and cons of membership fairly and comprehensibly. All they heard was propaganda.
Nearby at Berkswell station, waiting for the 7.42 into Birmingham New Street, the vanquished remainers seemed more confident in their stance. “Very disappointing result and the campaign's been awful,” said solicitor David Sheldon. “The leaders have behaved appallingly. Funny really. A guy at work who was voting out said: ‘Don't worry. It won't ever happen.'”
Hospital sonographer Romesh Attwall, the daughter of Indian migrants, was not exactly repentant but somewhat nervous. “I'm a child of immigrants. But when my parents came from India, Britain needed people to work here. Now there's an immigration problem. I know there's going to be instability. I just hope I don't live to regret this.”

Down the road in Stratford-upon-Avon, the world, as it does every summer's day, had made its way to Shakespeare's old front door. Outside their birthplace was a English teacher from Stuttgart, Ulrike Mensing, who was taking the news hard. “Coming from Germany, we feel let down. Being rejected doesn't feel so nice. I came here very often. I love Great Britain so much.”
There was also Blyth Timken, there with their two sons from Santa Fe, New Mexico. They shared the general bewilderment. “I did try to find the arguments for each side but I never discovered them. If it was me I'd think I'd have gone for remain. As travellers it's so nice not to have to stop at every border.”
Back at the Spar, Kam reported on their morning conversations with those who had voted for Brexit. “They've kept telling me I placed my vote but I didn't expect [it] to happen. A lot of people are worrying about it, just a bit. They're happy enough at the moment. But there's this strange tingling in the back of their minds.”
And just after lunchtime there was a sudden downpour.
Unemployment is Much Higher for Blacks Regardless Of Level of Education
By Victor Ochieng
The jobless rate among black people has been a matter of concern for many years. Some officials have justified such rates, saying that graduation rate among blacks is equally comparatively low, leading to such worrying statistics.
However, in a new report released by Economic Policy Institute, the rate of unemployment among Blacks is almost twice that of their white peers regardless of educational achievements.
The report revealed that only black college graduates' unemployment rate is equivalent with the national unemployment rate of 5%, according to Board of Labor Statistics' data.
On the other hand, the only category of whites with an unemployment rate higher than the national average are those who only have a high school diploma.
The article went further to say that the unemployment rate among Black college graduates has over the past year been 4.1%, which is 1.7 percentage points higher than that of white graduates.
The unemployment rate among Blacks with a college degree stood at 9.6%, while those without a college degree was at 16.6%. The figures are comparatively lower for whites with high school diplomas or less. White high school graduates have an unemployment rate of 4.6%, while those with no high school diploma have a jobless rate of 6.9%.
“The broader significance of this disparity suggests a race penalty whereby blacks at each level of education have unemployment rates that are the same as or higher than less educated whites,” wrote Valerie Wilson, who's the director of the Economic Policy Institute's Program on Race, Ethnicity, and the Economy. “Persistent disparities in unemployment are constant reminders of how race continues to have an undue influence on life in this country.”
Complaints have been raised over the high rate of unemployment among the black population. Some have argued that racial profiling has been institutionalized to the extent that a white person is highly likely to secure a job in a situation where the other candidate(s) are black. In most cases, a white person would even secure a job with an inferior portfolio compared to that of a black person.

Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips, likes to broadcast their eccentric behaviour. They and sometime collaborator Miley Cyrus have matching tattoos; they once tweeted photos of what looked like hard drugs during a recording session (they were actually Settler's Tums); and promoted a vinyl picture disk by announcing that they were going to infuse them with blood samples from musicians, including Coldplay's Chris Martin.
This gleeful loopiness translated to Saturday night's concert at Brixton as the crowd beheld giant inflatable toadstools, a model unicorn (as opposed to a real unicorn – not out of the question in Coyne's weird world) and 50 outsize balloons which were kept in the air for the majority of the gig. If Willy Wonka and Aldous Huxley got together and threw a party, I imagine it would look something like this.
NewsFamily, Politics - U.S.
CHARLOTTE, North Carolina, August 22, 2012 (LifeSiteNews.com) - Feminists are denouncing a rule at the upcoming Democratic National Convention that will bar children, including breastfeeding babies, from entering the event without being credentialed.
Critics say that officials for the event slated to begin Sept. 4 in Charlotte make it difficult for moms to credential their children, leaving delegate moms at a loss as to how to provide for their tots.
Top feminist icon Gloria Steinem said that by not even offering child care at the event the Democratic Party will alienate female voters, and that the party should acknowledge that, where there are women, there are occasionally babies too.
“Women are the key to a Democratic victory, and sometimes, children are the key to women,” said Steinem in a statement noted by the Charlotte Observer. “It's both right and smart for the Democratic Convention to behave as if children exist.”

Activists with the National Organization for Women in California also said the rules set up an “insurmountable barrier for mothers.”
“The DNC requires children and babies to have a credential to enter the convention, and then denies these credential requests from moms,” said Hollywood NOW President Lindsey Horvath. “The DNC credentialing process is being used as a tool to prevent mothers from participating at the convention and is nothing short of discriminatory.”
Convention spokesperson Joanne Peters said that delegates can access a directory of private child care options, and that lactation centers for nursing mothers will be available - but that children require credentialing to access the convention floor.
California Democrat Susie Shannon, 45, who planned to come to the convention with their 4-year-old daughter Gracie, called Peters' response “not enough.”
“When the Democratic Party refuses to provide child care at the convention and denies automatic access for young children to join their moms who serve as delegates on the convention floor, an entire group of women is disenfranchised,” said Shannon. “Moms with young children 6 years of age and under who cannot be left at home, some of whom are breast-feeding, are relegated to second-class status within the Democratic convention.”

KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 12 — Malaysia's largest combined cycle gas turbine power plant in Alor Gajah, Melaka is expected to begin operations in 2021.
Edra Power Holdings Sdn Bhd Chief Operations Officer, Datuk Mohamad Nor Ali, said the 2,242-megawatt (MW) combined cycle gas turbine power plant project was on track.
“The 2,242 MW mean you can light up 10 per cent of the country's electricity requirements,” they said.
They said the company commenced the preliminary work back in March this year and today, the site was ready for construction so it was well on track and that's basically one month ahead of scheduled.
As for financing of the project, they confirmed that Edra Power has hired three domestic banks to raise RM5.28 billion through a sukuk programme for the project.
“CIMB Investment Bank is the sole principal adviser and financial adviser while Maybank Investment Bank and RHB Investment Bank are joint lead managers for the debt programme,” they told Bernama today.
They said the project would be funded via the 80 per cent debt financing raising exercise and 20 per cent via Edra Power shareholders' funds.
“In total the project cost would be approximately RM6.5 billion,” they said.
The site is about 90 per cent ready for construction.
Edra Power, Malaysia's second largest independent power producer, is a leading clean energy group in Southeast Asia focusing on gas power generation.
It is wholly-owned by China Solar Energy Investment Ltd, a subsidiary of China General Nuclear Power Corp Ltd.
Mohamad Nor said: “The next critical milestone for us is to achieve financial close for the project by year-end and also issue the full notice to proceed for our APC (Assessment of Professional Competence) contractors so that they can go full scale and work towards achieving our commercial operation date of 2021.”
They also lauded the support from the Melaka State Government for the project which potentially has immense spillover effects to the local economy, via the generation of some 1,000 job opportunities particularly for the local community.
They said 30 per cent of the project would comprise local contents, whereby a significant amount would actually benefit contractors in Melaka.
The main contractor for this project is a consortium comprising Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co Ltd, Hyundai Engineering Co Ltd and Hyundai Engineering Malaysia Sdn Bhd.
They said they were well-established contractors in power plant construction, with the main equipment coming American firm General Electric, using its latest technology in the gas turbine sector.
They said all the power generated from the plant would be supplied to the national grid.
“Basically, we only have one customer, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, from whom we have secured a long-term power purchase agreement for 21 years from our commercial operation date of 2021,”he said. — Bernama
This year celebrates the 33rd anniversary of an extremely popular game that Konami released featuring Bomberman, a small humanoid robot that drops bombs to attack their enemies. Not much merchandise based off the character is available, but that's where this project comes in!
Overview
This Bomberman Project focuses primarily on the characters from the newest iteration of the franchise, Super Bomberman R. The main eight characters are the Bomberman Bros., although not all are brothers. This set includes the 6 brothers and 2 sisters to make up the group.
Features
The figures are White, Blue, Red, Yellow, Black, Pink, Green, and Aqua. Each character has distinct personalities and traits, and they can be seen through their facial expressions in each figure.
Like action figures, these buildable figures are poseable. They include ball joints in the shoulders, elbows, hands, at the hips, and feet. The head also spins, via a small axle in the center. The small ball on their heads also can be moved back and forth.
Also included is the classic bomb, with an axle connector on the top. By removing the small ball hand from the axle ball joint on each figure's wrist, you can attach the axle ball joint into the connector on top of the bomb. This will provide the effect of one of the characters holding it!
Each figure includes about 100-140 pieces, all with a similar body sculpt, but some with different head features, such as eyebrows or the bowtie on Aqua.
Future Updates
In the future, I am planning to add some different concepts. I am planning on making mosaics of some of the powerups, and possibly a display stand to showcase the figures on, although this would be quite large.
I'm also planning on creating the 5 Dastardly Bombers. These include Plasma Bomber, Phantom Bomber, Magnet Bomber, Golem Bomber, and Karaoke Bomber (with a removable mask to reveal Pretty Bomber). These might be made as a separate project, or added to this one, depending on the feedback left by you, the supporters.
Conclusion
This would be a great set for collectors, fans of the video game, or new players who are interested in starting to play! As a recent fan of the game, I couldn't wait to make these, and I know everyone will love them! Make sure to show your support and make these Bomberman Bros. come out of the video game and into the real world!

"Games for Windows Live to shut down July 2014 according to deleted support update"
http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/08/20/games-for-windows-live-may-shut-down-next-year/
An update to the Age of Empires Online support page revealed that Games for Windows Live will shut down July 1, 2014, and with it, at least some of AoE Online's features, if not the whole game. The announcement has been removed and replaced with the original text, but here's what it said:
“Games for Windows Live will be discontinued on July 1, 2014. Although it is available through Steam, Age of Empires Online requires features of the Games for Windows Live service.

Panama Papers: Authorities raid law firm Mossack Fonseca in tax-dodging scandal
Updated
Police have raided the headquarters of the Panamanian law firm whose leaked Panama Papers revealed how the world's wealthy and powerful used offshore companies to stash assets.
Key points: Police raided the Mossack Fonseca "with no incident or interference"
Company says it hasn't broken laws or destroyed any documents
China censoring online forums and media to stop names of relatives close to leadership circulating
Sorry, this video has expired Video: Authorities raid law firm Mossack Fonseca (ABC News)
Police with an organised crime unit carried out the raid at Mossack Fonseca "with no incident or interference", prosecutors said in a statement, adding that searches would take place at the firm's Panama City headquarters and its branches.
Police officers and patrol cars began gathering around the company's building on Tuesday afternoon under the command of prosecutor Javier Caravallo, who specialises in organised crime and money laundering.
Mossack Fonseca, which specialises in setting up offshore companies, did not respond to requests for comment.
Earlier, founding partner Ramon Fonseca said the company had broken no laws, destroyed no documents, and all its operations were legal.
The Panama Papers, centred on a huge cache of documents pilfered digitally from the Mossack Fonseca, have had repercussions around the world.
Iceland's Prime Minister was forced to resign after their name appeared as one of the beneficiaries of an offshore company.
Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron has had to disclose their tax records.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought to divert attention from their entourage by claiming it is all a US plot against him.
China has been censoring online forums and media to try to prevent the names of relatives close to the leadership from circulating.
And wealthy citizens in Australia, France, India, Mexico, Peru, Spain and elsewhere face probes over suspected tax avoidance after their names figured in some of the 11.5 million documents.
Mr Cameron's image has taken a beating from the delay in revealing that they held shares in their late father's offshore fund and received money from their parents that may have skirted inheritance tax.

Power-producing materials are the stuff of wearable inventors' dreams. And scientists just created a yarn that generates electricity with a simple tug. The yarn, comprised of carbon nanotubes and submerged in an electrolyte gel, isn't ideal for sweaters – but can harvest power from a wearer's breathing. And there's another surprising application: it could collect energy from ocean waves.
An international team of 29 researchers devised the the yarn material, known as twistron harvesters, “by tying a carbon nanotube string into a tangled weave of carbon and submerging it into an electrolyte gel,” according to Science Magazine. When covered in gel and tugged, the yarn can illuminate a light-emitting diode with a small current. The yarn's peak power generation – when strands are hooked together – is 250 watts per kilogram, and Ars Technica pointed out a professional cyclist's peak exertions are only around 10 percent of that figure.

The researchers tested the yarn by sewing it in to a shirt, and saw it generated a tiny amount of electricity as the wearer breathed in and out. The researchers also connected the yarn to an artificial muscle – a polymer that contracts when warmed, according to Ars Technica – and were able to convert fluctuations in temperature into energy. A still more unexpected way the yarn could be used is in wave power. The material operates when it's placed in saltwater similar to the ocean, and the motion of the waves moves the yarn, allowing it to generate power. Ars Technica notes the device does need a platinum electrode as seawater can be corrosive.
The proof of concept yarn strands aren't yet powerful enough to brighten a home, but the scientists say their technology is scalable. The journal Science published the research in late August. Scientists from institutions in South Korea, the United States, and China contributed to the study.

Flooding in the Yangtze river basin in China has left 112 people dead or missing in recent days, with more damage feared from a typhoon expected to land within days.
About 16 million people have been affected by heavy rains that have engulfed vast areas near the Yangtze, China's longest river, the Beijing News cited the civil affairs ministry as saying.
Water levels in Lake Taihu, close to Shanghai, are at their highest since 1954, it said, adding the area faced a serious risk of flooding if a typhoon hit nearby on Friday.
Pictures of a farmer in eastern China breaking down in tears as waters mounted around their 6,000 pigs were posted by state media.

Other images showed a sports stadium in the central province of Hubei turned into a “giant bathtub” by the rainfall.
Flooding is common during the summer monsoon season in southern China, but rainfall has been particularly heavy this year and many areas have been lashed by torrential rains this week.
Rain is expected to move north this week towards the Huai river, the Beijing News added.
China's vice-premier, Wang Yang, warned last month that a strong El Niño effect this year would increase the risk of floods in the Yangtze and Huai river basins.

An El Niño effect was linked to China's worst floods of recent years when more than 4,000 people died in 1998, mostly around the Yangtze.
The Beijing News quoted a meteorologist as saying rain patterns this year were more disparate than in 1998, diminishing the risk of a similar toll.
China's national observatory issued an orange alert for storms across the country's south and east last week – the second highest warning in a four-tiered system.
Whole villages were levelled and at least 98 killed in the eastern province of Jiangsu last month after the region was hit by a storm with hurricane-force winds and the worst tornado in half a century.
Floods also hit south Asia this week, with 33 killed in Pakistan and 25 dead in India after unusually heavy rains.
With More Clean Energy on our Grid, Dirty Energy is Evolving too
August 18th, 2011 by Susan Kraemer
As with any niche in nature, in which ecosystems must adapt with competition from a new species, the traditional electric power sector is changing and evolving as more renewable energy is added. For the first hundred years of electric power, coal dominated the field.
Hydropower and geothermal power did not alter the power “ecosystem” in any way, since they provided the same kind of baseload energy as coal did (provided that the coal railcars delivered their loads every twelve hours to stoke each new shift of steam-making coal fire, of course).
But with the recent addition of fuel-free renewable power from wind and solar, the energy grid has the potential for highs and lows that are more unpredictable. When clean wind power is generating an excess, dirty coal plants must now be shut down (in many states) in favor of power from the electricity source with lower greenhouse gases. But that can be hard on the economics of running coal plants.
In response, some enterprising traditional power plants are evolving a new business model: polygeneration. Coal or gas power plants are being reconfigured to manufacture chemical products in addition to electricity, so that they don't lose money when wind power generation is strong.
Energy Prospects is reporting that Seattle-based Summit Power Group expects to break ground this year on the Texas Clean Energy Project that includes an off-peak urea-manufacturing plant as part of a 400 MW integrated gasification combined cycle coal power plant which will capture 90% of its CO2 and use it to flush out a nearby oil field for enhanced oil recovery.
But, here's what's new. Now, rather than just shut down when there is excess wind power on the grid, at no little expense, Summit's plant will instead swich to manufacturing urea in those off peak hours, using its own un-needed baseload power to run the machinery.
Urea has long had value as a fertilizer, and experts believe there will be increasing demand in a new market created as a direct result of the heavy truck efficiency standards set by the Obama administration last month, because trucks must now burn cleaner fuel in the first ever CAFE standards for heavy vehicles.
Urea helps eliminate nitrogen oxides from truck exhaust through selective catalytic conversion, making an already intensely competitive urea even more in demand.
Summit expects that income will be divided in thirds between the three income streams, a bit less than one third from electricity generation, a bit more than a third from urea sales, and the remaining third from sales of carbon dioxide.
Urea is “much more of a valuable product than electric power in the middle of the night” says James Croyle, the president of Massachusetts-based SCS Energy, which just bought another abandoned carbon-capture IGCC project in California from BP – and also plans to modify it to produce urea on the side.
California's HECA project was an Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle facility that would gasify coal or petroleum coke to make a hydrogen-rich syngas. It was initiated back when many fossil energy businesses like BP wanted to be on the right side of expected climate legislation favoring carbon capture at the start of the Obama administration.
But although the Democrats' climate bill passed the heavily democratic Pelosi House, in the much slimmer (59) Democratic majority in the Senate, Republicans were able to deep six the legislation with their usual Senate filibuster. (Legislation must pass both houses to become law.)
With far fewer Republican seats up for re-election in the Senate than Democratic ones next year, there is no chance of future climate legislation, regardless of which party gets the House majority. So the original plan for HECA has been abandoned, because there is no way to recoup the new investment without a price on carbon.
Yet the electricity business must still comply with a multitude of greatly varying state Renewable Energy Standards. So power plants must find a way to survive the incursion of renewable power into the energy niche, despite the regulatory uncertainty. When SCS takes over HECA, they will use its off-peak power for manufacturing urea. Other examples include Dirty Energy's Waste Water Can Generate Clean Power.
In the absense of a price on carbon that would have leveled the playing field, instead, some coal power plants like those of SCS in California and Summit Power Group in Texas represent evidence that traditional power is beginning to evolve an alternative survival mechanism, making money on the side from manufacturing.
In Finland polygeneration between power production and industrial production evolved decades ago, in response to laws enforcing cleaner energy, but in reverse. Legislation were passed in the 1950s that encouraged the sale of excess power generated from industrial processes, because by using power twice, its emissions are halved.
Because of that legislation, paper mills there harness the excess heat generated from the industrial process of making paper, and use it to generate electricity which is then sold on the grid.
As a result, Finnish paper mills generate a third of the country's power. Perhaps, despite our laissez faire approach to legislation, evolution itself will lead to the same blend of electricity production and manufacturing as traditional power companies struggle to find their new place in the cleaner power ecosystem.

A New Orleans-based crime analyst, who contributes to the national data-based journalism website FiveThirtyEight, claims they are an independent expert. However, documents obtained by Shadowproof suggest they are currently employed as a crime analyst by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office in Louisiana.
From 2013 to 2015, Jeff Asher worked as a “crime analyst” for the New Orleans Police Department's Multi-Agency Gang Unit. In 2015, Asher went from a city employee to a consultant, listing themselves as the owner of Jeff Asher Consulting, LLC, which is described as a “consulting company aiming to bring innovative analytic expertise to challenging problem sets.”
Asher's author bio states they “used to work for the city as a crime analyst.” While they may no longer be an employee of the New Orleans Police Department, a response to a records request indicates they are working with the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office.
The sheriff's office said they could not turn over records requested by Shadowproof “due to the nature of Mr. Asher's employment as a crime analyst for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office.” Disclosure may reveal sensitive information about ongoing cases, the office contended.
Asher's failure to disclose their ties to law enforcement matters. Theirs claimed independence lends credibility and an air of neutrality to their ideas, which benefit law enforcement agencies like the one that employs him.
In the post-Ferguson era, Asher became a talking head regarding the so-called “Ferguson effect,” a theory they helped give credence to as a contributor to FiveThirtyEight.
Asher argues that we need more proactive policing—as supplied by the drug war—to curb shootings. They lamented an increase in shootings and tied it to a decrease in the number of New Orleans cops, and also warned about the possibility of a Baton Rouge murder spike, because of more restrained policing after Alton Sterling, a 37 year-old Black man, was killed by an officer in 2016
On Twitter, where they go by @Crimealytics, Asher's commentary on crime often takes an alarmist tone. They focus on spikes during a small span of time, such as one year to the next or even one month to the next. This is considered bad analysis and overlooks the fact that violent crime is about half of what it was in the 1990s.
For example, a local newspaper ran a story based on Asher noting in 2017 the date of New Orlean's 500th shooting was slightly earlier in the year, when compared to 2010 through 2016.
Churning out these graphs like a factory on their Twitter account, Asher appears intent to convince parish commissioners to fork over more money to the sheriff's office for more deputies.
While the independent contractor arrangement with the sheriff's office benefits Asher, their community suffers.
Leon Cannizzaro, the District Attorney of the adjacent Orleans Parish, is likely the least ethical prosecutor in the nation. Their office uses violent crime rates to justify its sordid practices, which include jailing several crime victims and the use of “fake subpoenas” to coerce witnesses to talk to their office under threat of jail.
When Cannizzaro jailed a rape victim, Christopher Bowman, the office's spokesperson, stated, “The district attorney is far more concerned with the numbers 55 and 204, which are, respectively, the number of people murdered and shot in New Orleans in 2017.”
Asher works for a sheriff in the same metropolitan area, and Bowman has retweeted Asher's statements on shooting statistics. In April, Asher told this reporter that they needed to stay “neutral” about Cannizzaro.
The veneer of being an academic and the failure to disclose their work with law enforcement is unethical and allows people like Cannizzaro and Bowman to run roughshod over people's human rights and dignity.
Shadowproof reached out to Asher but they refused to comment. FiveThirtyEight did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.
The Coupe du Monde de la Boulangerie – the World Cup of Baking, a.k.a. the “bread-baking Olympics” – was held in Paris over the past several days. Teams of bakers from all over the world represented their respective countries in the quest for the top prize. Several members of our King Arthur Bakery team were onsite, including Jeff Yankellow – a former Team USA captain who's been sharing their experiences here, and today reveals the Coupe winners.
Another Coupe du Monde is in the books, and the newly crowned champion of the world is the team from South Korea – followed by Taiwan in second, and the host country, France, in third place.
As great as it feels to win, it's probably best that the champions on the podium get mixed up a bit with every edition of the Coupe. For a long stretch there were always a few countries that were expected to be on the podium (and were) – but that has changed.
More and more emerging countries are participating and gaining experience. Some of them have made multiple trips and earned their way to the top tier of competitors. Other countries make one trip and don't return for a cycle or two – maybe never again. That's to be expected. I don't recall the last time there weren't at least one or two new teams.
Christian Vabret MOF, founder of the Coupe, said that for the first competition they contacted bakers they knew in neighboring countries and invited them to bring a team to compete.
That was in 1992. Ever since there've been far more teams wanting to compete than the 12 spots available. Currently there's a series of regional competitions, mini Coupes that are used to select the teams that ultimately come to Paris.
At least 30 teams competed for a chance to be in Paris this year. That's over 100 bakers, if you include the coaches. Previously the top three finishers would automatically qualify for the next World Cup, but that's changing. For the next Coupe, in 2020, all 12 countries will be selected through regional competitions – so the number of possible qualifiers will only increase. That's incredible reach.
There's no doubt that all of the bakers that participate benefit greatly from the experience, and gain knowledge that they share with others in their country. For some of them the process stokes a fire that will burn long after their day in the spotlight.
Regardless of them making it to the finals in Paris or not, these bakers go back to their workplace and share that energy with those around them. That collective excitement is a powerful force that moves the baking needle in the right direction. That's how the quality of baking improves around the world. As quality grows and consumers are exposed to better breads and pastries, I believe they recognize it and begin to expect it. That's a good thing for everyone.
One team is going home incredibly happy; the other 11, perhaps not so much. Some competitors will take the news harder than others, and wonder what they could or should have done for better results.
I believe it's important to remember that competing in anything takes a lot of courage. Winning or not doesn't ultimately reflect the value or importance of a person. We must rise above winning and losing, and recognize all of the competitors for how hard they worked and how much they sacrificed for what's ultimately the good of baking. I know that's what's important to us here at King Arthur Flour.
The goal of the competition is accomplished well before the winners are announced: bakers from around the world gathering in one place to raise awareness of artisan baking, and to advance the craft. New relationships are forged, and old ones rekindled. All of the teams have put in a lot of time and work over the last couple of years to be here; they'll remember this experience for the rest of their lives.
The members of Team USA will return to a new normalcy after dedicating so much time over the last couple of years to the process. They'll take what they learned and share it with other Bread Bakers Guild of America members for years to come, through teaching classes and mentoring new teams. This is our reason for competing, and this is how the knowledge they gained gets spread.
Last night we wrapped up the trip with a reception for the Guild. We gathered with friends, family, bakers, and anyone else who shares the same enthusiasm for baking. Among the accomplished professionals there were students at the beginning of their journey. We are all one, in bread and baking.
Until next time, thanks for reading. Now go bake something!!

Egypt's military has claimed it has killed the leader of the ISIS terror cell responsible for the shooting down of a Russian passenger jet which killed 224 people.
Terror group leader Abu Duaa al-Ansari was killed in Sinai along with 45 of their top aides and other militants in a series of airstrikes, according to a military spokesperson.
The airstrikes, launched near the town of Arish, also destroyed arms and ammunition stores used by the group.
Known as Wilayat Sayna, the group has been branded the 'most dangerous terror group in Egypt' following a five-year campaign of bloody attacks.

Terror group leader Abu Duaa al-Ansari was killed in strikes alongside 45 other ISIS fighters, according to a military spokesperson. The military released these images of the strikes in Arish on its Facebook page
The series of airstrikes were launched near the town of Arish, and also destroyed arms and ammunition stores used by the group, the military wrote on its Facebook page
As well as the deaths, the military announced that 'dozens' of fighters had been wounded.
'These successful operations avenge our martyrs, and keep the punishment of all militants and their leaders on track,' an army spokesperson said in a Facebook post.
They said counter-terrorism forces backed by war planes guided by 'accurate intelligence' carried out the operation.
The Sinai Branch, formerly known as Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, claimed responsibility for the shooting down of a Metrojet passenger plane in October 2015.
EGYPT'S 'MOST DANGEROUS' TERROR GROUP'S BLOODY CAMPAIGN January 2014: Downed a Egyptian military helicopter in the Sinai with a missile launcher, killed 5 January 2014: Series of bomb attacks across Cairo, killed 6, wounded 70+ February 2014: Attacked tourist bus in Sinai, killed 4 August 2014: Released execution video of four Egyptian citizens July 2015: Claimed missile on Egyptian naval patrol boat off the coast of the Sinai October 2015: Claimed shooting down of Russian passenger jet that killed 224
The Metrojet Airbus A321 was en route from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to St Petersburg in Russia when it was brought down, killing all 224 people on board.
President Putin said at the time: 'Killing our people at Sinai is among the most bloody crimes judging by the number of victims.
'And we won't wipe our tears away from our hearts and souls. It will remain with us forever.
'But it won't stop us from finding and punishing the criminals.'
The militants also downed an Egyptian military helicopter in January 2014 with a surface-to-air missile, killing all five people on board.
Although it swore allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in November 2014, the group has killed scores of Egyptian army personnel, politicians and civilians since 2011 in a campaign of terror that has included suicide bombers, car bombs and roadside IEDs.
There was no immediate confirmation from Sinai Province, the terror group's offshoot in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.

It comes as the ISIS faction released a video naming Egypt and its military forces as its primary targets.
Since Egypt's military overthrew Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, jihadists have stepped up attacks on the army and police with near daily attacks in North Sinai.
The terror cell's exact size is unknown, but estimates say they have between a hundred and a few thousand fighters.
According to TRAC, the Terrorism research and Analysis Consortium, they are mostly composed of local Bedouins, but also recruits members from Egypt and beyond.

KOTA: Jaipur City has produced its maiden IIT topper in the five-decade history of the IIT entrance exam. Aman Bansal of Jayshree Periwal School in Jaipur has secured the first position in the JEE-Advanced result announced on Sunday. Bansal, a resident of Triveni Nagar has scored 320 marks out of 372 to seal their victory. This year 12 lakh students appeared in the JEE-Mains exam.He has been on toes since their coaching institute Allen Career Institute, Kota (study centre in Jaipur) has announced them as national topper a day ago. "I wasn't sure, but they (institute) kept me sure of my victory," said Bansal while receiving wishes from their relatives and neighbors who flooded their house soon after the result was announced at 10 am.Bansal has kept a distance from social media, so far, to keep away from unnecessary distraction. However, it came as a surprise for Bansal when they learnt to have trending on Twitter and receiving congratulatory messages soon after the result was announced. "Neither I am on Facebook nor on Twitter. I think now it's time to make friends on social media," said elated Bansal.Eyeing to study Computer Science from IIT-Bombay, Bansal is sure of their selection. Their long lasting dream is to make software and mobile apps related to education. "I have seen in my neighborhood that most of the children drop out due to poor learning outcomes. I would like to start my own start-up developing pieces of software which can enhance their learning," said Bansal. The idea of developing pieces of software germinates into their mind out of their grandmother's saying "Whatever you do, it should benefit society".Engineering was not their childhood dream and until class X they aren't sure of what stream he'll be taking in class XI. "I am not somebody whose childhood dream is to become an IITian. Infact, I decided to go for engineering in class X because I don't want to leave mathematics," Bansal said who is known as Math Aficionado in their school for their keen interest in Maths.He owes their inspiration to IIT 2014 topper Chitraang Murdia of Udaipur. A meeting with Murdia last year has changed their mode and method for preparing IITs. "I met them last May. They shared some valuable tips on how to maintain cool and calm in times of distress or when things not going according to your plan. Their words of wisdom that 'maintain continuity' still rings in my ear and has helped in preparing for an exam," said Bansal.Bansal parents were amazed to see their introvert son giving back to back interviews to the media. "It's a proud moment to see my son hogging the national limelight. I couldn't believe my eyes to see how confidently they are answering media's questions," said Mukesh Bansal, father of IIT topper.A meritorious student throughout their academics Bansal scored 96.02% in class XII. They missed centum in Maths by 1 mark. They were also among the few students to have scored 120 out of 120 in Maths in JEE-Mains. While in JEE-Advanced, they scored 102/124. They love to solve Maths puzzles online while plays indoor games occasionally. Their father Mukesh is an engineer in PHED has done their engineering from Kota engineering college.
The symptoms of anxiety aren't just the unforeseen and unfortunate outcome of increased productivity and decreased labor costs; they're useful.
The symptoms of anxiety aren't just the unforeseen and unfortunate outcome of increased productivity and decreased labor costs; they're useful. The Yerkes-Dodson law is a model developed by two psychologists (Robert Yerkes and John Dodson) that maps a relationship between arousal and task performance. As arousal heightens, so does performance, up to an inflection point when the arousal begins to overwhelm performance and scores decline. Our hypercompetitive society pushes children's performance up, and their common level of anxiety with it. The kind of production required from kids requires attention, and lots of it. The environment aggressively selects at every level for kids who can maintain an optimum level of arousal and performance without going over the metaphorical (or literal) edge. It's a risky game to play when you're wagering a generation's psychological health, and we can read the heavy costs in Twenge's results.
The dramatic psychological changes don't stop at anxiety. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) is one of the oldest and most elaborate personality tests, and one of its virtues is that its endurance allows for comparisons between birth cohorts. Twenge and their coauthors analyzed MMPI results for high school and college students between 1938 and 2007. They are blunt: “Over time, American culture has increasingly shifted toward an environment in which more and more young people experience poor mental health and psychopathology,” including worry, sadness, and dissatisfaction. We as a society are tending toward these pathological behaviors, and for good reason.
Restlessness, dissatisfaction, and instability (which Millennials report experiencing more than generations past) are negative ways of framing the flexibility and self-direction employers increasingly demand. Overactivity is exactly what the market rewards; among the finance pros whom Kevin Roose studied for their book Young Money, those who didn't display hypomanic behavior also didn't last long on top of the world. The best emotional laborers have a sensitivity to and awareness of other people's feelings and motives that score paranoiac compared to past generations. Twenge spends a lot of energy criticizing narcissism among America's young people, but a hypercompetitive sociocultural environment sets kids up to center themselves first, second, and third. All of these psychopathologies are the result of adaptive developments.
Our society runs headlong into an obvious contradiction when it tries to turn “high-achieving” into “normal.” The impossibility of the demand that people, on average, be better than average, doesn't excuse any individual child's average—or, God forbid!, subpar—performance. The gap between expectations and reality when it comes to the distribution of American life outcomes is anxiety-inducing, and it's supposed to be. Anxiety is productive, up to a limit. But increased worker precarity means most firms are less incentivized to look out for the long-term stability of their human capital assets. It's less expensive to run through workers who are at peak productivity and then drop them when they go over the edge than it is to keep employees at a psychologically sustainable level of arousal. This generation's mental health is a predictable and necessary cost of the current relations of production, a cost that is being passed to young workers.
The link between anxiety and performance is strong, but other psychological maladies are tied to intensive production even more directly. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) are both increasingly diagnosed conditions that pose a danger to children's ability to compete effectively. There's some debate within the field of psychology as to whether these constitute two separate diagnoses, but they basically refer to two different ways of being distracted in class. A kid with SCT stares out the window, while one with ADHD squirms in their seat. It's a simplification, but good enough for our limited purposes. They're attention disorders—attention being the mental work that matters more and more in (automated) American production.
Students who are unable to muster the necessary attention over time can be diagnosed with an attention disorder and given medication and certain testing allowances to improve their performance. Sure, a few students are probably gaming their doctor and faking ADHD to get extra time on their SAT—but the reality is that some kids are just better at sitting still and paying attention for long periods than others, and our culture has pathologized those who aren't, because pathologies can be treated. Parents and teachers—the adults who traditionally spend the most time with children—both have good reasons to seek that treatment for low-attention kids, in order to turn them into high-attention kids. Their life outcomes might very well depend on it.
As the amount of attention required grows (more schoolwork, homework, studying, practice), more children will fall short. The number of American children treated for ADHD has grown significantly, from under one per hundred kids in 1987 to 3.4 in 1997 and from 4.8 percent in 2007 to 6.1 percent in 2011. Though the two studies used slightly different age ranges, the trend is abundantly clear to all observers. Between 1987 and 1997, the socioeconomic gap in diagnosis closed as the rate for low-income kids jumped; by the turn of the century, poorer children were more likely to be labeled attention disordered. In 1991, the Department of Education released a memorandum that clarified the conditions under which students with attention disorders were entitled to special education services, giving students who think they might fit the diagnostic criteria incentive to get certified by a medical professional.
The most popular (on-label) medications for ADHD are stimulants like Adderall and Vyvanse, which chemically boost a user's ability to concentrate and get to work. And with millions of children and young adults taking these pills, a thriving secondary market has sprung up among people who want to increase their performance without the medical formalities. One study of non-medical use by college students found rates of up to 25 percent, with abuse concentrated among students with lower grades at academically competitive universities. The steady flow of drugs from legitimate prescriptions makes illicit use impossible to contain. Whatever the official justifications for distributing them into the environment, many young people—diagnosed and not—routinely use amphetamines to keep up in the race to accumulate human capital. It's not for nothing they call it “speed.”
In the context of zero-tolerance school discipline, heavier law enforcement, and intensive parenting, increased medicalization of attention deficiency looks a lot like another form of youth control, a way to keep kids quiet, focused, and productive while adults move the goalposts down the field. Still, there's not much an individual can do about it. Once again, we're confronted with the conflict between what nearly everyone will recognize as a social problem (“Too many kids are being medicated to improve their academic performance”) and the very material considerations that weigh on any particular decision (“But my kid is having a really hard time focusing, and the PSAT is only a year away!”). This system demands too much of children—that must be clear by now—and if a pill can help them handle it better, with less day-to-day anguish, and maybe even push them toward better life outcomes, what parent or teacher could say no? A minority, as it turns out. Of American children currently diagnosed with ADHD, more than two-thirds receive medication.
The competitive system is designed to turn everyone into potential losers; it generates low self-esteem like a refinery emits smoke.
There are a lot of ways to think about the widening of these diagnoses and the prescriptions used to manage them. For an individual parent, it might very well be a question of helping a child cope with an overwhelming sociocultural environment. Teachers face all sorts of pressures when it comes to the performance of their students (recall the high-stakes testing that undergirds education reform), and guiding a disruptive pupil toward medication can make their lives a lot easier. Employers want employees loaded with human capital, with a superior ability to focus and a casual relationship to the need for sleep. How they get that way isn't so much the boss's concern. Kids themselves who take a long look at the world around them might well decide to ask for some pills—and then again, they might not have much of a choice. (Some students do a different calculation and start selling the “study aids” to their classmates.) Underneath all the concerned rhetoric about young people abusing medication, there's no way to be sure that America can maintain the necessary level of production without it. And we're not likely to find out. The economy runs on attention, and unending growth means we're always in danger of running a deficit. In this environment, a pill that people believe can improve focus will never lack for buyers.
Given the psychological burden that Millennials bear compared to earlier generations, we can also expect an increase in depression. The competitive system is designed to turn everyone into potential losers; it generates low self-esteem like a refinery emits smoke. It's very difficult to imagine that the changes in the American sociocultural environment have not led to more of the population suffering from depression. Sure enough, another Twenge-co-authored meta-analysis suggests that depression has increased 1,000 percent over the past century, with around half of that growth occurring since the late-1980s. If we're counting costs, then a tenfold increase in depression is a huge one, with an emotional cost to our population that's immeasurably bigger than the half-trillion dollars a year that New York Times reporter Catherine Rampell estimated depression costs the American economy.
It's another case of firms passing production costs to workers themselves, and depression has the added benefit of hiding social costs behind the veneer of individual psychosis or incapacity. But as Twenge reminds us, birth cohort is a proxy for changes in the social environment, and the increase in depression over time shows us that this is not a problem that emerges from the isolated turbulence of sick minds. These emotional costs are real, and Millennials bear them more than any generation of young people in memory.
