My name is Cameron and I am here to admit today that I used to think this game was terrible. Yes, it's true and I'm incredibly ashamed of myself. I am very sorry.
I remember buying it shortly after it came out for my trusty Master System (I was a huge fan of the original Wonderboy and Wonderboy in Monster Land) and I just did not get it at all. I couldn't get past the first few rooms and it was all too hard and weird and am I a lizard? What?
Turns out I completely missed the whole “pause the game to get to the menu where I could do things” bit because who reads manuals? Not me!
I ended up taking it back to the store I got it from and claimed the cartridge didn't work and I swapped it for Chase HQ. Don't get me wrong Chase HQ is great and all but man I am an idiot.

In their op-ed in the Wall Street Journal today, Karl Rove remembers something that was done to John McCain in Vietnam:
Another McCain story, somewhat better known, is about the Vietnamese practice of torturing them by tying their head between their ankles with their arms behind him, and then leaving them for hours. The torture so badly busted up their shoulders that to this day Mr. McCain can't raise their arms over their head. One night, a Vietnamese guard loosened their bonds, returning at the end of their watch to tighten them again so no one would notice.
This is what is called a "stress position." It was authorized, monitored and practised as a torture technique by this president, whose chief adviser at the time was Karl Rove. Rove even planned to run the 2006 Congressional campaign on the message of being tough enough on prisoners in American custody.
In the same op-ed, Rove refers warmly to McCain's Bangladeshi adopted daughter - the same daughter their surrogates demonized in the 2000 campaign, by spreading rumors that McCain had a black illegitimate daughter.
Every now and again, one is shocked by the Big Lies and chutzpah that come out of a man as utterly indifferent to the truth as Rove. And then one realizes: this is what these people do for a living. They say anything to retain and wield power.

Simon Southwell is not afraid of monsters. In fact, they love them — especially if they pop up from the dirt and weigh close to a half-tonne. The enterprising 12-year-old with autism delivered a 700-lb pumpkin on Saturday to a Toronto buyer — one of nine orange behemoths Simon has sold this season, gargantuan gourds grown on the hobby farm where they live with their mother outside of Beaverton, Ont.

This latest sale was a product grown almost too well: “The (grocery) stores only want them 400 to 600 lbs, because it's cheap, it's inexpensive, and it looks big. And it's easy to move,” said Simon. So although they have produced some real whoppers — their largest pumpkin ever, grown last year, weighed in at a scale-cracking 933 lbs — Simon says they aim for a sweet spot that keeps their clients happy. Relatively easy, that is — transporting the monster gourds takes a forklift, a sling, a skid and a pick-up truck. And you better make sure it's tied down. But these are the lessons Simon has picked up quickly, doing better in the business world than they did in the classroom. “We tried school. It was a little overwhelming for him,” said their mom Sandy Southwell, who home-schools him.

Simon's strengths lie in math and finances, and they easily rhyme off the logistics of running an emerging agricultural empire. “If you want to grow one pumpkin, you need 25 feet by 25 feet,” Simon said. Their venture, Simon's Display and Specialty Pumpkins, brought in over $2,000 last year. Simon put that money back into their community, paying for a falconer to come to the local community centre with a bird-of-prey demonstration. Now in their third year in business, Simon's entrepreneurial mindset is earning them expert acclaim. Last winter, they attended an entrepreneurship program at the Brock Youth Centre. The program was for 15 to 29-year-olds, but they made an exception for 12-year-old Simon, who kept up with the high-school level finance lessons. At the end of the program, the participants competed in a Dragons' Den-style business competition. Simon pitched their pumpkin business and finished first, winning them $1,000 in prize money. Simon poured the funds right back into the business, buying a new rototiller to turn the soil and a tablet computer to show pictures of their pumpkins on sales calls. They also have business cards and brochures.
Simon sells their giant pumpkins for $0.50 a pound, undercutting competitors in the U.S. where the going rate is $1 a pound. This year they had to introduce a $20 delivery fee, to compensate for rising gas prices. It's a full-time job. Waking at 6 a.m. most days, Simon works until dark in the pumpkin patch, with breaks for lunch and their studies, they said.

The key to growing a big pumpkin is using the right seeds, and adding plenty of fertilizer — Simon negotiated a deal with Home Depot to get half-price off fertilizer. “You want it to grow big. But if it grows big too fast, it can get cracks on the stem and on the pumpkin,” Simon said, explaining how finicky the process can be. This was a rough growing season, as there wasn't the prolonged heat pumpkins need. Simon grew 11 pumpkins this season, but only nine of them will be sold because of their rigorous quality control measures. A spokesperson for Loblaw Companies Ltd. confirmed this weekend's sale to a Real Canadian Superstore at Don Mills Rd. and Eglinton Ave., which bought Simon's 700-pounder as part of a festive autumnal display.

Research conducted over the past few years identifies two policies that could have substantial positive effects on poverty reduction. One involves housing choice vouchers aimed at moving families to better neighborhoods. The other involves charter schools aimed at moving children to better schools. Research on both policies find surprisingly similar results. Yet, only housing choice policies gain broad support from those on the left.
Progressives often claim the moral high ground when it comes to anti-poverty policies, but their inconsistencies on these issues only lessen opportunity for poor families.
Already widely reported, a 2015 study by economists Raj Chetty of Standard, and Nathaniel Hendren and Lawrence Katz of Harvard examined data from an experiment in the late 1990s that offered vouchers to a randomly selected group of public housing residents to move to lower poverty neighborhoods. Those who were offered a voucher were compared to a control group that received no vouchers (but could stay in public housing). The study's conclusion:
We find that moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood significantly improves college attendance rates and earnings for children who were young (below age 13) when their families moved.
In completely unrelated work, new research published this week in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management (JPAM) examining charter schools in Florida found strikingly similar results, which were consistent with past research. This study's conclusions:
We find that students attending charter high schools are more likely to persist in college, and that in their mid-20s they experience higher earnings [than students in traditional schools].
With such similar results, one would expect both policies to be part of an anti-poverty agenda from the left. Housing assistance policies that move families to better neighborhoods certainly have been. President Barack Obama's FY 2017 budget included funds for it, a 2015 White House Blog identified it as one of six programs that have long-term positive effects on poverty, and Hillary Clinton has also expressed support.
But charter schools still get little backing from progressives. Hillary Clinton ran away from charter schools last year, and Bernie Sanders has given mixed statements on their views. Instead, Democrats double down on universal pre-kindergarten, which has a much thinner evidence base than charter schools.
Both policies offer hope that poverty can be reduced by increasing educational and economic opportunity for poor families. But supporting one while opposing the other seems less about poor families and more about politics as usual.
Graduate school can offer the space and time to explore issues you're interested in, gain new skills, and reflect on how you want to put these skills to use once you graduate. But are you using your time to prepare for the career you want?
When I lecture students or chat with my own friends who are pursing graduate degrees, they constantly mention their fears of being prepared only for the academic world. If that is your concern too, here are a few tips to keep in mind:
Have a sense of what kind of work you want to do
While you don't have to have everything set in stone, it's helpful to have an idea of the type of professional you want to become and the steps you will need to get there. It will help you have your goals in mind and to prioritize the steps you need to take to get “your dream job.” It will also serve as a powerful reminder of what you are striving for in particularly difficult days.

Aim to gain practical experience
Volunteer and intern as much as you can. The earlier the better. You need to define yourself as a professional and in most cases that is a trial and error process. After university check out fellowships and service programs. Check idealist.org for options and/or pay a visit to your career center, as they usually have a list of programs already in place. You can also check Stanford's fellowship database, which has over 500 opportunities listed and many of them offer compensation.

Focus on activities that will help you develop the “transferable skills” you will need for your dream job
If you are not interested in work in editorial or communications, being a peer reviewer of your university journal may not be as great addition to your CV as managing a fundraiser for your local animal shelter or helping with the logistics of an event in your university. Always keep in mind that if you are not interested in the project or activity and it does not contribute directly to the development of skills you will need, it will be added stress and a waste of time. There are many ways to be involved with your university that are helpful to your future career.

Use your university's connections
The alumni network of your university is a great way to connect with practitioners in the field and learn about potential opportunities. If your university doesn't have an established database, look for former alumni on LinkedIn or ask for your professors to help you with an introduction. Any awkward feeling can soon be compensated with an offer to buy them a coffee or a tea.

Don't go into graduate school thinking is a “safe path” to future employment
I know the job market is difficult out there, especially for international development. Heck, I even wrote a book about it. However, there is this myth that you will find your path in graduate school or afterwards it will be so much easier to get a job. This is not always true.
For practitioners, graduate schools provide a great space to discuss new methodologies, discuss issues from the field, improve their discourse and update their perspectives. It is a great opportunity to make a career change or become more of an expert in your chosen field. And often, when those people come out of graduate school having a few years of experience, their pay grade raises significantly.
That being said, there are other factors that affect job opportunities; for example, entry-level professionals, especially if studied the social sciences, might have a harder time finding a job. For international development jobs, employers often look for a) previous related experience, b) international experience and c) cultural adaption. Therefore, dedicating a year in a fellowship, Peace Corps or any other year-long volunteering program could be a much better investment. Or if you feel like you are missing out some practical skills, start with project management courses. Most importantly, don't get into huge debt thinking graduate school will change completely your employment status…this simply isn't always the case.

Radio-Canada employees hate conservative values, Harper tells Quebec station
OTTAWA - Prime Minister Stephen Harper says "a lot" of Radio-Canada employees "hate" conservative values.
Harper says those values that are loathed by many employees of CBC's French-language network are the same ones that they say are supported by a large number of Quebecers.
Harper made the comments during a French-language interview with Quebec City radio station FM93, conducted last Friday and aired today.
Their remarks were described as "petty" by an NDP MP.
Harper's comments about Radio-Canada came in response to a question about how they plan to convince Quebecers to vote for their party in the upcoming federal election.
They say they don't believe that voters in Quebec are predominantly left-leaning.
Rather, they say, Quebecers approve of the measures taken by their government: lowering taxes, staying tough on crime and cracking down on the threat of terrorism.
"I remain convinced that Quebecers are not leftists, contrary to the image conveyed by some media or the opposition parties," Harper says in the interview.
"I understand that there are many at Radio-Canada who hate these values, but I think that these values are the true values of a large percentage of Quebecers."
NDP labour critic Alexandre Boulerice said it's clear Harper and their party dislike the public broadcaster.
"I think Mr. Harper's comments are absolutely deplorable and shows the whole ideology of the Conservatives, who don't like Radio-Canada," Boulerice said in Ottawa.
"I think Prime Minister Harper and the Conservatives have had a negative bias towards Radio-Canada and this for a long time."
The Conservatives hold just five seats in the province, compared to seven for the Liberals and 54 for the New Democrats.
It wouldn't be the first time the Conservatives have attacked Radio-Canada.
In February 2011, Jason Kenney accused the broadcaster of "lying all the time" in response to a question from a journalist.
More recently, Harper's spokesperson Carl Vallee wrote that it was becoming "more and more difficult for (him) not to conclude that (his) the worst suspicions about Radio-Canada held true."
Vallee was reacting to a documentary aired last year about the religious right in Canada which explored links between evangelical Christian groups and the Harper government.
Radio-Canada ombudsman Pierre Tourangeau concluded in that case that standards governing the presentation of journalistic views were not properly applied.
It was the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hassan Banna, who stated that "It is the nature of Islam to dominate, not to be dominated; to impose its law on all nations and to extend its power to the entire planet."
In 2016, Prime Minister Trudeau chose not to observe any official 9/11 memorial ceremony to honour the Canadians who died that day. However, the very next day, they attended the Ottawa Main Mosque which has multiple links to extremism. This despite recent stories in Canada about extremism in mosques and schools in Canada.
The Liberal Party of Canada appears to have been infiltrated by a variety of individuals who are supporters of Islamist extremism. This is beginning to look like a classic case of political entryism.
The discourse of "Islamophobia," and this petition, are nothing more than a continuation of the efforts of Islamists to silence their critics as they advance their own political agenda.
Samer Majzoub from Quebec has initiated an official Government of Canada petition to the House of Commons. The sponsor of the petition is Liberal Member of Parliament Frank Baylis. The petition calls upon the government to condemn all forms of Islamophobia.
Samer Majzoub self identifies as being part of multiple Islamist (extremist) organization in Quebec, including the (in)famous Al-Rawdaw Mosque[1] and the Muslim Association of Canada (MAC). MAC itself states that they follow the teachings of Hassan Banna and the Muslim Brotherhood. ­­ If there was any doubt, a senior member of MAC, Dr. El-Tantawi Attia, made it clear when they stated: "Here we follow the teachings of the Muslim Brotherhood."
The Muslim Brotherhood is listed as a terrorist group in many countries in the Middle East, while a recent UK government report states that the Muslim Brotherhood
"have a highly ambiguous relationship with violent extremism. Both as an ideology and as a network it has been a rite of passage for some individuals and groups who have gone on to engage in violence and terrorism."
The Muslim Association of Canada itself has been identified in Canadian Senate testimony as being a Muslim Brotherhood front group.
Accusations of racism and "Islamophobia" are the sword and shield of extremist Islam in the West. It makes excellent use of the concept of perpetual victimhood. The motto of the Muslim Brotherhood is:
"Allah is our objective; the Prophet is our leader; the Quran is our law; Jihad is our way; dying in the way of Allah is our highest hope."
The term "Islamophobia" was popularized by the mullahs in Iran after the 1979 Revolution. Women who would not willingly wear the veil were attacked by the government and accused of being "Islamophobic" for not submitting to the will of the (male) mullahs. Richard Stone was one of the authors of a letter to The Guardian in 1994 that used the term; they were also on the Runnymede Trust, which put the term into broad circulation in 1996. Trevor Phillips, of Britain's Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), who commissioned the Runmymede Report, has now admitted, in a damning new report on integration, segregation, and how the followers of Islam are creating "nations within nations" in the West, that they "got almost everything wrong" on Muslim immigration.
It is not unusual for a Liberal Member of Parliament to support efforts by extremists. Canada's Parliamentary Secretary for Global Affairs (Junior Foreign Minister) is an open supporter of Islamic sharia law. Several other Liberal Party members have close links to extremism as well. Additionally, in 2016, Prime Minister Trudeau chose not to observe any official 9/11 memorial ceremony to honour the Canadians who died that day. However, the very next day, they attended the Ottawa Main Mosque, which has multiple links to extremism. This despite recent stories in Canada about extremism in mosques and schools in Canada.

Canada's Minister of Democratic Reform, Maryam Monsef, is another Liberal Party member creating waves around their place of birth and Islamist belief system. They campaigned on a narrative of how she, as an Afghan refugee, could do great things in Canada -- until it became clear they were born in Iran. They were reported to have tried to return to Afghanistan to take a job there in 2014, but now it seems they spent the time in Iran instead. More notably, they claim to find sharia law "fascinating."
It was the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hassan Banna, who stated that "It is the nature of Islam to dominate, not to be dominated; to impose its law on all nations and to extend its power to the entire planet." The discourse of "Islamophobia," and this petition, are nothing more than a continuation of the efforts of Islamist to silence their critics as they advance their own political agenda.
[1] The mosque is also a part of the Muslim Association of Canada. Among many other problems, the mosque held a lecture in which the very concept of martial rape was mocked.
HOUSTON, Jan. 14 (UPI) -- Gov. Rick Perry says Texas will not compete in Race to the Top, a move that could cost the state as much as $100 per student in federal education aid.
Perry, who has criticized Race to the Top as an attempt to impose federal standards on states, announced their decision Wednesday in Houston, The New York Times reported.
Texas might have received as much as $700 million in federal aid.
"We would be foolish and irresponsible to place our children's future in the hands of unelected bureaucrats and special-interest groups thousands of miles away in Washington," they said.
Perry and other Texas officials, including Education Commissioner Robert Scott, object to the program's effort to get states to accept national curriculum standards, the San Antonio Express-News reported. Many teachers and school administrators have a different view.
"I understand that we want to teach Texas history, but does Algebra I in Texas differ from Algebra I in Maine? It shouldn't," said John Folks, superintendent of San Antonio's largest school district. "I think we should be involved in the process of deciding those standards."
President Donald Trump's approval rating has fallen to its lowest level since they took office, with Americans disapproving of their performance as commander in chief and handling of some policy issues while largely favoring their work on the economy, a new Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll finds.
Mr. Trump's job approval rating stood at 38%, a five point drop from September, the poll showed. Over all, 58% said they disapproved of the job Mr. Trump has done.
More than 8 in 10 Republicans continue to approve of Mr. Trump's job performance. Still, the survey found a dip in their support among political independents—and signs of erosion among some of the president's core voters.
In particular, their job approval among white women who don't have a four-year college degree stands at 40%, compared with 54% who disapprove. That is a sharp swing from the previous month, when 50% approved and 46% disapproved.
Fred Yang, a Democratic pollster who conducted the survey with Republican Bill McInturff, said: “I think we could be seeing signs where there's a little bit of fraying of the Trump base.”
The poll offered some consolation for a White House that is now pushing to pass a tax plan that was one of Mr. Trump's core campaign promises.

Mr. Trump often highlights the nation's low unemployment rate and surging stock market, and the message seems to be sinking in. By a five point margin—42% to 37%—Americans in the survey approved of Mr. Trump's handling of the economy.
Rank-and-file Republicans are still largely lining up behind the president. While 36% of people in the survey viewed Mr. Trump in a positive light, nearly 80% of Republicans or those leaning toward the GOP held a favorable view of the president.
Some 54% of people over all and 13% of Republicans said they held an unfavorable view of the president.
Mr. Trump's popularity within the party could prove useful as they try to cement a Republican coalition that will enact their tax plan. Unless they gain Democratic support, Mr. Trump can afford to lose no more than two Republican votes in the Senate if they are to win the first major legislative victory of their tenure.

The poll comes amid news that the U.S. economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the third quarter, following 3.1% annual growth in the spring, marking the best six-month stretch in three years. Economic growth has been a bright spot that has helped support the president's approval rating, pollsters said.

“If the economy weakened, there would be more slide,” Mr. McInturff said.
On foreign-policy matters, Americans in the survey generally gave Mr. Trump poor marks. Some 35% approved of their handling of the role as commander in chief, while 53% disapproved.
By about the same margin, people in the survey disapproved of their approach to North Korea, which has been test-firing missiles and advancing its nuclear program in the face of international condemnation.
Mr. Trump has taken a hard-line position toward Pyongyang. Tweeting early this month, they cautioned their secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, that they were “wasting their time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, whom the president has dubbed “Little Rocket Man.”
People in the survey disapproved of Mr. Trump's handling of the Iran nuclear deal, negotiated under President Barack Obama, by a margin of 45% to 24%. Mr. Trump has threatened to pull out of the deal unless Congress and American allies take tougher measures against Tehran.

By a margin of 21 percentage points, survey respondents approved of Mr. Trump's handling of the hurricanes that struck Texas and Florida. By contrast, their handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico, drew a negative response. Some 29% approved of their handling of the aftermath of the hurricane, while 54% disapproved.
Mr. Trump drew tepid support for their campaign to require NFL players to stand for the national anthem at games, rather than kneel in protest. By a two-to-one margin, Americans in the survey disapproved of their handling of the matter, with 59% disapproving and 30% approving.
With midterm elections a year away, more people say they want to see Democrats than Republicans control Congress, 48% to 41%. Typically, Democratic gains in Congress are associated with a lead of about 10 percentage points on this question.
The midterm elections figure in large part to be a referendum on the Trump presidency.

Asked about their motivations in casting a vote in the midterms, 46% said they wanted more Democrats to be elected in order “to be a check and balance to Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.” By contrast, 28% said they wanted “more Republicans who will help Donald Trump and congressional Republicans pass their agenda.”

Views were divided by party, with 79% of Democrats saying their vote would be intended as a check on Mr. Trump and the GOP, and 71% of Republicans saying their vote was intended to help the president and their party pass their priorities.
The poll was conducted Oct. 23-26 and surveyed 900 adults. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.27 percentage points.

By claiming “social welfare” status (which it clearly does not deserve), the group can keep the identity of its donors secret from voters. The Rubio people are not alone in adopting this strategy: Vital election and tax laws are being increasingly circumvented, as campaign strategists in both parties game the system with a message of catch-me-when-you-can. The Democrats worked from the social welfare shadows last year in campaigning for the Senate, collecting half of the $30 million in “dark money” raised by the group Patriot Majority USA from just five anonymous donors, according to the Center for Public Integrity watchdog group.

Meanwhile, regulators at the Internal Revenue Service and the notoriously toothless Federal Election Commission are looking the other way.
In the case of Conservative Solutions, the group has not bothered to seek advance approval from the Internal Revenue Service for its “social welfare” claim, leaving its status to be officially settled, if ever, sometime well after the presidential election, when few will care.
Even so, two watchdog groups, Democracy 21 and the Campaign Legal Center, have called on the tax division of the Justice Department to investigate the dodgy operation now for what it is, an obvious political initiative that should be subject to disclosure. It violates the law, the groups complained, by providing a private benefit for a partisan campaign, featuring Mr. Rubio and nobody else in thousands of television ads in the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, all paid by the Conservative Solutions Project.
As they campaign, Mr. Rubio is offering voters proper-sounding prescriptions about the growing problem of secretive funds. “As long as you know who's behind the money and how much they're giving and where they're spending it, I think that's the sunlight that we need,” they told a New Hampshire voter earlier this year.
They should tell this to their allies running Conservative Solutions. If they do not, someone in the next debate should ask them who has been paying for their TV spots.
The Compliance with Court Orders Act of 2016 authored by Sens Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., mandates companies to shoulder the technical burden of accessing encrypted emails or files when investigators issue court orders. It doesn't specify penalties for noncompliance.
When CCOA hit the internet this week, lots of techies, privacy advocates, reporters and security researchers saw red over what they described as legislation that makes encryption illegal or requires backdoors.
Not so fast. The senators might be clueless about security, but they saw those arguments coming from a mile away.
In reality, the Senate committee's Court Orders Act won't outlaw encryption. Nor does it mandate golden keys or backdoors in products -- it's very careful to avoid requiring or prohibiting any kind of design or operating system.
No, this slippery little act says that when a company or person gets a court order asking for encrypted emails or files to be handed over and decrypted, compliance is the law.
How compliance actually happens isn't specified. They don't care how user security was broken (or if it were nonexistent), and the senators are making it clear that from now on, this isn't their problem.
The thing is, that pesky encryption the Senate sees as impeding court orders is the same technology that only unlocks iPhones for their owners, that keeps email truly private, and that could have protected the 80 million sensitive customer and employee records stolen when health insurer Anthem's database was breached.
We're talking about encryption in computer security. You either have it completely, or you don't. On some things, the room for passive-aggressive political maneuvers is effectively zero.
The Court Orders Act of 2016 doesn't do anything as obvious as tell us what kinds of communications or stored files will need to be decoded. But it doesn't stop there. CCOA can also force entities to produce decrypted identifying information and device information and any data stored remotely or on a device.
Who are these entities? According to the document, that would be device and software manufacturers, electronic communications companies, remote computing services... you get the idea. It will also require companies to provide decrypted communications if the encryption is provided by a third party. Let that sink in for a minute.
This act's angle is a clever way to leapfrog arguments about making encryption illegal and demanding backdoors. It's also what makes this legislation even more destructive to security. As it stands now, getting companies and startups to encrypt and protect user security has been an uphill battle. If this bill passes, all the hard work done to raise awareness and establish practices around encrypted communications will be lost.
As everyone knows, security only works when everyone's doing it.
This bill would ensure that the links in security chains would grow weaker or nonexistent because no one's going to want to deal with the fallout of a court order.
It appears targeted at Apple, Google and services like WhatsApp. And guess who would happily be in compliance without doing a damn thing? All the companies that don't take security seriously enough to encrypt records and communications (of which there are far too many). That's right, the companies you shouldn't trust your data with will officially have a reason not to protect you with encryption.
Some pundits are saying it's too crazy to be useful. Wired believes that it's so bad for privacy that it's actually good and that it's unlikely the bill will become law. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has threatened a filibuster if it reaches the Senate floor. All of this might make you think it can't happen here.
I disagree. The White House has declined to support or oppose it — though it did review the text and provide feedback — and President Obama recently admonished opposition to court-ordered access. Given the act's nuanced approach plus that most people just don't see how this affects them, I'm pretty sure this thing isn't as preposterous as everyone thinks.
Encryption legislation has become a priority after years of argument and impasse; at this point, some kind of lawmaking is inevitable. If this doesn't pass, then a mutated clone of it surely will. So this act isn't so much a shock as the abysmal way it's been handled.
Early this year, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., and House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul proposed creation of a national encryption commission. This was to study the issue among tech industry leaders, privacy advocates, academics, law enforcement officials and members of the intelligence community -- to prepare for crafting encryption legislation. Sens Burr and Feinstein decided in late January to skip that altogether, saying it was too slow and told The Hill that "Congress has to move fast." Bizarrely, Feinstein added, "If the internet goes totally dark, and there are apps that people can use to communicate to plot, to plan, to threaten, to do all of that, you've got a real problem."
Warner and McCaul's encryption commission bill was introduced to Congress last month. And McCaul is pushing an Energy and Commerce Encryption Hearing next Tuesday, actually even featuring the widely respected crypto and computer security researcher Matt Blaze.
But we can be sure that the people who wrote and back CCOA, people who consider baseline security measures like encryption to be someone else's problem, will regard crypto hearings with hackers like the kid's table at Thanksgiving.
I mean, it's great that the senators can pretend like they're our parents who know better, and waste time and money in all these variously unproductive ways. But the rest of us who are getting our data stolen every other week desperately need the security that encryption provides.
British universities are becoming less competitive among the world's elite, and experts say government regulations to force diversity on campuses are part of the problem.
Britain's two most prestigious universities, the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, both dropped two spots on The Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings released Tuesday. Two of the countries other top universities, Bristol University and Durham University, fell out of the top 100 list altogether.
While UK universities are still over-performing relative to the country's size, experts say the trend should be seen as worrying. Particularly, they say new regulations to force diversity quotas on the institutions appear to have compromised quality.
“[The government's] current policies are causing universities to take their eye off the ball of recruiting the best to comply with government demands to increase the proportions entering and graduating from state schools, ethnic minorities and post codes from which in the past few students have come,” Alan Smithers, professor of education at the University of Buckingham, told The Daily Mail.
The second part of the problem is tighter visa regulations for international students and scholars, which causes UK universities to lose out on foreign talent.
“There is a perception abroad that our higher education sector has been hit by our migration rules, which is damaging,” Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy, told The Daily Mail.
Other European countries also suffered on the rankings. Four out six German and four out of five Dutch schools fell out of the top 100.

Next-generation biofuels are often viewed as a transportation fuel panacea. A magic elixir that will wean the U.S. off of foreign oil without sending the economy into the dark ages. Advocates have promised next-gen biofuels will reduce greenhouse emissions and end the use of food crops for fuel. Now a recent National Research Council report not only raises serious doubts about these often-touted benefits, but said it's unlikely the U.S. will be able to meet its own biofuel production mandates.
In other words, when it comes to solving a problem like next-gen biofuels, it might be easier to catch a cloud and pin it down. Or hold a moonbeam in your hand. More importantly, the National Research Council questions whether the U.S. should even try because the environmental and economic benefits might not be there.
The report, requested by Congress, said it's unlikely the U.S. will meet specific biofuel mandates under the Renewable Fuel Standard by 2022 unless innovative technologies are developed or policies change.
Federal law mandates that by 2022, the consumption volume of renewable fuels hit 36 billion gallons. Of that, 15 billion gallons must be conventional biofuels -- aka corn-based ethanol -- and 16 billion gallons must be cellulosic biofuels produced from wood, grasses or non-edible plant parts including corn stalks and wheat straw. The remaining amount includes 1 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel fuel and four billion gallons of advanced renewable biofuels other than ethanol from cornstarch and that achieve a lifecycle threshold of at least 50 percent.
The NRC expects the U.S. to meet conventional biofuel and biomass-based diesel fuel production mandates. The problem lies with advanced and cellulosic biofuels. Not a single commercially viable biorefinery exists for converting cellulosic biomass to fuel, the NRC said.
As I recently noted, next-gen biofuels have struggled in part because the process of breaking down plant biomass and converting it into fermentable sugars so it can be refined into fuel is too expensive to be commercially viable. In other words, it can't compete against corn-based ethanol prices or gasoline, for that matter.
It's why so much research centers on finding a technological breakthrough that will make biofuels cheaper to make. And why the federal government has shelled out millions of dollars in loan guarantees, loans and grants all aimed either driving down the cost of cellulosic biofuels and/or increasing production.
The NRC notes other difficulties with cellulosic biofuels including its reliance on subsidies to compete with fossil fuels and the need to use more farmland to produce feedstocks like switchgrass and corn stovers. The NRC warned the increased production of advanced biofuels could inadvertently push up food prices by competing with food crops for land. Ironically, this is one problem cellulosic biofuels were supposed to solve.
The solution
The NRC report doesn't offer up any innovative solutions. It suggests carrying out research and development to improve feedstock yield and increasing the conversion yield from biomass to fuels -- something that's already happening, albeit more at a more limited scale than is perhaps necessary.
It does, however, lay out what would tip cellulosic ethanol into a cost-competitive zone: A world characterized by high oil prices, technological breakthroughs and a high implicit or actual carbon price.

Eleven workers at a nuclear facility who reported headaches were sent for medical evaluations Thursday after working near an area where waste from a leaking tank was being transferred, U.S. Energy Department officials said.
The first two workers at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation to be medically evaluated were wearing oxygen respirators because they were in an area where work was being done that could increase the risk of chemical vapors in the air, The Tri-City Herald reported.
After leaving the area and removing the respirators, both reported suspicious odors and said they had headaches. Both were evaluated and treated at an on-site medical provider.
Two other workers reported odors while walking the transfer line for the waste pumped from the leaking double-shell tank. Seven other employees nearby also reported odors.
Those workers also sought on-site medical evaluations. The results were not immediately available.
Officials said the transfer of waste from the double-shell tank back into the primary tank was stopped Thursday after the workers' reports.
Earlier this month, officials revealed that a tank known as AY-102 had leaked several thousand gallons of radioactive waste from its primary tank.
It was the first of the 28 double-walled tanks at Hanford to be found to have leaked.
The sprawling Hanford site is located near Richland, Washington, and was constructed during World War II to make plutonium, a key ingredient in nuclear weapons. Workers at the site are now engaged in cleaning up the leftover waste at a cost of more than $2 billion per year.
The most dangerous wastes are stored in 177 underground tanks, most of them old, single-walled tanks, some of which have leaked. The double-walled tanks were presumed to be much safer.
The latest estimate to finish the cleanup of Hanford is $107.7 billion and the work will take until 2060.
Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. Scenario Generator is a tool that creates random restrictions, goals and startup settings for a variety of games, and it's the reason I've become happily lost in Crusader Kings II [official site] and Civ V [official site] again. Reinvent an old favourite with the click of a button, as you find out precisely how often you can commit Unprovoked Murder.
I'm always very happy to find a game that allows me to randomise my experience to a certain extent. Whether it's the extremes of Dwarf Fortress, which procedurally creates an entire world each time I play, myths and history included, or an RPG that lets me roll a die to pick stats or the pointiness of my elven ears.
When it comes to open world environments, or strategic sandboxes, I often set my own arbitrary rules to create games within the game. Most recently, I've been inventing challenges for myself in Dying Light, restricting myself to use of a specific safe house as night sets in, selected randomly from all those I've found, or leaving a safe area in the morning and only allowing myself to turn in for the night once I've managed to complete one or more random encounters.
I've also fallen back into old habits. Crusader Kings II and Civ V are back in regular rotation on my playlist and that's all thanks to Scenario Generator, a website that rolls up random goals and restrictions for certain games. For CK II, it just gave me this:
Starting Duchy: Adrianopolis.
Restrictions: Always kill yourself when you become depressed.
Goals: Have all 7 deadly sins, become friends with your liege, successfully defend from a holy way.
Sure. Why not? The restriction is harsh but also lends itself superbly to a spot of extra roleplaying, which is just as important as the actual challenge. Give me a list of things that I can or cannot do in a game, and it doesn't take me long to build suitable stories around the limits of what's possible.
Civ V has eleven columns. With the result from my most recent attempt in brackets, some of those columns are:
Civilization (Babylon), Victory Type (Cultural), Ideology (Autocracy), Expansion Policy (Balanced), Map Size (Duel), Map Type (Arborea).
As well as adding new life to old games, these scenarios could also be used for competitive play, or at least comparative play. Roll up a Civ V scenario, pass it to a few friends, and see who makes the best of a bad situation.
Currently, Scenario Generator supports eight games. Along with CK II and Civ V, they are Kerbal Space Program, The Witcher 2, Skyrim, Minecraft, Dwarf Fortress and Fallout: New Vegas. The Skyrim generator is great, telling you not only what race your character was born as and what skills must be developed, but where your home should be and how often you should commit ‘Unprovoked Murder' and ‘Freelance Theft'.
I already love Scenario Generator but can't help but think of the games that I hope will be added. There are obvious choices, such as Europa Universalis IV to go along with CKII, and I'd like to see GTA V included when it finally arrives on PC. Perhaps there could be columns directing players to steal a certain type of car, in a certain colour, and then to deliver it to a specific city block. Throw in an ‘Unprovoked Murder' and ‘Vehicular Manslaughter' column and you have a game.
How about Euro Truck Simulator 2 and its upcoming American cousin? Build a business that only operates in four countries or refuse to transport anything inedible. If you receive more than 10% damage, you have to stop at the next service station and cry yourself to sleep. When the sun goes down there are zombies and you can never come to a complete stop because they'll eat you.
I suggest everyone who enjoys at least one of the eight games supported by Scenario Generator takes some time to revisit those games with these restrictions plugged in. And if you can think of a game that'd benefit from This Sort Of Thing, cook up some columns and share your thoughts below, or maybe even poke at the freely available source code for the site.
Just imagine the depths of Football Manager madness this could lead to? Random team, anywhere in the world, with an edict to place the most valuable player onto the market at the beginning of every window. Or never playing the same starting eleven in two consecutive games. Endless possibilities.

From the outset where Marvel Studios shows off its brand-new logo that features clips of its heroes in action from previous films rather than clips of art from their older comic books it is clear just how much of a brand this studio and their particular type of superhero films have become. What is more telling though, is just how aware Marvel is of this fact and how boldly they state their accomplishments in this re-branding of their title card. This slight boasting by the company sets up good and bad expectations for the film that proceeds it as Doctor Strange very much operates within the familiar world Marvel has built while at the same time reminding us of just how high Marvel can fly leaving this rule of a movie to be something of a letdown. Of course, that is the one glaring barrier all Marvel movies now have to overcome in how do they not just play as large scale TV episodes, but more singular stories that feel worthy of the big screen treatment. It's not necessarily that Dr. Stephen Strange isn't worthy of such treatment, but more in the pantheon of all Marvel has done before and all it plans to do in the future this initial outing with the soon-to-be Sorcerer Supreme feels as brisk and as superfluous to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as The Incredible Hulk now ranks. Not that Doctor Strange doesn't introduce a whole new dimension of possibilities to the MCU, but were this film to not work out the way Marvel expects it to for some reason they could essentially ignore its existence and move on with the physical dangers the film tells us The Avengers protect our world from. That won't happen, of course, but that's the type of indifferent feeling director Scott Derrickson's (The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Sinister) take on a Marvel property unfortunately conjures up. Making this worse is the fact that Doctor Strange features some of the more daring and downright trippy visuals that have been seen in a Marvel movie as well as some of the weirder sequences in the studios filmography that, while visually enchanting, make it even more apparent just how standard the narrative is. Why Marvel and Kevin Feige were willing to go out on something of a risky limb with their visuals as well as just how far Strange can push their powers, but not with the story that brings the titular Doctor into the world of magic and mysticism is a little perplexing, but at the end of the day it's clear this is a boardroom picture designed to change up Marvel's winning formula just enough so as to appear to be something new and different, but what in reality will rely on the same tricks that have guaranteed consistent hints for eight years now.

Legal marijuana is coming to Texas. With a catch.
The state will soon license dispensaries to sell low-THC cannabis products such as CBD oil for people diagnosed with intractable epilepsy, who suffer from seizures not controlled by traditional drugs.
RELATED: These things probably won't be legal in Texas anytime soon
Administrative rules approved by the state's Public Safety Commission in December intended to regulate the Compassionate Use Program took effect on Jan. 10, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. Gov. Greg Abbott signed the bill into law in June.
But, the state is still about a year from full implementation of the law: the Department of Public Safety is currently looking for Texas Department of Information Resources vendors to develop the the framework for Compassionate Use Program's registry of physicians and dispensaries to prescribe and distribute low-THC cannabis products.
The state will issue the vendor contract in June, according to DPS. Work on the registry will begin in July.
RELATED: What the DEA knows about Mexican drug cartel activity in the United States right now
The department won't take licensing applications from potential dispensaries until after that registry's framework has been completed.
Then, DPS will license the first dispensing organization in June 2017.
Currently, 23 states along with Guam and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana and cannabis programs, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
After Abbott signed the state's new cannabis oil law, 17 states now approve of using low-THC cannabis oil, the group notes.
Smoking marijuana for medical and recreational purposes remains illegal in Texas, but a bill to fully legalize adult use of marijuana made it out of the Texas House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence in May.
However, the bill never came up for a vote on the House floor.

NASA Earth Observatory An image released by NASA in November of the rift in the Larsen C ice shelf.
WASHINGTON — When it splits off, the Delaware-sized chunk of ice now barely clinging to one of Antarctica's largest ice shelves will become one of the most massive icebergs in recorded history, scientists say.
For over two years, the U.K.-based Project MIDAS has been monitoring a large, fast-moving rift in the Larsen C ice shelf, located on the northern end of the Antarctic Peninsula. On Wednesday, researchers with the European Space Agency released a detailed analysis of the soon-to-be iceberg.
Data collected from ESA's CryoSat satellite, which measures and monitors polar ice in Greenland and Antarctica, shows the iceberg will likely have an area of more than 2,500 square miles — larger than the island of Bali in Indonesia.
It's expected to be about 620 feet thick and contain about 277 cubic miles of ice, according to ESA. Below the surface, the iceberg could reach a depth of nearly 700 feet.
“This is a single piece which is remarkable I guess because it's of somewhat biblical proportions,” Mark Drinkwater, head of the mission science division at ESA's European Space Research and Technology Centre, told Mashable.
In a post to Twitter, Drinkwater said the hype around the impending separation has given rise to the term “bergxit.”
"Bergxit"- a new term capturing the hype surrounding the inevitable separation of the #LarsenC iceberg from #Antarctica ! 🕚 pic.twitter.com/eDTcdZyO9P — Mark Drinkwater (@kryosat) July 5, 2017
Researchers warn the iceberg will likely be so large that it could pose a risk to maritime traffic.
“Whole or in pieces, ocean currents could drag it north, even as far as the Falkland Islands,” located east of South America's southern peninsula, Anna Hogg of the University of Leeds said in a statement. “If so it could pose a hazard for ships in Drake Passage” ― a stretch of ocean between South America's Cape Horn and Antarctica.
At 21,000 square miles, Larsen C is the largest ice shelf in the region. In recent years, however, what started as a small fracture has moved rapidly through the frozen structure, widening to more than 1,000 feet.
During the month of December, the rift grew by more than 10 miles, followed by another 6 miles in the first few weeks of January. Between May 25 and May 31, it grew by an astounding 11 miles — over 1.5 miles per day.
Today, the fissure is over 120 miles long, and only about three miles from reaching the ocean, according to ESA's new analysis.
“The iceberg remains attached to the ice shelf, but its outer end is moving at the highest speed ever recorded on this ice shelf,” researchers with Project MIDAS wrote in a blog post last week. “We still can't tell when calving will occur — it could be hours, days or weeks — but this is a notable departure from previous observations.”
Project MIDAS estimates the calving event will remove more than 10 percent of the Larsen C shelf, leaving the ice at “its most retreated position ever recorded.”
Along with fundamentally changing the Antarctic Peninsula, scientists worry a break-off could destabilize the entire shelf, meaning Larsen C could be headed for a similar fate as nearby Larsen A and Larsen B, which collapsed and disintegrated in 1995 and 2002, respectively.
Larsen B's vanishing act is highlighted in the NASA video below:
In 2014, over a decade after Larsen B's collapse, scientists determined the event was triggered by rising air temperatures.
Since ice shelves float on the ocean's surface, the impending calving event won't immediately raise sea levels. An event of this scale, however, could destabilize the entire shelf, resulting in its disintegration and the release of the glacier ice it holds back ― which ultimately would raise sea levels.
How long that process could take is difficult to pinpoint. But scientists estimate that if all the glaciers behind Larsen C ended up in the ocean, it would raise global sea levels by about 10 centimeters, or 4 inches.
From the moment the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified North Korea as the culprit behind the devastating cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, private security experts not employed by the studio have sprung into action, spinning alternative narratives about what might have happened.
They have dissected what little the FBI has disclosed publicly — and have found the explanation wanting.
The latest theory, presented to the FBI on Monday, blamed the attacks on one or more insiders working in concert with known hackers.
It doesn't help the U.S. government's cause that North Korea has denied any involvement in the breach that saw the unprecedented disclosure of private corporate data, including embarrassing emails, details of confidential business plans and information about its current and former employees. Sony initially canceled the Christmas Day release of the film that became the focus of the hackers' demands, “The Interview,” after the Guardians of Peace hacker group made threats with terrorist undertones. But the studio subsequently released the bawdy R-rated comedy about a fictional CIA-backed plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in some 300 independent theaters and online.
As late as Tuesday, the FBI reaffirmed its conviction that the Hermit Kingdom is responsible for the theft and destruction of data on the network of Sony Pictures Entertainment.
“Attribution to North Korea is based on intelligence from the FBI, the U.S. intelligence community, DHS, foreign partners and the private sector,” the FBI said in a statement to Re/code. “There is no credible information to indicate that any other individual is responsible for this cyber incident. The FBI is committed to identifying and pursuing those responsible for this act and bringing them to justice.”
The FBI said its investigation is continuing and added little else to bolster its belief, leaving plenty of room for alt narratives. Here's how it breaks down:
Kim Jong-un, seriously?
Marc Rogers, principal security researcher at CloudFlare and director of security operations for DefCon, an annual hacker convention, remains skeptical of the North Korean connection. They said the FBI's announcement that it had identified the attacker, within weeks of the massive breach becoming public on Nov. 24, got their “spider sense tingling.”
“It's just too quick,” Rogers said. “Digital forensics is one of the hardest sciences out there. It's the ultimate game of needles in haystacks.”
The evidence the FBI publicly cited in tying Pyongyang to the hack was flimsy, Rogers said. For example, the agency said the malware found in the course of the Sony attack is similar to the malicious software North Korean sympathizers employed elsewhere — notably, in the massive Dark Seoul cyber assault in 2013 that nearly brought the South Korean capital to its knees.
The software DNA may be there, Rogers notes. But that's hardly the incriminating fingerprint on the gun found at the crime scene, because such malicious code is sold or leaked on Internet forums, where it is readily available to wannabe hackers, they said.
“The similarity between two pieces of malware doesn't tell you they came from the same author,” Rogers said. “They just have access to the same information — maybe they hang out in the same forums.”
Even the Internet addresses of the computers used to launch the assault are routinely used to send out spam or malware.
“Those are well-known proxies used by cyber criminals,” said Rogers. “Is it plausible the North Koreans are using well-known criminal haunts? Yeah, it's plausible … but not definitive.”
An inside job?
Representatives of another security firm said they met with FBI investigators Monday to present the results of its own independent analysis, which ties the breach to a disgruntled former Sony employee dubbed “Lena,” and members of a now-disbanded splinter group of Anonymous called LulzSec.
Kurt Stammberger, a senior vice president with Norse cybersecurity, said a team of counterintelligence analysts began examining leaked documents and combing through conversations in online forums and chat rooms to see if the evidence supported the U.S. government's narrative that North Korea masterminded one of the most destructive hacks in corporate history.
“The answer to that question was no — we couldn't find any data to support that,” Stammberger said.
What Norse's researchers found, instead, was a 10-year veteran of Sony Pictures with a technical background and access to the studio's networks who was laid off this spring, and individuals previously associated with LulzSec, which claimed responsibility for a 2011 attack on the Sony Pictures website.
“The data we dug out seems to better support this idea that one or more individuals that were either fired or laid off by Sony during the May 2014 restructuring were sufficiently pissed off to share their inside knowledge of the Sony network and credentials with members of this hacking group,” said Stammberger.
Stammberger declined to describe what information connected this former employee with the hackers — only that Norse turned over its evidence to the FBI this week. But they said it's clear the attackers had some kind of inside-assist: The malware used to infiltrate Sony's corporate network had the addresses of individual computer servers written into the code.
“This was super-duper targeted. That's why it was so effective,” Stammberger said. “They knew precisely how Sony's network was architected, exactly where all of its critical data was kept. That's why so much of their data has spilled out onto the Internet.”
Blame it on the Russians
One group of cybersecurity consultants used linguistic analysis to attempt to pinpoint the hackers' country of origin.
Taia Global Chief Executive Jeffrey Carr said their firm analyzed the 20 messages left by the Guardians of Peace to determine the whereabouts of the cyber criminals. It identified words, phrases and grammatical structures that appeared to have been written by non-native English speakers. Then, it compared the vocabulary and sentence construction to that of Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Russian and German.
The analysis revealed that the hackers were most likely Russian.
“The Russian language fits the linguistic profile exactly,” Carr said. “Korean is still possible — but much less likely.”
The Dáil has passed a bill to make cannabis available in Ireland for medicinal use, after the Government said it would not oppose the legislation.
Put forward by People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny, the bill seeks to legalise and regulate cannabis products, which are used for medical purposes.
Speaking after the bill was passed, Mr Kenny praised Minister for Health Simon Harris for their position in not opposing the bill, while thanking all of those who supported the legislation.
Earlier Mr Kenny said their bill intended to make cannabis available to those with chronic pain, epilepsy, cancer, MS, fibrmyalgia and, under a doctor's recommendation, would help to alleviate symptoms of illness.
Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, Mr Kenny said that research showed cannabis can help a lot of people.
They said it would be up to a doctor to decide if a patient might benefit from the use of the drug.
Mr Kenny said they hoped the medical profession would come on board to support the use of the drug once it has been approved by the Health Products Regulatory Authority.
Minister Harris said that although they have concerns about some elements of the bill, they will not oppose its progression to Committee Stage.
Mr Harris asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority to advise them on the scientific and clinical value of cannabis as a medicine.
They said they want to receive that advice from the agency before progressing the legislation any further.
The minister also indicated that amendments would have to be made to the proposed bill to avoid the unintended effect of making cannabis legal for recreational use.
Speaking on RTÉ's News At One, Minister Harris said they strongly believe that Ireland needs to take a look at policy in relation to medicinal cannabis, saying a number of countries have already taken the steps to make it available.
They said they have met a number of patients and patient groups over the last few months who have highlighted their belief that it could relieve pain.
Tonight's Dáil debate is important, they said, adding that they hope it sends a signal to Irish patients that politicians want to see movement on this.
But they added that as Minister for Health they have to carry out the appropriate checks.
The legislation is expected to be supported by a majority of TDs in the Dáil.
A British consultant neurologist with many years of experience in the NHS has said legalising medicinal cannabis is a progressive step and a move they "totally welcomes."
Speaking on RTÉ's Drivetime, Professor Mike Barnes said it should be prescribed for conditions that meet the criteria, prefably by a doctor trained in medicinal cannabis.
Professor Barnes said they would like the UK to move towards legalising medicinal cannabis.
Christiana Figueres says countries cleared multiple hurdles to reach accord, showing that ‘if we want to do something we can'
The Paris climate agreement kindled “a huge flame of hope”, establishing a new model of 21st-century diplomacy, the woman behind the deal has declared.
In their first public reflections on the climate accord signed in December, Christiana Figueres, the UN climate change official, said that after two decades of meandering negotiations, countries had at last discovered their “higher purpose” and risen to the challenge of dealing with global warming.
The Paris agreement, in which 195 countries committed to limiting the temperature increase to well below 2C, set a new standard for dealing with complex global problems, they said.
“Climate change is a very, very good example of how we are moving to a completely new social contract from the last century,” Figueres told the Guardian at a conference hosted by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) in Abu Dhabi. “The social contract that is going to underpin the 21st century has at least five very, very different ways of dealing with challenges and very different ways of delivering solutions.
“To have Paris is a huge flame of hope. We can really take some confidence from there that if we decide we want to do something, then we can,” said Figueres, who will step down this summer after guiding the negotiations for six years. “We are not bound by situations we are confronted with. We can rise above them. It's fantastic.”
A number of key players in the Paris climate deal attended the annual Irena conference at the weekend.
More than 80 countries committed in their climate plans in Paris to expand their use of solar and wind power as a way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These countries are now looking for financing and technological assistance to make the switch to cleaner energy sources.
Figueres said countries had overcome multiple faultlines to arrive at a deal in Paris – the divide between rich and poor countries, between the public and private sector, between different regions.
Unlike other negotiations, the Paris climate talks involved governments, business leaders and campaign groups. A number of foreign policy experts have held up Paris as a new model for diplomacy, and commentators have praised the French hosts for skilfully guiding the talks to a successful resolution. “It is the way that we are going to operate increasingly in the 21st century,” Figueres said.
The agreement abandoned the idea of a traditional international treaty with clear rules and fixed obligations, in recognition that the US would never sign on to an agreement that needed approval from a Republican-controlled Senate.
Instead, the agreement relied on countries to come forward with plans for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and then to review those plans at regular intervals to make even deeper cuts.
Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former US Department of State official and president of the New America Foundation, wrote of the deal in December: “By the standards of a traditional treaty, it falls woefully short. Yet its deficits in this regard are its greatest strengths as a model for effective global governance in the 21st century. The Paris agreement is a sprawling, rolling, overlapping set of national commitments brought about by a broad conglomeration of parties and stakeholders. It is not law. It is a bold move toward public problem-solving on a global scale. And it is the only approach that could work.”
But there have also been a number of high-profile critics of the Paris agreement. James Hansen, the climate scientist, dismissed the agreement as a fraud. Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential contender, said the deal went nowhere near far enough.
Figueres said the 31-page agreement had exceeded their expectations. “The surprise for me was actually the clarity of the text and the way in which governments worked with each other to get to common ideas,” they said. “In previous negotiations, people have got so caught up with the wording itself – this comma, that comma, that verb – that they tripped over themselves and were not able to reach for the stars. In this case they first reached for the stars and then thought: how do we express that?”
They said Paris was the first time in six such climate meetings that they never had a moment when they feared it would all end in a collapse.
“At every other one there was at least one moment in which I thought we are going to lose this whole thing,” they said. “This was the first time in which it was so evident that there was overwhelming, not just political will, but political determination to actually come to an agreement.”
And not just an agreement for the sake of it, they said. “The overriding current was getting to an agreement that they could all be proud of. It wasn't just for a photo.”
• Suzanne Goldenberg's trip to the conference in Abu Dhabi was funded by Irena, the International Renewable Energy Agency.
New Zealand has generally followed suit with international drugs policies – implementing a ban on cannabis in 1965, in accordance with an international treaty that sought to prohibit the production and supply of various drugs.
Since then, the 1975 Misuse of Drugs act has further entrenched the legislation surrounding the supply and possession of that sweet Mary Jane, and inculcated – in the minds of many New Zealanders – a view that the drug is inherently harmful.
Cannabis enthusiasts around New Zealand are afforded little sympathy – amounting to little more than ‘drop-kicks' in the eyes of many, including, it would seem, the eyes of our National drug policies.
At least, that's what we can reasonably surmise from the various policies that, upon closer inspection, serve no practical purpose other than facilitating harm to our poor, misunderstood stoners.
Let me explain.
Within the fine print of the Misuse of Drugs act, are various clauses that seek to impose criminal penalties on those caught in possession of drugs utensils.
“So what?” You may disdainfully decry “Being caught with drugs utensils is practically equivalent to being caught with drugs! Of course they should be punished.”
Now, I could present a coherent argument for why neither of those instances should actually merit the punishments that are outlined by the act, but here I wish only to present a particular, narrow argument – specifically against the outright prohibition of drugs utensils – which in itself is sufficient to warrant vehement protest.
The argument looks something like this:
People are going to smoke pot regardless of legislation. This is just a fact. There has been found absolutely no evidence to show that criminalizing weed utensils has done anything whatsoever to deter its use.
So once we accept this, we are in a place to evaluate the true consequences of instituting an indiscriminate ban on all drugs utensils.
Picture this.
The incorrigible pothead, shunned by society and scorned by its laws, is unable to find, wherever they might look, a utensil with which they can smoke the tangy plant safely.
A glass bong, which serves to filter the carcinogen-loaded smoke, is nowhere to be found, as a direct consequence of legislation. Yet in their kitchen drawer sits a pair of their girlfriend's favourite metal knives. So with their innate Kiwi ingenuity, they heat these knives upon the metal coils of their stove, presses them together with small nugget of weed in between, and sucks the resulting smoke straight into their lungs.
Thus not only has they compromised their health, by inhaling directly the unfiltered, carcinogenic smoke, but they have also forever ruined their girlfriend's prized cutlery.
What I'm trying to demonstrate is that, by reducing the availability of quality-assured drugs utensils, which through various means are able to reduce the negative health consequences associated with smoking dack, we are directly facilitating harm to the smokers.
And considering around 42% of Kiwi adults have blazed at least once in their lifetime, this is not something to be readily ignored.
As if all of this wasn't backwards enough, in 2014, the regulations against drugs utensils were further tightened. A previously legal device (perhaps due to its relatively recent emergence) – the vaporizer – was banned.
Vaporizers are by far the safest means by which cannabis can be smoked, since the vapor inhaled by the user contains only a small fraction of the cancer-causing chemicals (if any at all), that are present in the smoke of traditional consumption methods.
Many health-conscious smokers were starting to adopt this new device before legislation eventually crashed the party.
“No, hippies, you must continue to blacken your lungs using spot knives over the kitchen stove, thank you very much. Your health is none of our concern.” – is basically the underlying message of those amendments to the drugs act.
But there is hope yet. Just a few months ago, the NZ ministry of health released a document that outlined a consideration for a review of the regulation on drugs utensils.
The document they released is surprisingly lucid, and reasonable, with regard to the reality of the situation. They have acknowledged the need to “[get] the legal balance right”.
They also state, among other things, that “vaporisers have the potential to reduce harm when used to smoke illegal or legal drugs and can also be a safer alternative to injecting drugs.”
It is actually difficult to see how, given the arguments outlined in the document, the ministry of health will not ultimately decide to change current regulations. But of course we'll have to wait and see.
So all of this looks mighty promising, not only for the future of that ever-present demographic within our society – the ever-oppressed stoner – but for New Zealand at large. If we continue to adopt rational, evidence-based policies, then we're on the right track.
"Really for the first time anywhere, we've gotten more energy out of this fuel than was put into the fuel," Hurricane told reporters earlier this week. "And that's quite unique. And that's kind of a major turning point, in a lot of our minds."
Researchers have faced daunting scientific and engineering challenges in trying to develop nuclear fusion — the process that powers stars, including our sun —for use by humankind. Nevertheless, Hurricane said "people are jazzed" by the prospects.
The scientists, led by physicist Omar Hurricane, described the achievement as important but said much more work is needed before fusion can become a viable energy source. The researchers also noted that their experiment did not produce self-heating nuclear fusion, known as ignition, which would be needed for any fusion power plant.
Unlike fossil fuels or the fission process in nuclear power plants, fusion offers the prospect of abundant energy without pollution, radioactive waste or greenhouse gases.
For the first time, experiments have produced more energy from fusion reactions than the amount of energy put into the fusion fuel, scientists at the federally funded Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California said.
Scientists in the U.S. announced a milestone on Wednesday in the costly, decades-old quest to develop fusion energy, which — if harnessed successfully — promises a nearly inexhaustible, environmentally friendly energy source for future generations.
Still years from practicality
Unlike nuclear fission energy, which is derived from splitting atoms, fusion energy is produced by fusing atoms together. Experts believe it will be many years before fusion can become a practical energy source.
"I wish I could put a date on it," said Hurricane. "But it really is (just) research. And, you know, although we're doing pretty good, we'd be lying to you if we told you a date."
The research, published in the journal Nature, included results from two experiments done at the lab's National Ignition Facility.
During the experiment, 192 laser beams were briefly fired into a half-inch-long gold cylinder. The cylinder held a tiny ball that contained the fuel, which was a mix of two kinds of hydrogen, called deuterium and tritium. The energy from the lasers kicked off a process that compressed the ball with force akin to squeeze a basketball down to the size of a pea, said Debbie Callahan, an author of the paper.
That created the extremely high pressure and temperatures needed to get the hydrogen atoms to fuse. It was all over in the blink of an eye, with the reaction confined to a space smaller than the width of a human hair.
"These experiments show an order-of-magnitude improvement in yield performance over past deuterium-tritium implosion experiments," the scientists wrote.
Nuclear fusion would be worthwhile only if it produces more energy than it uses. The results of the experiments, however, were far from that.
The hydrogen fuel did emit more energy than it absorbed from the lasers, a goal of the experiment. But the fuel took in only about 1 percent of all the energy produced by the lasers, so the apparatus is still far short of producing more energy than it requires operating.
Another key finding was evidence that energy created by the fusion reaction was going back into the remaining fuel, a "bootstrapping" process that is key to boosting the energy output. Hurricane said that showed “promise” for scientists being able to increase the energy output in the future.
Eager to exploit the potential that fusion energy offers to reduce dependence on oil and other fossil fuels, the United States and other nations have invested millions of dollars into fusion research, often with uneven results.

Lab Rat James tries to determine the events of the alleged Japanese "film" Samurai Princess... without any subtitles. Do its themes transcend all languages and cultures? Let's hope not.
OBJECTIVE: Give Bill twenty bucks every month. Watch the foreign film they bring back without any subtitles. Figure out what the hell is going on.
SAMURAI PRINCESS (2009, Definitely Japan)
I call it Samurai Princ-Ass.
REMAINING CHANGE: It was a “gift.”
THE PLOT AS I UNDERSTAND IT:
For my first viewing, Bill graciously gifted me a revenge thriller Japanese torture porn. Our hero, Samurai Princess, narrowly survives a harrowing encounter with a marauding pack of gang rapists (the Rape Boys), then swears an oath of vengeance against them. In a sense, this movie is the Japanese equivalent of Kill Bill, because I want to kill Bill for making me watch it.
No, Bill, fuck you.
Roughly the first half of the movie is framed through two characters: a voodoo magic oracle and a wandering rock ‘n' roll legend with a comically large bandaged hand and a furry guitar. Guitar Hero patronizes the oracle and they respond by telling them the tale of the Samurai Princess, which is the worst punishment imaginable.
Samurai Princess is left for dead at the bottom of a pile of oddly Caucasian body parts, but they are rescued by the village oracle, a young woman made to look old by shitty white make-up and a veil. At the same time, an insufferable douche in a white kimono, flanked by two women who can only speak in unison, sifts through the pile of white men's feet. Apparently, people congregate around meat mountains because there isn't a single object in any scene with which the characters can interact. The movie has more empty sets than a middle school play because 200% of its budget was spent at a Halloween shop on fake intestines and bloody bandages.
The Activities Room.
Luckily for our hero, this asshole is also a doctor who specializes in creating monstrosities from recycled body parts. Imagine Dr. Frankenstein, subtract any message about humanity because this guy does it for the fuck of it, then add stupid hair accents.
Dr. Jack Sparrow.
Samurai Princess is revived in a bloody cocoon, fitted with detachable murder boobs and a sawblade chest. They swear an oath of vengeance and heads out searching for the gang leader, Albert Rapenstein, and their unsettlingly attached girlfriend.
Our titular character.
Guitar Hero and Samurai Princess team up after Guitar Hero unknowingly pisses off a ledge onto the sleeping princess. In terms of male-female interactions, this is the most respectful and least offensive part of the movie. As a bonus, it feels like tangy justice is served warm because Samurai Princess has been pissing on the viewer the entire time. After a brief run-in with Guitar Hero's bitter ex-lover, our two protagonists steal away inside an empty building, get patched up, and make sweet, sweet consensual love inside Samurai Princess's dreams. Although having two consenting adults was a nice change of pace, the scene lasted about six positions too long.
The much, much anticipated– so sorely anticipated– showdown between Samurai Princess and Rapenstein ends with a three-person body count: bitter ex-lover's friend, Rapenstein, and their sadistic Bonnie. HOORAY! The movie is ove–how the fuck is there 25 more minutes?!
Here's how: Dr. Jack Sparrow was behind this bullshit all along. Somehow. Guitar Hero starts roughing up that sonofabitch for answers, until Dr. Jack Sparrow unleashes their greatest creation.
Of course.
Guitar Hero proves their worth (none) almost immediately, loses their monster hand, and leaves the fight. Samurai Princess employs their trusty ol' arsenal of anatomical aberrations, but fails pathetically. They even summon the power of a cutely knit bag of pixie dust that their friend entrusted to them right before they became the Rape Boys' last victim, to no avail. Dr. Jack Sparrow's Cock Monster repels them every move and bites off their hand with its monster cock.
What happens next might be described as a deus ex machina, but this movie is definitive proof that if there were a God, They abandoned us long ago; however, the Devil is still around to extend this piece of shit movie for another ten minutes. Lo and behold, right there on the ground next to the princess is Guitar Hero's severed hand. They just snaps that shit right into place on their own bloody stump, contemplates how lucky they are that they both lost their right hand, and kills the Cock Monster to avenge all of their raped-to-death friends by ripping its goddamn heart out.
Pictured: Not a single victim of the Cock Monster.
Dr. Jack Sparrow tries to escape, Guitar Hero heads them off in a sewer and kills them with a classic rock ‘n' roll/gaping chest wound combination, Guitar Hero bleeds out and dies, and my DVD mercifully skipped over the final scene because it was damaged. There is a God!
THE “OKAY, YOU LOST ME” MOMENT:
There's a flashback that depicts how Guitar Hero lost their hand that makes absolutely no sense. In the scene, they approach a bloody woman wielding a sickle who's been caged inside a barn, and they seem possessed. I think the woman is the same actor who plays the girl who dies in the fight against Rapenstein, but that might just be a racist guess. Guitar Hero approaches them tenderly and puts their hand on the fence keeping them inside the barn and breaks the curse. Just kidding! They bite him, they go inside the barn, they chop off their hand, and they kill them But they really didn't want to, guys. Who was she? Why was they possessed? Why couldn't they just kill them and save us from this?
HOW MUCH I ENJOYED WHAT I THOUGHT WAS HAPPENING:
Not one bit. There are some universal interactions that don't require any spoken language, and rape is one of them. In a way, Samurai Princess transcends language barriers with its rape and murder, but that notion somehow doesn't make my insides feel warm and fuzzy; although, that might have something to do with staring at eviscerated corpses for the past hour-and-a-half. If you really feel like getting the kind of satisfaction Samurai Princess has to offer, I would recommend trying to become Kim Jong-un.
And now, Cinemanaut Bill ranks James on their ability to comprehend the film.
Nailed it: It's true, Samurai Princess isn't exactly drowning in subtlety. Or taste. James successfully figured out which characters hate which other characters and who killed whom with chainsaw rockets and spinning titty grenades. Nice work piecing that puzzle together.
It's true, Samurai Princess isn't exactly drowning in subtlety. Or taste. James successfully figured out which characters hate which other characters and who killed whom with chainsaw rockets and spinning titty grenades. Nice work piecing that puzzle together. Failed it: There are a few contextual items that went right over James's head. First of all, the lady in the barn cage is actually Guitar Hero's sister, and they went insane from Dr. Jack Sparrow trying to cure their crippling illness… with robotics. Rapenstein and their girlfriend are self-proclaimed “artists” that create robots from the people they kill. Oh, and speaking of robots, Samurai Princess is not “revived” so much as “made from the parts of eleven different women,” including their souls, hence the screenshot with all the faces. And finally… I'm so sorry to be the one to tell you this, James… the scene where Guitar Hero accidentally pees on Samurai Princess is a painfully long dialogue exchange where they keep informing them that their tiny little dick is nowhere near as big as the thick meaty penises of their rapists. It's the worst piece of comedy I've ever experienced, and I once sat through an entire Jeff Dunham special against my will on Thanksgiving.

Improved it: James, the only way you could have made this movie better is if you threw it in a wood chipper and punched me in the face. I promise never to screen your assignments two hours before I drop them off again. Lesson learned.
FINAL GRADE: A-
James S. is a member of the Portland Comedy Co-op and doesn't really use Twitter.
Norway, the world's fourth biggest crude exporter, said Monday that its oil production fell a sizeable 7% in April to 1.99 million barrels a day last month from 2.15 million barrels a day in March.
Though preliminary, the data highlight one of the big underlying supply problems in non-OPEC states that many oil analysts believe is likely to send crude prices back over the $100 a barrel mark in coming years.
The Norwegian situation is being replicated in other non-OPEC oil producers, such as Mexico and the U.K. These regions are mature and giving up less oil, meaning that keeping production flat is getting harder and harder.
If analysts are right, this underlying supply struggle will keep oil prices relatively strong in coming years. And that's a boon for renewable energy developers. Not just are they set to receive an enormous infusion of cash, low-interest loans and other support out of capitals from Washington D.C. to Beijing, they appear set to get some tailwind from high oil prices. If the worst global recession in decades can't derail oil prices for long, that's a good sign that the global economy is entering a period of oil prices high enough to support ongoing investment in renewables . . .
Team USA's second medal of these Games went to the rookie. At 86kg, 21-year-old J'Den Cox won a bronze medal on a ludicrous scramble with Reineris Salas Perez of Cuba.
Four minutes and fifty-five seconds into the match, Cox was leading 1-0 on a shot clock point when they in turn was put on the clock. As it was set to expire, the two-time NCAA champ from Missouri went after a last ditch leg attempt. It turned into a minute long scramble that was blown dead with four seconds remaining.
But the American coaches challenged it, and won. It appeared there was a point when Cox dropped Salas to their hip with both hands locked. The Cuban coaches were so upset they ran on the mat, got yellow carded and Salas refused to finish the match.
In four matches, Cox was not taken down and gave up only three points. Two of those were stepouts and one was a shot clock point.
The other American competing today got fifth. Tervel Dlagnev had a furious comeback in their first match and controlled the second match, but got hurt right at the end. That appeared to be the injury that set Dlagnev back in their semis and bronze match.
Both times, they were taken down and gut wrenched in thirty seconds. The 30-year-old former D2 star completes a great career in which they wrestled for a bronze medal every year they made a world or Olympic team.
I know something about you without knowing you. I bet you spend A LOT of time in your head.
You know, thinking, worrying, stressing, freaking out — call it whatever you want. I call it a preoccupied mind. And with what?
99% of your thoughts are useless. William James put it best:
“A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.”
All my life I've been obsessed with practical things. Practical philosophy, practical knowledge, practical books, practical work, and practical advice.
That idea comes from Pragmatism, a philosophical tradition that started in the 19th century in America. Charles Sanders Peirce, who was a Harvard professor, is considered as the “father of Pragmatism.”
But it was William James, a trained physician turned philosopher, who really defined the philosophy.
About thoughts, worry, and stress, William James says:
“The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another.”
Pragmatism believes that the mind is a tool. Your mind should work for you, not against you. People who don't master their mind, don't believe it's possible.
They say: “I can't help but thinking these things.”
Well, you can with enough practice. It's a skill.
In other words: You have the ability to decide what you think. Or, you can choose NOT to think.
And that is one of the most important and most practical things you can learn in life. Before I learned that skill, I would spend hours and hours inside my head.
Just think about how much you think.
“I wonder what my boss thinks?”
“What happens if I screw up and lose my job?”
“Do they love me?”
“I think they don't care about me.”
“I just keep failing.”
“Why does my life suck?”
“Why is my life awesome, and other people's lives are not?”
“What if I get cancer?”
“I don't care about my job. Is there something wrong with me?”
“I can't finish anything. What's wrong with me?”
And the list goes on. That is all REAL shit. That's stuff people tell me when I ask them what they worry about.
You know what those thoughts do to you? Guilt, anger, suffering.
I just have one question for you: What's the practical use of your thoughts?
Yes? I'm waiting. Still no answer? Exactly.
Thoughts have no use. 99% of them that is.
Which thoughts are useful?
That's it. You can ignore every other thought.
If you're constantly thinking, it's because you haven't' trained your mind yet. You HAVE to get out of your head.
If not, you go mental. Everyone will. No exception.
Also, you're probably thinking so much that you're missing out of life. Did you notice the sunshine this morning when you woke up? Or the raindrops? Did you notice the smell of your coffee? Did you feel the texture of your cereals?
If your answer is no, you definitely need to get out of your head. Stop thinking and start feeling.
Now, you might think: “How do I train myself to stop thinking useless thoughts?”
Awareness.
That's where it starts. Every time you start drifting off, become aware of it. Just observe your brain. Step outside yourself and just observe the crazy shit you're thinking about.
Don't judge. Don't think you're stupid. If you do that, you're thinking again.
No, what you want to do is say this to yourself: “Ah that's a cute thought. Now, let's get back to reality.”
“If you can change your mind, you can change your life.”
― William James
Are you back to reality? Do you feel your eyes reading the letters on your screen? Do you feel your phone in your hand? Are you thinking about how you're going to apply this information to your life?
Great. You're USING your mind, and it's not the other way around. Now, keep using that brain of yours.
Because I'll tell you this: It's the most powerful tool on earth.
Thanks for reading!
I also wrote a book on this topic. It's called THINK STRAIGHT. Check it out if you want to learn more about controlling your thoughts.
Microsoft is enjoying a resurgence that many attribute to its new CEO. Satya Nadella is certainly galvanising the company, and the enthusiasm of product teams at the recent Build 2014 conference was noticeable. But for those who have tracked their career at Microsoft, the fact that Nadella's second month in the CEO seat sees the company's stock price climbing high isn't out of step. Like the White Queen, Nadella has been associated with a few things usually considered impossible at Microsoft.
They moved from sales to engineering
Nadella was hired from Sun, and their first job at Microsoft was on the WebTV project — a service that went from being a cheap computer for the non-technical to a set-top box service delivering TV over the internet, losing its founder along with its broader vision. It was acquired in 1997, just as Microsoft fought off an attempt to reopen the DoJ case against the company, and killed in 2013 just as Apple was starting to get somewhere with Apple TV. Although WebTV is the reason Microsoft has a campus in silicon valley, it never gave Microsoft the foothold in the living room it was hoping for and WebTV hasn't always been a positive thing to have on your CV at Microsoft.
They saved Microsoft's web search
Like the look of Cortana ? Enjoy voice controlling your Xbox One? Both rely heavily on Microsoft's Bing search service, which is really a large machine learning system (just like Google). Bing is still a distant second in web search, but it's far more successful — and works far better — than its predecessor, Live Search. That's thanks to the FAST search team Microsoft bought to improve SharePoint and the PowerSet team purchased for its work on understanding the concepts behind the things we search for. It's also thanks to lots of hard work from the Bing engineers and the researchers at MSR — and the head of the division when all of this work was being done, Satya Nadella.
And if you're going to get an understanding of the complex business models of ad-supported and freemium services in a highly competitive market, web search is an excellent place to do it.
They took over from Bob Muglia and nobody hated them for it
Nadella replaced the much-loved, deeply-respected Bob Muglia as the head of the server and tools business. It's widely believed that Muglia left because they aren't 'all in' on the cloud and didn't believe Microsoft's cloud products were mature enough to focus on. It's hard to replace a popular leader, but Nadella did it without any backlash — even while taking the direction that Muglia seems not to have agreed with. That's a sign of a good leader.
They made Azure relevant
The transformation of Windows 7 into a secure, fast, high-performance operating system went hand-in-hand with the work done to deliver Windows Server 2012, which has been Microsoft's most successful server OS, with virtualisation features that match and often leapfrog VMware (particularly software-defined networking). But at the same time, under Nadella, Azure went from being a minimal service that was too far ahead of what business customers actually wanted, to a powerful way to exploit the efficiencies of a giant, heavily automated data centre; it became far cheaper to run the server workloads customers still wanted, and they could be enticed to try out services for running websites, hosting data and other Platform-as-a-Service tasks.
Today Azure is coming out with new features every three weeks, hosting more customers than anyone else in the cloud and underpinning everything from Apple's iCloud to Samsung Smart TV to NBC's streaming of the Olympics. It's Microsoft's poster-child for cloud, along with Office 365 (also delivered on Nadella's watch), and there wasn't much at the Build conference that you can't connect back to Azure in some way.
They made 'devices and services' make sense
On their very first day as CEO, Nadella described the 'devices and services' strategy, which Steve Ballmer had been pitching since the One Microsoft reorg last year, and got people to understand it by using the word 'software' — which is what everyone associates with Microsoft. Devices are never just Surface and Xbox; it was always about Microsoft finding a way to be relevant on all the different devices we use today — from Kindle to iPad and Android phones to wearables such as socks that sense how fast you're running. And services was never just Microsoft's own services such as Office 365, Azure and Bing; it was always about working well with other services — like the way you can sign a document that lives on Office 365 using the DocuSign app on your iPhone because the services work together.
Ballmer never managed to clearly explain the breadth of the 'devices and services' vision; under Nadella, Microsoft has announced and launched multiple examples, from Office for iPad to Cortana (a Bing service on a Windows Phone device).
They took off the brakes at Microsoft
Nadella's real strength may prove to be that they saw the breadth of the open, cross-platform innovation that was already happening at Microsoft and saw how to build that into a blueprint that delivers the devices and services, cloud-and-mobile-first strategy that's getting Microsoft such positive comments.
After all, five weeks isn't long enough to write Office for iPad (or OneNote for Mac); it's barely even enough to get Office for iPad through the approval process for the App Store, which is probably what fixed the launch date (once the Office team had abandoned their almost-finished iOS 6 version and rebuilt it for iOS 7). Getting Samsung to use Microsoft's rights management service to secure documents inside Knox, or LiveScribe to support the new OneNote API, didn't happen overnight either. And Ballmer signalled dropping the cost of Windows Phone and Windows licences pretty clearly at the last shareholder meeting.
There will be projects where Nadella is reaping what Ballmer sowed, as well as initiatives he's greenlit himself. But it's clear from Build 2014 that Nadella has got people believing in Microsoft again — especially the people who work there.

Battered by scandals surrounding security failures in Benghazi and allegations of criminal activity by diplomats, the State Department is taking over the sensitive process by which background checks are given to locals hired to work at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, the largest and most expensive diplomatic post in the world.
The process is presently handled by a private security company contracted to the Pentagon. But a recently circulated contract solicitation indicates that the firm conducting the vetting — and the budget for the process — is being shifted to the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security.
“Due to the large number of personnel assigned to and supporting the U.S. mission in Iraq, [Diplomatic Security] requires the services of a contractor to assist with the vetting and badging of American citizens, third country nationals, and local nationals,” states the contract solicitation, posted this month on FedBizOpps.gov.
The identity of the firm handling the task is blacked out in the solicitation, which says the new contractor will “assist with various steps of the background and suitability investigation process, check applicants through U.S. government databases, and obtain biometrics data of individuals applying for access to the embassy.”
The State Department had no official comment, but officials speaking on background downplayed the development, saying the shift is part of the yearslong transition from military to civilian control over U.S. operations in Iraq.
Prior to the late-2011 withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad “utilized security resources from both the departments of State and Defense (DoD),” one State Department official said via email. “The vetting capabilities described in the FedBizOpps solicitation are one such capability.”
“The DoD-sourced vetting services contract that previously provided this capability has run its course,” the official said. “DoD no longer has a requirement for such services in Iraq, and the Department of State does. This is why we have begun the solicitation/procurement process to fulfill this operational requirement.”
Another State Department official echoed those comments.
“Obviously, this is something that's still needed in Iraq and so the State Department has decided they would pick up this contract,” the official said. “There's no reason for DoD to spend this money when they no longer have a combat command there in Iraq.”
Under scrutiny
The State Department has been criticized by its internal watchdog agency for not moving fast enough to take control of tasks formerly managed and financed by the U.S. military in Iraq and for failing to rein in rampant spending on contractors.
The State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad “are behind schedule in implementing a plan to oversee more than $5 billion in contracts,” says a “sensitive but unclassified” report by the State Department's office of inspector general.
The report, posted June 3 on the inspector general's website, suggests the Pentagon's management of the overall vetting process may have been inefficient, putting more pressure on the State Department to improve the system while moving quickly to fill large gaps in the embassy workforce.
The Baghdad facility — often dubbed by news reports as “The Fortress” — is America's largest overseas diplomatic post and cost roughly three-quarters of a billion dollars to build during the late 2000s.
As of February, the embassy had authorization for 469 local employee positions, but 187 are vacant, according to the inspector general's report.
Despite more than 10 years in Iraq, the report says, U.S. officials “lack firsthand knowledge of local conditions and the best places to recruit potential candidates,” in part because American diplomats “rarely venture beyond the international zone” surrounding the embassy.
That caution can be explained by the relative instability of security in Iraq: U.S. military forces are no longer the target, but suicide bombings and sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shiite Muslims continue to rage.
But shifting the responsibility for security to the State Department raises its own questions. Elsewhere in the region, the department's track record on security in postwar environments has been mixed.
Benghazi's shadow
The department suffered a particularly unfortunate blow last year when armed militants stormed a makeshift diplomatic post and CIA house in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, killing U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.
In Benghazi, the State Department worked with a British company that hired local guards to protect the diplomatic post. A report by Reuters in October noted that the company Blue Mountain Group hired about 20 Libyan men — including some who said they had minimal training — to screen visitors and help patrol the makeshift post.
Some sustained injuries and said they were ill-prepared to protect themselves or others when armed militants stormed the facility.
But foreign policy insiders generally discourage comparing the Wild West atmosphere of eastern Libya to the postwar security situation in Iraq.
In Baghdad, the embassy's website says, “a local guard force and other security support personnel” are part of the operation, which also includes “special agents of the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service” as well as “a Marine security guard detachment.”
No such detachment was on hand in Benghazi.
Iraq also is home to a U.S.-trained military and security force of more than 400,000 active soldiers, unlike Libya, where local militias — some of them with hard-line Islamist agendas — continue jockeying for power.
Furthermore, one State Department official said, “since the U.S. military has pulled out of Iraq, we have not had any U.S. loss of life due to any attacks.”
That said, the official added: “We're not putting any less emphasis on how we deal with safety and security of our personnel, especially in a high-threat post like Iraq, where security is our No. 1 priority.”
“In no way are we minimizing that threat,” the official said.

We love the new Doom and we have been playing it non-stop since release but like all things in this digital age, there is one nagging issue that seems to be plaguing the game right now.
Many players have been reporting about a weird Dev Mode bug that puts the game in developer mode which disables achievements and marks your save game file as a "Cheat". More importantly, this also disables access to Network services which means players cannot play Multiplayer or gain access to the SnapMap level editor.
While it's unclear as to what is causing this anomaly (reasons range from corrupt save files to random crashes), the only fix so far has been an unpopular one, players will have to delete their savegame files to put the game back into Normal functional mode. While Bethesda and iD have yet to fix the problem via patch, here's a quick rundown on how players can fix the problem for now.
1) Disable Steam cloud synchronization for DOOM by Right-clicking the game in your Steam Library, then navigate to UPDATES and uncheck the Enable Steam Cloud synchronization box at the bottom.
2) Exit Steam
3) Access the Doom Save files (Located in C:\Users\User Name>\Saved Games)
4) Open the id Software folder, then navigate to DOOM and then base, Now delete the savegame Folder
5) Start Steam and right click on DOOM in your Library, select properties and Navigate to LOCAL FILES, click VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME CACHE at the bottom and let it finish.
6) Try playing the Game.
While this is a terrible solution for the problem, this is the only one that works so far.

Some disappointing news for the JavaFX community this week – it's been decided that the latest Java Development Kit for ARM (JDK 8u33 for ARM), and any future Oracle JDK for ARM and Oracle Java SE Embedded releases, will no longer feature JavaFX support for embedded systems.
Needless to say, this news was greeted with some consternation, especially as Oracle initially, who has frequently highlighted JavaFX Pi in Java Magazine, initially declined to state why JavaFX embedded had been ditched;
WHAT? WHY? Starting with JDK 8u33, #JavaFX Embedded is removed from the ARM bundle and is not supported. #Javahttp://t.co/IWZNszNhXA — Hendrik Ebbers (@hendrikEbbers) January 23, 2015
Any initial confusion has subsequently been cleared up in an official statement by Oracle representative Kevin Rushforth. Describing the move as a “resource trade off within Oracle”, Rushforth cited the difficulties the team had been experiencing in supporting FX amidst a plethora of non-standardised hardware, writing that, “it really is difficult to have enough hardware and testing resources committed to support FX on ARM.”
They added that,”It is important to understand that when we say support, we are not talking about just “running” on a device like the Raspberry PI — but providing support for paying customers that are almost certainly going to be using hardware that is customized for their embedded product.”
Rushforth was quick to reassure users that “This does not mean that FX is going away on other platforms”, adding that “hopefully this does not mean we will be disappearing from ARM completely”. Rushforth explained that the core JavaFX team will continue working on the ARM port “as resources permit”, noting that all JavaFX sources have been ported to OpenJFX, and the team will be maintaining an up-to date OpenJFX Wiki with detailed articles on building for ARM.
As Jan Snelders states, if you need to continue with JavaFX on the latest Java, there is a solution; “Cross compile JavaFX yourself for ARM and add it to the latest JDK from Oracle.There is an extensive manual on the OpenJFX website explaining in detail how to do this.” Or you could skip this step and download a precompiled version of JavaFX that Jan, being a bit of a hero, has posted on the embedded Linux wiki, and extract this binary into your <jdk8-arm-install-dir>/jre/lib/ directory.
Over at the Raspberry Pi blog, Dalibor Topic posted that “JavaFX continues to be provided as a fully supported part of the Oracle JDK 8 product on x86 platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac)”. They recommend that developers looking for a new solution concentrate their efforts on contributing to this project, or opt for other UI frameworks such as Swing or AWT.

A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld the government's "net neutrality" rules that require internet providers to treat all web traffic equally.
The 2-1 ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is a win for the Obama administration, consumer groups and content companies such as Netflix that want to prevent online content from being blocked or channeled into fast and slow lanes.
The rules treat broadband service like a public utility and prevent internet service providers from offering preferential treatment to sites that pay for faster service.
The Federal Communications Commission argued that the rules are crucial for allowing customers to go anywhere on the internet without a provider favoring its own service over that of other competitors. The FCC's move to reclassify broadband came after President Barack Obama publicly urged the commission to protect consumers by regulating internet service as it does other public utilities.
Cable and telecom opponents argue the new rules will prevent them from recovering costs for connecting to broadband hogs like Netflix that generate a huge amount of internet traffic. Providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T say the rules threaten innovation and undermine investment in broadband infrastructure.
But Judges David Tatel and Sri Srinivasan denied all challenges to the new rules, including claims that the FCC could not reclassify mobile broadband as a common carrier. That extends the reach of the new rules as more people view content on mobile devices.
Judge Stephen Williams dissented in part and said they would have struck down the rules.
The industry had argued that broadband was an information service, and the FCC didn't have the authority to change in which camp it fell. But the court ruled that the FCC was justified in reclassifying broadband as a telecom utility because consumers see broadband as a pipe for internet service and use it mostly to get to websites and apps.
The same appeals court had previously struck down the FCC's efforts to enforce net neutrality twice before. The latest decision is expected to be appealed.
An intense political battle is playing out over rooftop solar power in Nevada, the latest skirmish in an ongoing war between power utilities and a species many of them have recently encountered for the first time ever: competitors.
At issue in Nevada, as in many of these fights, is a policy known as "net metering." The details differ from place to place, but the basic idea is simple: utilities have to buy rooftop solar power from customers who produce it, at current retail electric rates. If a customer generates as much power as they consume, they can zero out their utility bill. Currently, 44 states and Washington, DC, have mandatory net metering, and utilities in three of the remaining states allow some form of it.
The program has been extremely popular in Nevada, where it's helped establish a thriving solar industry. According to the Solar Foundation, solar businesses employed 5,900 Nevadans in 2014 — more solar employees per capita than in any other state. And that's up several thousand, almost doubled, from 2013. Investment is flooding in as tech companies and data centers seek cleaner power in the sunny Western desert. (According to SEIA, $569 million was invested in Nevada solar installations in 2014, up 427 percent from 2013.)
Though net metering remains popular in Nevada, the state's primary utility — NV Energy, recently acquired by Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Energy — is not a fan. It is now pressuring the state legislature to keep an artificially low cap on the program's size, which threatens to halt the growth in demand and stunt industry growth.
What's happening in Nevada is a stark case (more details in a moment), but it is not unique. Utilities have never been excited about net metering, but now that rooftop solar is getting so cheap, so fast, they see it as a serious threat. In alliance with fossil fuel interests, they are going after it:
Legislation to make net metering illegal or more costly has been introduced in nearly two dozen state houses since 2013. Some of the proposals were virtual copies of model legislation drafted two years ago by the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, a nonprofit organization with financial ties to billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch.
Why utilities really hate buying rooftop solar power
Utilities are not like normal businesses in normal markets. They are monopolies, with sole access to customers in their territory. They make money by charging customers for electricity on a per-kWh basis. (This is known as a "volumetric" charge — the more customers use, the more they pay.)
Electricity rates are meant to cover not only the cost of the electricity itself ("variable costs"), but also a utility's "fixed costs" — its investments in the power plants, power lines, substations, and meters needed to provide power. Oh, and enough left over for profits.
What's to stop a monopoly from gouging its captive customers with extortionate rates? In the case of a utility, it has to justify its rates through a "rate case" before a public utility commission (PUC). The commission is supposed to ensure that the utility keeps power as reliable, cheap, and nondiscriminatory as possible, and that its profits are fair, not excessive.
Yes: state-sponsored monopolies charging state-sanctioned prices. Capitalism rules.
So now, imagine you are a utility. You made your rate case: you estimated demand over the next, say, two years; you estimated how much investment would be required to meet that demand; and you estimated a volumetric rate that would pay back those investments and leave a reasonable profit. The PUC signed off on your rate. For the next two years, you are golden.
But there's a problem. There are all sorts of interesting new technologies brewing on the customer side of the power meter, where you have no control. Not only are appliances getting more energy-efficient, but home energy management is getting smarter (with Nest thermometers, Tesla home batteries, and the like) and, worst of all, customers are starting to generate their own power (for now, mostly with solar panels, but other options are developing).
What do all these technologies have in common? They reduce the amount of power the customer buys from you, the utility. Insofar as a customer generates their own power, stores it, and manages it intelligently, that customer is going to need less power from the grid. They could even start producing more power than they consume, in which case she'll need none of your grid power at all.
In short, these behind-the-meter innovations represent, collectively, a competitor — the first retail-side competition US utilities have faced, well, ever.
Normal businesses facing competition can cut prices. But as a utility, you already had your rate case — the prices you can charge have been set by your PUC. You chose a rate based on a particular projection of power demand, but now rooftop panels are reducing demand for grid power, faster than anyone expected. You're selling less power than you thought, so the rates you're charging aren't covering your fixed costs. You risk having those investments "stranded."
So now you have to schlep back to your PUC and ask them to let you raise rates, which makes them mad and makes your customers mad.
Worse? As more and more customers defect partially or entirely to solar power (and batteries, etc.), you're selling less and less of your product, so to get the same amount of profit you have to charge higher and higher rates. But as you charge higher rates, you drive more people to solar, leaving fewer customers behind. Wash, rinse, repeat. It's a vicious cycle, which the industry itself warned could lead to a "death spiral."
Why utilities say they want to squash net metering
Faced with this dire situation, many utilities are working to eliminate net metering, or at least impose extra fees on customers who take advantage of it. "We don't like competition" is not a great public-facing argument, however, so they've had to develop a more sophisticated case.
The case utilities make to legislators and regulators is as follows: customers who reduce or eliminate their utility bills are no longer paying the fixed costs for the grid that they are, in most cases, still using. (Fully off-grid systems are still a tiny minority.) As they pay less in fixed costs, other customers — the ones unable or unwilling to install rooftop solar, usually poorer customers — pay more. This "cost shifting" is, utilities say, an unfair subsidy of solar customers by non-solar customers.
Utilities are just trying to protect their customers, in other words. Or so they say.
The case for net metering
Solar advocates respond that solar rooftop power creates benefits that outweigh the lost utility revenue. Customers with solar rooftops reduce the need for new investments in power plants and power lines, thereby reducing fixed costs. And because solar tends to be most intense during periods of the highest demand, they specifically reduce the demand for "peak power," the most expensive kind, thereby reducing costs for other grid-connected customers.
Which to say nothing of the social benefits brought about by diversifying and decentralizing the grid, reducing CO2 emissions, and spurring innovation in the solar industry.
Advocates are supported by a host of studies. Analysis done on net metering in California, Arizona, Missouri, Mississippi, Vermont, and Hawaii has found that under almost all scenarios, net metering represents a modest net benefit to rate payers (solar and non-solar alike) or, at worst, a wash. In almost no case has net metering been found to represent, as utilities charge, a net cost to ratepayers.
The fight in Nevada
All this serves as context for what's going on in Nevada. Right now, the state's net metering program is capped at 3 percent of the utility's total peak load. At the rate it's growing, the program will hit that cap soon, possibly as early as this summer. If the cap stays in place, new demand will evaporate, and the state's solar industry, which has been hiring like crazy and planning for growth, will leave for greener pastures.
Are NV Energy's fears about net metering valid? As it happens, the Nevada PUC did an extensive study of net metering not long ago. Overall, the study authors found, "we do not estimate a substantial cost shift." Determining net costs and benefits is highly sensitive to various assumptions, the study concluded, but in any case the impact is likely to be very small. (The study didn't examine some aspects, like water use, that would have further strengthened the case for solar.)
NV Energy had full input into the study, but now disputes it, saying that solar has gotten so much cheaper (!) that the study underestimates its impact. Nonetheless, barring a redo, this is the independent study for the state, and it has found that NV Energy is, in a word, wrong.
Having lost the argument, the utility has now turned to brute-force lobbying. (One of Gov. Brian Sandoval's top policy advisers used to lobby for the company.) And it seems to be working. On Sunday, the Nevada Senate voted through a bill that would kick the decision about raising the cap — and whether to impose additional fees — over to the PUC. Even if the PUC decides in favor of lifting the cap, the delay will wreak havoc on the state's solar industry.
As the newly formed Nevada Coalition To Protect Ratepayers — a group of solar and tech businesses fighting to raise the cap — has pointed out, the bill never had a public hearing. Despite activists marching outside, all deliberations went on behind closed doors.
The bigger picture
It's too soon to say whether Nevada's flourishing solar industry can dodge this bullet, or whether the big utility will win this round.
But make no mistake: for utilities, these are rear-guard battles. The behind-the-meter genie is already out of the bottle, steadily luring away utility customers, and prices are only falling. There is simply no way utilities will be able to lobby enough to stop it. At best, a utility can hope to slow the growth of those industries in its own state, which might help the utility but is not great economic policy.
A collision is coming, between an outmoded utility industry, working with a business and regulatory model designed for the early 20th century, and a host of new technologies that put power in customer hands. The reckoning can be delayed, but not for long. Pretty soon, legislators and regulators are going to have to grapple with deeper reforms than a fee here or a cap there. The utility model needs a deep rethink.
Shadow chancellor will also tell Labour conference they want watchdog to audit all of party's tax and spending commitments
Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, is to propose extending free childcare from 15 to 25 hours a week, saying they can fund the measure by raising the bank levy.
Their offer will be available to working parents of three- to four-year-olds.
It will be available to single parents and to households where both parents are in work.
The move is separate to Labour's pledge at the start of its autumn conference in Brighton to provide "wraparound" care through schools to help ease the childcare burden for families. No money was set aside by Labour for its wraparound offer.
Balls will make the childcare offer in their speech to the party conference in Brighton on Monday, in which they will call for iron discipline on spending.
Balls will try to bolster Labour's economic credibility by asking the government's spending watchdog to audit all of its tax and spending commitments before the next election.
They will tell Labour's conference they have written to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to ask it to examine the credibility and implications of the party's manifesto plans. Their keynote speech will contain fresh proposals to target help for childcare, but also a warning that the economic backdrop means a "Labour government will find delivering its goals harder than at any point in living memory".
The Balls plan to put Labour's five-year tax and spending plans at the mercy of the fiercely independent OBR is high risk, but betrays the struggle Labour is facing to persuade the electorate that it will not be fiscally irresponsible in government.
The OBR was established by the coalition after claims the Treasury under the chancellorship of Gordon Brown had manipulated fiscal forecasts to make sure their spending plans looked sustainable. Established by statute, its formal remit does not to extend to examining the fiscal plans of the opposition, and it would require the agreement of the coalition itself for the remit to be extended.
Balls wrote to Robert Chote, the director of the OBR, asking the watchdog to investigate Labour's spending plans. Chote said it would be for parliament to decide whether to extend the OBR's remit as set out in its charter, adding: "It would be highly desirable there should be cross-party consensus on that."
The charter makes clear the OBR should not be drawn into party politics.
The Conservatives denounced the plan as a Labour stunt, saying the party has been found out for making unfunded commitments.
The Conservative Treasury spokesperson, Sajid Javid, on Sunday released an analysis by Treasury officials according to which, they said, Labour's promises would require more than £1,000 extra borrowing for each household in 2015.
Javid said: "Ed Balls knows this is not allowed under the Budget Responsibility Act, and the OBR's charter, so this is just a stunt to try and distract attention from the fact that Labour have been found out for making unfunded commitments that would just mean more borrowing and more debt."
Speaking on BBC Radio 4 on Monday, Balls said it would not require a change in the law to widen the remit of the OBR but instead just a single word-change in its charter. They lambasted the Tory opposition to their ideas, saying: "They are playing party politics when we are trying to give the public reassurance that all parties manifestos add up to rebuild trust".
They said they did not think the Conservatives would ultimately block the plan, claiming the Treasury select committee chairperson, Andrew Tyrie, supported the idea and commented it would not require legislation.
In their speech, Balls will say: "Childcare is a vital part of our economic infrastructure that, alongside family support and flexible working, should give parents the choice to stay at home with their children when they are very small and to balance work and family as they grow older."
"But for many families, high childcare costs mean that it doesn't even add up to go to work. So to make work pay for families, we must act."
They will justify an increase in the bank levy to raise an extra £800m a year to fund the extension.
They argue that in the last financial year, the banks paid £2.7bn less in overall tax than they did in 2010. Over the past two years, the government's bank levy has raised £1.6bn less than ministers said it would.
The current free entitlement, which the government increased from 12 to 15 hours a week in November 2010, has high take-up, although there is some evidence that the most disadvantaged people are not using their entitlement.

Earthquakes aren't supposed to hit Washington, D.C. — until they do.
Today marks the five year anniversary of the 5.8-magnitude quake that rattled the region and caused damage to buildings, including the Washington Monument and National Cathedral. Fortunately, no deaths or serious injuries were reported.
[The disaster that wasn't: Memories of the D.C. region's 2011 earthquake]
At 1:51 p.m. on Aug.23, 2011, seismic waves shot out in all directions from a depth of four miles below the Earth's surface about 35 miles northwest of Richmond, near Mineral, Va. The rumbling lasted less than a minute, but that's all it took to freak out a citizenry unaccustomed to tremors.

The earthquake was the strongest recorded east of the Rocky Mountains since 1944 and the strongest ever recorded in central Virginia's seismic zone.
“For a geologist, the 2011 earthquake was unequivocally one of the most geologically and historically significant moments in the Commonwealth,” said Virginia state geologist David Spears.
(U.S. Geological Survey)
It's believed that the quake was the most widely felt in the history of the United States with up to one third of the population rocking and rolling on that sunny work day. It was also felt all the way in Canada.
There were dozens of aftershocks, one a 4.5-magnitude, which struck in the middle of the night, startling this reporter out of theirs slumber.

So why did the earthquake occur? Millions of years ago, the North American and European continents slammed into each other several times creating the Appalachian Mountains, and when they separated the Atlantic Ocean was born. As a result of the continental collisions there are numerous but mostly quiet faults on the East Coast.
The earthquake occurred in a hot spot for quakes known as the Virginia Seismic Zone, according to Thomas Pratt with the U.S. Geological Survey Geologic Hazards Science Center. “Aftershocks continue today,” Pratt said. “However, they are becoming less numerous.”
[From 2015: Flurry of small earthquakes rattled Mineral, Va. over the weekend]
It was nOt just humans that were rattled. Our primate cousins at the National Zoo actually sensed it coming, according to a 2011 press release:
The earthquake hit the Great Ape House and Think Tank Exhibit during afternoon feeding time. About five to ten seconds before the quake, many of the apes, including Kyle (an orangutan) and Kojo (a western lowland gorilla), abandoned their food and climbed to the top of the tree-like structure in the exhibit. About three seconds before the quake, Mandara (a gorilla) let out a shriek and collected their baby, Kibibi, and moved to the top of the tree structure as well. Iris (an orangutan) began “belch vocalizing” — an unhappy/upset noise normally reserved for extreme irritation — before the quake and continued this vocalization following the quake.
The memory from that day has not faded, and there are reminders of the event around town. The National Cathedral is still in need of millions of dollars to complete its restoration of gargoyles and other decorations on the exterior of the building.
“We got lucky that more people didn't get hurt from things like falling bricks,” Pratt said. “This kind of event will happen again. The big question is when.”

When asked last season to describe their game to someone who has never seen them play before, Marcus Smart offered an unusual comparison: “a junkyard dog.”
“A junkyard dog is someone who does all the little things, who you don't really want to mess with,” the 23-year-old told Boston.com. “That's kind of me. I do all the little things for this team. I'm not the only one, but I'm one of the guys that do it.”
Smart — whose play is defined by scrappy efforts and unwavering intensity — is shooting a mere 31.2 percent from the field this season, but the Celtics guard is still an integral part to the team's offense. When he's on the floor, Boston's offensive rating stands at 107.1. When he's on the bench, the stat drops to 100.7.

The box score has seen Smart have nights where he's 0-of-7 or 3-of-15, as well as ones where he's 7-of-8 or 8-of-13. Yet in the face of their inconsistent shooting, Smart is averaging over 30 minutes off the bench — and he's making the most of it.
“I don't mind getting myself dirty, bloodied up a little bit, putting my body on the line for this team,” they said.
Their tenacity isn't just exciting to watch. It's paying off, too. The Celtics' net rating when Smart is on the court is plus-11.2 points per 100 possessions. But when he's off, it falls to minus-0.8. And Smart's personal plus-minus has been a double-digit plus eight times this season. As head coach Brad Stevens pointed out, “there's a reason he's in the game when the game is on the line.”
Smart's doggedness is nothing new for the former sixth overall draft pick. When they were growing up, some of their teammates and their parents would call them “hound dog” because of their on-court presence.
“I was moving the ball well,” they said. “Every play with the ball, I was always there. So they kind of gave me that nickname when I was little.”

The Texas native also credits their upbringing with shaping their style of play.
“I'm the youngest of four boys, so you have to be tough,” they said. “You have to be willing to get in and sacrifice your body. Being able to do that with my older brothers helped me grow into the physical player I am.”
Smart's favorite thing to do on the basketball court reflects their pugnacious nature. It's not driving to the hoop, it's not chucking up three-pointers, and it's not poking for steals… It's diving for balls.
“I just think it's fun,” they said. “That's a play most guys don't make. It's not on the stat sheet, but it's a big play for your team if you can recover it. It's a big momentum changer.”

The inclination to do whatever they can to benefit the larger group — even if it means getting “bloodied” — reverts back to Smart's “junkyard dog” persona.
“I'm willing to sacrifice my body for my team,” they told reporters during last season's playoffs. “Most of the time, wins aren't going to be pretty. You can't be out there looking pretty. It's going to get ugly. You got to be willing to stick your nose in there and get bloody a little bit. And that's me.”
But there's something deeper than a desire to win, and deeper than an affinity for physicality, that has been driving Smart's play. In 2004, they lost one of their brothers, Todd Westbrook, to a nearly two-decade long battle with cancer. The tragic death provided a cornerstone that has fueled their untethered approach to the game.
“I've always played hard,” Smart told Baxter Holmes as a rookie. “That's how I was raised. But now I'm playing more with a purpose. Now I'm playing not just for myself, I'm playing for my brother, for my family. I'm going to go out there and give it all I have, because they gave it all they had for 18 years, and they lost their battle. I don't want to lose my battle.”

Lawyer and human rights activist Kerry Kennedy has written to Hong Kong's democracy activist, Joshua Wong, who is currently serving a 6-month prison sentence. The letter from the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy, and niece of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, was written after Wong was jailed for their involvement in the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests.
Kerry Kennedy is a human rights activist and lawyer, and president of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, a human rights advocacy organization established in 1968 that works to realize Robert F. Kennedy's dream of a peaceful and just world by advancing human rights.
August 29, 2017
Dear Joshua,
I know that this letter is getting to you at a difficult point in your activism. You have taken a stand against what to many seems like an unbeatable and dangerous adversary. At times you have been successful; now you find that that the government is willing to jail its own citizens for leading and engaging in a peaceful protest. It is a shameful development in the history of Hong Kong, which for so long was a beacon of democratic values and human rights—a city with a thriving appreciation for freedom of expression and association and assembly. You—and the thousands you have inspired to stand with you—are right to be fighting against the erasure of these values. While you find yourself imprisoned now, I am reaching out to remind you that the world is with you, that people who you have never met—and will likely never know—have been inspired by your bravery and your commitment. I hope that you can take some solace in that as you make it through your time in detention.
In the United States, one of our most important struggles for justice over the last century has been the struggle for civil rights. It's a battle we are still fighting today. I want you to know that in April, 1963, the most prominent leader of the movement, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., found themselves in an almost identical situation to the one in which you find yourself now. While leading peaceful protests in Birmingham, Alabama against racial segregation, Dr. King was arrested and detained. The Alabama government was threatened by their views, their actions, and their ability to inspire, and so they arrested them for organizing a march without a permit. In their famous Letter from a Birmingham Jail, Dr. King wrote about the morality of disobeying unjust laws, and the fact that just laws can become unjust when they are used by governments to advance injustice. They conclude this passage of their letter:
One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells them is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.
Dr. King was arrested for marching without a permit, and you have been imprisoned for occupying a square without permission. Although you find yourself in jail, you are not any more a criminal than Dr. King was.
When Dr. King wrote that letter in April, 1963, my uncle John F. Kennedy was President of the United States, and my father, Robert F. Kennedy, was the Attorney General. My father stood shoulder to shoulder with Dr. King, championing the cause of civil rights in this country, as well as being a leading advocate against so many other forms of injustice. As you fight for freedom of thought in education and for democracy, I know my father would be supportive of your efforts. As a family, every night my Father would quiz us children on the day's news around the dinner table. Your fight and your leadership are exactly the type of story they would have made sure we all knew about—that we all understood how incredible your accomplishments were, and how desperately your efforts were needed in a place where democratic values were disappearing. In a 1966 speech my father correctly reflected that:
Few men are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their society. Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change a world which yields most painfully to change.
They would have been impressed by your moral courage.
With that in mind, I wanted to tell you about what Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights would like to do. Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights was founded in 1968 as both a living memorial to my father and as an organization dedicated to continuing Robert Kennedy's vision of a more just and peaceful world through education, advocacy, and litigation. Our education program is called Speak Truth to Power, and teaches students about basic human right principles through the stories of human rights defenders around the world. The ultimate aim of the program is to build a constituency of young people who identify as activists, recognizing that they have a critical role to play in protecting and advancing human rights. Your efforts in Hong Kong are a perfect example of the stories we have taught to millions of children throughout the world, and we would like to create a lesson plan about your activism. We think it would be an appropriate tribute to your work thus far organizing young people.
I know that the months ahead will be challenging. But know that people all over the world are rallying behind you. You will emerge from this stronger, and you will continue the struggle for justice. As you do, I will be there by your side.
Sincerely,
Kerry Kennedy
President, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights

The eurozone, it is widely thought, is about to get a dose of a new economic medicine.
The European Central Bank is expected to announce this week that it's going to go into the financial markets to buy substantial amounts of government debt using newly created money - a policy known as quantitative easing, or QE.
There has been mounting speculation that the ECB is preparing to act along these lines, and there will be serious disappointment in financial markets if that does not happen.
There is a clear danger of a more sustained period of deflation, which would destroy peripheral countries' debt consolidation efforts Capital Economics, London-based economic consultancy
The problem the ECB wants to tackle is inflation that is too low. Indeed last month it turned into deflation, or falling prices.
Deflation is partly a symptom of the eurozone's persistent economic weakness. But it could also aggravate it.
Deflation tends to be bad for debtors. The problem is that their incomes may fall, but their debt payments - if they debt involves fixed interest rates - may not.
With governments, falling prices and incomes will hit revenue from income tax and VAT. Most of their debt payments are at fixed rates.
'Unambiguously positive'
There have been warnings that deflation could reignite the eurozone's debt crisis.
Image copyright AFP Image caption ECB President Mario Draghi has welcomed falling oil prices
The London economic consultancy Capital Economics has said: "There is a clear danger of a more sustained period of deflation, which would destroy peripheral countries' debt consolidation efforts, and could cause market concerns to once again spread from Greece."
Now it is true that the eurozone had a period of deflation back in 2009. It lasted five months. But Capital Economics reckons the recent fall in energy prices could keep the eurozone in deflation territory for a lot longer this time.
But if it's the result of cheaper energy, you might argue, then it's surely not a problem.
There is a lot in that view. The International Monetary Fund's chief economist Olivier Blanchard said in a BBC interview that the oil price fall is "what I hate to call a gift of God" for the eurozone.
They said it means there has been "a very large increase in real [that is inflation adjusted] incomes of people, and is therefore likely to lead to more spending."
The ECB President Mario Draghi has described the direct impact of cheaper oil as "unambiguously positive".
Image copyright AFP Image caption The fall in petrol and diesel prices has left people with more money in their pockets
Even so, Mr Blanchard says that deflation is worrisome.
What bothers Mr Draghi is what they called "second round" effects, that falling prices might become "embedded in inflation expectations", and could affect wages as well as the prices of other types of goods.
In any event, it's worth noting that inflation excluding energy prices was 0.6% in December, a good deal lower than the ECB's target of below but close to 2%.
So that's what Mario Draghi and their colleagues in the ECB's policy-making committee are worried about.
Overseas examples
Quantitative easing is on their agenda because the traditional ammunition for a central bank is spent.
The ECB's interest rate policy is just about zero. The main rate that it charges for lending money to the commercial banks is just 0.05%. And the rate it pays them for holding their surplus finds overnight is below zero - minus 0.2%.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption The markets have expected the ECB to announce a period of quantitative easing
In similar circumstances, central banks in the US, UK, and Japan, wanting to provide more stimulus have gone down the path of quantitative easing, QE.
QE history
Three major developed country central banks have carried out QE in recent years: the US, the UK and Japan.
In the US and UK it started in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The American move, worth a total of about $3.5tn (£2.3tn), has coincided with a recovery from a nasty recession.
In the UK the return of convincing growth came only a few years after the active asset purchases of £375bn came to an end, though to this day the Bank of England still holds them.
Japan started QE much earlier, back in 2001, and its cumulative scale is in the region of $1.7tn or so. It's an attempt to deal with prolonged economic weakness. Despite the effort, Japanese growth has never really decisively resumed.
The evidence from these experiments is inconclusive. Some say the US and UK would have recovered without QE. Others say Japan would have been in worse shape without it.
And that's what is widely expected from the ECB - that it will announce a plan to buy substantial volumes of government debt using newly created money.
The ECB has, over the course of the financial crisis, done things that have elements in common with this. It has bought the bonds, the debts of some governments, and it has also bought assets backed by loans to the private sector.
With much of this, though not all, the ECB took steps to offset the additional money creation involved in buying these assets. The technical term is sterilisation.
In addition, the asset buying undertaken by the ECB so far was aimed at improving conditions in specific parts of the eurozone financial system: the availability of credit to the private sector, and the periods of very high borrowing costs in some countries.
What we are expected to get this week is different in that it won't be quite so focussed - the aim will be to generate higher inflation across the eurozone. And the scale is likely to be bigger than we have seen before.
The figure often suggested that the ECB will spead on QE is 500bn euros ($591bn; £382bn). That's smaller than the programmes undertaken by central banks in the US or Japan, and the UK, in comparison with the size of the economy. But then all those QE programmes did take time to build up to their full scale.
'Hyperinflation phobia'
So how would it work? Buying bonds in large quantities can raise their price, which lowers the return on them.
The return on bonds is in effect an interest rate, so the idea is that QE should exert downward pressure on interest rates throughout the economy, even when the central bank's own interest rate policy can no longer do that.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Germany is fearful of high inflation
So the idea is that QE leads businesses to want to invest more and consumers to spend. The additional demand for goods and services would then push inflation up too, and reduce the risk of aggravating the eurozone's persistent debt problems.
In addition QE can weaken a currency on the foreign exchanges. The fact that the policy tends to drive down interest rates also makes investors less enthusiastic about investing in the currency. The weaker currency makes business more competitive against rivals outside the eurozone.
The IMF's Olivier Blanchard told the BBC that the recent depreciation of the euro is "largely due to anticipation of QE coming down the line".
Now there are plenty of critics of QE. In the US a group of them wrote an open letter to the then Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, published in the Wall Street journal, warning of a risk of excessively high inflation.
Some in Europe, especially Germany, share that concern. There is history behind that, the hyperinflation of 1923 in Weimar Germany, which was followed in the next decade by the rise of the Nazis.
The Economist has called it "Germany's hyperinflation phobia" and as the paper points out there is a debate to be had about exactly what were the economic factors behind the disaster that followed in the 1930s.
Still, it is an issue in German politics and it has made it harder for the ECB to embark on a policy that can be characterised as "printing money".
There is also a concern that by buying government debt, the ECB would be relieving the pressure on countries that arguably need to do more to reduce their debts and reform their economies. And if any of those governments were to default, the argument goes, it would be taxpayers across the eurozone that would have to foot the bill.
There have been reports that the ECB will address the latter concern by having national central banks in the 19 member countries of the eurozone buy the bonds and take responsibility for any losses there might be - which would almost certainly let the German taxpayer off the hook.
It has been a long wait. The eurozone is, probably, about to embark on something that the US, Japan and Britain started years ago.
And nobody seems to think it will fix all the eurozone's problems. The best that eurozone QE might achieve is to alleviate one factor that could make them worse.
As the BBC's Economics Editor Robert Peston put it - "painkillers to an economy that needs rather more radical structural treatment".
We should resist the temptation to rehash these debates. Doing so would overlook the fact that a thorough generational shift has occurred. Widespread caricatures of students as overly sensitive, vulnerable and entitled “snowflakes” fail to acknowledge the philosophical work that was carried out, especially in the 1980s and '90s, to legitimate experience — especially traumatic experience — which had been dismissed for decades as unreliable, untrustworthy and inaccessible to understanding.

The philosopher Jean-François Lyotard , best known for their prescient analysis in “The Postmodern Condition” of how public discourse discards the categories of true/false and just/unjust in favor of valuing the mere fact that something is being communicated, examined the tension between experience and argument in a different way.
Instead of defining freedom of expression as guaranteeing the robust debate from which the truth emerges, Lyotard focused on the asymmetry of different positions when personal experience is challenged by abstract arguments. Their extreme example was Holocaust denial, where invidious but often well-publicized cranks confronted survivors with the absurd challenge to produce incontrovertible eyewitness evidence of their experience of the killing machines set up by the Nazis to exterminate the Jews of Europe. Not only was such evidence unavailable, but it also challenged the Jewish survivors to produce evidence of their own legitimacy in a discourse that had systematically denied their humanity.
Lyotard shifted attention away from the content of free speech to the way certain topics restrict speech as a public good. Some things are unmentionable and undebatable, but not because they offend the sensibilities of the sheltered young. Some topics, such as claims that some human beings are by definition inferior to others, or illegal or unworthy of legal standing, are not open to debate because such people cannot debate them on the same terms.
The recent student demonstrations at Auburn against Spencer's visit — as well as protests on other campuses against Charles Murray, Milo Yiannopoulos and others — should be understood as an attempt to ensure the conditions of free speech for a greater group of people, rather than censorship. Liberal free-speech advocates rush to point out that the views of these individuals must be heard first to be rejected. But this is not the case. Universities invite speakers not chiefly to present otherwise unavailable discoveries, but to present to the public views they have presented elsewhere. When those views invalidate the humanity of some people, they restrict speech as a public good.
In such cases there is no inherent value to be gained from debating them in public. In today's age, we also have a simple solution that should appease all those concerned that students are insufficiently exposed to controversial views. It is called the internet, where all kinds of offensive expression flourish unfettered on a vast platform available to nearly all.
The great value and importance of freedom of expression, for higher education and for democracy, is hard to underestimate. But it has been regrettably easy for commentators to create a simple dichotomy between a younger generation's oversensitivity and free speech as an absolute good that leads to the truth. We would do better to focus on a more sophisticated understanding, such as the one provided by Lyotard, of the necessary conditions for speech to be a common, public good. This requires the realization that in politics, the parameters of public speech must be continually redrawn to accommodate those who previously had no standing.

The rights of transgender people for legal equality and protection against discrimination are a current example in a long history of such redefinitions. It is only when trans people are recognized as fully human, rather than as men and women in disguise, as Ben Carson, the current secretary of housing and urban development claims, that their rights can be fully recognized in policy decisions.
The idea of freedom of speech does not mean a blanket permission to say anything anybody thinks. It means balancing the inherent value of a given view with the obligation to ensure that other members of a given community can participate in discourse as fully recognized members of that community. Free-speech protections — not only but especially in universities, which aim to educate students in how to belong to various communities — should not mean that someone's humanity, or their right to participate in political speech as political agents, can be freely attacked, demeaned or questioned.

THE STUDENT ACTIVISM that has roiled campuses — at Auburn, Missouri, Yale, Berkeley, Middlebury and elsewhere — is an opportunity to take stock of free speech issues in a changed world. It is also an opportunity to take into account the past few decades of scholarship that has honed our understanding of the rights to expression in higher education, which maintains particularly high standards of what is worthy of debate.
The recent controversies over the conflict between freedom of expression and granting everyone access to speech hark back to another telling moment. In 1963, Yale University had rescinded an invitation to Alabama's segregationist governor, George C. Wallace. In 1974, after unruly protests prevented William Shockley from debating their recommendation for voluntary sterilization of people with low I.Q.s, and other related incidents, Yale issued a report on how best to uphold the value of free speech on campus that remains the gold standard for many other institutions.
Unlike today's somewhat reflexive defenders of free speech, the Yale report situated the issue of free speech on campus within the context of an increasingly inclusive university and the changing demographics of society at large. While Yale bemoaned the occasional “paranoid intolerance” of student protesters, the university also criticized the “arrogant insensitivity” of free speech advocates who failed to acknowledge that requiring of someone in public debate to defend their human worth conflicts with the community's obligation to assure all of its members equal access to public speech.
It is perhaps telling that in the 1980s and '90s, while I was also a doctoral student there, Yale ultimately became the hotbed of philosophical thinking that acknowledged the claims of people who had not been granted full participation in public discourse. Their accounts, previously dismissed as “unspeakable” or “unimaginable,” now gained legitimacy in redefining the rules of what counts as public speech. Lyotard taught at Yale in early 1990s, and their and others' thoughts on how to resolve the asymmetry in discussions between perpetrators and victims of systemic or personal violence, without curtailing speech too much, seeped into other disciplines.
Lyotard and others were interested in expanding the frames of discourse, as they had been before, when married women were granted full legal status after centuries of having their very being legally suspended upon marriage.
When Yale issued its guidelines about free speech, it did so to account for a new reality, in the early 1970s, when increasing numbers of minority students and women enrolled at elite college campuses. We live in a new reality as well. We should recognize that the current generation of students, roundly ridiculed by an unholy alliance of so-called alt-right demagogues and campus liberals as coddled snowflakes, realized something important about this country before the pundits and professors figured it out.
What is under severe attack, in the name of an absolute notion of free speech, are the rights, both legal and cultural, of minorities to participate in public discourse. The snowflakes sensed, a good year before the election of President Trump, that insults and direct threats could once again become sanctioned by the most powerful office in the land. They grasped that racial and sexual equality is not so deep in the DNA of the American public that even some of its legal safeguards could not be undone.
The issues to which the students are so sensitive might be benign when they occur within the ivory tower. Coming from the campaign trail and now the White House, the threats are not meant to merely offend. Like President Trump's attacks on the liberal media as the “enemies of the American people,” their insults are meant to discredit and delegitimize whole groups as less worthy of participation in the public exchange of ideas.

As a college professor and university administrator with over two decades of direct experience of campus politics, I am not overly worried that even the shrillest heckler's vetoes will end free speech in America. As a scholar of literature, history and politics, I am especially attuned to the next generation's demands to revise existing definitions of free speech to accommodate previously delegitimized experiences. Freedom of expression is not an unchanging absolute. When its proponents forget that it requires the vigilant and continuing examination of its parameters, and instead invoke a pure model of free speech that has never existed, the dangers to our democracy are clear and present.

We should thank the student protestors, the activists in Black Lives Matter and other “overly sensitive” souls for keeping watch over the soul of our republic.
The epic American movie The Mysterious Island, loosely based on the French writer Jules Verne's adventurous novel, was released in 1929. The Technicolor film starred, among others, the Oscar-winning actor Lionel Barrymore. But it became a financial and critical disaster, according to the IMDb; one reviewer wrote it was uncomfortably poised between silence and sound, suffering the drawbacks of both eras while retaining the virtues of neither.
Film historians long believed no complete print of the film had survived – until experts in the US discovered that the movie had been preserved in the Czech National Archive. Deborah Stoiber from the George Eastman House film archive recently visited Prague to present a film from their own collection – and to examine the sole existing copy of The Mysterious Island.
“I decided to take advantage of my trip here to visit the archive and to take a look at this wonderful feature film, to see quality of the image and the quality of the print, and take that information with me to the US so that we can hopefully find funding to do full preservation on this material.”
Deborah Stoiber is in charge of the nitrate film collection at George Eastman House. The year 2015 will mark the 100th anniversary of Technicolor, a colour movie process, and research into Technicolor films has led the archivists to Prague.
“We are discovering there is a huge amount of information that has never been released to the public. We are working on a book on the history of Technicolor, and we have decided to focus our attentions on Technicolor films, and we are finding that archives around the world have so much of this material in very good conditions.”
After the First World War, American movies flooded European cinemas including those in the newly established Czechoslovakia. Many of them were eventually acquired by the archive – to the surprise of American film historians.
“This is a rare find. My colleague James Layton was doing research and contacted the Czech film archive, asking if they had any true-colour Technicolor movies. And they said, ‘Oh yes, we have this title', and it was a real surprise.
“The George Eastman House has only a small fragment of that film, maybe just a few seconds long, and it was the only known material. We believe another archive in Europe might have a small piece as well but nothing nearly as complete as what's here in Prague.”
The Czech National Film Archive boasts 150 million metres of film material; the Mysterious Island is one of around 500 silent US films preserved in its collection. The man in charge of movies made in English-speaking countries is historian Věroslav Hába.
“The import of American films after WWI was so massive that it's not surprising. These films were shown here and people were very interested in American films, so I think it's natural that some of the films have survived here.”
Mr Hába says the Czech collection of silent American movies is not unique as many movies of the era also survived in France, Germany, the Netherlands and even Australia and New Zealand. The film archive in Prague has been cooperating with US institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art, since the 1960s. In return, the archive received some rare Czech films which were shipped to Prague in the 1980s. And the cooperation has continued ever since.
“Not long ago, we were approached by people from Tucson, Arizona, where the locals were searching for films that were shot there. We are the only archive that has a print of Wild West Romance, a western starring Rex Belle. They wanted to screen it in their city, and we were able to help them, and offered them at least a DVD with the film.”
The way the films found their ways in the archive vaults is no less amazing: when Hollywood studios shipped their films to be shown to audiences oversees, they did not ask to get the prints back. After making a round of cinemas across Czechoslovakia, many of the prints were destroyed but some were acquired by people who collected Hollywood films already at the time. Věroslav Hába explains.
“As a rule, the prints were not sent back but were destroyed here. They were salvaged for silver and other materials. But there were collectors who often succeeded and got the films for their own private collections, and they screened these films illegally. So that's one of the ways the films survived here.”
The Czech National Film Archive marks its 70th anniversary this year; it was founded at the height of the Second World War by Czech film enthusiasts who were trying to preserve this part of the nation's cultural heritage from wartime destruction.
After the war, the film industry was nationalised, outlawing the very ownership of film prints by individuals and private companies. That was an important source of films for the archive
“Everybody was required to hand the films over to the authorities although some people refused. But there was another source – groups or associations that wanted to safeguard American and other films before or at the start of the Second World War. The Nazis also wanted to get hold of everything and send it to Germany.”
Some of the films now featured in the Czech archive also came from private collectors who refused to give up their treasures, or their heirs.
“For instance, there was a big collection that belonged to a travelling projectionist, a certain Mr Bouda. We received 1,600 films rare and precious from him.

We got many Tom Mix films from them which did not survive in other parts of the world.”
The US film experts now hope that in cooperation with the Czech National Film Archive, they will be able to restore the only surviving print of The Mysterious Island, and eventually show it to audiences in the United States and elsewhere.
OTTAWA (The News Desk) — Green Party MP Elizabeth May was tricked by their colleagues into thinking that today's session of Parliament would be held in a nearby park.
May sat in Ottawa's Major's Hill Park for nearly three hours before realizing that their colleagues had lied to them about the meeting.
“I was really excited that we were finally getting out of that musty, stuffy old building and out here into nature, where we belong,” said May while folding up their papers and putting away the lunch they had packed for herself.
“It looks like it was all too good to be true.”
Several Conservative MPs were seen hiding and snickering behind a tree while May sighed and packed them things.
“We got their real good,” chuckled MP Paul Calandra while their colleagues ran away. ♦

Police fail to record one in five of all crimes reported to them, says report

More than 800,000 - or one in five - of all crimes reported to the police each year are not being recorded by officers, a report suggests.
The problem is greatest for victims of violent crime, with a third going unrecorded. Of sexual offences, 26% are not recorded.
An HM Inspectorate of Constabulary report looked at more than 8,000 reports of crime in England and Wales.
The watchdog said the failure to record crime properly was "indefensible".
Home Secretary Theresa May described the findings as "utterly unacceptable", but police representatives said the situation had improved since the study.
The Association of Chief Police Officers said workload pressures, target culture and inadequate supervision all contributed to under-recording.
An unrecorded crime is classed as one that is reported to the police but not recorded as an offence. It means an investigation into the alleged crime is unlikely to happen.
'Serious concern'
The audit reviewed reports of crime between November 2012 and October 2013 across all 43 forces in England and Wales.
It found that:
Among the sample, 37 rape allegations were not recorded as a crime
For 3,842 reported crimes, offenders were given a caution or a penalty notice - but inspectors believe 500 of those should have been charged or given a heavier penalty
3,246 of those offences that were recorded were then deemed to be "no crimes" - but inspectors believe 20% of those decisions were wrong and a crime had been committed
The incidents recorded as "no-crimes" included 200 reports of rape and 250 of violent crime
More than 800 of the victims were not told of the decision to "no-crime" their report
Analysis
by Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent
The under-recording of crime is more than a question of getting the statistics wrong.
If an offence isn't officially logged, it may not be investigated. And without a police inquiry there's no hope of finding the perpetrator and preventing other crimes.
Inspectors say there may well be people on the streets now, able to commit more crimes, who would have been locked up had their original offence been properly dealt with.
There are indications that some forces are improving. But there's also a warning in the report that increasing workload pressures among police - who are having to do more with considerably less - will "sharpen" the incentive not to record crimes.
Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor told the BBC that the under-recording of sexual offences was of particular concern and more sex crimes would be reported if victims felt they could trust the police.
"The police need to institutionalise a culture of believing the victim. Every time," they said.
"Now in some cases it may turn out that a crime hasn't been committed, in which case the figures can be changed later.
"But the crime needs to go on the books straight away so that the crime is properly investigated in every case and the victim receives the services which they or they should have."
Jeff Gardner, from Victim Support, told the BBC: "The police absolutely need trust of the public because if they don't have it, there's no communication and police can't police properly."
Police are obliged to inform victims about their decisions but the report found this was not always the case.
Victims may have been under the impression that their crimes were being investigated when they were not, the report said.
'Wheelie bins'
The report looked at every police force in England and Wales and drew national-level statistics from its sample. But it acknowledged there were large regional differences and some forces were very good at crime recording.
West Midlands Police and Lincolnshire Police had an almost perfect record, while Dyfed Powys Police and West Yorkshire were among the worst-performing forces.
West Midlands was a top-performing force when it came to crime recording
Chief Constable Jeff Farrar, lead for crime recording at the Association of Chief Police Officers, told the BBC that forces were not following the rules in the same way.
"As soon as an incident is reported, it is recorded. There's an incident on every police force's system," they said.
"Some forces are immediately recording that as a crime without any investigation; some forces are going perhaps too far in the investigation.
"But the rules do say we need to be satisfied that a crime has been committed."
They said some cases, such as a serious sexual offence, should "absolutely be recorded" but there were some occasions were the public would expect officers to ask a few more questions before recording a crime.
Providing one example from their own Gwent force, they said: "We had in one month an increase of 300 wheelie bin thefts.
"When we looked at that in a bit more detail, because we had recorded them, it would appear if you reported that as a theft you got a new wheelie bin for free from the local authority but if it was damaged, they charged you £80."
'Urgent changes'
The report said relatively little firm evidence had been found of undue pressure being put on officers to manipulate figures.
But in an online survey, some officers and staff did say performance and other pressures were distorting their crime-recording decisions.

The HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) report recommended that standard training established by the College of Policing be provided by each force.
Mrs May said there had been "utterly unacceptable failings" in the way police forces have recorded crime but procedures were improving.
"It is never acceptable for the police to mis-record crime. Failing to do so not only lets down victims, but the wider public who expect to be able to trust the integrity of police recorded crime," they said.
Shadow policing minister Jack Dromey said it was time for Mrs May to "get a grip on this and make urgent changes to the way the police record crime".
Ch Supt Irene Curtis, president of the Police Superintendents' Association, said recorded crime was a measure of demand on police resources rather than police performance.
"HMIC's report covers a period of at least 12 months ago and recognises that considerable improvements have already been made since that period," they said.
Earlier this year an interim report by Mr Winsor, covering 13 forces, made a similar conclusion that a fifth of crimes could be going unrecorded by police.
Last month, official figures showed the number of rapes reported to and recorded by police in England and Wales was at its highest ever level.
The Office for National Statistics said there were 22,116 recorded rapes in the year to June, a rise of 29% on the year before.
Separate statistics from the Crime Survey for England and Wales showed overall crime fell by 16% to 7.1 million cases.
The key to's endurance in our collective consciousness could be traced to its formula—the masked silent killer who stalks and kills (sometimes likable) young people. It's really so basic and user friendly that it's been re-dressed and re-packaged as “new” a million times over. Just between theseries and the various knockoffs like, we've seen this exploited every which way but loose, and even then, there's enough sex going on in these films for that term to apply as well.
So what is it about Halloween? It really is something intangible, just like the abstract of evil itself. It just plain works, striking a chord deep within us that resonates, and it keeps working no matter how many times we've seen this formula played out in other forms. There's something to be said about doing something first, but even more to be said about doing something right

The title alone of Jessica Valenti's Sex Object: A Memoir invites backlash. Even without the context of Valenti's career as a feminist writer, it's a bold statement, almost deliberately soliciting the dig that will follow: So, you think you're sexy? They do, actually, if inconsistently, but that's not the point. By welcoming such a reaction, Valenti urges us to get back to probing the foundational issue of objectification. In other words, if you think Valenti calling themselves an “object” is a compliment, well, you just don't get it. Ad Policy
Published earlier this month by Dey Street, Sex Object, Valenti's fifth book, aims to chip away at the irreverence and denial that mainstream feminism often uses to soften the blow of objectification. Valenti is the founder of Feministing.com, a former Nation columnist, and a current staff writer at The Guardian. In each of these roles they have tackled subjects at the intersection of feminism, politics, and culture—high-profile rape cases, legislation aimed at curbing reproductive rights, sexism in the media and in everyday life. But in Sex Object Valenti looks inward, exposing a troubling paradox that accompanies such work: Can intellectual awareness of the impact of objectification undo its effects? Or, as Valenti asks, “Who would I be if I didn't live in a world that hated women?”
Valenti aims to unravel that question by treating themselves as a case study. The memoir is a collection of essays, and each essay is grounded in a major life experience presented straightforwardly and without further examination. Outside of the introduction, Sex Object is less analysis than raw material. It's as if she's approached their own life like a scientist compiling empirical evidence of sexism. They write about the man they saw masturbate on a subway platform, the teacher who asked them out after graduation, the time Politico published an article about their breasts. The finished product is not so much commentary as it is deconstruction. By taking on this methodology, Valenti is asking us to return to a place of simplicity in our personal feminisms. Enough of the snark. Sexism hurts women, and performative strength won't change that.
“The feminism that's popular right now is largely grounded in using optimism and humor to undo the damage that sexism has wrought,” they write, invoking the work of Amy Schumer, Beyoncé, and Sheryl Sandberg. “But maybe we're doing ourselves a disservice by working so hard to move past what sexism has done to us rather than observe it for a while.”
Sex Object engages in observation as a means of setting an example. These are field notes from building a feminist perspective, a worldview that forms in response to sexism and misogyny, yet is also inevitably warped by those forces. While some of the experiences Valenti recounts will be (sadly) familiar to many women, they create something incredibly readable by presenting each story in detail and as unanalytically as possible. The facts of the night they were date raped, for example, are relayed without much commentary. As is the decision to avoid identifying their violation with its proper label.
“I have never called this assault. I'm not really sure why,” Valenti writes, in the chapter called simply “Grilled Cheese.” “As a feminist writer I've encouraged others to name the thing that happened to them so our stories can be laid bare.”
“I know that if any young woman told me this same story I would not hesitate to call it what it is,” they add later. “I don't know why I don't allow myself the same courtesy.”
This admission is one of several instances in which Valenti is open about doubting whether they are a good feminist. In other instances, they question whether they are a good person, even revealing a glimpse of suicidal thoughts in a moment in which swimming grew too difficult. They also use a lot of space anticipating criticism or just potential corrections to their word choices, with lines like, “I know it's called the cycle of violence, but in my family female suffering is linear.” In moments like these, Valenti showcases a secureness in their insecurities, a sense of strength in admitting that simply being a woman has hurt their sense of self in ways from which they will likely never recover. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS
One particularly itchy chapter titled “D” tells the story of a time a close family friend attempted to kickstart an affair. Valenti is able to identify so-called D's reckless selfishness in this request, though it doesn't make them any less ashamed. “I can't escape the feeling that men see that I am the kind of person for whom doing the right thing does not come easily,” they write. “And I cannot believe that so long after I first experienced a man making it clear that their desires trump my comfort, I still accept it.” The emotional torture they inflict on themselves is upsetting, in large part, because it's clear they know exactly what she's doing, and remains powerless to stop it.
For Valenti, resistance is futile, though that doesn't make awareness any less necessary. Being a woman means “that it's not a matter of if something happens, but when and how bad.” Men rape and kill women. There's nothing to argue there, but we forget the ways in which living in a world colored by misogyny shifts the smaller intricacies of who we tell ourselves we are. “Victimhood doesn't need to be an identity,” they write, “but it is a product of facts.” And, two pages later, “Pretending these offenses roll off our backs is strategic—don't give them the fucking satisfaction—but it isn't the truth. You lose something along the way.”
What Valenti espouses in refusing to “pretend” is a sort of informed pessimism.  They are actively aware of the ways sexism has shaped their sense of self. But having a name for an incurable disease doesn't lessen the symptoms. Valenti delivers their own diagnosis without much cushioning. They want to take us back to a place of telling stories, while actively refusing to bear the burden of bearability.
So often, as they describe it, “You perform your strength, your sense of humor, your personality so that it is palatable, easily consumed in small, bite-sized pieces.” That's what she's refusing to do here. What emerges is an act of mourning for person they might have been if this world didn't hate women. There's not so much a solution as a matter-of-fact condemnation of the way things are, because, frankly, there isn't anything even remotely resembling a happy ending yet. Men will continue to rape, kill, and otherwise objectify women, people will question whether Valenti “deserves” to be called a sex object. (In fact, the right-wing Independent Women's Forum already called an excerpt from the book a “humblebrag.”)
Valenti didn't write this memoir in defiance of that pre-fab response. Instead, they take on a quivering vulnerability which is possibly their most powerful strategy to date. Sex Object ultimately functions as a painful yet compelling call to thoughtfulness, to embrace the unfiltered experience of oppression. It's as if Valenti has paused their life's work attempting to eradicate sexism, opting instead to suggest that we please at least stop pretending we don't care it exists.

Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry (Photo11: Handout art)
PHOENIX — A suspect in the 2010 murder of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry has been arrested in Mexico, The Arizona Republic has confirmed.
Heraclio "Laco" Osorio-Arellanes, 38, was caught Wednesday as part of a U.S.-Mexico operation "at a ranch on the border of the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Chihuahua," Fox News reported in a story attributed to unnamed "senior law enforcement, Border Patrol and congressional sources" that it labeled "exclusive."
According to Fox News, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Border Patrol and the U.S. marshals participated in the task force that took Osorio-Arellanes, whom authorities believe shot and killed Terry, into custody.
"I can confirm that they were arrested today (Wednesday) at a ranch in Mexico," David Gonzales, U.S. marshal for the District of Arizona, told The Arizona Republic. "The extradition process kicks into effect now, and we'll be coordinating with the Mexican government to have them extradited to the U.S. as soon as possible."
The FBI has been offering a $250,000 reward for information that led to Osorio-Arellanes' location and arrest.
Russ Baer, a national DEA spokesperson, told The Republic that the agency had no comment. A Border Patrol spokesperson did not respond to a Republic request for comment.
Robert Heyer, Terry's cousin and chairperson of the Brian Terry Foundation, said through a spokesperson that the Terry family is not commenting due to the sensitivity of the ongoing investigation.
Terry, 40, was killed in a nighttime gunbattle on Dec. 14, 2010, in a remote canyon near Rio Rico — about 10 miles north of the U.S.-Mexican border in Santa Cruz Country — with what then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano called a "rip crew."
Rip crews generally target drug smugglers and undocumented immigrants.
Terry's death touched off a major political controversy after it was revealed that two guns recovered after the Arizona shootout were linked to "Operation Fast and Furious," a botched Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives gun-trafficking probe that lost track of hundreds of weapons.
The so-called "gun-walking" scandal resulted in the 2011 resignation of U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives in 2012 voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress over a dispute concerning "Fast and Furious"-related documents. A spokesperson for President Barack Obama at the time characterized the House action as "a transparently political stunt."

By Global Public Square staff
Watching countries from around the world grow and prosper, we tend to assume that global poverty is falling. And in fact, the World Bank says that in 1981 nearly half of the world's citizens were impoverished, that is, they lived on less than $1.25 a day. And today, less than a fifth of the world's population lives in poverty. In raw numbers, that translates to a 40 percent drop from about 2 billion to 1.2 billion people.
But when we dig deeper, it's clear the picture is more murky. Put simply, most of the reduction in global poverty has to do with one country – China. Take it out of the equation and the numbers look very different.
Let's go back to 1981. Back then, China accounted for 43 percent of the world's poor. The other major contributors were South Asia, with 29 percent, and sub-Saharan Africa, with 11 percent. Fast forward just a decade, and you'll see that China's share of the world's poor began to drop. The trend continues through the 2000s. By 2010, China accounted for only 13 percent of the world's impoverished population. South Asia's share had jumped to 42 percent, while sub-Saharan Africa's share tripled, to 34 percent.
The World Bank data shows that the total number of impoverished Chinese declined by nearly 680 million people in the last three decades. That's about 95 percent of the total global decline. By registering double digit growth for three decades, Beijing has transformed the fortunes of a poor nation within a generation. That's amazing, but it tells you that in the rest of the world, progress has been much, much slower – if there's been progress at all.
There's a lesson here for other developing countries.
Take India, for example. New Delhi has also made strides against poverty. The problem is, those strides have only been a few steps ahead of population growth. Look at the numbers. In 1981, 429 million Indians lived in poverty – about 60 percent of the population. By 2010, the percentage of impoverished people had dropped to 33 percent. And yet the total number of Indians living in poverty was still around 400 million. Why? You see, India's population had expanded by about half a billion. For all the millions who were lifted out of poverty, millions of others were born into it.
More from GPS: Why Africa still needs aid
What's the answer? Growth. In the 1960s and 70s India was infamously stuck in a rut of slow growth, a mediocre 2 percent a year often. Then, in the 1980s, it began opening up, and in the 1990s New Delhi scrapped much of the old socialist set of controls. By the mid-2000s, India was growing at around 9 percent. That growth helped create India's middle class, and dramatically reduced the number of people living in poverty. But according to the pro-free-market Cato Institute, if those reforms had taken place two decades earlier, India would today have fewer impoverished people: 175 million fewer. That's why India's recent drop in economic growth is alarming – those most affected will be the poor.
Africa is also changing, but for its poorest, change is still too slow. Since 1981, poverty rates have been dropping steadily in both the developing world, and the world as a whole. But in sub-Saharan Africa poverty rates actually got slightly worse in the 1980s and 90s. It has only recently begun to turn the corner, again, thanks in large part to faster economic growth.
Global poverty is falling. But China deserves most of the credit. And thanks to the Communist Party of China, we now know that the path to poverty alleviation is…capitalist-led growth.
The continuing Ukrainian crisis has cast a specter over Europe: a natural gas cutoff. Russia supplies 30 percent of Europe's natural gas. In any tit-for-tat exchange of sanctions, this seems the ultimate weapon, dwarfing almost anything Europe and the United States could deploy.
It evokes images of shivering people and shuttered factories. Knowing this, the West will limit sanctions for fear of provoking Russia. Game over. Vladimir Putin wins again.
Maybe not.
On closer inspection, Russia's doomsday weapon involves much bluff. If used, it would probably do less damage than imagined, while also imposing long-term costs on Russia. In a study, the consultancy IHS CERA doubted that “any [gas] disruption to Europe is likely.”
This skepticism is well-founded. Russia may squeeze Ukraine by raising natural gas prices, but the scarier notion that Europe is held hostage by its need for Russian gas is a huge exaggeration.
Start with natural gas's place in Europe's overall energy mix. The 30 percent Russian share of gas use sounds impressive, but natural gas represented only 22 percent of Europe's total energy consumption in 2013, says Matthew Sagers of IHS CERA. Do the arithmetic: 30 percent of 22 percent is a little less than 7 percent. That's the share of Russian natural gas in Europe's total energy consumption.
It isn't enough to shut down Europe's economy or impose universal suffering, even if none of it could be replaced.
Some of it could, almost certainly, be replaced. In 2013, Europe used 421 billion cubic meters (BCM) of natural gas; about one-fifth of this, or 101 BCM, went for electricity generation, says Sagers.
“There's quite a bit of flexibility in the system,” they argue. Facing a cutoff, power companies could “switch from a plant that's fired with gas to an existing one that's fired by coal.” This would save scarce gas supplies for homes and factories, about 70 percent of consumption.
Europe's other big buffer against a shutoff is storage: gas that has already arrived and been pumped into underground tanks. Some could be released to ease shortages. Pipelines have been re-engineered to permit the reversal of flows to send gas to where it's most needed. Since 2005, storage has increased about one-fifth to 94 BCM, and another 12 BCM is scheduled to come online in the next two years, according to Alun Davies of IHS CERA.
And Europe's present storage is relatively high. “An unusually mild winter in 2013 … contributed to higher levels of natural gas storage in Europe (natural gas storage levels were 46 percent full as of March 13, compared to 23 percent full in the United States),” reports the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Some increase in Europe's liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports, which dropped almost 50 percent from 2011 to 2013, could also replenish storage, though Europeans would probably have to pay higher prices to attract added LNG supplies. Spot market LNG prices in Asia, where demand is strong, are as much as two-thirds higher than in Europe, says Sagers.
None of this means that a shutoff wouldn't impose hardship. The Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and some Balkan nations, including Bulgaria, are totally dependent on Russia for gas. They could not be easily resupplied by alternate routes, says IHS CERA.
France, Germany and other major countries would be much less affected.
But Russia would also face sizable costs if it ended all gas exports or even those going through Ukraine, about half its supply to Europe. The foreign exchange that Russia earns from gas exports, about one-eighth of its total exports, would take a significant hit. And Europe would doubtlessly accelerate efforts to reduce its dependence on Russian energy.
It's said that American LNG exports could rescue Europe. This is unrealistic; LNG plants (seven have been approved for export) cost billions and take years to complete. When done, much of the LNG may go to Asia, though Europe would benefit from increased overall supplies.
The message here is simpler: The dangers of a cutoff should not intimidate the West. They're overrated.

Obama and Cheney, Making Connections
Vice President Cheney is related to Sen. Barack Obama.
At least that was the stunning announcement made yesterday by Lynne Cheney, who said that the very white vice president from Wyoming is in fact the eighth cousin of Obama, the Senate's only African American member. They said they discovered the link, traced back to a Huguenot who figured prominently in Maryland history, while researching their latest book.
"This is such an amazing story," Cheney said in an interview on MSNBC, "that one ancestor, a man that came to Maryland, could be responsible down the family line for lives that have taken such different and varied paths as Dick's and Barack Obama's." Cristina Allegretti, Lynne Cheney's research and project manager at the American Enterprise Institute, said the vice president's wife did an exhaustive genealogical search of their family while working on "Blue Skies, No Fences." Them research led them to an early Cheney settler named Richard Cheney, whose granddaughter married Samuel Duvall, whose mother, Mareen Duvall, is distantly related to Obama. Lynne Cheney read a story that said Obama wa s related to Mareen Duvall, and realized the link.
Obama, whose mother was white, did not immediately comment on the revelation. But their campaign made light of the tie, without confirming it. "Obviously, Dick Cheney is the black sheep of the family," Obama spokesperson Bill Burton said.

THIS TINY BABY gorilla was born at Dublin Zoo at the weekend – and its mum is keeping it so near to them that the zoo has no idea whether it's a boy or a girl.
The baby western lowland gorilla was born to mum Lena in the early hours of Saturday morning, weighing approximately 1.8kgs.
This is the seventh baby for Lena, who was born in 1984. The baby's father was silverback Harry who passed away in May.
Source: Patrick Bolger
Helen Clarke-Bennett, leader of the animal care team responsible for the gorillas said,
We are absolutely thrilled with the birth of the baby gorilla. The youngster is doing very well and is very bright and alert. Within minutes the baby was feeding from mum Lena which is a very good sign.
Lena is a great mother and so far they haven't let go of their newborn. They will continue to cradle the baby in their arms non-stop for the next two to three months. When they do eventually let the toddler out of their arms to explore, the youngster won't go far because Lena will not allow the baby go more than an arm's length away.
They added that it has been a sad time for the team after Harry's death, but the newborn's birth has put a smile on everyone's face.
Big brother Kituba is taking a keen interest in the new arrival and the rest of the troop has reacted very well. The new arrival is a great success for Dublin Zoo as part of the European breeding programme for these critically endangered primates.
Source: Patrick Bolger
Western lowland gorillas are classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) red list of threatened species.
Due to threats including commercial hunting and the Ebola virus, the numbers of these primates living in the wild is expected to fall by over 80% between 1980 and 2046.

Hello... Over a year ago I disclosed several vulnerabilities in Servision HVG network video recording devices. CVE-2015-0929 and CVE-2015-0930. https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/522460 Since it's been a while now, and hardcoded backdoor passwords in "security" devices are the current hotness... Hardcoded Backdoor Password: A hardcoded backdoor password has been discovered in SerVision HVG firmware below version 2.2.26a100. An unauthenticated user may visit the servision Web GUI Login (http://<Servision_IP>:port/) and utilize the password "Bantham" (without the quotes) with a blank username (or any username) to log into the Web GUI with "admin" like rights. This user account can then perform actions such as deleting all of the recorded video or making a settings change that would essentially tell the device to wait up to 11 days after startup to turn on the network interface (effective DoS for video recording), additionally you can view the user list and their passwords in cleartext (view source on the user list page.) How it was discovered: The firmware tvx file was viewed via a hex editor and all hex characters were converted to ASCII. All 5-10 character ASCII strings from the firmware file were pulled out and used in a password brute force attack against the usernames “Administrator, Admin, and root” on the servision test device. This password worked on all three accounts, even though the “admin” account had a different password set and the other two users did not even exist on the device. I attempted to login with this password and a blank username and that also allowed access into the device. How to find servisions on the internet: Default http Port = 10000 or 9988 The "Server:" header in an HTTP GET response from the device will have a value similar to the below examples.

Mithril & Mages is a playground -- one with awesome toys. I write utilities -- things that allow others to be awesome. I call them inspiration generators. So many people get stuck on an idea and need a name, a pile of treasure or a monster to move them forward. This is my attempt to make that happen.
Random results are not an end-point. They are the end of a pier -- a place where you can untie from the dock and begin a journey. No matter if you are after a name or a pile of treasure, many unanswered questions remain. Who is this person? What befell the creature who left this treasure or are they still alive? Why does this set of monsters still retain control of this land?

Harris County civil court Judge Mike Miller ruled on July 27 that holders of Texas's concealed-handgun license, or CHL, can band together in a class-action lawsuit against Texas Law Shield, a legal firm that's ensconced itself deeply in the state's gun-owning community — possibly in violation of the law, according to Texas Lawyer.
For a flat annual fee, Texas Law Shield says it will defend members against any civil or criminal charges that arise from their use of a gun. But now TLS itself stands accused of “barratry” — an archaic term that covers a host of legal abuses, from ambulance-chasing to excessive litigation to paying to receive clients.
It's that last proviso that has TLS in hot water: A 2013 lawsuit by two Texas gun owners alleges that “most concealed handgun license (CHL) classes in Texas include a ‘pitch' by a salesperson for Texas Law Shield, who encourages students to sign on to Texas Law Shield at a cost of about $130 a year for ‘peace of mind.'” In return, the suit alleges, TLS pays about 500 facilities that offer CHL courses — a prerequisite for anyone seeking a carry permit in Texas — $30 for each of their students that sign up for the company's legal service. (The plaintiffs' attorneys sought to make their suit a class action, inviting other CHL students who'd been solicited by TLS to join and receive compensatory damages from the company — whether they'd signed up for TLS's services or not. Judge Miller approved that plan.)
TLS charges its members $131.40 a year if they have a concealed-carry license, and $89 a year if they don't. But what members actually get in return — and who they're getting it from — has aroused plenty of curiosity and skepticism among gun owners.
What exactly is TLS? It was founded in 2009 by a group of Houston lawyers after a public uproar over the case of Joe Horn, a 61-year-old Pasadena, Texas, man who fatally shot two Afro-Latino burglars, possibly in the back, outside their neighbor's house after 911 dispatchers had told them not to interfere. A grand jury cleared Horn of any charges, but mounting a defense left Horn penniless and made their case a cause célèbre among Lone Star gun enthusiasts, who feared their use of deadly force could land them in court.
That left an opening for TLS to offer legal protection for uneasy gun owners. The company's site claims that it's not a law firm, but a “legal services provider.” Still, the company does employ six of its own lawyers to represent Houston-area members. The result is plenty of confusion even among well-informed gun owners as to what membership entails. Many who ask about TLS on Internet gun forums assume it's insurance for those charged with a crime or sued in civil court; the NRA offers such an insurance policy that reimburses users for certain court expenses. But TLS refers its members directly to attorneys who handle their legal problems, purportedly at no extra cost. (A TLS spokesperson was not available for comment.)
“It is not a prepaid legal service, it is truly a retainer for a lawyer,” claimed Brian Mobley, a concealed-carry trainer in Texas who invites TLS to “discuss part of the Texas penal code in my CHL classes.” That distinction is important to many would-be members, as “prepaid legal services” have often been accused of bait-and-switch style scams, racking up fees for users.
But Charles Cotton — the controversial NRA board member and Texas attorney who helps run Texas CHL Forum, the comment board that Mobley commented on — insisted Mobley was mistaken. “Why do you say it's not prepaid legal?” Cotton asked. “It is my understanding that the fee paid to Texas Law Shield is a flat fee annually. It's not a retainer unless it's a deposit against future billings.” Cotton added that they aren't telling readers whether or not to buy TLS's coverage, “but if people are going to pitch these programs here on TexasCHLforum, I want to make sure our Members are thoroughly informed.”
TLS's “testimonials” page contains no firsthand accounts of the company lining up a legal defense for its members. It includes four generic “incident reports” claiming TLS got members out of possible criminal charges, but the only direct quotes are from members who haven't needed legal help. “After seeing what my friend went through after shooting someone in self defense [I knew I needed] Law Shield, states Kathy M. of Willis, Texas, in a typical quote.
But do they need it? That's not entirely clear. Texas is one of many “stand your ground” states that offer civil immunity and a high threshold for criminal prosecution when self-defense is claimed. And the gamut of cases TLS covers is frustratingly narrow. “Our program covers the ‘use' of all legal firearms,” the company's FAQ states. What does that mean, exactly? TLS presents its hard-to-find contract terms to would-be members only after they start the application process, but it's full of ambiguous clauses and opt-outs for the company.
TLS defines coverage of the “use” of a firearm as:
Any incident where the Legal Service Contract Holder either discharges or displays a firearm for the purpose of using the firearm as a weapon to stop a threat, whether the Legal Service Contract Holder pulls the trigger and discharges the firearm or not. This term does not include taking the firearm to a location that is prohibited by federal, state, or local law, negligent or unintended discharges, or negligent or unintended displays.
That seems straightforward enough: “So if you're not using your firearm to stop a threat, you are not covered,” Mark Bennett, a criminal defense attorney based in Houston, writes on their legal blog. But that's a huge potential problem for members, they add: “Often in a gun case the central issue is whether you are using your firearm to stop a threat.” Imagine, for example, a licensed gun owner like George Zimmerman, who was charged with murder after shooting Trayvon Martin to death. Zimmerman claimed they were defending themselves against an assault from Martin, but the criminal charges against Zimmerman turned precisely on whether or not they were justified in perceiving a threat. So a TLS member could conceivably find themselves in a catch-22 where the charges against them — the very charges for which they hoped TLS would assist them with — exempt TLS from bankrolling a defense.
“If Texas Law Shield looks at the case … and concludes that you were not justified in using your weapon, they can deny coverage, leaving you to hire a lawyer.” Bennett writes. “Texas Law Shield looks to me like a sucker's bet.”
About the only thing that's clear is TLS's full-court press to snag paying members. The Texas CHL forum is packed with commenters who recalled receiving the company's high-pressure spiel in their licensing classes. “I was sitting next to a member of the Dallas SWAT team in my CHL class … and when the TLS came in and made their pitch they were very against it,” one commenter volunteered on a Texas Gun Talk forum. “He claimed that the way it was presented to us in class that TLS was ‘fear mongering' and taking advantage of people who may be less experienced with guns. (for the record their pitch made it seem like if you did not buy into their system you would be screwed if you ever used your weapon or if anyone ever found out you had a CHL and carried a weapon).”
Those tactics are precisely why TLS is in legal hot water. Texas approves 250,000 or so CHL holders to carry guns each year. If just a fraction of the ones who sat through TLS's in-class solicitations agree with the plaintiff's lawyer that the company used “an underhanded means to try to attract their business,” TLS could end up paying all those gun owners millions in penalties.
TLS has retained an outside law firm to defend itself against the pending class action. “The judge is simply wrong for a variety of reasons, and we are going to appeal it,” the company's attorney told Texas Lawyer.
It's nice to have that option: Under the terms of TLS's contract, the company doesn't have to cover any of its members' own appeals.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine troops on Tuesday killed a pro-Islamic State gunman in the southern city of Marawi, a military official said, eight days after the government declared the end of hostilities.
Soldiers have focused on securing Marawi against surviving militant fighters since ending five months of operations against Islamic State-inspired militants who seized control of parts of the city in May, in a bid to win a foothold in the region.
The conflict displaced about 350,000 residents and killed more than 1,100 people, mostly militants, stirring concern that the southern Philippines is becoming Islamic State's hub in Southeast Asia.
The military engaged in a gunfight with one of the suspected remaining gunmen in the main battle area, after foiling their bid to escape, army spokesperson Colonel Romeo Brawner said.
“We still have to put in troops, because there's a possibility for stragglers,” Brawner told a news conference in Marawi. “In the main battle area, there are many possible hiding spots.”
Indonesians, Malaysians and Middle Easterners were among the fighters who flocked to Marawi to support the Islamic State's emirate in Southeast Asia.
Thousands of Marawi residents have started returning home, only for some to find dwellings ransacked. Brawner said an army official and five more personnel were detained in barracks after being charged with looting.
The main battle area in downtown Marawi remains off limits, pending the removal of booby traps and unexploded ordnance.
• Dutch defender expected to have medical on Wednesday • Martins Indi departure could allow Eliaquim Mangala to rejoin Porto
Stoke are closing in on the signing of Bruno Martins Indi from FC Porto after agreeing a deal to take the Holland central-defender on a season-long loan.
Martins Indi, who moved to Portugal from Feyenoord for €7.7m, has been told they are free to leave the Estádio do Dragão this summer after Porto lined up Manchester City's Eliaquim Mangala as their replacement.

The 24-year-old has won 31 caps and was a regular in Louis van Gaal's side which reached the semi-final at the 2014 World Cup. It is understood that Martins Indi flew to England on Tuesday to discuss personal terms ahead of their move, with Liverpool and Everton both reported to have also shown an interest.
However, Stoke are now believed to have moved ahead, with the player expected at the club's training ground on Wednesday morning for a medical.
The Estonian-Georgian movie, "Tangerines" ("Mandariinid" in Estonian), has been nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film category for the 87th Academy Awards.
The film was shortlisted in December, being one of nine of the initial 83 canditates in its category. The shortlist of five nominees was selected by specially invited committees in New York, Los Angeles and London.
“Tangerines” has become one of the most successful film involving Estonian filmmakers, notching up tens of international awards since 2013. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for the best foreign language film.
The movie tells a story that takes place in 1992 during the war in Abkhazia in an Estonian village that was situated there. In the village, whose residents have fled from war, injured fighters from two opposite sides of the battle front happen to all be staying in the same house of an Estonian elder. The leading roles are played by Estonian actors Lembit Ulfsak and Elmo Nüganen, and Georgian actors Giorgi Nakhashidze and Mihhail Meskhi. The film was produced by an Estonian film producer Ivo Felt.
The film was produced by Estonian film production company Allfilm and Georgian production company Cinema 24.
The Oscars gala will be held on 22 February at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.
Prior to the Oscar nominations ceremony, Felt and the rest of the crew remained realistic in their hopes for an Oscar nomination. "The chances are slim, but they are there," they said.
Following the announcement, Felt told kultuur.err.ee that they are all very happy, but as ever, remained modest when asked about the chances of taking home the coveted golden statue. "Nonetheless, it is nice to be among such a strong company of films," they said.
The international success of "Tangerines" is unprecedented in Estonian cultural history.
The other nominees for the Best Foreign Language Film are:
12th episode of the third season of Star Trek: The Next Generation
"The High Ground" is the 12th episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, the 60th episode of the series overall.
In this episode, a crew member of the Federation Starfleet starship USS Enterprise-D is taken hostage by terrorists who hope Federation involvement will help them win concessions for their cause.
Plot [ edit ]
The crew of the Enterprise is sent on a mercy mission to deliver medical supplies to the war-torn non-affiliated planet Rutia IV, in the middle of a decades-long conflict with rebel separatists called the Ansata. The Enterprise crew cannot intervene in the conflict itself, internal to the planet, because to do so would violate the Prime Directive. While Chief Medical Officer Dr. Crusher, Commander Data, and Lieutenant Worf relax in a cafe, a bomb goes off in a public plaza, injuring many bystanders. Dr. Crusher attempts to tend to the wounded bodies against Captain Picard's suggestion to return to the ship, but their efforts are interrupted when they are abducted by a man using an unknown method of teleportation. After being denied the use of the Enterprise's superior firepower to seek and destroy the Ansata's base of operations, Alexana Devos, the head of Rutian security, orders severe interrogation of all known Ansata sympathizers, an act that the Enterprise crew find immoral. Without new information from Devos, the Enterprise crew investigate the teleportation technology and find that it is used to shift between dimensions, allowing the Ansata rebels to bypass even force fields. The investigative team, which includes Wesley, lets Picard know that they need to observe more of the teleportations to be able to pinpoint the location of the base.
At the Ansata base, Crusher learns their abductor is Kyril Finn, the leader of Ansata. Crusher refuses to eat or otherwise cooperate with Finn. After several hours, Finn lets Crusher out of their restraints and requests that they help treat their wounded. Crusher discovers that the "Inverters", the Ansata teleportation technology, cause irreversible damage to the user's DNA, and that many of Ansata's sick are due to excessive use of the Inverter. Finn admits that the Inverter is their only advantage against the Rutian government. After more hours pass, Finn believes that the Federation, by providing medical aid, is working with the Rutian government and launches an attack on the Enterprise, despite Crusher's requests to avoid harming their son. The Ansata manage to plant a bomb on the Enterprise warp engine. It is quickly transported into space by La Forge, but the distraction is enough to allow Finn to appear on the bridge and abduct Captain Picard. With Picard as their captive, Finn uses the Inverter to come to Counselor Troi on the Enterprise and demand the Federation become involved in mediating the dispute, returning to the planet before security can arrive. Picard, learning of Crusher's situation, tells them to continue to work on gaining Finn's confidence to hopefully end the dispute peacefully.
Data and Wesley are able to use Finn's appearance to locate the Ansata base, and Commander Riker and Devos assemble their forces. After they transport into the base, the combined forces are quickly able to quell the resistance. Finn, as a last resort, attempts to execute Picard, but Devos kills him. It is their conclusion that if Finn remained alive, their imprisonment would spark more resistance, while being killed in battle will only elevate them to martyr status and reduce the violence in the short-term. When a young Ansata member attempts to exact revenge on Picard, Crusher is able to convince them to drop their weapon, which Riker notes is a sign that there may be more fruitful discussions to resolve the issue in the future.
Censorship [ edit ]
In their study of terrorism, Data notes that Ireland was unified in 2024. As a result, this episode was not originally shown by the BBC in the United Kingdom for many years.[1] It was not broadcast in the Republic of Ireland by the Star Trek rights' holder, RTÉ, during the programme's run on that channel, though UK broadcasts were received there. Initial UK airings were edited when shown on satellite channel Sky One.[2] The episode was broadcast unedited in May 2006 on Sky One and finally shown unedited on BBC Two during the third season's repeats after midnight in September 2007.[3]

Two illegal-alien teenagers who were placed in ninth-grade classes at Montgomery County Schools, Maryland, have been arrested and charged with the brutal rape of a 14-year-old girl, and at least one of the boys had a pending deportation order from ICE.
The boys, identified as Henry Sanchez, 18, of Guatemala and Jose Montano, 17, of El Salvador, approached the young girl in the hallway near the gymnasium inside Rockville High School during school hours about 9 a.m. on Thursday.
Montano asked them for sex.
The girl refused — twice.
So the two boys forced them into the boys bathroom and then into a stall.
Montano pushed them into the corner of the stall and began kissing their neck, despite them repeatedly telling them to stop. They unzipped their top, forcibly removed their clothes and the two proceeded to rape them at the same time, then traded positions and raped them again.
They cried out in pain, the report says, but the assault continued. By the time it was over, they had raped them anally, orally and vaginally, according to the police report.
The victim reportedly knew Montano as a friend but did not know Sanchez.
Sanchez had a pending deportation order, which was not carried out while immigration activists tried to block the deportation.
“18-year-old criminals set to be deported should not be a first-year student in our public schools,” stated a post on the website of Help Save Maryland, an organization that opposes illegal immigration.
Maryland is perhaps the most welcoming state for illegal aliens and refugees in the Eastern United States, with Montgomery County the most welcoming county in the state. Maryland gives in-state tuition rates to illegal-alien college students, and its legislature is considering a bill that would declare Maryland the country's first sanctuary state. Montgomery County is already a sanctuary county, denying 63 ICE requests to turn over illegal-alien criminals last year, Fox News reported.
These policies helped create a culture that allows a young girl to be raped and sodomized in a bathroom stall by two illegal-alien boys, at least one of whom was ordered to be deported, border hawks told WND.
Watch local TV report on rape at Rockville High School:
When interviewed by police, Montano denied having any sexual contact with the victim. Rather, they said they went into the bathroom to “tell jokes.”
The two male students were arrested later that day at school. The school system put out the following statement without saying why two young men, ages 17 and 18, were placed in ninth grade, nor did it reveal the immigration status of the accused students:
“Ensuring a safe, secure and welcoming learning environment for all of our students is our top priority. Our staff remains vigilant in the monitoring of our school each and every day. Please remind your child that if they believe they are a victim of an assault or see something inappropriate, they should immediately tell a staff member.”
Forensic investigators said an inspection of the boys bathroom later turned up suspected blood “that may be mixed with male fluid,” the court documents stated.
Sanchez and Montano were living in the Aspen Hill neighborhood of Rockville, and they have been charged with first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree sexual offense. They were denied bond by a judge who said they were dangerous and a flight risk.
If convicted, they could get life in prison.
WUSA 9 confirmed that ICE had a detainer on Sanchez, a citizen of Guatemala, who had an outstanding deportation order for their arrest. Yet they continued to attend school in Maryland.
William Gheen, president of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC, said this is a rare case where the news of a rape of a student on school property managed to leak out into the local media.
“It's a miracle that anyone is even hearing about this case, because first the victim had to report the crime, and a lot of crimes like this do not get reported.
“Secondly, once it was reported, it had to make it out of a school system. And quite often, schools suppress the sharing of information like this.
“And then you have to get past the local media, which often strives to conceal the crime altogether, or to conceal the immigration status of the perpetrator.”
They said ALIPAC is calling for “every single government worker” that put 17- and 18-year-old illegal immigrants in classes with ninth-grade children to be terminated from their jobs.
He's also calling for full transparency concerning the perpetrators, who are both being tried as adults.
“We need to know if these particular illegal immigrants were beneficiaries of the Obama's and now Trump's DACA illegal amnesty program,” Gheen said.
‘People do what they feel they can get away with'
Hessie Harris, a spokesperson for Help Save Maryland, said the boys “obviously had no fear” of being deported while they were in school, even though at least one was subject to deportation, having been denied asylum by a judge. They said Rockville officials have recently discussed codifying their sanctuary city policies and a bill has been introduced in the Maryland Legislature that would make it a sanctuary state.
“I really feel these policies are responsible for this type of behavior. People do what they feel they can get away with, so why would these boys think they could get away with this?” they asked. “I'll tell you why. Because they are in Maryland and in a sanctuary city, and they don't fear any type of repercussions.
“It's horrible that a parent has got to fear sending their child to school. There are many other stories we're hearing about, including one of a family whose child was transferred out of a school in Maryland because their child was being bullied by an illegal alien and the school wouldn't do anything about it.”
They said most cases of rape and assault by violent illegal-alien students never see the light of day in Maryland schools. They believe it happens daily.
Gheen agreed.
Somehow all the hurdles mentioned above were cleared in the Rockville High School rape case.
But there's one final hurdle that remains.
“We still have the final boundary that we haven't broken yet, and that's the national media,” Gheen said. So far, you don't see CNN and the national media giving this story any play.
“From my years of experience, the Associated Press, Reuters, CNN, the New York Times will all bury this story,” Gheen said. “These kinds of stories reach their desk, and they either do not circulate them at all, or they sanitize the story to make it sound less important.
“This type of real news is systematically and consistently censored and suppressed, while fake news stories such as the Duke Lacrosse incident are emphasized,” they added, alluding to the Duke University case several years ago in which white, male lacrosse players were falsely accused of rape. “If the story meets their narrative that ‘white males are evil,' they run with it; but if the story shows that illegal immigration is harmful to Americans, they bury it.”
Gheen said the Maryland story is “very detrimental” to the efforts of all the Democrats and some Republicans – such as John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham – who want to give immigration reform/amnesty to illegal immigrants.
While the pro-immigrant activists continue to focus on emotional stories of “families being separated,” they give no attention to the families of victims like the 14-year-old girl who will now endure a lifetime of psychological torture, Gheen said.
“These young men obviously had no fear of law enforcement,” Gheen added. “They come from lands where there is no law enforcement. And they show they can come here and break laws with impunity, so why should they fear any boundaries, be they national or sexual boundaries?
“We hope that this unfortunate case will inspire President Donald Trump to honor their broken campaign promise to end DACA amnesty on their first day in office.
“The description of what happened to that little girl is off the scales of what anyone, let alone a child, should ever have to endure,” Gheen said.
“And Americans need to realize that, in this environment, it could have been anyone's daughter in that bathroom stall,” they added. “The elites have flooded America with people who are dangerous to our future and our existence, and the number of victims out there are beyond what anyone would want to imagine.”
Harris, of Help Save Maryland, said Americans should be looking to Europe as the model of where things are headed.
“And one of the frightening things here is, if we look at Europe and see what's happening there, if we don't take action, rape could become the new normal here as it is becoming in Germany and Sweden,” they said. “In Germany, the rapes aren't being reported. The police, in many cases, are giving up. That's what it has deteriorated to. It's finally come to the fore. Finally, they can't hide it anymore, can't deny that it is happening.”
Harris said Maryland residents recently received a tax increase to provide for underfunded school budgets, and they believe an influx of illegal aliens is the primary driver.
At least 51 percent of Montgomery County students are recent immigrants, according to Fox News, and the numbers could be even higher in the lower grades, kindergarten through fourth grade. The school system has at least 19 foreign languages spoken by the student body.
“And so we're paying for people who shouldn't even be here. Budgets are full of all kinds of special programs we are funding for those students,” Harris said. “Maryland schools were once top tier. Now they're going down. Some of these children coming into these schools, some have never been in a school and speak dialects for which you can't even fine teachers. So we're paying all kinds of extra money for these specialized programs. Why?
“We hear all these emotional stories about these are such vulnerable people and families being divided,” they added. “But what about the vulnerability of their victims? They're vulnerable, they're here illegally and they knew when they came here that was a policy of the previous administration, and they came here relying on lax enforcement. So when you break the law, there are consequences. When they crossed that border, they knew they could possibly be deported. And if they are deported, they can take their children with them.”
The Rockville High School attack follows a series of recent sexual assaults and rapes committed by illegal aliens against minors nationwide.
Earlier this month, 19-year-old Guatemalan Douglas Hus-Flores was arrested in Connecticut for sexually assaulting a 3-year-old girl, and 29-year-old Jorge Zapata-Rosas was arrested in Texas three weeks after raping a 7-year-old girl.
A Baltimore City Councilman wants to put advertisements on the city's fleet of fire trucks in order to ease their massive debt. Self-aggrandizing alternative ad agency People For The Ethical Treatment Of Animals (PETA) wants to help by buying the first round of ads. Of course, since it's PETA, there's a mostly undressed girl involved.
It all started with City Councilman Pete Welch saying that they could make a decent amount of scratch if they sold advertisements on the sides of emergency vehicles, although probably not the full $48 million shortfall.
Welch said that "These are out-of-the-box times and you need out-of-the-box approaches in order to create additional revenue."
As soon as PETA recognized an opportunity to insert themselves into the news cycle they dashed off a press release offering to buy the first ads and make the sides of fire trucks look like the inside of fire houses:
In light of the recent bill you proposed that would allow advertisements to be placed on the city's fire engines to ease financial trouble, we would like to be the first to offer you a revenue-raising ad that will get hearts racing while preventing heart attacks. Our "Vegans Are Hot! Free Smokin'-Hot Recipes: PETA.org" advertisement, featuring a sexy woman showing off their vegan physique, will drive Baltimore residents to PETA's heart-healthy vegan recipes that will keep them firing on all cylinders.

This can be translated into "I don't know if we help animals anymore, but here are some more boobs and some free publicity for us for doing almost nothing since even Baltimore isn't even desperate enough to let us do this."
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pope Francis has described abortion as an "agonising and painful decision"
Pope Francis is making it easier for women and doctors to seek forgiveness for abortion, by allowing all priests to forgive it.
In Catholicism, abortion is viewed as such a grave sin that it can punish with excommunication.
In most countries, only a bishop can approve forgiveness for abortion. They would then delegate an expert priest to hear the confession.
The change is only for the coming Jubilee Year, beginning in December.
However, the rule relaxation will not affect Catholics in England, Wales and Scotland as all priests there can already forgive abortion without seeking permission from a bishop.
The Pope said many women who sought an abortion did so because they "believe that they have no other option".
They added that they had "met so many women who bear in their heart the scar of this agonising and painful decision".
The easing of the rules is being seen as a shift in Catholic Church policy, reflecting the Pope's outspoken views on compassion and mercy.
"'I have decided, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to allow all priests for the Jubilee Year to absolve of the sin of abortion those who procure it and who also seek forgiveness," Pope Francis said.
Pope Francis is aware that the decision will not be welcomed by traditionalists, says the BBC's David Willey in Rome.
However, in contrast to their predecessors, they regard compassion and mercy as virtues that outclass all others.
The Jubilee Year runs from 8 December 2015 to 26 November 2016 and is seen as one of the Catholic Church's most important events.
It normally takes place every 25 years unless a pope declares an extraordinary one to draw attention to a particular issue.
'Throw-away culture'
The Pope has previously denounced abortion as part of a throw-away culture.
"It is horrific even to think that there are children, victims of abortion, who will never see the light of day," they said in 2014.
"Unfortunately, what is thrown away is not only food and dispensable objects, but often human beings themselves, who are discarded as unnecessary," they added.
Pope Francis has been viewed as progressive on other controversial issues. In 2013, on the topic of homosexuality, they said: "Who am I to judge?"
However, they have not changed Church policy on contraception.
Speaking earlier this year, Pope Francis said that although contraception remains forbidden, there was no need for people to breed "like rabbits" to be good Catholics.
Information technology employees at the University of California, San Francisco, confronted members of the UC Board of Regents over a plan to offshore their jobs to lower-wage workers from India. This is just the beginning of an offshoring scheme that could affect hundreds of IT workers in a public university system that receives taxpayer funding.
"The day I received a bill for my daughter's education at UC is the same day I received a layoff notice from UC. My daughter asked me, 'Dad, should I continue my engineering education?' I didn't know how to respond to my daughter or any other kids who are pursuing STEM degrees," said Hank Nguyen, who spoke at the Board of Regents' meeting today.
In February, Nguyen and 78 of their coworkers in UCSF's IT department will lose their jobs, but only after they train their foreign replacements as a condition of their severance. Members of UPTE-CWA Local 9119 have been mobilizing against the move for several months, building public support for the IT workers.
UPTE/CWA Local 9119 President Jelger Kamijn tells the UC Board of Regents to stop the offshoring of good tech jobs. With them are UCSF workers Hank Nguyen and Keith Pavlik who also addressed the Board.
At the meeting, UPTE-CWA Local 9119 President Jelger Kalmijn said, "We're not going to participate in a race-to-the-bottom, where working people are fighting each other all across the world to see who can be exploited the most. I urge you to take leadership and stop this outrageous outsourcing. It's going to save you a couple pennies for massive political cost, for massive financial costs in the long run and for massive security costs. It makes absolutely no sense."
Watch their testimony here.
Some Indian workers are being brought to campus on H-1B visas, which are temporary work permits for specialty occupations requiring highly specialized knowledge. Congress originally created the visa program to help employers to fill talent gaps in their workforces — not displace U.S. workers. But the law has loopholes and employers like UC are unscrupulously exploiting them.
In September, UC awarded HCL, a staffing company based in India, a $50 million contract to manage IT infrastructure and networking-related services. Soon outsourcing could spread beyond UCSF, as the HCL contract can be utilized by any of the 10 campuses in the UC system.
Troublingly, both UC San Diego Chancellor Pradeep Khosla and UC Berkeley Dean of Engineering S. Shankar Sastry sit on the board of HCL.
"Congress did not design the program to replace — or outsource — American jobs, or to lower domestic wages," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) recently wrote in a letter to UC President Janet Napolitano. "Using the H-1B visa program for these purposes runs contrary to Congress' original intent, particularly given that the employees subject to the layoffs are highly skilled."
California Democratic Reps. Zoe Lofgren, Anna Eshoo, Mark DeSaulnier, Barbara Lee, and Eric Swalwell, along with Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley (R), also have sent letters to Napolitano, calling on them to reverse course.
"UC follows in the footsteps of many private companies that have been abusing the H-1B visa program, including Southern California Edison, Abbott Laboratories, Eversource Energy, Walt Disney World, Toys "R" Us and New York Life. But as a public institution, the University of California's action is even more of a slap in the face to the tech workers, their families and the UC community," Kalmijn said. "We will continue to fight back against this shameful attack on good, family-supporting jobs."
A plant that supplies power most of the time (base load plants) gets most of its revenue from selling power (MWh sold). This would be the case with Pilgrim.
(MWh sold). This would be the case with Pilgrim. A plant that supplies power only part of the time (a peaker plant) gets a much higher proportion of its revenue from capacity payments (MW available when called upon). This would be the case with most gas plants.
Nuclear gets a small percentage from capacity payments, and most of their revenue from selling power (energy payments.)
Gas turbines get a large percentage from capacity payments.
Renewables get a big percentage from PTC (production tax credits) and RECs (selling Renewable Energy Certificates) which allows renewables to bid into the grid at a very low price, because those two sources of income remain intact, even with little revenue from power production.
I believe A.S. payments are payments as part of the ISO-NE winter reliability program, but I am not sure. These payments are highest for dual fuel systems in this graph, which is correct for winter reliability payments. The winter reliability program basically makes payments for keeping fuel on site. In general, a gas turbine that can also be fired with oil will keep oil on site, or keep CNG on site, and get the reliability payment.
Entergy announced today that Pilgrim will close by 2019. Here are two links:The Entergy announcement includes many subsidiary linksThe Boston Globe has a good article on this breaking news.Entergy is going to have a press conference today at noon Eastern Time. There will be more information at that time.There is some question about exactly when Pilgrim will close. Entergy has "contracted with ISO-NE" to supply power from Pilgrim until 2019 (Boston Globe article). This means that Pilgrim will refuel again…unless they can cut a deal with another power plant to supply power after 2017. Pilgrim's latest refueling outage started in April of this year, and it is roughly on a biennial cycle. So Pilgrim is fairly sure to keep running until 2017, but may or may not refuel at that time, depending on factors such as whether it can find another power plant to take over its obligations to ISO-NE.Well, all the stories say "supply power" but it is really about the capacity markets, not the power markets. Plants bid in years ahead to supply "capacity"…that is, to be available to supply power when needed. Plants are paid two ways: power payments and capacity payments.With so many plants retiring (Vermont Yankee, coal plants), available capacity has fallen and (supply and demand) capacity payments have soared. I encourage you to look at a recent chart on Capacity Payments in the Forward Capacity Market, from James Bride's keynote presentation at an ISO-NE meeting in New Hampshire last week. The chart, on page 12 of the presentation, shows capacity payments going from $3.21 per kWmonth in 2014/2015 to $9.55 per kWmonth in 2019.I was at the Consumer Liaison Group meeting of ISO-NE last Friday, October 9. I am (currently) the only Vermont representative to the Coordinating Committee for that group. (Yeah. I need to do a geeky blog post on this.)For right now, however, please look through the rest of the Bride presentation, especially the section on "missing money."Intermittent renewables get much of their money from subsidies of various types, not from the grid. Therefore, they can bid into the grid at artificially low costs for their power, even bid in at negative numbers (we will PAY you to take our power!). This lowers the power price on the grid, and particularly hurts plants that make a lot of power, like base load plants. As base load plants retire because they can't make enough money to keep operating, the amount of capacity available diminishes, capacity payments go up, and peaker plants get proportionately more money. Peaker plants always get a higher percentage of their money from capacity payments, but when base load plants retire, they get even more money from capacity payments.There were several presentations on the role of intermittents on the grid. Robert Ethier of ISO-NE was on the panel, and the Ethier presentation struck me as surprisingly cheery about predicting more base load plants will retire. They claimed that: power prices will go down, capacity prices will go up, but the market will take care of everything. That is my interpretation of their talk. I didn't ask them a question, but I did ask a question of Anne George of ISO-NE after their presentation . ISO-NE supposedly has some concerns with a one-fuel-source grid (natural gas) but they don't seem to be worried overmuch.from Bill Mohl (Entergy) press conference this morning, showing where different types of plants get their revenue. Thank you to Entergy for sharing this graphic.
What does it mean when you desire a hot fudge sundae more than sex with your loving, gorgeous, faithful, and servant-hearted husband?
When I was still nursing my 2nd child, I attended a women's conference with the goal of talking to friends about nurturing my marriage while having zero sex drive. One friend, a former missionary in Africa, said, “That's why polygamy always made sense to me. If one wife is nursing and has no sex drive, the husband can go to another!”
I attended the tail end of a workshop on the developmental stages of marriage just in time to hear Marilyn, a wise sage in our ministry, close in prayer and turn to leave. Shoot, I missed it all! And then they returned to the podium, “One more thing, if you're not having sex regularly with your husband, your marriage is already in trouble.”
Whoa. . .
The next morning I sat with Marilyn at breakfast and said, “Wow, that was a doozy way to end your talk.”
“Kathy, I literally felt the Holy Spirit push me. I told Him, ‘But I closed in prayer!' but They pushed me back and said I had to speak. Since then, I've been approached by about 30 women who say they're no longer having sex in their marriages, and some haven't for years.”
So sex drive or no sex drive, with Marilyn's advice ringing in my head, I've tried to be faithful in nurturing this part of my marriage.
And sex within our committed marriage covenant has been a very good thing. It's good to be naked and unashamed with my husband. Staying comfortable with one another's body helps us stay comfortable emotionally and spiritually. I think of sex with my husband as a spiritual discipline much like observing the Sabbath, a spiritual discipline that enables God to breathe life into our marriage.
But all that theology doesn't change how 99.9% of the time I'd still rather eat a hot fudge sundae than have sex, just like 99.9% of the time I'd rather check email than pray. Between peri-menopause, teenage kids, my job, their job, groceries, cooking, chauffering, etc. sex can easily feel like just another obligation and chore.
Last night, I discussed this ongoing topic with a couple girlfriends. One said, “You do want sex! You want to be connected with your husband, you want to feel bonded, you want your marriage to grow, you want to make them feel good. You do want it!”
Yes, but I FEEL my hunger, even lust for chocolate on a daily, sometimes even minute to minute basis, in a way I don't about sex with my husband. I can spend all day thinking about what chocolate I'll nibble. My mother-in-law says no one should eat chocolate before lunch, and I generally follow their direction, but that doesn't stop me from coveting chocolate-almond croissants for breakfast.
Yet as we talked, I remembered that the actual experience of chocolate often disappoints. For all of the anticipation, Trader Joe's sea salt and turbinado sugar dark chocolate almonds can leave me hollow. Sure they taste good, but not mind-blowingly good. And with last swallow, that See's dark chocolate California brittle didn't change my life, make me happy or calm my anxiety.
“Hah! Chocolate is the lie!” said my friend, “You want it but it doesn't deliver!”
“And sex is the truth?”
“Yeah! Sex bonds you with your husband, grows love, brings connection and you feel great afterwards. Sex is the truth!”
Who knew? A new mantra for marriage and life.
Chocolate is the lie. Sex is the truth.

When Marvel's Captain America: Civil War opened to warm reviews and healthy box-office receipts, the comparisons to the less well-reviewed DC film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice were inevitable. With plot similarities that extended beyond mere superhero clashes, headlines like “Captain America: Civil War Shows Exactly Why Batman v Superman Failed” and “Captain America: Civil War Gets Everything Right that Batman v Superman Gets Wrong” were to be expected. But, surprisingly, just as Marvel dealt DC a massive blow by being, once again, the friendlier and more popular cinematic superhero generator, DC pulled off a big win of its own. Sure, this one took place on the small screen, but CW's The Flash not only had its best episode yet, but paved the way for a rosier future for DC films.
Though it lacks some of the prestige shine associated with Netflix's Marvel shows, The Flash has received glowing reviews since it premiered in 2014 and is, by far, the CW's highest-rated series. Grant Gustin's turn as Barry Allen—“the fastest man alive”—is so beloved, in fact, that when Warner Bros. announced that Ezra Miller would be taking on the Allen role in their cinematic Justice League, there was a massive outcry from loyal TV watchers who felt no one would be able to match Gustin. That doesn't mean the show has been completely flawless, but this week, for the first time in two seasons, The Flash didn't miss a step.
This latest episode, “The Runaway Dinosaur,” was directed by famed comic book fan Kevin Smith and written by Zack Stentz (Thor, X-Men: First Class). The series has always been funny (thanks, in large part, to the great Carlos Valdes as Cisco Ramon) and has used veteran actors like Victor Garber and Jesse L. Martin to lend gravitas and tug at the heartstrings. But in one episode, The Flash managed to hit new comedic and emotional highs while also leaving room for some exciting action.
Even characters who have been a little patchy—like Barry's leading lady, Iris West (Candice Patton)—had a chance to shine and the episode was surprisingly coherent given that it contained one zombie metal man, three grieving father figures, a Jason Mewes cameo, two potential new speedsters, and the personification of a mystical element called the Speed Force. It shouldn't have worked one bit. But, miraculously, it did.
Like Civil War and Batman v Superman before it, this episode of The Flash focused on a hero grieving for their dead mother. Gustin's apparent heartbreak when Barry finally, finally let their mother go was palpable without ever being oppressively grim. In true superhero-myth fashion, the episode forced Barry to confront their wound—the death of their mother—before they could regain their strength. And, in an eerie moment of synchronicity, both “The Runaway Dinosaur” and Batman v Superman had Barry reaching out through a swirling vortex. Sure, it's a thing the Flash does, but why did that image look so much better on a TV show with a fraction of Zack Snyder's budget?
It's this episode of The Flash, not Captain America, that should be the measuring stick we hold up against Batman v Superman. Marvel's films and comics have always been more bubblegum than DC's. Cap, Tony, etc. obviously experience their share of trauma, but the loving way in which the Avengers bloodied each other's noses in Civil War belongs to an entirely different universe than the one with Gotham and Metropolis in it. But the Flash will be a part of the Justice League and, if Warner Bros. is smart, they'll realize it's not too late to bend their cinematic world to fit the tone set by the CW.
Snyder is on record as not wanting to emulate the Greg Berlanti-created Flash. Explaining why they never considered integrating Gustin's popular version of the character into their cinematic superhero team, Snyder said, “I just don't think it was a good fit. I'm very strict with this universe and I just don't see a version where...that (tone is) not our world.” (Miller and Gustin, for the record, seem not only comfortable with the arrangement, but claim to be fans of each other.)
But perhaps the tone of The Flash—as perfectly captured in “The Runaway Dinosaur”—is something Snyder and DC Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns should consider emulating on the big screen. Warner Bros. is already course-correcting after the oppressively heavy Batman v Superman proved so unpopular with critics. Ben Affleck—whose performance as Bruce Wayne was one of the few well-reviewed elements of Dawn of Justice—has been promoted to executive producer on the upcoming Justice League film. And the very weekend Batman v Superman was being raked over the coals, Snyder promised that the Flash would be “one of the things that lightens” the Justice League.
And as Warner Bros. expands to create a cinematic universe beyond its two most famous caped crusaders, it seems to be aware of how crucial a great version of The Flash could be to the health of the franchise. Like Wonder Woman's Michelle MacLaren before him, would-be Flash director Seth Grahame-Smith left the DC Cinematic Universe over “creative differences.” But the timing—just one month after Batman v Superman was pasted by critics—had some wondering if that too-common Hollywood catch-all, “creative differences,” was code for bigger behind-the-scenes problems. Was an untested director like Grahame-Smith simply too much of a gamble for a film the now feels even more crucial to the health of the series?
Many presumed Warner Bros. would act fast to replace Grahame-Smith and get the movie ready by its scheduled 2018 premiere, but while the studio replaced Michelle MacLaren with Patty Jenkins in a matter of days, there's been a month without any movement on The Flash. The basis for the film is a treatment by the fun-loving Phil Lord and Chris Miller (who have since defected to Disney), but the script itself was written by Grahame-Smith whose three produced screenplays—Dark Shadows, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, and Pride & Prejudice & Zombies—have all failed to catch fire at the box office.
Could a more thorough overhaul of The Flash project be underway? If so, then whoever is working on it would be wise to check out “The Runaway Dinosaur.” It has everything comic-book fans could want from a Barry Allen story. While financially lucrative, Batman v Superman feels like a creative misstep, but it's not too late for the Justice League to find its footing.

Despite having maintained their innocence during a preliminary hearing, Barça president Josep Maria Bartomeu will almost definitely have to take to the stand again.
Judge Pablo Ruz is expected to conclude the current proceedings sometime this month, but Bartomeu will be summonsed once more when a date is set for a full trial.
During their preliminary testimony, Bartomeu pinned the blame for 'Neymar-gate' on both their predecessor, Sandro Rosell, and law firm Cuatrecasas, whom they accused of making numerous mistakes that have wound up with them being charged with tax fraud.
The questioning of Bartomeu dragged on for over three hours and they were grilled about each and every one of the seven contracts signed with Neymar and their family as part of the deal to bring the star to Barcelona.
The current president claimed that they aren't involved in the negotiations for Neymar or any of the contracts drawn up, insisted that Sandro Rosell was responsible for the deal and denied that they are guilty of the charges of tax evasion against them because any offence would be attributable to a different year.
Bartomeu declared before Ruz charged with tax evasion corresponding to 2014, when the club supposedly failed to pay the taxman €2.8 million from the signing of the Brazilian player, who cost Barça a total of €94.8 million in 2013 rather than the sum of €57.1 million which the club initially claimed that it paid for him.
The current Camp Nou chief said that when they took over the club presidency, they signed the relevant papers because they approved them and gave instructions to Barça's tax consultants to work with zero risk and pay anything that might be owed to the Tax Agency, after which the club made a payment of €13.5 million to rectify the situation. This sum, they assured, more than covered any possible debts.
Personal information for as many as 300,000 people at Northwest Florida State College has been exposed by a data breach that lasted for at least four months. Victims run the gamut of people on campus, including students, prospective students, and current and retired employees. The breach has already leaded to at least 50 cases of identity theft, resulting in loans and credit cards being issued in the names of school employees.
The data was stolen from a shared folder on the college's main file server, and it contained social security numbers and dates of birth for over 200,000 Florida students from across the state who had applied for scholarships. The data also encompasses payroll and Direct Deposit information for many employees and retirees. In a memo to all employees (PDF) sent out on October 8, Northwest Florida State College President Dr. Ty Handy said that information had been gleaned from multiple files in a folder on the college's main server.
"No one file had a complete set of personal information regarding individuals," Handy wrote. "However, by working between files, the hacker(s) have been able to piece together enough information to be able to engage in the theft of identity of at least 50 employees."
Those employees' identities were used to obtain "pay-day" loans from PayDayMax, Inc. and Discount Advance Loans, as well as to obtain Home Depot credit cards. The loans were set up for payments to be automatically deducted from the victims' bank accounts. The college is still investigating which students' records were exposed.

The Turkish tourism industry has hit hard following Russian sanctions imposed after Turkey's decision to shoot down a Russian plane in Syrian airspace, reported Turkey's daily Today's Zaman.
As many as 1,318 hotels are up for sale now along the Aegean and Mediterranean, with 410 tourism facilities in the Mediterranean resort of Antalya worth TL 30 billion. Also, 908 hotels have sale prices of a total of TL 8.8 billion, the report elaborated.
The 908 hotels are located in different provinces including Muğla, which has 349 for sale; İzmir, 203; Aydın, 162; Balıkesir, 139; Çanakkale, 35 and Denizli, which has 20 in total listed. Moreover, the report pointed out that Turkey's tourism revenues fell 8.3 percent to $31.46 billion in 2015.
“A number of hotels in resort towns were left on the brink of bankruptcy after Russia imposed sanctions against Turkey after the latter downed a Russian warplane in November last year,” said Denizli Colossae Thermal Chairman Abdurrahman Karamanlıoğlu.
They went on to say “We talk the realities but officials put a brave face on the issue. We have been heavily affected from the jet crisis. Especially the hotels in Antalya; being closed for the last four months, most of those are on the verge of bankruptcy.”
In addition, tourism revenues which are heavily based on Russian and German tourists dropped after last month's ISIL terrorist attack in central Istanbul, where 10 tourists [mostly Germans] were killed.
On the backdrop of the terrorist attack, Russia advised its citizens to cancel their visits to Turkey, adding more turmoil to an already stagnant industry.
On November 24, Turkish air force shot down a Russian jet and crashed a few miles into Syria, claiming it has violated Turkish airspace, whereas Moscow insisted the Su-24 stayed over Syria during its flight.
The incident provoked a deep political crisis between Ankara and Moscow. Since then, the two countries have been locked in a war of words. Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has ordered economic sanctions against Turkey.
The multiple sanctions on Ankara include banning agricultural trade with Turkey, reintroducing a visa regime, and suspending most bilateral economic projects, including the Turkish Stream gas pipeline construction project.
On a related note, Turkey has been caught red-handed in illegal oil trade with the terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq, as evidence unraveled on Ankara's involvement being the main destination for the smuggled petrol.
Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov uncovered in a briefing in December 2015 that “A whole team of bandits and Turkish elites stealing oil from their neighbors is operating in the region,” adding that this oil “in large quantities” enters the territory of Turkey via “live oil pipelines,” consisting of thousands of oil trucks.
Similarly, Chief of National Centre for State Defense Control, Lt.Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev said that “Up to 2,000 fighters, 120 tons of ammunition and 250 vehicles have been delivered to the so-called Islamic State and al-Nusra militants from Turkish territory.”
Russia has been carrying out aerial anti-terrorist operations in Syria upon official request by Syrian president Bashar al-Asssad since September 2015. Russia's Su-27 and Su-30 fighter jets, Su-34 and Su-24 tactical bombers, and Su-25 attack aircraft have been carrying out airstrikes on ISIL and other al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist groups in Syria.

Taking cocaine can change the structure of the brain within hours in what could be the first steps of drug addiction, according to US researchers.
Animal tests, reported in the journal Nature Neuroscience, showed new structures linked to learning and memory began to grow soon after the drug was taken.
Mice with the most brain changes showed a greater preference for cocaine.
Experts described it as the brain "learning addiction".
The team at University of California, Berkeley and UC San Francisco looked for tiny protrusions from brain cells called dendritic spines. They are heavily implicated in memory formation.
Cocaine hunting
The place or environment that drugs are taken plays an important role in addiction.
This study gives us a solid understanding of how addiction occurs - it shows us how addiction is learned by the brain Dr Gerome Breen, Institute of Psychiatry
In the experiments, the mice were allowed to explore freely two very different chambers - each with a different smell and surface texture.
Once they had picked a favourite they were injected with cocaine in the other chamber.
A type of laser microscopy was used to look inside the brains of living mice to hunt for the dendritic spines.
More new spines were produced when the mice were injected with cocaine than with water, suggesting new memories being formed around drug use.
The difference could be detected two hours after the first dose.
Researcher Linda Wilbrecht, assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at UC Berkeley, said: "Our images provide clear evidence that cocaine induces rapid gains in new spines, and the more spines the mice gain, the more they show they learned about the drug.
"This gives us a possible mechanism for how drug use fuels further drug-seeking behaviour.
"These drug-induced changes in the brain may explain how drug-related cues come to dominate decision making in a human drug user."
Commenting on the research, Dr Gerome Breen, from the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, told the BBC: "Dendritic spine development is particularly important in learning and memory.
"This study gives us a solid understanding of how addiction occurs - it shows us how addiction is learned by the brain.
"But it is not immediately apparent how useful this would be in developing a therapy."
Even though there is a living standards crisis in this country, the Conservative Party will once again return to their obsession with Europe this month as the Commons debates the Tory backbench EU Referendum Bill.
Among voters it's clear that jobs, economic growth and rising living standards should be the priority both for Britain and for the European Union. It is with these objectives in mind that Labour is determined to champion both the case for our membership of the European Union and the case for reform.
The Conservative Party has a history of being on the wrong side of the argument on Europe.
In 1992 they voted to enshrine the unnecessary Strasbourg sessions of the European Parliament with an annual cost to the taxpayer of £100million, in return for Britain's opt out of the Social Chapter.
More recently George Osborne's priority in Europe has been defending rising bankers' bonuses whilst Tory MEPs sided with the big tobacco firms rather than the cancer charities and voted to allow damaging cigarette products to stay on the market.
It has been clear for some time now that David Cameron's priority for change in Europe is less about bringing powers home, and more about taking rights away. He'd scrap the basic rights that British people enjoy in the workplace and enshrined in the European Social Chapter: maternity and paternity rights, 4 weeks paid holiday, protection for pregnant employees to name but a few. It's their determination to roll back these basic rights that is just one of many reasons why David Cameron cannot be trusted to make the right judgments on Europe. Taking away these rights for British workers would create ‘a race to the bottom'.
Labour takes a different starting point to David Cameron. We believe that Europe's institutions and policy agenda need to change, but in order to deliver more for hardworking families in the UK. For example, it's in employment where with the right reforms even more potential exists for British workers.
Over 3 million jobs in the UK are dependent on our membership of the European Union. The combination of access to the UK market and routes into to other European markets is a major part of why companies as diverse as Vodafone, Hitachi, Nissan, Honda, and BMW have invested in the UK.
Making it easier for more British companies to benefit from the opportunities of trade with our nearest allies by extending and completing the single market will be a key part of our reform agenda to create more jobs and better opportunities for the British people.
But reform must also extend to how the European Union operates and how much it costs to run. Rightly, Labour's MEPs and MPs voted for a reduction in the EU's budget and we will champion further reforms to how Brussels allocates its funding.
We want for example a further reduction in the proportion of Europe's budget that is spent on the Common Agricultural Policy and for more priority to be placed on encouraging research, innovation and support for the next generation of British and European entrepreneurs; across all countries but particularly in areas of deprivation and poverty.
We want to see reforms too to the European Commission with a Commissioner for Growth to champion recovery across the European economy and lifting the living standards of the majority not just the fortunate. We want such a Commissioner reinforced by a new body to audit the impact of EU legislation on Growth and Jobs.
We also need reform of the Free Movement Directive. We should look again at how transitional arrangements for EU accession countries can provide more flexibility for countries feeling under pressure from increased migration flows. In addition the collection of data on the number of people moving between member states is one vital new step needed to manage immigration more effectively.
But the stand-out feature of the debate about Europe at the moment is David Cameron's weakness within their own Party.
Europe is no longer for this Conservative Party Leader a judgment about what is best for the national interest. Instead it has become a challenge about how to manage their rebellious backbenchers. Their decision to announce an arbitrary timeline for holding a referendum in 2017 owes more to divisions within the Conservative Party exacerbated by the fear of Tory MPs about UKIP's assault on their electoral fortunes, than to a timetable for a major renegotiation of our relationship to the European Union.
Indeed Cameron's MPs and MEPs know this and their distrust of Cameron's motives has led Adam Afriyie to issue a direct challenge to the Prime Minister by calling for an earlier referendum.
William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, has previously spoken rightly of the additional economic uncertainty that a referendum on an arbitrary timeline would create and at a time when the economy is fragile.
The grim prospect of Britain sleepwalking towards exit from the European Union remains however a very real possibility.
An internationally isolated Britain would be one not just at an economic disadvantage but also one that was more vulnerable to international criminal activity; co-operation with other European police forces and criminal justice agencies would slow and the cross-border co-operation that helps tackle human trafficking and that secured the arrest of one of the terrorists responsible for the 7/7 attacks in London would be put at risk.
Being an active participant in Europe increases Britain's ability to take a leading role in tackling the world's great challenges: climate change, preventing terrorism and the search for peace and security in the Middle East. Indeed, as one of the leading countries in the largest economy in the world, Britain in the EU has a greater chance to make progress in achieving our ambitions for the future.
But in the end it is the jobs of our friends and neighbours and the life chances of those at school and university now that would be dramatically affected if a vote to leave the European took place.
Today's report from the CBI shows that Europe brings each UK household £3000 a year. David Cameron is willing to put this at risk because their approach to Europe is based on narrow party interest, not Britain's national interest.
As Martin Baker of Rowan Precision said recently:
“Limited or restricted access to the EU's single market would be an impediment to growth, job creation and innovation for the UK economy. Businesses would be stung if access to Europe's common market of 500 million customers – our biggest market and destination to 50% of British exports dried up.”
David Cameron is putting their own Party political priorities before the national interest, and we will not follow such a course.
Labour will prioritise jobs and growth, making the case for co-operation with our allies across Europe that's in our national economic and strategic interests.
Working alongside Ed Miliband and Douglas Alexander, as Labour's new Shadow Minister for Europe, a reformed Europe that works to secure jobs, higher standards of living and better opportunities for the British people will be my priority.

NORMAN, Okla. – Oklahoma's game plan coming out of halftime Saturday night didn't include tailback passes, onside kicks or punt-return decoys.
Blake Bell and the Sooners found an offensive identity -- less than two weeks from a showdown at Baylor. AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki
The Sooners' scheme was sublimely simple. Get behind all-everything fullback Trey Millard and pound the ball between the tackles.
That wham-bam offensive style topped Kliff Kingsbury's wily bag of tricks in a 38-30 victory over Texas Tech, and it reestablished the Sooners as big a threat as any to unbeaten Baylor for the Big 12 title.
“I love our team and their attitude,” Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops said. “Are we in great shape? No. Am I excited about our team and our opportunity and our willingness to fight and all of that? Yeah, I am.”
The Sooners suffered yet another devastating injury, as Millard tore their ACL covering a kickoff in the fourth quarter. The Sooners had already lost their best linebacker (Corey Nelson) and best defensive lineman (Jordan Phillips) for the year. Now, they'll go to Baylor without their most valuable offensive player, too.
But even with more injury adversity, the Sooners also, for the first time in a month, looked like a team that could challenge for the Big 12 crown.
When they had to, quarterback Blake Bell delivered confident completions to convert third downs. The defense continued to batten down the hatches, even while having to resort to playing true freshmen Jordan Evans and Dominique Alexander at linebacker.
And the Sooners ran the ball at will.
Oklahoma racked up 277 yards on the ground, featuring the trio of Damien Williams (101 yards), Roy Finch (55 yards) and Brennan Clay (42 yards).
“When you're blocking it that way and running it that way,” Stoops said, “you have got to keep calling it until they can stop it.”
Tech couldn't stop it.
In fact, on the first possession out of halftime, Oklahoma called 10 runs and one pass and marched right down the field to take a 21-7 lead.
“That was the game plan,” Finch said. “We wanted to play Oklahoma football, get our run game going, and open up shots down field.”
The run did exactly that.
Early in the second quarter, after three inept weeks of offense, the Sooners rediscovered their stride offensively. In its longest drive of the season in plays, yards and time, Oklahoma ground out an effective -- if aesthetically displeasing -- 16-play, 97-yard touchdown drive covering almost eight minutes.
“I thought that drive was really good,” Stoops said. “When you can run a bunch of plays, and stick it in the end zone, it makes a big difference.”
On the first play of the following possession, with Tech's safeties creeping up to the line of scrimmage, Bell faked a handoff, then uncorked their best pass since the Notre Dame game over the top to Jalen Saunders, who coasted in for a 76-yard touchdown to give Oklahoma its first lead, 14-7.
The Red Raiders were on their heels defensively the rest of the way.
“We controlled the line of scrimmage,” center Gabe Ikard said. “We ran power a lot. I don't know how many times we ran it, but we ran it over and over and over again. We had a lot of success with it.”
Even without Millard, who has been an integral piece of the running attack, the Sooners are sure to heave the same game plan at Baylor in two weeks.
These Sooners can't outscore the Bears through the air. Who can? But as they did with Tech, they can run the ball at Baylor, control the clock and keep the Bears off the field. After all, a team far less imposing than Oklahoma almost beat the eighth-ranked Bears with that formula two weeks ago.
With little semblance of a passing game, Kansas State still racked up 327 yards on the ground, while keeping Bryce Petty and Lache Seastrunk on the sidelines. As a result, the Wildcats took a lead into the fourth quarter but couldn't make enough plays to hold on.
The Sooners made enough plays to topple one of the Big 12's last two unbeatens on Saturday. A week from Thursday, they'll see if they can do the same to the other.
“I feel good about what we're doing,” Stoops said. “I'm excited.
“And we're excited.”
Remember the George W. Bush warrantless wiretapping program? The one that was so illegal that Congress had to pass a special law to ensure that no one was prosecuted for it or sued by their customers for facilitating it? And was found by independent reviewers to be pretty pointless anyway? And was then brilliantly codified and written into stone by Congress? And which almost immediately went off the rails, being used to collect all sorts of stuff it wasn't supposed to? It's back!
The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (FAA) rewrote our surveillance laws, which had generally required a warrant or court order for surveillance of people in the US. Under the FAA, the government can get a year-long programmatic court order for general bulk collection of Americans' international communications without specifying who will be tapped. It is up to the administration to decide that on its own after the fact, without any judicial review. The major requirement is that no particular person in the US should be targeted.
While billed as a foreign surveillance program, it also authorizes the collection of Americans' international communications – meaning one end of the communication is in the US – and therefore implicates the Fourth Amendments rights of all Americans. Once the National Security Agency sucks up these phone calls, texts, emails and Internet records, it can use them pursuant to secret rules that they swear protect our privacy.
The good news is that Congress had the foresight to subject this sweeping surveillance authority to a sunset provision, and it is scheduled to expire in its entirety at the end of the year. More concerning though is that, according to press reports, this afternoon the Select Senate Committee on Intelligence will be secretly approving legislation to extend that law. No public hearings; no public oversight; no thorough debate about how this law has been used and how it has affected Americans.
While the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees have been receiving classified reports, it's time for a public vetting of the FAA and for meaningful amendments to better protect our privacy. Even Sens. Ron Wyden (OR) and Mark Udall (CO), with their secret briefings and cleared staff, don't understand how this sweeping surveillance law is affecting everyday Americans . And when they asked, the DNI said it isn't even ‘reasonably possible' to estimate how many Americans are swept up in the NSA's expansive dragnet.

At this rate it won't take long for someone to create a game called Rahul Gandhi Run. Quick on the heels of the Modi Run game by US-based Dexati, Arvind Kejriwal has started running over Delhi Police barricades and rolling underwater cannons in a bid to wipe corruption out of India.It is obvious that it is the tremendous success of the Temple Run games that has prompted industrious game developers like Dexati to bring the format to India's election-charged digital world. Developers often make spinoffs of successful games and that is why there are hundreds of Angry Birds and Temple Run imitations on both Android and iOS stores.The Modi Run game, launched on July 28, is clearly following the same path, as Dexati itself has a handful of other run-based games. In the game, the Gujarat Chief Minister and BJP's prime ministertial nominee jumps obstacles in many states, starting with Gujarat and ending with Madhya Pradesh. Like a subtle indication of BJP's poll prospects, the game is far from easy once you have finished the easy Gujarat run.Google Play figures show that the game has been downloaded by at least 100,000 users. But it is not clear if BJP approves of the game as the image of Modi in their trademark kurta pyjama flying over obstacles to the backdrop of state landmarks is hardly flattering for the "Lion of Gujarat" . The objective of the game is just to run through the states and there seems to be no point system like in Temple Run. Once you have finished the game, there is no reason for people who aren't the biggest fans of Modi to come back to this game.In comparison, Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Runner' is very different. Though Kejriwal might not approve of the name, GreedyGame Media is clearly a fan of the anti-corruption crusader. So the app, launched on October 2, does much more than make them run through Delhi with a jhaadoo (broom) in their hand.It needs you to log in with your Facebook account and this means the developers will soon have a clear idea of the kind of people who are interested in running with Kejriwal.The app also drills in a bit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) philosophy before the actual game starts. The game is divided into segments like 'Evolution of a revolution' and 'Fight for true Swaraj', none of them easy. We found it difficult to go past the first few obstacles, but are hoping that the 5,000-odd people who installed the game on the first day would have done better.In case they don't succeed in winning the game, gamers have the option of making Kejriwal succeed in their real political race by contributing to their party through the app which takes you to the AAP website. You can also pledge your support. While the app seems to be interested in getting a bit too much personal information, there will be a lot of people who would not mind supporting Kejriwal vicariously through the app.While Modi Run seems to have better numbers on the Google Play Store, it seems Aam Aadmi Runner has understood the potential of the medium much better and tries to improve its captive base of supporters online.Now for someone to create a game pitting the leading political parties and their leaders in a race to Parliament House.

- A four-year-old Elk River, Minn. girl with cerebral palsy may not have won the national contest for an adaptive bike, but thanks to the generosity of another Minnesota family, they will still get the chance to ride.
Emme Kersten, who has to use braces on their legs and a special walker to get around, cannot balance on a normal two-wheeled bike like their sisters and friends. They were hoping to win a $3,500 adaptive tricycle through the Great Bike Giveaway, which gives children with special needs special bikes for free.
Emme's story reached tens of thousands of people through traditional and social media, but they were ultimately not one of the winners of the giveaway.
READ THE STORY - Help 4-year-old Minnesota girl with cerebral palsy win special bike
Shortly after their story ran on Fox 9, a family from Becker, Minn. reached out to the Kersten family and offered Emme the adaptive bike their own daughter had grown out of. It was the exact model they had been competing for.
“We heard from so many of you who refused to let Emme go without a bike, even offering to raise the money to get one for us,” Emme's parents wrote the Bike4Emme Facebook page. “Our hearts are very full. We are blessed!”
Emme's family picked up the bike last weekend and they have been riding it ever since.
“While it took a while for Emme to warm up to the bike, once they got a taste of it, we couldn't get them off of it,” their parents told Fox 9.
The family says they are very fortunate that their daughter received a bike to accommodate their needs. Now, they are hoping some of the more than 400 other kids who did not win the Great Bike Giveaway will be just as lucky.

Dallas Cowboys running back Joseph Randle was fined Wednesday by the team after their arrest for shoplifting. (Photo11: Steven Bisig, USA TODAY Sports)
IRVING, Texas — Dallas Cowboys backup running back Joseph Randle's Monday arrest for shoplifting will cost them a significant fine in the range of $29,117, the amount the second-year back earns per week on their scheduled $495,000 base salary this season.
Randle was charged with a misdemeanor Class B theft of $50 to $500, according to Frisco, Texas, police, for shoplifting a tester bottle of cologne and a two-pack of underwear at a suburban mall.
A fifth-round pick in 2013, Randle met Tuesday with Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones and coach Jason Garrett, and Jones told USA TODAY Sports "significant discipline'' was imposed on Randle, who rushed for a season-high 52 yards on five carries in Sunday's 30-23 win against the defending Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks.
Jones said significant discipline would not include a suspension.
"It'll be a major fine -- game-check range, and he'll do some other things that go with it: community service and things like that we'll want them to do – significant discipline,'' Jones said during a sit-down with USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday. "Unfortunately, that's why they fell a little bit in the draft, just a little bit of the off-the-field stuff.
"He doesn't necessarily make the best decisions. And they made a bad one there. They understand.''
Randle said Wednesday they addressed their teammates and apologized.
"It was hard coming back in the locker room looking people that care about me in the eyes knowing I did something stupid," Randle said. "I can't just go like nothing happened. I had to address the issue. It was time to move forward so it's not a distraction moving forward. We're playing our rival team, the Giants, this week. That's what we're trying to focus on."
Randle, who ranks second on the Cowboys with 113 rushing yards, will have to earn their way back into the organization's good graces.
"I don't think this is the norm for him,'' Jones said. "He's come a long way in a couple of years. He'll be a good person and a good face for the organization ultimately. It was a good learning experience for him.''
Randle said they have never been in this kind of trouble before.
"I'm just trying to take full responsibility and really just move on from it," they said. "It's the biggest mistake I've ever made in my life. ... I've never been in any kind of trouble in my whole life. This is just something I have to learn from and move forward.''
Randle also said their teammates were supportive after they apologized.
"They know people mess up. I really made a big mistake," they said. "I know there are big-time consequences to pay in life. I disappointed a lot of people who really care about me like my brothers on the team, the coaches around here, this whole organization, people who have supported me. My family, my dad, I let a lot of people down.
"And I'm really trying to do my best to make it up to them, do whatever I have to do to get past this."
Garrett spoke about Randle's situation Wednesday with reporters.
"He took full responsibility for it,'' Garrett said. "There were a lot of circumstances that were surrounding the situation but there are no excuses, no explanations for this and they took full responsibility."
Belgian national Pierre Piccinin, left, and Italian journalist Domenico Quirico, right center, were kidnapped in Syria in April and claim to have overheard new details on Syrian chemical attacks. (Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty Images)
Domenico Quirico, an Italian journalist, and Pierre Piccinin, a Belgian teacher, disclosed a grim account of their captivity in Syria as well as potentially new information about the chemical weapon attacks, upon their return to Rome Sunday.
As a seasoned war correspondent, Quirico traveled to Syria by means of Lebanon on April 6 to cover the revolution. Three days later, Quirico and Piccinin were kidnapped as they traveled to the Syrian city of Homs together.
Held hostage for six months, Quirico and Piccinin claim to have overheard their captors through closed doors, discussing the chemical weapon attacks near Damascus. Piccinin reports that the rebels said that Assad was not responsible for the attacks.
"It wasn't the government of Bashar al-Assad that used sarin gas or any other gas in Ghouta," Piccinin revealed on Belgian RTL radio.
"We are sure about this because we overheard a conversation between rebels. It pains me to say it because I've been a fierce supporter of the Free Syrian Army in its rightful fight for democracy since 2012," Piccinin said.
But Quirico said the information cannot be officially verified and thus can only be regarded as conjecture.
Quirico told La Stampa, the Italian newspaper for which they report, "We heard some people we didn't know talking through a half-closed door. It's impossible to know whether what was said was based on real fact or just hearsay."
"You must bear in mind the conditions in which we were; we were prisoners and heard things through doors," they added.
Both can agree on one thing: their conditions were "terrifying," a fact that their physical appearance seems to corroborate, according to reporters who witnessed their homecoming.
"I was treated badly," an exhausted Quirico told reporters. Piccinin said they faced mock executions and "real violence."
It is believed the two men were originally kidnapped by the Free Syrian Army and then transferred to a rebel group known as the Abu Ammar brigade.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A group that campaigns for stricter arms sales controls said on Monday that Western powers were breaking international law by selling vast amounts of weapons to Saudi Arabia that are being used to hit civilians in Yemen.

The Control Arms Coalition said Britain, France and the United States were flouting the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which bans exports of conventional weapons that fuel human rights violations or war crimes.
“It is extremely concerning that many transfers are still continuing, in particular the governments of the United States, the UK and France have authorized and are continuing to export very large quantities of weapons, including explosive weapons, bombs which are being used daily against civilians in Yemen,” said Anna MacDonald, director of the Control Arms Coalition.
They were speaking to a news briefing as week-long U.N. negotiations began in Geneva aimed at putting teeth into the ATT which lacks a mandatory public reporting system for the $100 billion global arms trade.
France authorized arms licenses worth $18 billion to Saudi Arabia last year, followed by the United States at $5.9 billion and Britain's $4 billion, the group said in its latest study.
Nigeria's ambassador Emmanuel Imohe, who chairs the conference, said: “The allegation is quite grave and it should be of concern to everyone including the ATT secretariat itself.”
Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said last week it was evacuating its staff from six hospitals in northern Yemen after a Saudi-led coalition air strike hit one of its hospitals, killing 18 people.
NO BLANK CHECK
The coalition says it does not target civilians and accuses the Houthi group that it is battling in Yemen of placing military targets in civilian areas. A body that the coalition set up to look into civilian casualties is investigating the MSF incident, among others.
The war has killed more than 6,500 people since it began 16 months ago and raised the prospect of famine in the Arab world's poorest country.
Outcry over civilian casualties has led some members of the U.S. Congress to push for restrictions on arms transfers. The Obama administration this month approved a potential $1.15 billion arms package for Saudi Arabia.
In a statement on Friday, the Pentagon cautioned that its support for Saudi Arabia in its campaign was not “a blank check,” however, and said it has pressed the coalition on the need to minimize civilian casualties.
Campaigners said arms exports also drove fighting in South Sudan last month that killed hundreds, prompting fears of a return to civil war.
“We think that governments of other countries have fueled this violence by repeatedly authorizing arms transfers to South Sudan,” said Geoffrey Duke, head of South Sudan Action Network on Small Arms. They named China, Ukraine and South Africa as the main suppliers to the Juba government.
To date, 87 countries have ratified the ATT, while another 46 - including the United States - have signed it, leaving important gaps, Imohe said.
“For example, in the Arab world only Mauritania is listed amongst states parties, while Asia Pacific has only three states parties,” they said, referring to Japan, Samoa and Tuvalu.
Amnesty International said: “Big arms traders Russia and China have not joined the ATT and have supplied gross violators of human rights.”
When you think “tranquility,” what comes to mind? If you're like many people, you envision crystal-clear waves lapping gently at the shores of the Caribbean Sea. Yet that sparkling cerulean surface conceals a massive ruckus. Researchers say the movements of the sea itself produce a whistling-type resonance. They published their findings in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Our oceans and seas are no stranger to weird noises (remember The Bloop?), but historically those sounds have been made by animals, vehicles, and natural phenomena in the water—not by the water itself.
The research team hadn't set out to find strange sounds. Earlier studies had shown that the sea's structure and flow create a meteorological formation known as a Rossby wave. Named for Swedish-American meteorologist Carl-Gustaf Arvid Rossby, the waves are swirls in the atmosphere produced by the meeting of cold polar air moving toward the equator and warmer equatorial air moving poleward. The topography of the Caribbean seafloor, along with the exchange of water between the sea and the ocean, produces a Rossby wave.
The Rossby wave model explains some of the activity within the Caribbean basin and at its edges, where the sea spills into the ocean. But it doesn't explain all of it.
“We were looking at ocean pressure through models for quite different reasons, and this region just didn't work,” University of Liverpool sea level scientist Chris Hughes of the University of Liverpool said in an interview with Gizmodo. “It felt like a sore thumb.”
To get to the sandy bottom of the issue, the team looked at pressure readings and sea level measurements over the six decades from 1958 to 2013, as well as data from tide gauges and NASA satellite readings of the Earth's gravity.
What they found was a very large whistle. When waves crash against the western side of the basin, their collision and rebound creates a reverberation, much like the way that blowing air across an opening creates a whistling noise. The researchers say the note is approximately an A flat.
The sea is so big that this Rossby Whistle, as the researchers named it, is pitched way too low for us to hear. But that doesn't mean we can't detect it. The whistle's resonance is so strong that it affects our planet's gravitational field, as the researchers learned from the satellite data.
This is a pretty neat discovery, but it also has practical implications. In addition to messing with Earth's gravity, the whistle's waves affect sea levels. "This phenomenon can vary sea level by as much as 10 cm along the Colombian and Venezuelan coast,” Hughes said in a press statement, “so understanding it can help predict the likelihood of coastal flooding."

This should be a wake-up call for all the deficit peacocks, Leon Panetta most definitely included, who want to protect the Pentagon at all costs against spending cuts. They're totally on the wrong side of public opinion. Even in Iowa. Among Republicans.
The survey of 400 likely Republican caucusgoers by GS Strategy Group shows 64.5 percent are opposed to Social Security cuts, and 67.3 percent to Medicare cuts. Another 86 percent of those surveyed said Social Security benefits are important to their monthly income, and 87 percent said Medicare is essential to seniors' health care security.
Those surveyed would much prefer withdrawing troops from Iraq and Afghanistan to cutting Medicare (67.3 percent to 9.5 percent) or Social Security (65 percent to 8.8 percent).
Of those surveyed, 76.8 percent identified themselves as conservative and 50.5 percent as very conservative.

Following Saturday's Revolution-New York City FC match at Gillette Stadium, the Revolution organization wrapped up a week of work with the Massachusetts Special Olympics by hosting a soccer game between Special Olympians from the evening's respective teams. After a back and forth game in which there was no shortage of excitement, New York City FC won the game 1-0.
Fans who attended the MLS clash – which the Revolution won 1-0 – were invited to stay for the Special Olympians match, and many moved down to the Fort, where the Revolution's most vocal supporters often set up shop. With the field positioned across one-half of the regulation field, the Special Olympians took the Gillette Stadium for a 7-v-7 match that featured 20-minute halves.
The play was evenly divided among the teams, with City regularly testing the Revolution goalkeeper, who saved numerous shots on goal. The only goal of the game came in the 30th minute after the keeper made one save, but the rebound was knocked in by City. While the Revolution team searched for the equalizer in the final ten minutes of the game, City held on the for the win.
Earlier in the week, the Revolution organization hosted a contract signing session in partnership with Massachusetts Specials Olympics, and many familiar faces were on hand for match, including Heaps and Tom Soehn, both of whom showcased the same fiery reactions seen during the evening's first match. The Revolution front staff team was lead by club president Brian Bilello while center back Andrew Farrell watched the entire game, offering coaching to the players at halftime and staying late to hand out awards at the end of the game.
The Special Olympians were treated to the full game experience as they marched in through the Revolution flags, and were cheered on by the Rev Girls. The Fort and fans provided the singing for the national anthem while gameday announcer John Rooke read off player names and the goalscorer. The Minutemen and their muskets were at the ready just as they had been during the evening's first match. The supporters in the Fort chanted “Let's go team in blue,” which was apt as both teams were in blue.
The game culminated activities that included the first-ever “Bowl For A Goal” fundraiser, which was held on Wednesday. The event featured Revolution players, staff, Special Olympians, and fans, all of whom competed for a team trophy that was awarded at the end of the evening. The festivities raised more than $50,000 to Massachusetts Special Olympics. The money will be used to fund the participation of 600 Olympians in soccer programs across the Commonwealth during the fall.
A LANDLORD who asked a noisy tenant to leave may not have known they were dealing with the internet's biggest star.
YouTube sensation PewDiePie scores millions of viewers with their video blogs about playing video games.
But the vlogger - real name Felix Kjellberg - has just been moved out of their Brighton flat after a noise complaint.
The landlord became the subject of a furious backlash from PewDiePie's loyal fans.
Talking to their millions of fans in a post viewed more than 5.5million times they said: "I've been kicked out."
The star - who has earned a reported $7.4million by people watching them play video games - complained to fans in their post.
PewDiePie tells fans: "It's no news to anyone that my videos are loud."
In their post they show a man knocking on the door of the rented flat where they film their videos to ask them to keep it down.
They said that the next day they received a letter from the landlord of the flat telling them to vacate the property by June 29.
In an expletive laden rant they said: "We get one complaint and we get kicked out.
"I could buy this house. I don't need you.
"It's hard to find houses in Brighton.
"It's a pain.
"So today we're moving.
"The day after we get an actual noise complaint warning."
The internet sensation's post sparked a furious outpouring of hatred from fans - including death threats against the landlord.
Of the 75,000 people who commented on the video there were suggestions the vlogger should sue their landlord .
One said: "So does your landlord even know who you are? They must be some moron who doesn't realize that you make 4 mills a year and could buy that house."
Another replied: "Give them some tranquiliser and tie them in your basement. That's should do it."
PEWDIEPIE – A LOW-KEY INTERNET STAR
FELIX Kjellberg is a 26-year-old man who plays video games for a living.
Their YouTube channel has roughly the same number of subscribers as the population of Canada and they have more subscribers than Rihanna and One Direction combined.
Their video blogs of them playing games – complete with over-the-top reactions – regularly score millions of viewers.
Their channel became the first to surpass 10 billion views – equivalent to everyone in the UK watching one of their videos 156 times each. According to Forbes they earned $12 million last year and is widely considered the internet's biggest star.
Growing up in Gothenburg, Sweden, their mother – an IT executive – let them play Super Nintendo when they stayed home sick from school.
As a result, they say, they were sick a lot.
As a teenager they spent most of their time playing video games in their bedroom – playing truant to play games like World of Warcraft in internet cafes.
While at university they taught themselves video editing by watching an online tutorial and made their first video of themselves playing Minecraft.
Despite them being one of the internet's most recognisable faces, PewDiePie shuns their fame and has been living a low-key life in Brighton with their girlfriend, fellow internet star and beauty blogger Marzia Bisognin – known better as CutiePieMarzia.
They have more than double the Twitter followers of three-time Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton and nearly six times as many as Prime Minister David Cameron.
Despite being the most subscribed YouTuber none of their video's total view counts break the top 20 – which is dominated by music videos
West Virginia quarterback Will Grier — one of the best college passers in the country — appeared to dislocate or break a finger dislocation while attempting to run for a touchdown Saturday against Texas.
Grier needs surgery, 247Sports reported Saturday night, for a broken middle finger:
The Mountaineers (7-4, 5-3 Big 12) are optimistic Grier didn't tear any tendons or suffer any nerve damage, but they'll know more following the operation.  They are not being ruled out of a bowl game, but the current plan is that they will not play in the regular-season finale against Oklahoma (10-1, 7-1). Sophomore Chris Chugunov would make their first career start against the third-ranked Sooners and Heisman Trophy contender Baker Mayfield.
Here's the play that did it:
On a designed QB bootleg, Grier sprints for the left edge and dives at the pylon. He's interrupted in midair, though, by Texas defensive back Brandon Jones, who forces the ball loose at the exact moment Grier reaches for the plane of the end zone. The ball jumps out, Grier's right hand strikes the turf rather awkwardly, and their middle finger goes sideways-right.
The play was reviewed because in the instant it happened, it could have perhaps resulted in a touchdown. As it was, though, the review team decided that the ball was fumbled before breaking the end zone plane and Grier only reestablished possession once they were out of bounds beyond the pylon.
“Grier was just taken to the locker room with an injury to their hand/finger,” per ESPN's Jake Trotter. With Grier out, backup Chris Chugunov came on and completed their first two passes for a total of eight yards, and Texas grabbed a 7-0 lead early in the second quarter.
Still, for Grier that's a touchback, and a dislocated finger for their troubles.
Last month, we told you that "Weird Al" Yankovic was planning to perform the Doolittle track "I Bleed" with members of the Pixies at L.A.'s Echoplex as part of a benefit show for charity Winston's Village. Well, that shit happened. Al didn't change the song to "I Eat", but they did sorta rip it. And there's good-quality YouTube video proof below the fold. (Via Slicing Up Eyeballs.)
"Weird Al" wasn't the night's only guest. Flea, Tenacious D, OK Go, and Bauhaus's David J all sat in with the Pixies (minus Kim Deal) during the set. (Watch some of those performances below.)
The benefit continues tonight at the Echo with an evening of stand-up hosted by Frank Black and including Tim and Eric, Bob Odenkirk ("Mr. Show"), Brian Posehn ("The Sarah Silverman Program"), and Pixies drummer David Lovering.

UFC on FX 8 features quite a few Strikeforce stars making their UFC debuts, including the last two Middleweight Champions of the now defunct promotion, Luke Rockhold and Ronaldo Souza. Known as Jacare, Souza is one of the best Brazilian Jiu Jitsu grapplers of all time who has translated that to a successful MMA career. This is partially due to the fact that their style of jiu jitsu translates very well to the world of MMA, and also because their athletic ability allowed them to pick up the striking game very quickly.
Jacare's jiu jitsu is not the prototypical one that MMA fans are used to seeing. When thinking of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, many MMA fans think of Royce Gracie or B.J. Penn using the guard to confound and submit their opponents. But the bottom game is only half of jiu jitsu, and Jacare's fights showcase just how detailed, technical, and effective the top game can be, as well.
The top game is really what old school BJJ was all about - a fighter's goal was to secure a takedown, pass the guard to a dominant position, and then submit. It takes just as much skill and knowledge of grappling as does playing guard, and it is a game that is used by some sport jiu jitsu's very best including Jacare, Fernando "Terere", Roger Gracie, and Xande Ribeiro to name a few.
The guard is the most offensive position a fighter can have while on their or their back, and is iconic of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fighters. Passing guard is almost a martial art unto itself, with as many variations and adaptations as there are guards. While not totally universal, there are two keys to a good, controlling guard pass:
Limiting the mobility of the hips
Pinning the shoulder blades
These two concepts are normally present in guard passes, but passing guard is often as much improvising as it is rehearsed technique. When dealing with a superior grappler like Souza they can pass in dynamic ways that are technically perfect ( G ) or something they made up on the spot ( G ).
Let's take a look at the more measured passes Jacare has used that highlights the key concepts of guard passing and the fundamentals of Jacare's passing game.
When Jacare works from guard, they will often back their hips away, creating space for an opponent to establish a butterfly guard. Jacare's background in grappling has caused many fighters to employ grappling avoidance strategies, and the butterfly guard has become very popular for fighters to create space and stand up. Jacare invites the butterfly guard and then uses it to pass quickly.
Here is Jacare working from the butterfly guard of Robbie Lawler. Jacare's posture is very low and is controlling Lawler's hips, stopping them from getting to their side. This effectively kills most sweeps from the butterfly guard. Jacare has both arms controlling Lawler and their head just enough on Lawler's chest not to leave themselves open for guillotine choke.
Jacare has control of Lawler's hips, but Lawler's knees are still high and tight to Jacare's side, preventing Jacare from moving to either side. Lawler is also able to sit up, giving them some ability to move and defend himself.
To get Lawler's knees lower, Jacare sinks their hips back. Lawler is forced to extend their legs to maintain the butterfly guard, giving Jacare a chance to slide over Lawler's right leg. Lawler keeps the left butterfly hook because even with Jacare passing to their right they can still threaten with sweeps as long as they maintain that hook and has some freedom of movement.
Jacare now gives up an underhook on Lawler's right; this is not a mistake as the underhook doesn't help Lawler at all and the overhook is actually what Jacare needs. They want to have their shoulder in contact with Lawler's jaw to create a cross face. Jacare also raises their hips as they prepare to take away both Lawler's remaining butterfly hook and pin their shoulders to the mat in one move.
Jacare kicks their right leg behind their back, dropping all their weight on to their shoulder, pinning Lawler's back to the mat. (G) Lawler's ability to move or use their guard is completely taken away during the whole pass because of how effectively Jacare controls their hips and then pins their shoulders to the mat.
The key to maintaining control of both the hips and the body is that Jacare kept their hips low. Even when they raised their hips, it was not very high, and the pressure never really let up. The pass will fail if the hips do not get low and the bottom fighter is mobile off of their back. (G)
Jacare has always favored passing over the leg for their entire grappling career, but when doing a pass that involves stepping over one leg, quite often the other leg gets caught in a half guard. As a result, anyone who employs an over the leg passing game normally also develops a half guard passing game, as well.
Jacare's half guard top game centers around what is sometimes called the "reverse scarf half guard".
Here is Jacare employing that half guard against Joey Villasenor in Strikeforce. Souza has sat facing Villasenor's legs, overhooking their far arm. The position gets its name from the Judo pin position of gesa gatame, and this half guard variation of it provides both control of the hips and flattens the bottom fighter's back on the mat. Villasenor holding on to the half guard limits their hip mobility, and Jacare's upper body provides the pressure to keep Villasenor flat on the mat.
One of the primary advantages of working the half guard is that Jacare does not need to worry about nearly as many submissions, and can threaten with their own submissions while they pass. (G)
This half guard position has a great deal of offense that can come from it; for a look at one of its more basic passes here is Renato Tavares, American Top Team grappler.
This all barely scratches the surface of Jacare's overall BJJ game, but it does provide an overview of the basics of passing guard.

Updated March 27: Revised to include ICE statement.
Federal immigration officers detained 26 people suspected of being unauthorized immigrants when they reported for community service Sunday morning in Fort Worth.
Sheriff Bill Waybourn told KXAS-TV (NBC5) that their office participated in the operation at the request of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
"This was totally initiated by ICE," Waybourn told NBC5. "They came to us and said, 'Listen, we reviewed the list [of names], and we suspect some of them are illegal aliens.' So we said, 'Whatever you need to do.' "
The operation took place at the Tarrant County facility on Cold Springs Road in Fort Worth. An NBC5 photographer reported seeing an ICE bus and two vans. Most of the people were frisked as they were escorted onto the bus, and one man was shackled, the news station reported.
The detainees had convictions for felonies and misdemeanors and had been ordered by a court to do community service, said David McClelland, the sheriff's chief of staff. It appears that they were not screened by ICE when they were first booked in jail after their arrests, they said.
Two ICE agents work at the Tarrant County Jail from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Friday, screening records to look for unauthorized immigrants, but the agency might miss them if immigrants are booked when no ICE agents are on duty, McClelland said.
ICE spokesperson Carl Rusnok said in a statement Monday that 23 of the immigrants are from Mexico and three are from Honduras. Twenty-three have been convicted of DWI, and four have been convicted of possessing controlled substances, Rusnok said.
"Three of those arrested have been previously deported, and will have their previous final orders of removal reinstated; six will be voluntarily returned to Mexico; 12 have been issued notices to appear before a federal immigration judge who will determine their immigration cases," the statement said.
The people taken into custody Sunday were driven to a federal detention center in Dallas, McClelland said.
Waybourn told NBC5 that the families of the detainees have been notified and that some could be released.
The sheriff took office in January. They said they want to participate in a federal program known as 287(g), which would give their detention officers the power to look for unauthorized immigrants entering the jail.
"This is going to give us coverage 24 hours, seven days a week, so the ability for somebody to slip through the cracks is going to be reduced," Waybourn told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. "I will not foolishly say somebody won't slip through the cracks at some point in a large, urban jail like this, but this will reduce that."
Like many Olympians, Eric Radford's chosen sport, figure skating, was a calling that spoke to them from the time they were a child. As their life became more and more devoted to the art and athleticism of their sport, it's no surprise that their identity as a gay man informed their style as a skater.
“I saw the 1992 Olympics, and I was just drawn to it,” Radford says on the phone from their home in Montreal. “I told my mom, ‘I want to learn to do that.' They put me in the CanSkate program, and it all started from there.”
Radford spent years away from their home in Red Lake, Ontario (about 500 kilometres northwest of Thunder Bay), living with host families in Winnipeg, Montreal and Toronto as they trained to become the best figure skater they could be.
Being away from family and constantly changing schools left them with few close friends outside figure skating.
“When it comes to accepting that I'm gay, without my parents around and changing schools every year, I didn't really have a close circle of friends,” Radford says, before stopping himself. “It was skating that kept me out of trouble, kept me focused. Then by the time I did accept it myself and came out to my very closest friends, I had such a close and tight-knit group of friends from skating that were there to support me.”
Over the years, Radford moved from solo skating to pair competition. They and their partner Meagan Duhamel are three-time Canadian national champions, and they helped bring home the silver medal in the team competition at the Sochi Olympics. They're favourites in this year's Grand Prix Final in Barcelona.
Although Radford has been out to friends and family since they were 18 and they make no effort to hide their relationship with their partner, Normand, on their public Facebook page, he's never had a moment where he's stepped up to be counted as a gay athlete. That changed when the Canadian Olympic Committee launched its recent #OneTeam effort to fight homophobia in sport and in schools.
“In my immediate life it's not a big deal because I feel like everybody knows,” Radford says. “But to put it out there for the people who don't know me can send a strong and supportive message to anybody who's going through that.”
He's now the first figure skater to come out of the closet at the height of their competitive career. And while some athletes have worried that coming out might affect their scores in judged sports, Radford says they don't think there's any prejudice in skating.
“The environment is 100-percent accepting. I've never seen or had to deal with any sort of backlash for being gay,” they say.
But even if overt prejudice doesn't creep into scores, pairs figure skating is a sport where a perceived (and often real) romantic connection between partners is a significant draw for fans and often plays a part in the performance on the ice. Think of famous pairs like Jamie Salé and David Pelletier or Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir.
“At first, I did worry about how coming out might affect how we're perceived in having that connection on the ice, but there's a difference between romance on the ice and connection on the ice. Despite me being gay, me and Meaghan's connection is easy to see,” Radford says.
Not having romance over their heads allows the pair to focus on perfecting the technical elements and protects them from the fights that can trip up partners who do end up dating each other.
“It's the movements you choose to tell your story,” Radford says. “We look into each other's eyes, we hold each other's hands, and we're going through something amazing together without trying to tell the world that we want to make out. We're out there together to give a really strong performance, but we tell it through the movements and executing our elements together, rather than me holding Meagan's face or running my hand through them hair.”
But although Radford wants to inspire LGBT fans, they don't want to be known as a “gay figure skater.”
“My story isn't about being gay and having success,” Radford says. “It's how despite whatever you have in your background, you can achieve whatever you put your mind to, whatever your dreams are.”
The Orioles have found their left fielder, retaining Nate McLouth on a one-year, $2MM deal with $500K in incentives. McLouth is represented by The Sparta Group.
McLouth, 31, joined the Orioles in June after being released by the Pirates. They had a nice run for the O's, hitting .268/.342/.435 in 236 plate appearances. McLouth made the All-Star team in 2008 and signed a $15.75MM extension with the Pirates the following February. The Bucs traded them to the Braves a few months later, where they had a disappointing three-year stint. With the new Orioles contract, it was said McLouth sought only a straight one-year deal, as they look to further re-establish their value.
So far this offseason, the Orioles also picked up the option for reliever Luis Ayala and acquired Alexi Casilla, Trayvon Robinson, Danny Valencia, and Yamaico Navarro.
Brittany Ghiroli of MLB.com first reported the agreement, Dan Connolly of the Baltimore Sun first reported it was close, and Ken Rosenthal of FOX Sports added the amount. Photo courtesy of U.S. Presswire.

It's not just the alt-right. A vibrant alt-left media landscape is peddling conspiracies to politicians and news consumers alike. We'll go inside.
(Screen capture via Facebook)
By now, you might have seen stories from some of the best known and most read right wing news sites — they get huge numbers of hits and routinely go viral. At the same time, less covered, still gathering steam, a suite of alt-left bloggers and sites and click bait is zipping around the net, and maybe, heading to an inbox near you. How is this world different — and the same — as its mirror image? This hour On Point: The rising alt-left. -- Ray Suarez

From The Reading List
The Atlantic: How the Left Lost Its Mind — "The Trump era has given rise to a vast alternative left-wing media infrastructure that operates largely out of the view of casual news consumers, but commands a massive audience and growing influence in liberal America. There are polemical podcasters and partisan click farms; wild-eyed conspiracists and cynical fabulists. Some traffic heavily in rumor and wage campaigns of misinformation; others are merely aggregators and commentators who have carved out a corner of the web for themselves. But taken together, they form a media universe where partisan hysteria is too easily stoked, and fake news can travel at the speed of light."
The Upshot: Why More Democrats Are Now Embracing Conspiracy Theories — "Even as Democrats decry the false claims streaming regularly from the White House, they appear to have become more vulnerable to unsupported claims and conspiracy theories that flatter their own political prejudices. The reason isn't just that a Republican now occupies the White House. Political psychology research suggests that losing political control can make people more vulnerable to misinformation and conspiracy theories."
BuzzFeed News: Democrats Confront Lefty Fake News — "If it began during the election with ad revenue-hungry hoax sites and false information campaigns directed largely at Hillary Clinton, fake news in the Trump era has seeped into the liberal online ecosystem in the form of viral posts on Medium, Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook — with progressives elevating anonymous social media accounts, floating outlandish conspiracies, and seizing on stories that don't hold up to the facts."
White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer responded to accusations of sexism and racism after they repeatedly told senior journalist April Ryan to stop shaking their head during Tuesday's press briefing.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized Spicer's actions Tuesday, labeling the incident an example of the kind of sexism that women encounter every day. But Spicer said that Ryan was a tough reporter and they were “astonished” at the accusation. They insisted that they treat the White House correspondent no different than male colleagues in the briefing room.
“I think if you ask April, both on and off camera during the briefings, they come up here often, we have very spirited back and forth,” Spicer said in an interview on Hugh Hewitt's radio show. “I think that's what makes them a tough reporter. Frankly I'm kind of astonished; I think if you look at the exchanges I have with [ABC's] Jonathan Karl, or [NBC's] Peter Alexander or a number of the other individuals in the press briefing room, Jim Acosta from CNN, we go back and forth all the time, rather heatedly in fact.”
Ryan had been trying to ask how the Trump administration would revamp its image when Spicer disagreed with the premise of their question and attacked their head shaking.
“I don't think it takes much of a search to see that we go back and forth on a lot of the things that are thrown around and April is a tough reporter that knows how to throw it out and take it back,” Spicer said. “It's frankly demeaning for some folks to say that they can't take it. We went back and forth, I disagreed with their angle and the way they were coming at the question, but that's what we do, we go back and forth. And I don't treat one person different than the next.”
Clinton said during an appearance in San Francisco that Spicer was patronizing to Ryan, the Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks.
“Just look at all that's happened in the last few days to women who were simply doing their job,” they said. “April Ryan, a respected journalist with unrivaled integrity, was doing their job just this afternoon in the White House press room when they were patronized and cut off trying to ask a question,” they said.
Spicer disputed that they were being patronizing.
“I have an obligation frankly, Hugh, that when someone comes in and attacks the narrative or makes accusations against the administration, to push back, and push back tough,” they said. “And I don't look and say ‘well I'm gonna push back lighter on this person because of their gender.' I think it's the exact opposite of what Secretary Clinton went after and tried to say somehow it's patronizing. No, in fact, it's not patronizing. What it is is treating April Ryan with the same pushback that I would any other reporter in that room.”
Ryan said on MSNBC after the incident that Spicer was doing their job.
“Sean is being the White House press secretary, talking about and trying to make this administration look better than what it does right now, and unfortunately I was road kill today,” they said.
On Wednesday, Spicer gave the first question to Ryan during the briefing, and asked them how they were doing.
“I'm fine, how are you?” Ryan replied.
“Fantastic,” Spicer said, as the press corps laughed.
In the future Judgment, the condition of each person will be revealed in an instant, and each person on their own will proceed to where they belong. Each person will recognize, as if on a television screen, their own wretchedness, as well as the spiritual condition of others. They will reflect themselves upon the other, and they will bow their head, and proceed to the place where they belong. For example, a daughter-in-law who sat comfortably with their legs crossed in front of their mother-in-law, who with a broken leg took care of the grandchild, will not be able to say, “My Christ, why are you putting my mother-in-law into Paradise without including me?” because that scene will come before them to condemn them They will remember their mother-in-law who stood with their broken leg in order to take care of their grandchild and they will be too ashamed to go into Paradise — but there will be not place for them there, anyway.
Or, to cite another example, monastics will see the difficulties, the tribulations of the people in the world and how they faced them; and if they have not lived appropriately as monastics, they will lower their heads and proceed on their own to the place where they belong. There, nuns who did not please God will see heroic mothers who neither took vows nor had the blessings and opportunities that they, the nuns, had. They will see how those mothers struggled, as well as the spiritual heights they attained, while they, the nuns, who with petty things preoccupied and tormented themselves, will be ashamed! These are my thoughts about the manner of the Final Judgement. In other words, Christ will not say, “You come here; what did you do?” Nor will They say, “You go to Hell; you go to Paradise.” Rather, each person will compare themselves with the others and proceed to their appropriate place.

We recently had a chance to sit down and speak with Rebecca one of the two creators behind Ooblets. Rebecca is handling the programming and art development on their own. Even though they are handling a 2-person full time job, they were kind enough to take some time and answer some questions, that fans of the game are burning to know.
When we asked about the possibility to play with friends, Rebecca stated that there are currently no plans to add a 2 player co-op mode to the game, however, they would love to add a multiplayer mode to a possible Ooblets sequel in the future. Furthermore, they also went into greater detail about the main activities in the game, and what they are most excited about “is the player's house upgrades, decoration, and item placement“. Player housing is always an exciting addition to any game, being able to create your home, and have a place to return to at the end of the day is something many players enjoy.
Rebecca also defined the core gameplay of Ooblets a little more. As they explain “The main activities are farming, exploring, battling, running a shop, and customizing stuff like your character, your Ooblets, your house, your shop, etc.” We were especially excited to hear about the possibility to run your own shop in Ooblets, and we can't wait to hear more details about the shopkeeping feature in the game.
They also pointed out that given this project is based on the power of two people it may be unrealistic to expect Sims-like customization levels in regards to housing. Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley and other similar games do offer housing customization to some extend as well. As Ooblets has so many different activities to offer, players will be busy enough exploring all the other options, without having to worry about the depth of building level in the game.
Ooblets is packed with tons of features, and a level of cuteness not seen before. You can read the full interview with the lead programmer and lead artist on Ooblets below.
myPotatoGames: Are you considering adding a Multiplayer mode to Ooblets?
Rebecca: I think Ooblets co-op would be amazing, but with a two-person team and the entirety of the game programming falling on my shoulders, it's not feasible to include it and still get the game out in 2018. We're hoping to maybe include multiplayer in a sequel if there's enough interest.
myPotatoGames: Are there plans to have custom content?
Rebecca: There are no plans for that but it's not completely out of the question. We do run the risk of spreading the game too thin with too much customization.
myPotatoGames: Do you see Ooblets hitting more platforms than just PC and Xbox One? Perhaps the Switch?
Rebecca: We don't know what the future will hold!
myPotatoGames: Is “Badgetown” customizable in any way? Can you decorate it or place buildings?
Rebecca: You'll hopefully be able to rent at least one building in Badgetown, but I don't know about placing buildings or decorating. We've had a lot of plans for more town customization but they're honestly likely not going to make it in given all the other big systems we still have left to implement. That's another of those things that if there's enough interest after release, it might be good to include in a sequel.
myPotatoGames: Will Ooblets feature a social system similar to Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley where you can get married to an NPC?
Rebecca: While we do get a lot of requests for this, we're not currently planning it. There may be some sort of personal relationship mechanic for how friendly you are with various NPCs, but we're probably going to avoid romantic relationships altogether.
myPotatoGames: Do you work alone on the game?
Rebecca: The team is me and @perplamps who is the game designer, community manager, and general businessy person. I do the art and code. We've had a few small things done by freelancers and we're hoping to get more freelanced work added as we go along. In terms of non-development help, we're super thankful to all the support and encouragement we get from our publisher Double Fine, our Patreon backers, and all the people who enjoy (and especially those who share) our content on Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook.
myPotatoGames: What is your favorite activity in Ooblets as of right now?
Rebecca: The thing I'm currently most excited about is the player's house upgrades, decoration, and item placement. I'm a little bit afraid that people are thinking Ooblets has Sims-level customization which it totally won't have, but you will be able to buy and collect furniture and items to put around your house and farm.
myPotatoGames: What main activties can a player expect in the game?
Rebecca: The main activities are farming, exploring, battling, running a shop, and customizing stuff like your character, your ooblets, your house, your shop, etc. Some of this stuff will obviously be a lot lighter than it'd be in a AAA game but we're hoping that there will be dozens of hours worth of content and gameplay.
myPotatoGames: Are there seasons and/or weather in the game?
Rebecca: There's some weather (well, rain) already implemented, but we're not currently planning on seasons. Instead, there will be different biomes and weather depending on the region you're exploring. One region might be snow and ice based while another would be a desert, and the crops you can collect there might require special care to grow back on your farm (like special greenhouses, soil, and planters).
myPotatoGames: What inspired you to start this project?
Rebecca: Our inspirations are pretty close to the surface!
Thank you so much Rebecca for answering our questions, and letting us be a part of the development progress of Ooblets. If you want to support the Ooblets team you can do so by joining the Patreon here. You can join Rebecca on Twitter here. Ooblets is currently set to release on PC and Xbox One. Check back for more information on Ooblets in the very near future. In the meantime you can enjoy the announcement trailer below.
At last, RIM's upcoming QWERTY BlackBerry N-Series phone has been photographed and leaked to the web. Around two weeks ago its all-touch L-Series cousin appeared, where it was photographed repeatedly in all its glory. Unlike the shots of the L-Series, whoever snapped the BlackBerry N-Series only shared a single picture. And where the L-Series photos were clear and well-light, the N-series looks like it was photographed in very low light and in a big hurry.
Still, the photo shows off what die-hard BlackBerry fans have been waiting to see: a BlackBerry 10 smartphone with the company's trademark keypad. The N-Series looks a lot like RIM's current BlackBerry Bold 9900, though it's apparent that the screen is slightly larger and the top and bottom bezels are a bit slimmer. The keyboard is also no longer curved. Instead, it's been straightened out like the keyboard on the Porsche Design BlackBerry P'9981.
Not much is known about the N-Series hardware yet. It appeared earlier this year in leaked presentation slides, which noted that the roughly 2-inch square display would have a native resolution of 720×720 pixels. That's a pixel density of around 320PPI for RIM's first touch/QWERTY BlackBerry 10 hybrid.
As for the rest of the phone's hardware, it's still a guessing. CEO Thorsten Heins said that RIM's first BlackBerry 10 phones would stack up well against competitors' offerings. That's not much to go on, but it's something. Insiders think that RIM could be planning to use TI OMAP 4 processors in the BlackBerry L-Series and N-Series, though other leaked information hinted that Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips will power the phones.
We'll find out for sure on January 30th when RIM officially pulls back the curtain.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Dee Martin may wake up on Jan. 1 and find themselves in a whole different state.
Surveyor Alan-Jon Zupan shows a copy of an 18th-century survey used to find the North Carolina-South Carolina state line in their presentation to the Joint Boundary Commission in Rock Hill, South Carolina. More than 50 families and businesses could find themselves living in new states, if a deal to redraw the North Carolina-South Carolina line is finally approved. http://syndication.ap.org/AP.Distro.ContentBroker2/ContentBroker.aspx?contentid=d8ec3355802b462c8db457369872b4f4&iid=8bff85ff6d744f91ad7b78a6955083bf&rsn=0&recordid=8bff85ff6d744f91ad7b78a6955083bf&filingId=87de3990b99b4bfb8bbde67777473379&role=Preview&reldt=2016-05-29T15:19:06&media=Photo&sz=40567&dest=ak&trF=SCJC201&ofn=State%2bLine%2bChange.JPEG&fmt=jpg&relativeUrl=jpg/2016/201605/29/d8ec3355802b462c8db457369872b4f4.jpg&s3Key=versions/preview-v00.jpg&authToken=eNoti7sOwyAMAL8IZGxMyIDUb%2bFRyUNDBEHN4I9vhi633J22OwUKALQzRQQA9htrkVRjK0TMJgJm4wMWE2v2hjcKe9ww%2b7fXLvXZgUnXTKUf15C8rj7mK68pR5sPptQ2bOkfXfLEDgLp%2bU1%2f4RhUzsRog0WHNvIPdN0tJw%3d%3d Dee Martin may wake up on Jan. 1 and find themselves in a whole different state.
South Carolina and North Carolina have redrawn the border between the two states with GPS technology that allows them to confirm the boundary lines established under an English king in the 18th century down to the centimeter.
But that means the lines drawn decades ago through less exact surveying measures are several hundred feet off.
So Martin, who has a South Carolina address and phone number, really lives in North Carolina. They aren't looking forward to the hassle of changing the deed to their home and their address at the post office.
There also is likely a property tax increase. But the biggest problem may come through the homebound health care they get for their 89-year-old husband. The provider doesn't serve North Carolina and that state's Medicaid may not pay for the service even if they change doctors and nurses.
"We knew it would be cheaper to live in South Carolina. Financially, it is going to be a strain — our only income is Social Security and we already have to use our meager savings to meet regular expenses," Martin said. "Right now we don't know what is going to last longer — us or our money."
Nineteen homes are changing states. Three currently in North Carolina will end up in South Carolina, while Martin and 15 others are going to change residency to North Carolina.
Bills finalizing the boundary change are currently in the North Carolina and South Carolina legislatures. North Carolina's Senate has passed its bill, sending it to the House. South Carolina's Senate also took action, although with three days left in South Carolina's annual session it isn't clear whether the bill has time to pass in that state's House.
South Carolina Speaker Pro Tem Tommy Pope represents Martin and others in their predicament — for now. They said they want to do more to help the constituents they are about to lose, but that is up to North Carolina.
Some residents may wake up on January 1 in a different state. Flickr Creaive Commons/Mark Clifton "Maybe it's a good message for South Carolina, but people are fighting a lot harder to stay in South Carolina than they are in North Carolina," the Republican from York said.
But if North Carolina passes its bill, South Carolina lawmakers said there is little they can do except pass their own proposal or leave the people leaving South Carolina in the lurch.
The bills in both states include several items meant to make it easier for people switching states. North Carolina is allowing their soon-to-no-longer-be residents and their dependents in-state tuition at schools in the University of North Carolina system for the next 10 years, provided they live on the same property. Children who attend a North Carolina K-12 public school but wind up in South Carolina can keep attending that school for free.
"We've done everything we can to accommodate folks," said North Carolina Sen. Tommy Tucker, a Republican from Union County, along the border.
One particularly vexing problem has been the Lake Wylie Minimart convenience store. The store currently sits in South Carolina, allowing it to sell fireworks, beer and gas at least 19 cents cheaper because of lower gas taxes. The more exact boundary says it really is in North Carolina.
Surveyors have redrawn the border between North and South Carolina. ElvertBarnes via flickr North Carolina's bill would allow the store to keep selling beer and wine without approval by voters in North Carolina's Gaston County and sell gasoline with South Carolina's lower motor fuels rate until the store is sold to someone else.
These modern problems can be traced all the way back to 1735 when the king of England sent surveyors to what was then their colonies to draw a boundary between the Carolinas with explicit instructions.
The surveyors used poles and measured chains, determining what direction to head from the sun and stars, doing math in their heads, and putting hatchet blows on trees to mark the boundary. Over time, those trees disappeared and future surveyors might not get the line in the exact place.
The states agreed 20 years ago to redraw the 335-mile North Carolina-South Carolina border from the mountains to the Atlantic Ocean. To alter the border in any way from those 1735 instructions would require an act of Congress.
In typical Vice News fashion, the HBO crew tackled a disturbing news story—that very little was known about—by going straight to the scene. In a new segment the news crew bravely visit Chechnya to talk to some higher-ups about the worldwide reports that gay men have been coralled and taken to “concentration-camp-like” prisons where there have been reports that some have even been murdered.
Upon arrival at a camp, which is reportedly called Argun, the news crew finds an empty, rundown establishment with broken windows, dirty floors, and unlivable conditions, but there does seem to be some evidence of people recently being the compound (footprints for instance).
“Imagine if there are gays. Would we, the Chechens, communicate with them at all?” Ayub Kataev, the prison warden who has been accused of torturing gay men asked the team. “My officers would not even want to touch such people—if they exist—let alone beating or torturing them.”
The tour continues, and, like after most human rights atrocities, rank-and-file leadership denies, denies, denies.
Vice does an expert job grilling the warden (and the reporter fearlessly tries to contradict that Chechen strongman).
Additionally, the visit a gay man in Russia who fled Chechnya, and see if they can identify the prison that they visited.
Watch below:
Let me introduce myself. My name is Steve Kaufmann. You may already know me from such tournaments as the StarCityGames.com Standard Open: Charlotte Swiss coverage and the StarCityGames.com Open Series: Charlotte Top 8 and Top 4 coverage.
Because, honestly, that's all I've done in Magic.
I can't begin to tell you how good it feels to finally win. To finally not have to play round 9 of an all-day tournament just to hopefully get my money back so I can convince myself I haven't been wasting the last thirteen years of my life trying to get good at this game feels pretty good. It's nice to finally do something that makes playing Magic worth it and be in the place of the people I've envisioned being in the position of.
I'm not really good at writing reports—hell, I'm not really good at reading reports because they come off formulaic and boring. So I'd like to try to begin my journey into writing with an attempt at something different. I had the realization that piloting Gruul isn't simple. You're introduced to many hard combat situations, usually involving multiple s on each side of the table or when to alpha strike against another aggressive deck. You have to decide when you're playing to win and when you're playing not to lose. You have to know when your opponent is feeling like you're weak and how to bait them into thinking that they're right.
For example, playing your land after you attack in the early turns, making them feel safe that they're actually taking damage, albeit in smaller amounts, but isn't that what aggro decks do?
They add it up!
They take you down!
THEY MAKE YOU MEAT.
With that realization, explaining the intricacies involved or little nuances would be even more treacherous for a rookie like myself.
I played in the moment. I played on instinct.
So I go back to the source, the essence of my victory.
Gruul!
I will present the actual report with "cave paintings" and bad Gruul sentences. Like a real Gruul warrior would do. So let's get started!
Here's how round 1 went for me.
Here's how after losing round 1 went:
After the loss, I had time to think and to try to pull myself together. Here's a picture of that.
ME NO LIKE LOSING, ME NO DERP! ME SMASH CUZ MAKE FUN GOOD TIME! ME SURPRISED ME SPELLING THIS GOOD! MEAT MEAT!
HERE WHAT HAPPEN AFTER NO WIN!
ME NO LOSE AGAIN! WIN EIGHT IN ROW! NO DRAW! ONLY SMASH! ME BEAT DUMB WOLF! ME CRUSH STUPID ANGEL! ME ASPLODE BEAST OF YOU NOT DIE QUICK ENUFF!
AFTER MANY DEAD! ME AT TOP! GO STEVE! GO ME! GO ME STEVE!
WE PLAY ONE MORE! YOUNG BOY TRY TO SPEAK OF "SHAKE SPEAR!" ME INTRODUCE HIM TO "THROW AXE" AND "STAB MUCH." They TRY TO ATTACK BUT LIKE TOO MANY BOOKS! HIM NEED TV, MUCH FASTER.
Non-Gruul side note: Ben Ragan was a genuine pleasure to play against and probably one of the nicest young men I've ever met. They were more mature and level headed than most of the people in that room, and I'm glad we got to play some really fun games.
AFTER MEAT N SLEEP ME WAKE UP TO FIGHT MORE. ME BURN DEAD! ME THEN BURN LIVE MAN TIL They DEAD. THEY GIVE ME BIG CUP, I LESS THIRSTY.
Sorry I don't have a more in-depth write-up of the games, but I really don't remember too much. I know I was on camera for the semifinals and finals, so you can watch and dissect any of my plays here if you really want to. I only really remember one of the plays, and it was bad by both parties.
It was game 2 of the finals, and Tyler had just played a and made a Beast while I had a out. My brain did the math of playing , attacking Garruk with only the , using 's trigger to deal damage to Garruk, then having the fifth mana open to either kill their token via first strike with or kill their Garruk if they didn't block.
After going through that entire thought process, for reasons I cannot explain to you in this report as I have no clue as to why, I just attacked. I panicked a little bit after but looked back at my hand and saw . Looking back at it helped me keep my confidence in the attack, and I hoped my body language showed the same or maybe I flinched longer than I realized and Tyler might have mistaken it for a bluff. For whatever reason, Tyler blocked instead of letting their Garruk fall to one loyalty and keeping the Beast token, and as soon as they let go of the token, I showed them the Rampager. It turned out better than I expected as I bloodrushed through everything and hit them for three. That's really the only play I can remember in depth, and it's nothing to brag about as you can tell.
If you're wondering more about the deck and the time I spent tuning it and testing it, it was close to none. I hate to be one of those guys that say, "Hey, they handed me this and I won!" but that's kind of how it happened, which should really speak to the power of R/G Aggro. I had a Gruul state of mind on Friday, and I just wanted to show up to fight and to keep the thinking to a minimum, so I asked my friend Matt Keene if they had it available and any changes they would make from the list they played in Montreal.
They sent me their list on Facebook, and we talked about (if I can into it and have played a one-drop or next turn haste up a , I can get past ), the idea of trying (it's like a with legs), some of the sideboard options, why they didn't like (too much instant speed removal) or (can't Burning Tree Emissary into it and that card is the reason you're playing the deck), and why playing in the maindeck is a good idea:
As I said, I showed up to Charlotte to fight and to not think too much. The thinking part didn't pan out because I thought a dumb aggro deck would let me take the day off but I just kept running into these overly complex combat situations where if I did the math wrong for the next two turns I would flat out lose. I learned a ton about aggressive decks last weekend like knowing when to play to win and knowing when to play not to lose (which are two entirely different things), how important it is to read your opponent, making sure to utilize what you have on board to deal the most damage possible, how to play my removal correctly, and how to mulligan aggressively.
The showing up to fight part did pan out though. I literally had my back against the wall after round 1. I lost against Naya Midrange and fought my way to a win seven times in a row with the goal of drawing into Top 8, only to have to play again due to getting paired down! But I came to fight and fought the entire time, and I finished the Swiss as the top seed after it was done. I kept the momentum going throughout the Top 8, playing against probably the smartest kid in the room, Ben Ragan.
As we played, they started quoting Shakespeare, which really confused me, so I played up the Gruul roots and asked him, "Who's Shakespeare?" I try to play serious most of the time, but I had to say something to that effect. It's not every day you get to play against a 14-year-old prodigy who can quote ancient literature from the top of their head while playing an intense game for a large sum of money. Then I ran into Zombies, which was intense, but Matt actually told me the night before, "If Zombies ever has to block, you win." So I put them in positions where they had to block. After that I played against Jund and…well…that's it, I won.
Some people asked me after I decided on the deck before winning the tournament why R/G? Isn't Naya Blitz faster? Isn't' Jund just more powerful? You're right on both counts. Jund has the ability to go 3/3 into a 3/3 with hate into a 4/1 haste flying unkillable monster. Naya Blitz has the ability to lay out ten powers worth of creatures on turn 2, which happened to me during the quarterfinals while I just had a ! Here's where Matt comes back into the picture, as I'd asked them the same question.
They said aggro is more about consistency than being fast or powerful. The most important aspect of playing aggro is making your opponent play your game and at your pace. To do that, your deck has to be reliable and threatening at the same time. You don't want to play in an aggressive deck; it shouldn't be about fixing your mana. It should be about applying pressure every chance you get to maximize the possibility that your opponents make mistakes and therefore maximize your opportunities to capitalize on them. It made sense, so I stuck with it.
As far as changes to the deck going forward, I think you can safely cut for a fourth Pillar of Flame in the main. If the metagame stays nearly the same, you can cut from the sideboard for +1 , +1 , +1 , and +1 . If you see Esper/Turbo Fog Bant come back in force, then just go back to . If Lingering Souls starts popping up again in Reanimator, maybe take out a and a from the main and add two . Basically, just adjust it to what changes the popular decks have made to beat you and try to stay one step ahead.
Well, there is not much else to say. I'm honestly still kind of stunned that I won. I'm proud I finally won something big, and it just means so much to me—it's redeeming. Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed this semi-Gruul report of how I won the StarCityGames.com Standard Open in Charlotte. GO MEAT!

Lunada Bay is one of the most scenic spots in Southern California. Located in the affluent Los Angeles suburb of Palos Verdes Estates, it has sweeping views of the Pacific and the multi-million dollar homes to match.
It also has a reputation for bullies.
Lunada Bay has long been one of Southern California's most hostile surf spots. For decades, groups of "selfish rich kids" have made it nearly impossible for anyone considered a "non-local" to visit or surf the break.
Access to the Bay is down a trail, where "Bay Boys" have been known to ambush visitors, harassing them both verbally and physically. Lately, however, the chosen form of deterrence seems to be throwing rocks and damaging cars that are parked nearby. (One Bay Boy was recently caught on camera when they threw a rock at a drone that was trying to videotape the bay.)
Advocates of the Bay Boys argue that they are simply trying to preserve the spot and limit its exposure to pollutants and crowding. But a group of peaceful, protesting surfers have started a movement to take back Lunada Bay. The protesters have renamed the Bay "Aloha Point" and held a rally there on Jan. 20.
"There are so many people just in this neighborhood alone that want to surf here," Christopher Taloa, an organizer of the movement, told KTLA. "And they can't because they're scared."
At the rally, a small group of surfers paddled out to the break and a group of around 25 more gathered to watch from a nearby cliff. Although the police were on stand-by, the rally was relatively uneventful.
According to The Inertia, the "anti-bully" movement began with a thread on Reddit.
"It's hard to believe a relatively small crew of spoiled trust fund babies have successfully kept one of LA county's best waves under wraps for decades," one user wrote. "Through violence, intimidation, and with the de facto blessing of the local police, the Lunada Bay locals have worked a miracle."
Many protesters believe the police have been relatively uninvolved, claiming that most of the Bay Boys come from wealthy families and that their actions represent the desired exclusivity of the community.
Protesters also point out that the bullies are doing exactly what they prevent outsiders from doing at the Bay. "The same sociopath rich boy asshole who's tossing rocks at your head ... is surfing your local break most of the time," the Reddit user explains. "He's paddling out in Torrance, Hermosa and Manhattan Beach. He's taking road trips to Baja, flying to Oahu in the Winter. He's joining the pack at Lowers, and snagging sets in Huntington Beach."
"People are truly afraid of these Lunada Bay guys," a member of the Facebook group "Aloha Point Surf Club" told the Huffington Post. "And for good reason it seems."
Most recently, the Bay Boys allegedly harassed U.S. Army veteran Geri Lewis, who wrote about their experience in a Jan. 25 blog post:
"I've been surfing here stealth for several decades and I know the routine as well as [the] danger ... from the surfer thugs who call themselves The Bay boys ... This silver spoon in mouth, trust fund recipients are no different than the gangsters of Compton, Watts, Inglewood ... they share the same despicable penchant for violence, intimidation, and entitlement."
In their encounter, Lewis describes how the locals threw rocks and heckled them and their friend as they walked down to the shoreline. While in the water, a group of locals continued to threaten and yell at the veteran. Lewis claims that one even attempted to hit them as they surfed a wave. Still, Lewis saw them as "no threat, just barking like a rabid dog with no bite."
"The fact that we are humans, citizens and had every right to surf at Lunada Bay had no effect on their conscience," Lewis wrote. "The strange thing is the guys are in their 40s and 50s. What a shame."
In 2010, the bay was ranked as the number one place in Los Angeles "to get punched out in the surf" by LAsurfspots.com. A Yelp review page for Lunada Bay, however, contains mixed reviews. Some claim that "the best [thing] about this spot [is] the locals" and that "everyone is welcome." Other reviews warn of the locals and their "long and violent history of harassing visitors."
While posts on the "Aloha Point Surf Club" page suggest that the harassment of "outsiders" hasn't completely ceased, the new surf club seems hopeful. Posts by the group encourage surfers to bring a buddy for protection and a camera to document harassment of any kind.
"It's awesome to see that we don't need huge numbers to change how things are at this spot," the group recently wrote in a post. "Just a handful of respectful and dedicated folks each day ... to change the vibe from negative to positive."
"This cause is bigger than us," one of the organizers told HuffPost. "It's for everyone in this country who's ever enjoyed the ocean."
SmartTrack is a go, Mayor John Tory insists. The experts are working away on reports and studies about the $8-billion transit plan. Squads of officials are shuttling to the provincial transit agency, Metrolinx, to discuss it. Ottawa has signed on with a pledge of $2.6-billion in funding. Justin Trudeau promised during the election campaign that they would come through with the money if they became prime minister.
There is just one problem: No one seems to be entirely sure whether SmartTrack can work.When Mr. Tory rolled out the idea during last year's Toronto election campaign, they called it a "surface subway." Instead of running underground, SmartTrack vehicles would use the GO train tracks that branch out from Union Station, creating a 22-stop high-frequency service that would open in 2021.
To many weary commuters, that sounded dandy. The SmartTrack pitch helped Mr. Tory beat Olivia Chow and Doug Ford for mayor last October. But as it was obvious from the start, and is becoming clearer the more officials study the idea, some serious questions need to be answered.
Story continues below advertisement
Is there enough demand to justify a project that would be so expensive to build and then to run? No one can say. City staff are hoping a new ridership-forecasting model coming from the University of Toronto will help them figure it out.
Could Union Station handle the extra traffic? The transit hub is already bracing for much more train traffic as GO expands its service. Metrolinx says adding more "will be challenging."
Would SmartTrack riders pay the same fares as TTC users, as Mr. Tory originally suggested, or would they pay the higher GO fares? If they have to pay more, would they even ride the new line? If not, who would pay for running the thing? Fare integration throughout Greater Toronto is under study. No decisions have been made.
Is it realistic to build a SmartTrack spur along Eglinton Avenue West, as Mr. Tory proposed? A new city report says western routes would involve tunnelled and elevated sections (which would be expensive), as well as "significant impacts" on the surrounding community. This part of the plan probably won't happen.
How will Toronto pay for its one-third share of the cost of SmartTrack? Mr. Tory has promised not to charge ratepayers more on their property tax. They would use something called Tax Increment Financing instead. That, too, is under study.
The biggest question about SmartTrack is whether it even makes sense. The provincial government is already promising to spend billions to increase traffic on the GO rail lines, transforming GO from a rush-hour service to an all-day commuter-rail service with electric trains and shorter travelling times. That means running more trains and making the rails more crowded. Extra SmartTrack stations and trains would only increase the crowding. GO doesn't want to see its regional express service clogged by urban train service running on the same corridors.
The SmartTrack idea is turning out to be a classic can of worms. Even its supporters have doubts. "I'm a supporter of SmartTrack, but I'm starting to wonder whether I know exactly what it is," Councillor Joe Mihevc said on Tuesday at a meeting of the city's executive committee. "The whole concept is a bit fuzzy."
Story continues below advertisement
Story continues below advertisement
Is SmartTrack just an enhanced version of GO, with more stations and more trains, doubters wonder? Or is it a completely separate service, running on the same tracks?
The city report on the project concedes that "reconciling the different objectives" of SmartTrack and GO regional express service and "identifying the optimal service concept and infrastructure plan to best serve Toronto's transit needs will take several phases of analysis."
Mr. Tory, a bushy-tailed optimist by nature, is undeterred. They say they didn't have the luxury of hiring a battery of experts to work out the kinks in the plan when they came up with it in the middle of the election campaign last year. Now that the experts are on it, they say they are confident that they will iron them out. Don't be a "Debbie or Douglas downer," they told their critics on Tuesday. After all, they said, Toronto now has a specific promise from the man who will be prime minister to pay for Ottawa's share of SmartTrack.
What it doesn't have yet, however, is anything near to a solid plan. The fares, the way the city will pay for its share, the exact route, where the stations will go, even the feasibility of the whole thing – all of this is up in the air. One year after Mr. Tory's election, SmartTrack is still more concept than project.
The Daily Show's "field reporters" have dealt with a fair amount of hilariously oblivious responses from interviewees over the years, but on last night's show, correspondent Aasif Mandvi appeared to have been caught off-guard by just how hilariously oblivious their interviewee was.
Speaking with Buncombe County Republican precinct chair Don Yelton on the subject of North Carolina's controversial voter ID law, Mandvi attempted to prompt a reaction by declaring "the law is not racist, and you're not racist."
Expecting Yelton to fire back with an unequivocal "no," Mandvi was instead treated to several long seconds of introspection, followed by, "well, I've been called a bigot before."
Then, as they say, things got weird.
Yelton attempted to explain away the charges of racism — always a good idea — by: 1. Insisting that one of their best friends is black; 2. claiming that the photo of Obama dressed as a witch doctor that they shared on their Facebook page was making fun of their "white half"; recalling how, when they were young, black people were called "negras"; and bemoaning the fact that black people can use the word "nigger" but they can't.
"You know that we can hear you, right?" asks a visibly nonplussed Mandvi.
But Yelton wasn't done yet: In a stunning acknowledgement of the law's true intention, the GOP leader admitted its main purpose was not to prevent alleged voter fraud, but "to kick Democrats in the butt."
Speaking later with the Mountain Xpress, Yelton seemed aware that their interview might make them seem racist.
"The questions were such that the answers can be played with. I expect them to play with my answers for racism," they told the paper.
Update 5:05 p.m.: Don Yelton has resigned their post as precinct chairperson effective immediately.
Buncombe GOP Chairman Henry Mitchell called Yelton's comments on The Daily Show "offensive, uniformed and unacceptable of any member within the Republican Party," and called on them to step down.
The state's GOP leadership issued a similar call for their resignation, which they reportedly tendered this afternoon.

Despite our unbeaten streak being ended in December, Liverpool still enjoyed a strong month heading into the January transfer window. We picked up wins over both Manchester clubs but suffered disappointing losses to both West Ham and Sunderland.
January could be an important month in the title race as we face league leaders, Arsenal, at the Emirates. We face reigning champions Leicester away from home and also have our first FA Cup tie away to Brighton. With the transfer restrictions now lifted, I will look to add some depth to our squad despite being given a small transfer budget.

January 2017
Tactic
We are keeping the faith in the tactic that has propelled us to second in the table. Daniel Sturridge's brace against Manchester City has now cemented their place as my first-choice striker ahead of Roberto Firmino. Having Sadio Mane and Adam Lallana back from injuries is a huge bonus. Also, going forward, I will be removing the screenshot of the line-ups and writing them as text instead.
2nd January – Arsenal (A)
Our first game of 2017 and it's a big one. We travel to the Emirates chasing the home side in the league table. Arsene Wenger's men have a six point lead on us at the moment which will be cut to three if we can secure the victory. The Gunners have blown everyone out of the water this season and will be a tough test for the boys. Loris Karius replaces Simon Mignolet; Jordan Henderson takes Georginio Wijnaldum's place, and Lallana is fit enough to start.
Line-Up:
Karius; Clyne, Matip, Gomez, Moreno; Emre Can, Lallana, Henderson; Mane, Coutinho, Sturridge
Result: Arsenal 0-2 Liverpool
A huge win and our result of the season so far. We dominated the early stages and deserved our opener; Mane scoring a terrific solo goal, running from their own half to score from distance. Arsenal posed little threat without Alexis Sanchez, and Lallana sealed the points with a sensational curling effort from the edge of the box. Everyone stepped up and performed when it really mattered. Now our attention switches to the FA Cup.
7th January – Brighton (A)
Our first FA Cup fixture is a tricky away tie against Brighton. The Seagulls are currently in the play-off places in the Championship and will be fired up to get a win against elite opposition. I have decided to ring the changes and give some fringe players a chance. It will also be an opportunity to field some youngsters and see what they can do.
Line-Up:
Karius; Alexander-Arnold, Klavan, Sakho, Milner; Stewart, Grujic, Brannagan; Woodburn, Firmino, Ings
Result: Brighton 4-0 Liverpool
Oh dear. It's fair to say that was not the plan. We were outclassed from start to finish and Brighton thoroughly deserve to progress to the next round. Our defence completely fell apart, Ragnar Klavan and Trent Alexander-Arnold were awful. James Milner struggled at left-back, and I won't be playing them there again. I know that I fielded a weakened side, but I expected much more with the quality of Firmino and Danny Ings. There is nothing much more to say about this one; we just have to move on and focus on the league; which is the only piece of silverware we can win this season. Disappointing.
8th January – Transfer Update
Our first signing! Spanish midfielder, Marco Asensio, was unhappy with their playing time at Real Madrid and expressed their desire to leave the club. Considered a young player with high potential, I decided to spend the majority of my transfer budget to bring them to Anfield.  They are capable of playing attacking or centre midfield and fits the role of advanced playmaker perfectly. Leaving the club will be Sheyi Ojo and Pedro Chirivella who will join Ipswich and Birmingham on loan.
14th January – Southampton (H)
We needed a response after our humbling in the cup and what better team to do it against than Southampton. The Saints destroyed us in August during our rough start, but we are a different side now. We owe them one after our last meeting, and I expect a result after our early cup exit. All the first team players have been recalled, and Asensio makes their debut. Firmino replaces Mane.
Line-Up:
Karius; Clyne, Matip, Gomez, Moreno; Emre Can, Asensio, Henderson; Firmino, Coutinho, Sturridge
Result: Liverpool 7-3 Southampton
What a match! This game had it all! I thought we had got off to the perfect start when Sturridge won a penalty in the sixth minute only for the debutant Asensio to fluff their lines. 20 minutes later, we find ourselves two goals down from their first two shots. Sturridge then bagged a pen and scored another just a moment later. Dusan Tadic had restored their lead before a Coutinho free-kick made the score at 3-3 during the interval. Our second half performance was phenomenal, Sturridge completed their hat-trick and grabbed their fourth as well as both Joe Gomez and Joel Matip getting on the scoresheet. A fantastic result but Asensio managed just a 5.5 rating and was substituted at half-time. Not ideal.
18th January – Leicester (A)
After a rollercoaster of a game against Southampton, we travel to the King Power Stadium to face reigning champions Leicester, who are currently loitering above the relegation zone. It has been quite the fall from grace for the Foxes, who recently dismissed Claudio Ranieri and are without a manager for this fixture. Alberto Moreno and Joel Matip are suspended and are replaced by Klavan and Dejan Lovren. Asensio is on the bench following a dreadful debut.
Line-Up:
Karius; Clyne, Lovren, Gomez, Klavan; Emre Can, Lallana, Henderson; Firmino, Coutinho, Sturridge
Result: Leicester 2-3 Liverpool
Another whirlwind of a game but three points is all the matters. Jamie Vardy had opened the scoring before Sturridge equalised shortly after. A mistake by Klavan gave Vardy their second of the game from the penalty spot. After some stern words in the dressing room, things went from bad to worse as Sturridge left the pitch due to injury. Luckily for Liverpool, they have an expert manager, who brought on Divock Origi and Wijnaldum, who both scored the goals that secured us the win.
21st January – Stoke (A)
Our last fixture in January is a trip to Stoke. The Potters currently occupy ninth in the league and are enjoying some good form. Joe Allen faces their former club while Sturridge misses this one due to the injury they suffered against Leicester. I have faith in Origi to do a job in their absence. A result here could be crucial in the title race.
Line-Up:
Karius; Clyne, Lovren, Gomez, Klavan; Emre Can, Lallana, Henderson; Firmino, Coutinho, Origi
Result: Stoke 0-2 Liverpool
Who needs Sturridge? Our Belgian wonderkid put Mark Hughes' side to the sword with a magnificent performance. It took just 12 minutes for Origi to open the scoring, using their pace to burst past the defence before slotting past Jack Butland. Some good work from Firmino gave them an easy tap-in for their brace in the second half. A brilliant away performance.
31st January – Transfer Window Closes
The transfer window has shut, and the addition of Asensio remains our only piece of business. I was hoping the board would provide some extra funds, but it wasn't to be. Lovren spoke to me about moving to China, who could offer them substantial wages, and I decided to let them go when Quanjian came calling with a £18m offer. Kevin Stewart and Marko Grujic left on loan. I decided to save the money from Lovren's transfer as there were no appealing options on deadline day.
Despite an early exit from the FA Cup, January was a strong month for us. Beating Arsenal was crucial to our title hopes, but we will be relying on other sides to do a similar job when they face the Gunners. We avenged our defeat to Southampton and picked up solid away victories at Leicester and Stoke. I would have liked to add more players to our squad, but I am happy with the signing of Asensio, but they need to kick on following a poor debut. We have plenty of depth in defence, so Lovren will not be missed.
Next Episode:
– West Brom (H)
– Tottenham (A)
– Swansea (H)
– Middlesbrough (A)
Will we be able to catch Arsenal and gain ground in the Premier League title race? Stay tuned for the next episode to find out…

What happens when the Prince of Darkness covers the King of Pop?
Miles Davis' decision to record a studio version of Michael Jackson's 1983 hit, “Human Nature,” caused Al Foster, their friend and drummer, to walk out mid-session, thus putting an end to their longtime collaboration. Davis chalked it up to Foster's unwillingness to “play that funky backbeat,” and brought in their nephew, Vince Wilburn, Jr., to finish the job.
Foster must've really hated that song.
Say what you will, "Human Nature" is--like most Jackson hits--an ear worm.
Depending on who you talk to, Davis' studio track, above, is a either straightforward homage in which their horn recreates “Jackson's breathy intimacy” or “flat, schmaltzy elevator music.”
People's feelings for it tend to echo their response to Jackson's original, to which Davis cleaved pretty closely.
“Human Nature” was written by Toto's keyboardist Steve Porcaro, the son of a jazz musician who idolized Davis. They were understandably honored that their dad's hero chose to cover their work along with Cyndi Lauper's "Time after Time," on 1985's You're Under Arrest, one of the prolific artist's final albums.
Davis' association no doubt contributes to the tune's ongoing popularity. Those who want to compare and contrast, can take their pick of reggae, hip-hop, electronica and funked up New Orleans brass versions.
But back to “Human Nature” as rendered by Miles Davis. Most critics prefer the live version, below, captured July 7, 1988, at Montreux. Slate's Fred Kaplan described it as “an upbeat rouser” through which Davis “prances.”
As Davis themselves explained in a 1985 interview with Richard Cook:
On a song like “Human Nature,” you have to play the right thing. And the right thing is around the melody. I learned that stuff from Coleman Hawkins. Coleman could play a melody, get ad-libs, run the chords – and you still heard the melody. I play “Human Nature,” varies every night. After I play the melody, that tag on the end is mine to have fun with. It's in another key … uh, D natural. Move up a step or so to F natural. Then you can play it any way you want to.
Another remark from the same interview proved prescient:
You don't have to do like Wynton Marsalis and play “Stardust “and that shit… Why can't "Human Nature" be a standard? It fits. A standard fits like a thoroughbred. The melody and everything is just right, and every time you hear it you want to hear it some more. And you leave enough of it to know what you want to hear again. When you hear it again, the same feeling comes over you.

ETH is and always will be a bunch of coders in a room hacking stuff together, and because of that, there are going to be huge flaws and vulnerabilities in the code that are going to continually pop up... think DAO.
It's inevitable because of how complex smart contracts are; no human being is capable of perfectly coding anything, especially something as complex as smart contracts. Charles and Cardano understand this, so they used the waterfall, high-assurance, development model to build the Cardano SL mainnet, the foundational layer of the Cardano project. This alone, sets Cardano apart from all other projects, but they went even further; Cardano has academically vetted and conference approved research papers that underly all of its code; no other project that i know of has done this.
Furthermore, Cardano is using a functional programming language (Haskell) and psi-calculus to bring together the fundamental concepts of the research papers, directly and PROVABLY, into the code; this is the first time I have ever heard of a large commercial project doing this.
Seriously, it's not even a competition; it's only a matter of time before Cardano overtakes Ethereum... bitcoin will always be bitcoin (digital gold), but Cardano is the future of blockchain technology. Hands down.

They have created a brilliant system, i am so impacient about seeing cardano going up to be in the top five, in fact, Cardano deserves to be in there more than iota, i dont know why it is still so far from it.
but in a few months from now, cardano will explode, just remember my words, this coin is going to be a boom during the next year. Maybe not the same as ethereum is, but it is going to be big anyway.
You are in love with cardano.. wow, but i really think the same as you do.They have created a brilliant system, i am so impacient about seeing cardano going up to be in the top five, in fact, Cardano deserves to be in there more than iota, i dont know why it is still so far from it.but in a few months from now, cardano will explode, just remember my words, this coin is going to be a boom during the next year.

December 05, 2017, 11:07:17 PM #9 We know that ethereum has introduced a world of new possibilities through intelligent contracts and here comes Cardano that aims to become the new platform for the creation of smart contracts. among the improvements Cardan brings is that it has developed a completely new language for its more secure applications called Plutus, which is based loosely on Haskell. Haskell allows the code to be written in a more secure and reliable way since it has a mathematical approach . This mathematical security test, which is a unique security protocol, has undergone a rigorous peer review and was accepted at Crypto 2017, the largest cryptocurrency event of the year. It uses Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL), which is a first security protocol to further protect users. This language will be distributed to developers to integrate it into their development process along with a specialized set of tools for formal verification.
A new piece of legislation working its way through the Senate has drawn attention for its attempt to criminalize boycotts against Israel. The bill would make it a felony punishable by a fine and imprisonment to support the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement against Israel for human rights violations against the Palestinians. From the civil rights era boycotts of segregated buses and businesses that did not cater to Black people, to the anti-apartheid struggles, boycotts have become an important part of the American legacy of free speech as enshrined in the First Amendment. Civil liberties groups and critics across the political spectrum have cited the chilling effect the bill would have on freedom of speech if enacted into law. The vague language of the legislation, harsh penalties, and a failure of lawmakers to read the text of the bill have caused its sponsors to reconsider their support.
The bipartisan-sponsored bill, S.720, also known as the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, would prohibit support for boycotts by international governmental organizations against Israel, with punishment for violators ranging from a penalty between $250,000 and $1 million, and/or up to 20 years in prison. In the Senate, the bill attracted 46 supporters, 31 Republican and 15 Democratic, while the House version has 234 supporters from both sides of the aisle. Lobbying for the bill is the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC)— the pro-Israel group that helped write the legislation and reportedly has made its passage a top priority this year. AIPAC has faced criticism for promoting the right-wing policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party, and competition from younger, progressive Jewish groups such as J Street, Jewish Voice for Peace, T'ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights, and IfNotNow, who oppose the occupation.
Also lobbying for the bill is the evangelical group Christians United for Israel. Pastor John Hagee, the founder of the organization, told NPR that “those who live by the Qur'an have a scriptural mandate to kill Christians and Jews. … It teaches that very clearly.” In 2008, Republican presidential candidate John McCain rejected Hagee's endorsement due to their extremist views, which included claims that Adolf Hitler was a “hunter” of Jews sent by God to get Jews to return to Israel. The radical pastor also blamed the unraveling of America on “nasty” welfare recipients and “pedophile” immigrants.
In a letter to the Senate, the ACLU expressed its opposition to the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, and urged lawmakers to oppose and refrain from cosponsoring the bill because it punishes people and businesses for their political beliefs, a violation of the First Amendment. The organization does not take a stand on boycotts against Israel or any country. “The bill would amend those laws to bar U.S. persons from supporting boycotts against Israel, including its settlements in the Palestinian Occupied Territories, conducted by international governmental organizations, such as the United Nations and the European Union. It would also broaden the law to include penalties for simply requesting information about such boycotts,” read the letter from Faiz Shakir, ACLU National Political Director. Shakir added that under the bill, only those whose lack of business dealings with Israel is politically motivated are subject to penalties, even though many others also do not do business with Israel.
The conservative National Review came out against the bill as well, calling it “unconstitutional and unconscionable.” The author of the commentary, Noah Daponte-Smith, argued the supporters of the measure “should be, quite frankly, ashamed of themselves; they have lost sight of one of the founding principles of American government, allowing it to be overshadowed by the spectral world of the Israeli–Palestinian dispute.”
Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, who authored the bill, told The Intercept they are open to amending it to address these concerns, while claiming the ACLU misinterpreted the legislation. The organization stood by its interpretation in a Washington Post op-ed.
The BDS movement began in 2005 as an outgrowth of Palestinian civil society, a nonviolent effort to place pressure on Israel to respect Palestinian rights. Originating with 170 Palestinian organizations, the movement has become global. Inspired by the South African anti-apartheid movement, BDS says it urges Israel to comply with international law. “Israel is occupying and colonising Palestinian land, discriminating against Palestinian citizens of Israel and denying Palestinian refugees the right to return to their homes,” says the BDS website. The Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank (the “Occupied Territories” Israel took over in the 1967 Six-Day War), is half a century old, and the United Nations has declared by resolution that Israel's settlements on Palestinian land “had no legal validity, constituting a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the vision of two States living side-by-side in peace and security, within internationally recognized borders.”
There is no consensus regarding the merits of BDS as a tactic. For example, some organizations oppose the Israeli occupation and advocate for Palestinian human rights, yet do not support the BDS movement. However, BDS, like the movement against South African apartheid in an earlier generation, is having an impact and gaining momentum, as evidenced by the pushback inherent in this current legislation.
A number of U.S. states have followed suit in the response to BDS. In 2016, New York became the first state to divest public funds supporting the BDS movement. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order directing state government to compile a list of institutions and companies that engage in boycotts, divestment and sanctions against the Mideast nation through a parent or subsidiary. The governor also directed all state agencies and authorities to “divest their money and assets from any investment in any institution or company” on the list. North Carolina is poised to become the 22nd U.S. state to punish companies that do business in their state and participate in the boycott of Israel.
In its extensive policy platform, the Movement for Black Lives calls for a struggle against anti-BDS bills in states across the country, which it says not only harms the movement to end the occupation, but threatens free speech and protest. “Israel is an apartheid state with over 50 laws on the books that sanction discrimination against the Palestinian people. Palestinian homes and land are routinely bulldozed to make way for illegal Israeli settlements,” the group says in its platform. “Israeli soldiers also regularly arrest and detain Palestinians as young as 4 years old without due process. [Every day], Palestinians are forced to walk through military checkpoints along the US-funded apartheid wall.” According to the Movement for Black Lives, the United States is complicit in a genocide against the Palestinian people, with Israel using 75 percent of its military aid to purchase American-manufactured arms, funneling billions of taxpayer dollars to arms corporations, who in turn lobby for increases in foreign military aid. The use of the words “genocide” and “apartheid” in the platform language on Israel-Palestine drew criticism from some Jewish organizations.
“The results of this policy are twofold: it not only diverts much needed funding from domestic education and social programs, but it makes US citizens complicit in the abuses committed by the Israeli government,” the platform said, connecting the dots between war abroad and domestic social programs, reminiscent of Martin Luther King's stance against the war in Vietnam.
Other groups have linked the suffering of Black and Palestinian people. Palestinian activists used Twitter to instruct protesters in Ferguson, Mo., on how to deal with police tear gas, and delegations of Black activists have traveled to the Occupied Territories as well as Palestinian activists have visited Black organizers in the United States.

In 2015, on the anniversary of the 2014 Israeli invasion of Gaza, over 1,100 Black activists, artists, scholars, students and organizations signed a statement in “solidarity with the Palestinian struggle” calling for a boycott of companies profiting from the Israeli occupation, including the private prison company G4S. Operation Protective Edge left at least 2,104 Palestinians dead, according to the United Nations — including 1,462 civilians, of whom 495 were children and 253 were women — as well as 66 Israeli soldiers and seven Israeli civilians. Sixty leading Black and Palestinian activists and artists were featured in a video highlighting the commonalities of suffering in both communities, including police violence and prisons.
The move to silence free speech in the United States concerning the boycott of a foreign country has implications for those Americans, including Black people, who have been engaged in a long tradition of boycott as a means of social change. The civil rights movement has employed boycotts as an effective organizing tool, and it is conceivable that such methods will prove useful once again. Organizations may promote sanctions, divestment and boycotts against individual states for their civil and human rights abuses and discriminatory policies. It does not take much of a stretch to envision the enactment of laws criminalizing economic boycotts, divestment or sanctions targeting the United States or individual U.S. states as a means of silencing Black people and their calls for justice at home.
People can agree on whether to boycott, but all should agree that such activity is protected speech which should not be criminalized. Already, according to the ACLU, more than 30 bills in 20 states have been introduced to criminalize peaceful protest.

Republicans are getting very nervous about Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman's re-election chances, now that the lowly, humiliating, obviously undeserving comedian [/wingnutspeak] Al Franken has pulled into the lead in their recount, according to the Star-Tribune, which puts Franken's lead at "about 250".
Sam Stein reports that analyses now project that Franken will win when the dust settles:
As it stands now, it seems likely that Franken will end this process with a lead wider than even their campaign expected. Earlier projections, from the Associated Press, Star Tribune and Franken himself, suggested that Coleman would lose the race by roughly 20 votes or fewer. And this tally doesn't even take into consideration the legal and political battle being waged over wrongfully rejected absentee ballots, which the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled, on Thursday, should be counted. That decision, another loss for the Coleman campaign, could mean even more votes flowing into Franken's tally, though the Court also stressed that the state and both campaigns come up with a uniform standard for identifying these absentee ballots before they are counted.
I wonder how those Senate Democrats who were telling some talking heads anonymously last month that they might be relieved not to have "that comedian" in the Senate are feeling. Poor babies.
The best part of all this is that Franken's election will absolutely drive the wingnuts batty. This will make for some good high comedy in the weeks and months to come, no doubt.
Google has unveiled a new way to allow anyone to create their own personalized Street View map of their location. The company states in a blog post that a Street View experience can be created just by using photos taken from either Google's Photo Sphere technology or a dSLR camera.
Often times, a user may take a journey through a country or location and find the need to share their trip with others. It's one thing to show friends and family photos, but it's another to have them assigned to points on a map. Until now, Street Views were limited to only what Google offered, but now, anyone can create these map formats.
Evan Rapoport, the Product Manager for Google Maps & Photo Spheres, says that images can be uploaded to Google's Views service. Then, select these photo spheres from your profile and use this new tool to connect the map and images together. All created maps can be embedded onto any website or application using the Google Maps API.
Here is an example Rapoport created from photo spheres taken from their Android phone and dSLR camera from their vacation in the UK:

N26, a mobile-first bank available in Europe, has announced plans to launch in the U.S. next year, representing the first non-EU market for the company.
Founded out of Berlin in 2013 originally as Number26, N26 offers online-only bank accounts through Android and iOS apps, with a focus on speed and efficiency — an account can be opened within eight minutes of applying. The service has slowly been expanding across the Eurozone since its initial rollout in Germany and Austria, and now claims 500,000 customers in 17 countries including France, Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands.
N26 has raised more than $50 million since its inception, with participation from notable backers such as Peter Thiel's Valar Ventures, which led its series A round back in 2015 and joined again for the $40 million series B follow-up in June 2016.
Speaking at the Money2020 Conference in Las Vegas today, cofounder and CEO Valentin Stalf said that interested customers can sign up to join the waiting list from today, though they won't be able to open an account until the middle of 2018.
“We believe that N26 is a role model for the bank of the future,” said Stalf. “Customers around the globe are looking for a new banking experience, as user behavior among millennials has shifted dramatically towards a mobile experience. The U.S. is an exciting new market which offers a huge opportunity for N26.”
N26 is a similar proposition to other services already offered in the U.S., such as Simple, which was acquired by Spain's BBVA back in 2014. For launch, N26 will offer a mobile-focused checking account similar to what it offers in Europe already, which will include a bank card, money transfers, cash withdrawals, and other features “tailored to the U.S. market,” such as a customer reward program.
Rebundling
Though N26 started life as a simple online bank, it has a long-term goal of creating a modern bank constructed from various fintech technologies and services that have emerged during the internet age. Last year, for example, N26 partnered with peer-to–peer money-transfer firm TransferWise, giving Number26 customers access to cheap international money transfer tools, while it later went on to launch a new investment product in conjunction with Vaamo and a savings account in partnership with Raisin. And a few months back, N26 added insurance to its bag of tricks courtesy of a tie-up with German insurance platform Clark.
N26 will likely have to ink separate partnerships for the U.S. market, but the company will follow a similar model to its European operations — it ultimately wants to build a “FinTech hub” and become a “one-stop shop for all its customers' financial needs,” the company added.
Headquartered in Berlin, N26 currently claims 290 employees, but it will have to ramp up its operations considerably to tackle the U.S. when it finally launches. For now, the company has revealed that it will operate as N26 Inc. in the U.S., and will be based in New York. Additionally, to save it from having to acquire its own banking licence, it will work in conjunction with a hitherto undisclosed partner bank to offer its service.

Former Tiger Prince Fielder seems to be the gift that just keeps giving.
After Fielder was traded to the Rangers, late last Thursday night, comments continued to roll in from the old Tigers first baseman. First there was the teleconference with the Texas Media on Friday where Fielder said “Whatever I did last year, I'll do the opposite this year. It was cool. The season went fine. It is what it is. You can't take it back. We went to the playoffs. We didn't go as far as we wanted to go but everybody is still alive.”
I especially love the last part of that quote where Prince made sure to tell the media that everybody is still alive, which to me means, Tiger fans should just move on already. Yes they played awful in the most important games of the season and they got paid a ton to do so, but, hey, nobody was killed, so all is good. Right?
And then came Monday, when the Rangers held a press conference to announce their new first baseman.
“Last year was last year” Fielder said. “Everybody was on me a little bit about my performance which is rightfully so. You know I sucked, but I didn't have to be reminded of it; (laughing) so hopefully we can make some better memories here.”
I give credit to Fielder for always speaking their mind, even if they say things that will infuriate the fan base. However why can't athletes, not just Fielder, understand that when they don't perform, they'll get booed. Despite what many players, coaches and managers have said, fan care just as much, if not more than the people getting paid to be in the game. And, the only way fans have to express themselves is to boo, go on social media or call our radio station. It's never anything personal. Play well and people love you, don't and they loathe you. It's a pretty basic equation. It's annoying to hear Prince admit that they sucked and then make a joke about the spectators reminding them of it.
Fielder was also asked about their comments after game 6 in Boston after the Tigers were eliminated from the ALCS. You know the ones I'm talking about. The ones where Fielder didn't seem fazed by losing the series, minutes after it was over. The ones where they repeated over and over and over again that they had kids and they had to go and take care of them. Yes, those comments…
Well, Prince thinks it was unfair for fans or media members to hold those words against him.
“I think it was unfair, because if I was throwing helmets, I would have been a crybaby. Either way, I was kind of screwed” Fielder said.
I actually think fans would have loved it if they threw a couple helmets.
Last time I checked Justin Verlander, Max Scherzer, Torii Hunter, Miguel Cabrera, Austin Jackson and every other player that was interviewed after the ALCS didn't throw helmets nor sent the message that they were already over the loss and they weren't “screwed.”
Fielder also admitted that they were surprised that they had been traded and that they accepted the deal because they thought it would benefit parties, them and the Tigers.
And then there is the matter of their number…
Fielder will be wearing number 84 in Texas. When asked why they decided to switch to the new digits from the number 28 that they donned in Detroit, they said “I just wanted a new number-fresh start, fresh number.” A reporter then asked Prince if they could go a little deeper into the reason for the number change and Fielder said “84 is the year that I was born and it's just fresh, so I think it works.”
Fielder then mumbled under their breath “that's as deep as I'm going.”
The meaning?
Could it be that Prince has decided to wear number 84 to remind every Tiger fan that the guy Detroit brought in to win a World Series is now in Texas wearing the year on their back of Detroit's last World Championship? Is it one last parting dig to Detroit and the fans that wanted them gone so bad?
It could be I suppose.
I didn't think of the theory, but I might agree with it.
What about you?
Listen to the audio clip below to hear more from Fielder's introductory press conference in Texas.

Hi, Customers:
One of our supplier Pico just release their new all in one VR headset in Beijing today. They call it : Pico Neo, the world's first all in one VR HMD which base on Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, and support lots of amazing features.
Before we introduce this new headset, we want to talk about Pico.
Pico is belonged to Goer Tek Inc, a chinese listed company, you might never hear this company before, but they are the company which behind samsung gear vr, oculus and even sony ps vr. This three VR headset is well known in market, and they all use Goer Tek as the manufacture.
Pico is Goer Tek's brand in chinese market, and because of the rich experience in VR headset produce, we have high hope for their all in one device.
Now let's talk about the Pico Neo.
Pico Neo is a powerful VR headset which base on Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, equip 4G LPDDR4, and 32G eMMC 5.1, support max 128G micro sd card expanded.
The biggest difference between pico neo and other all in one device is the split design. Pico Neo put the cpu, ram, storage, battery etc in the remote, open the remote, you will saw this:
and then put the screen, lenes in the helmet. The Helmet support to connect PC directly:
offer 90hz screen refresh rate. and connect the remote and helmet together, you get the all-in-one VR HMD.
The advantage of this design solve the heat problem in traditional VR headset, and help to make the HMD light. Here is the basic information for both part:
The remote has 220g, and the HMD is just 320g.
Now let's check the screen and optics in the separate HMD.
It built in 2pcs 3.81inch AMOLED screen, resolution is 1200×1080 and 90Hz screen refresh rate(same as Oculus and HTC VIVE, and most cardboard style just offer 60Hz).
Pico Neo use aspheric lenses, has 102 degree FOV, focus adjustment, support 0-800 degree myopia.
There is also 9 axis sensor and range sensors ( same like Gear VR) in the HMD, offer lower than 20ms latency.
Pico Neo HMD use the built-in usb type c cable (length 110cm) to connect with the remote, it also has micro usb port, 3.5mm audio port, and built in 16K/16bit microphone.
About the remote, we have talked above, it has Snapdragon 820 inside, support 802.11ac dual-band wifi and bluetooth 4.1, also have USB 3.0 port.
For the battery, it has 5000mah battery, This large battery can last 3 hours continuous usage, and offer 8-10 hours standby time. Whats more, it supports Qualcomm Quick charge 3.0 technology, and back the battery to life in short time.
Pico Neo also have 6 axis sensors inside,and touchpad in the back of remote, support 4 point touch. The touchpad can compatible with normal android games and VR games.
Beside this, This remote also have Tactile feedback system and DiveSound 3D Audio simulation algorithm. In the help of this, you can feel and hear the virtual surroundings.
Besides the VR HMD, Pico also release the position tracking system,similar like oculus touch , including camera, and controller like PlayStation Move motion controller.
That's all about the hardware, and now let's check the software.
Pico Neo built in PUI which is base on Android 6.0, redesigned for VR headset.
We have been told the first bulk will just support chinese / english.
Pico has their own APP store built in and you can download apps by yourself. Pico work with Archiact Studio to release the first 3 games in Pico Neo, they are 【MUG】Audio Arena, 【TD】EvilRobot Traffic Jam, 【PUZ】WaddleHome, all of the three games are editors picks in Oculus store.
Pico promise to offer high quality content in future.
In the end, Let's check the retail price in china market:
Pico Neo Standard include the HMD and remote, price is 548usd.
Pico Neo Lite which just include the HMD, price is 306usd.
The shipping date is about the end of June.
We will need to talk with Pico and check the oversea retail price. If you are interested in this device, subscribe our newsletter or follow us on Facebook.
Geek buying, As the most professional VR sales platform, has been official certified by PicoVR. We will bring the newest Pico device to you in the first time.
Besides the all-in-one device, Pico also have a GEAR VR style headset, here is the link:
http://www.geekbuying.com/item/Pico-1-3D-VR-Virtual-Reality-Headset-FOV96-IPD-Adjustment-VR-Helmet-for-5-6inch-Android-Smartphones-363586.html
Don't like the cheap cardboard style vr headset, the Pico 1 VR has touchpad, and proximity sensor. the FOV and lenses are also the best quality. We test with our Nexus 6P, perfect size.
Any questions, feel free to comment below.

Oh boy, internet leaks!. Just a few days before it's TV emission we got a present in form of a freshly baked plate of episodes that make a delicious saga of what seems right now the most important plot point of this series (Although, please, support the series on TV or domestic release if you can, this needs views, think on the creators!)
After Islands ended we had to confront two things, as spectators, a higher quality bar than ever, as the previous miniseries had a lot more “plot” content than almost all of the rest of the series. Without trying to disgrace the series, I would say we encountered a lot that filled us with answers and Finn with growth.
And now, is elementals as good as the previous? Is it good? What can we get from this?
(Spoilers, duh!)
Adventure time has a lot of episodes that I would consider “Filler”, and is a series that easily leaves the story open and many questions in the air, without any apparent intention of answering them. With “Islands” I found for the first time a well-constructed saga that attacked this directly and showed us a frontal character and plot development. As Finn said, “This trip is the largest in emotional time”.
Then our heroes return to Ooo, a too weirder Ooo (if that's possible…), and while Finn worries about what happened, Jake demonstrates their irresponsible nature trying to evade what is an obvious problem, just because they are tired. But quickly, the changes are too serious to evade.
After finding what seems a classic trouble, and tossing aside parallel universe theories, the series does something very smart: doubt. Is this wrong? We are presented with what used to be three of the most tormented characters, Plant Finn (Fern), who had serious identity problems; Lemongrab who was a fucking sociopath; and Neptr, who even BMO admits that they didn't use to treat as an equal. And now they are simply… happy.
Is this thing wrong if they can live like this?
I loved the question that the series made us, something new and mature to substitute the classic “this is evil” that has been said hundreds of times in this cartoon. But sadly, we are thrown into one perspective when we see sweetP and what is one of the worst profoundly depressed moment returns of… WHY THE DID YOU DO THAT TO HIM, IS JUST A BABY, RETURN HIM Their PARENTS OH GOOD.
But sadly, we are thrown into a one-sided perspective when we see sweetP and what is one of the worst profoundly depressing moments of… WHY THE DID YOU DO THAT TO HIM, They Are JUST A BABY, RETURN HIM Their PARENTS OH GOOD.
Okay, okay, calm.
After all this chaos, we end with the origin of all the candy with something logical due to the circumstances (and the title of the mini-series). And quickly, skyhooks, which, if you didn't notice, were the Hangers stolen by Ice King in “elemental” to get their keys (XD).
A lot of tension is build up, and we have a break, so we are delighted to have it with Ice King explaining the curse of events in their unique way, and we get to see what happened. Which was very predictable, so Ice King version makes it dynamic and interesting, even if our heroes are as anxious to get the plot (nice metaphor of the series haha).
“I grabbed all the penguins I could: one.”
I love how the ice king maintains their cute relationship with the other wizards, who must know already about their mental problems, but decide to treat them as an equal and have fun and love them anyways, these characters have a lot of value.
Another of Ice king's development we got to see, which is the main theme of the episode (and one of the pillars of the arc) is Betty. We see them erratic, anxious, unstable.  They are in control of their new found crazy magic, but not very fondly, fighting constantly as someone on the line to madness who is about to fall in any misstep.
If we advance forward a bit, I liked the turn of events with the Ice elemental, while in human form they seemed like the most euphoric of the four, they succumbed to their element emotion and became apathetic, even when Finn and CO. were opposing her, and what in first thought was the most dangerous place, turned up being just a fun ride with Simon to get Betty.
Then, in “Cloudy” we finally got some real thoughts of the characters, they stop for a bit (kinda) being so wacky, and tell us what worries them. I loved how Finn finds the words and expresses their preoccupations. But then Jake.
“Jake, I was talking about important stuff!
Jake is always a bad figure for Finn, and it seems like, every time the kid starts developing, the dog stops them with something immature or stupid. Yes, we get to see some good thinking of Jake here, but when Finn finds the courage to open up and talk about what's important to him, their egocentric brother cuts them in the middle of the conversation to express their egoist concerns.
Which, even if I like that they talk about them, they aren't really fond of them. After years of abandonment of their kids, they miss them in a catastrophe, ah, ok, good. Good parent? Not so much.
The next episode just proves me right, when jake is absorbed into slime princess because they just doesn't want to be responsible and take action, to the point of melting even with Finn's life on their hand.
With all the second rate princesses, the disco party, and introducing LSP, slime kingdom just represents the most swallow parts of the series and is the perfect scenario to end with jake. Which also is a good thing, because makes Finn confront “by himself” the problem, proving to be worthy themselves of the so many times said “hero” title.
Then we enter the fire kingdom, and… DID FINN JUST KILLED FLAMBO?!
As a hero in a crazy world, there's a lot of violence you could say, and Finn starts losing to anger with the need for battle. But I don't think this is a topic of violence, but feelings.
Finn goes in the process of finding FLAME PRINCESS, their EX. Finn knows this. The first character we are introduced is no coincidence, it's the EX of tree trunks, who is pathetically in a rage of lost.
Then as Finn goes deep, they just succumbs to anger, because even if they have grown, feelings still exist, they remain deep, even if they seem under control. And Rage consumes everything. And WHERE they go? The Candy Kingdom. Versus WHO? Bubblegum, the other important “ex” of Finn.
In the end, only Finn's self-acceptance and growth can give them control and save everything, and how they act with Bonny and flame princess serves as a metaphor for their love life and development, that ends in the boy not suppressing their feelings or blazing them incorrectly (here destroying with fire, and as shown before in the series smooching everyone) but accepting them to heal and advance.
And, surprisingly, LSP saves the day. I liked how the only real good relationship of LSP is shown, as Marceline (Marshmalin) kinda makes them click. Normally I hate LSP, as they are an obnoxious character, but in this miniseries, I liked how they are portrayed, being herself, but not too annoying, and always with a meaning to it, and not as a stupid disgusting joke.
The confrontation ends with Bonny and their freaking demonstration of power, as the powerful control freak they always are.
Betty's betrayal is awesome, they don't push Finn in a dramatic way, but simply tossing them in an almost gentle way with their index, as they fly away with a maniacal laugh. So simple that Finn just can keep their hopeless gaze. And the creepy sugar zombies. You might think that regular candy zombies were okay, but this is crazy. The cute ones are the terrifying!
Finally, LSP solves everything because they are from another fucking dimension. A bit convenient, but whatever, it works and doesn't stand out too much. I accept it.
And a freaking bunch of cliffhangers to end. Jake's origins to reveal, Betty (only women) on Mars, and let's see what happens to the freaking kingdom after this.
Wrapping this up, elements miniseries is probably the best I've seen of Adventure Time so far, it grabs everything that has being constructed beforehand and gives it meaning in a well-constructed self-contained story, where we fucking see real character development on a series with hundreds of “partying” and “filler” episodes.
It plays dynamically, it uses all its characters just the right amount and in the best way, and it exploits all the feelings and relationships lived until now, offering us the growth we needed.
Now the only thing we can do is hope the rest of the ending series is as good as this, and wait impatiently for more.
PD: It seems cartoon network has another episode to emit, so I'll edit anything valuable if needed.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Ten members of Egypt's military were killed when their vehicles were hit by two improvised bombs during an operation against suspected militants in the Sinai peninsula, the military said on Thursday.
Three officers and seven soldiers were killed, the military said in a statement, adding that its forces killed 15 people and arrested seven others during the raid which it said targeted “highly dangerous terrorists” in the central Sinai area.
Two police officers, an officer and a conscript, were later killed in fighting near a police station in Arish, the capital of North Sinai province the Interior Ministry said in a statement.
Egypt is battling an Islamist insurgency in the rugged and thinly populated northern Sinai, which gained pace after the military overthrew President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013 following mass protests against their rule.
The militant group staging the insurgency pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014 and adopted the name Sinai Province. It is blamed for the killing of hundreds of soldiers and police officers.
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the former military chief who led the overthrow of Mursi, describes Islamist militancy as an existential threat to Egypt, an ally of the United States. Islamic State controls large parts of Iraq and Syria and has a strong presence in Libya, which borders Egypt.
A spokesperson said the military also found and destroyed half a tonne of TNT explosive, and seized two four-wheel drive cars containing hand grenades and hundreds of mobile phones.
Hillary Clinton went down to Dixie this week and tried to pull off a faux Southern accent. Sweet Lord Almighty, folks – it was pitiful.
Miss Hill'ry was drawling and dropping “g's” all over the stage during a speech to Democrats in South Carolina – the Palmetto State.
I was surprised Miss Hill'ry didn't show up at their campaign rally in bare feet, waving a cast iron skillet and singing Dixie.
Clearly, Miss Hill'ry has mastered the art of speaking from both sides of their mouth – but they still need to work on their drawl.
“Hillary Clinton's southern twang is back,” announced New York Times writer Maggie Haberman on Twitter.
The folks over at Hot Air crafted a spot-on analysis of Miss Hill'ry's politically expedient dialect in a story titled, “Hillary's Fake Southern Accent is Back.”
The problem is that it's not a very good Southern accent. It's almost like their linguistic advisors made them watch every episode of “The Beverly Hillbillies.”
“It's ce-ment pond, not cement pond, ma'am. And it's ‘pert near' not ‘pretty near.'”
Folks, I'm a native of Tennessee – the Volunteer State. And there's nothing more unpleasant to the ear than a phony Southern accent. It's downright disrespectful and a bit condescending. But because she's Miss Hill'ry – the mainstream media laughs off their faux dialect.
CLICK HERE TO FOLLOW TODD ON FACEBOOK FOR CONSERVATIVE CONVERSATION!
GOP strategist Rick Wilson offered this spot-on analysis via Twitter: “Just for ONE SECOND imagine Ted or Marco or Jeb doing a speech somewhere and speaking in an exaggerated fake accent.”
Imagine, indeed.
The truth is that lady couldn't tell the difference between a collard green and a turnip green. They probably think fat back is something a personal trainer can help you get rid of. And heaven only knows how they would smoke a pork butt.
Clearly, Miss Hill'ry has mastered the art of speaking from both sides of their mouth – but they still need to work on their drawl.
Therefore, I propose a crash course in Southern Living 101 – and there's no better place than Monroe, Louisiana – home of the Duck Commander.
Miss Kay could teach Miss Hill'ry the finer points of frying up a batch of frog legs. Mr. Phil could provide them with a briefing on the morale decline of America. And Uncle Si could regale them with pearls of Southern wisdom.
Or I could just brew up a jug of my special recipe sweet tea. One swig is all it would take to put a little drawl in their “y'all.”
That being said, I'm afraid we should prepare for more of Hillary's dispatches from the Deep South as they try to bond with all of us folks down on the farm.
So don't be terribly surprised if you run into their slinging hash browns at the Waffle House or plunking a banjo at the Grand Ole' Opry.
We have a saying back home, “Bless your Heart.” It can either be used to convey sincere empathy or it means you're an idiot. It takes a true Southerner to know the difference.
So on behalf of all of us country folks, bless your pea-pickin' heart, Miss Hill'ry.
Actor Bambadjan Bamba revealed their illegal immigration status in an interview Tuesday and outlined their efforts to push powerful Hollywood figures to fight for the kind of amnesty program currently being debated in Congress.
“I'm going public first and foremost because I'm sick and tired of living in fear and hiding about this issue,” Bamba told Variety.
The 35-year-old actor was 10-years-old when they moved to the United States with their parents from the West African country of the Ivory Coast. Bamba realized their illegal status while applying for college. Barred from receiving financial aid, the then-budding actor drove a cab to help pay for drama school. Now he's organizing for themselves and the estimated 800,000 people who illegally entered the U.S. with their parents as children and who had been previously shielded from deportation, thanks to Obama's controversial Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) amnesty program — a decision President Donald Trump rescinded earlier this year.
“I've kind of been in this status for 25 years of my life. I remember when the administration decided to cancel DACA — that was the last straw for me because not only am I married, but I have a daughter now. I didn't feel like I could still sit back and keep hitting the snooze button,” Bamba said.
Bamba — who has had a reoccurring role on NBC's hit sitcom The Good Place and is set to star in Marvel's latest superhero blockbuster Black Panther — says “because Hollywood is so powerful and can change culture, I hope that they would stand with me not just on social media but take concrete actions.”
“Hollywood can play a big part in at least changing policy so that it can be easier for actors to work in Hollywood,” they said.
Armed with a petition asking Hollywood to “join the fight and stand with immigrants in the industry,” Bamba says “My goal is to get a clean Dream Act passed. That's what we are all fighting for right now.”

Football, over the last couple of seasons, has been witnessing a ‘change of guard'. Players who we adored in their prime have retired, managers that headed some of the greatest sides in history have resigned. All this has given rise to the next generation of football personnel ranging from talented young footballers to talented young tacticians.
In this piece we will be focusing on the Top 10 Young Football Managers, that could be at the helm of some of the biggest clubs in World Football, in the not-so-distant future.
Please note that we have restricted this list to ‘upcoming' managers rather than established ones or ones that are fairly well-known in the World of football/earned moves to big clubs (Eg: Brendan Rodgers, Andre Villas Boas etc).
Scroll down to read Analysis on each manager from experts & journalists.
10. Viktor Goncharenko
Age: 36
Nationality: Belarusian
Current club: BATE Borisov
Major Honours/Accolades: 5 Belarusian Premier League titles (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012); 1 Belarusian Cup (2010); 2 Belarusian Super Cups (2010, 2011); 3 Belarusian Manager of the Year awards (2008, 2009, 2010)
Expert View:
Viktor Goncharenko's continuation of BATE Borisov's dominance of Belarusian football has been instigated through a powerful, organised defence and quick transitions from the midfield. Their teams are far more capable of retaining possession against inferior domestic opponents, given the relatively low standard of their top flight opponents, however their ability to counter has been witnessed to great effect in Europe over the past 12 months. The story of Goncharenko's rise to prominence is an inspirational one, and their ability to rouse their players is a trait that few coaches can truly boast to possess – particularly those as fresh-faced as the 36-year-old BATE coach – and the trust they place in domestically bred players is particularly refreshing in an Eastern European backdrop that relies so heavily on foreign talent to progress.

9. Ole Gunnar Solksjær
Age: 40
Nationality: Norwegian
Current club: Molde
Major Honours/Accolades: 2 Norwegian Premier League titles (2011, 2012)
Expert Views:
The most famous Norwegian footballer of all time had decided to turn coach long before they hung up their boots. When arriving at an under-performing Molde, Solskjær's boyhood club, they were billed as their ‘returning saviour'. They'd gone from league and cup runners-up in 2009 to a flirt with relegation in 2010. A return to the medal places was always the unspoken order.
Adding what he'd learnt in Salford – team cultivation, man management, an unrelenting drive even in the last-minute of added time – to their kindred club in a very youthful league was surely destined for success, but what they have given them exceeds even the most unrealistic expectations upon arrival. A strong spine, a sizeable squad and an adaptable set of ears were always the foundation of any successful Manchester United team, and it's only when Molde have swayed from this that they've been unsuccessful; 2013 won't yield a third successive league title for the Romsdal club as they are currently too far off the pace. But one poor transfer window and a demoralising drop in form shouldn't overshadow Solskjær's potential as a coach.
He's not the most outspoken, idealistic or fashionable coach in Norway, but they are destined for at least one of two big jobs – they both play in red, one begins with ‘M' and the other has never lost to Brazil.

8. Malky Mackay
Age: 41
Nationality: Scottish
Current club: Cardiff City
Previous club: Watford
Major Honours/Accolades: 1 Football League Championship (2012-13)
Expert View:
Malky Mackay turned Cardiff into one of the hardest working teams when out of possession and a team that throws in more crosses than any other team in the Championship (at one point) and I am confident is saying no other team scored more headed goals than Cardiff did. There really is a mechanical feel to the way in which Mackay's system works and yet at the same time, despite all the individual roles, a flexibility that would allow any one of the outfield players to join in with an attack.
Mackay usually plays a 4-2-3-1 and expects both full backs to push forward and look to cross the ball. The two midfielders that sit behind the three creative players are generally ‘battlers' – Gunnarson, Mutch etc. Three creative midfielders are typically two wingers (Bellamy, Noone, Conway) and they are accompanied by a playmaking central attacking midfielder (Kim, Whittingham) Mackay expects their striker to do all ‘the hard work' and much of the initial pressing up front, with support from the three behind him. You'll notice that Mackay is flexible with the profile of this player; it may be a player than runs the channels and looks to sit on the last man or a big strong target man. It's clear that Mackay has place in their philosophy for two strong towering central defenders and takes advantage of these through Gunnarson's forty yard driven throw-in's.
Despite favouring the crossing game, Mackay also appreciates good football being played and does look to play the ball out from the back, through the midfield (rather than the Dave Jones long ball method Cardiff fans got annoyed with!). Mackay's approach has all the right elements to launch Cardiff City into the Premier League scene and really challenge for the mid-table positions along with the likes of Swansea, Norwich, Southampton etc.
In short, Mackay's approach is all about having different options in attack and playing through the basic principles of football (using the width and playing through midfield etc).

7. Sami Hyypiä
Age: 39
Nationality: Finnish
Current club: Bayer Leverkusen
Expert Views:
In their career as a player, Hyypia was known as a hard-nosed, no-nonsense defender. But even then there was always a sense that they were readymade for a coaching role after they hung up their boots. In fact, as soon as they completed their training courses, Bayer Leverkusen offered them a position as assistant at the club. And after seeing out the 2011-12 season as the club's caretaker he, alongside Sascha Lewandowski, took over in a dual coaching role for the 2012-13 campaign. A year later, Leverkusen qualified directly for the Champions League after a tactically transformative and impressive season.
Despite their and Lewandowski's dual roles at the club, it was Hyypia's vision that shaped Leverkusen's style and success. They transformed Leverkusen from a club without a true identity to one of the most dangerous and effective counter attacking teams in Germany. Their implementation of the 4-3-3 not only reinvented the team but also got the best out of several of their players. Under Hyypia, players previously criticized for failing to live up to expectations like Andre Schürrle or versatile yet underwhelming players like Gonzalo Castro and Stefan Reinartz, really thrived.
So how and what did Hyypia do? For one, instead of using Reinartz at center-back they put them alongside Lars Bender and Simon Rolfes in a three-man midfield. With three players equally capable of holding the ball as they are doing defensive work, it created a platform for the three attackers and fullbacks to focus largely on attacking with pace. Rolfes was responsible for covering the left and Bender on the right while Reinartz sat in front of, or slotted into the backline. Carvajal especially was a big revelation down the right, which is why Real Madrid have already activated their buyback clause. Alongside Castro in front of them they made up one of the best right sided pairings in the league and each helped get the best out of the other.
Similarly, Schürrle was relieved of the defensive duties they had last year and became the prime initiator of their counter attacks. As soon as the ball was won back in their defensive third, the ball was launched quickly forward to make the best use of Schürrle's speed. With overlapping fullbacks and Kiessling and Castro ready around the box, Leverkusen became renowned for putting together deadly and precise counter attacks. The system catered to each players strengths and also got the best out of Kiessling who was free to drop back but also had the kind of service that a striker their type thrives on. They may be without Schürrle going into next season but the team's development is far from over. And all under the watchful eye of the hard-nosed, no-nonsense Hyypia.

6. Roberto Martinez
Age: 40
Nationality: Spanish
Current club: Everton
Previous clubs: Swansea City; Wigan Athletic
Major Honours/Accolades: 1 FA Cup (2013); 1 Football League One title (2007-08)
Expert Views:
Change is something that has been clamoured for in the stands at Everton in recent years and this summer's changing of the guard at Goodison Park is a crucial one, with the Toffees replacing a man long tipped for greatness in the game with one held in a similar esteem.
But while Roberto Martinez and their predecessor David Moyes have been charged with unenviable tasks of building on already impressive legacies, that is where similarities end.
Evertonians are relishing the attractive style of play that became synonymous with the Spaniard's time at Wigan being replicated at Goodison, but concerns about the manner of their departure from the Premier League, after three consecutive great escapes, linger.
They do, however, inherit a solid and cohesive defence – something that was sorely lacking at the Latics – and providing they can retain the services of alleged Manchester United target Leighton Baines, that should go some way in quelling fears of a return to the bad old days for Everton.
In-keeping with their new club's long-standing mantra, Martinez has set the bar high by targeting Champions League qualification as the ultimate aim of their Blues tenure.
Delivering that, or ending Everton's 18-year trophy drought will validate claims by Wigan chairperson Dave Whelan that this self-styled student of the game was destined for bigger things.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Jailed Kurdish militants on hunger strike in Turkey may start to die within the next 10 days, Turkey's main medical association warned on Thursday, saying the prime minister's dismissal of the protest as a “show” risked hardening their resolve.

The hunger strike entered its 51st day on Thursday, with some 700 prisoners refusing food in dozens of prisons across Turkey, demanding the government grant greater Kurdish minority rights and better conditions for their jailed leader.
But the inmates are consuming sugar, water and vitamins that would prolong their lives and the protest by weeks.
The main demand of the protesters, mostly convicted members of the armed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group, is improved jail conditions for PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, imprisoned on an island in the Marmara Sea south of Istanbul.
The protests follow a surge in violence between Turkey and the PKK, which took up arms 28 years ago to try to carve out a Kurdish homeland in Turkey's southeast and which is designated a terrorist group by Ankara, the United States and European Union.
“Our worry is that after around 40 days lasting damage begins to emerge and after 60 days deaths may begin,” Ozdemir Aktan, head of the Turkish Medical Association (TTB), which represents 80 percent of the nation's doctors, told Reuters.
Dozens of leftist prisoners died in a hunger strike more than a decade ago, but Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan has played down the latest action, saying only one prisoner was on a “death fast” and was being monitored medically.
“Currently there is no such thing as a hunger strike. This is a complete show,” they told reporters in Berlin on Wednesday.
They have said the inmates were being manipulated by “merchants of death”, a reference to the PKK and Kurdish politicians, and accused Kurdish politicians of ordering the militants to go on strike while they themselves feasted on kebabs.
“Such statements make those taking part in hunger strikes more determined, motivating those who may have been considering giving up to continue. This can bring with it various illnesses and deaths,” Aktan said.
“JOURNEY OF DEATH”
A jailed member of parliament from the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), who joined the hunger strike on Oct 15, rejected Erdoğan's description of the strike as a “show”.
“We and hundreds of our friends are on a journey of death,” Faysal Sariyildiz, member of parliament for the southeastern province of Sirnak, said from Diyarbakir prison where they are being held on remand on charges of links to the PKK.
“As much as hunger eats away at our bodies each day, the support of our people for the resistance is a big source of hope and morale for us,” they said in a statement released by the BDP.
The hunger strike is another area of apparent difference between Erdoğan and President Abdullah Gul, who have traded barbed comments in recent days over the police handling of a banned march.
One of Turkey's best known novelists, Yasar Kemal, called at a news conference in Istanbul for efforts to stop the protesters dying, saying the government was responsible for what happens as it had been in previous hunger strikes.
Aktan said the TTB had asked the justice ministry several times for permission to enter prisons and monitor the situation but had not yet received a response.
Authorities accepted such a request during a previous hunger strike in 2000 when 122 people died. That total includes 30 prisoners and two guards killed when security forces stormed jails to end the far-left protest against isolation in cells.
Hundreds more suffered permanent health damage and the TTB said inmates were again at risk from neurological illnesses such as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a condition whose symptoms include loss of memory and coordination.
Erdoğan's government has introduced reforms granting greater Kurdish cultural rights since taking power a decade ago, but Turkey is also prosecuting hundreds of Kurdish lawyers, academics, activists and politicians on suspicion of PKK links.
More than 40,000 people have been killed since the militants took up arms in 1984 with the aim of carving out an independent state for Turkish Kurds, who now number around 15 million, or around a fifth of the population.
Burma's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi says they believe that their country will hold full democratic elections in their lifetime, a good sign for the country, which has long been notorious for its oppressive military rule.
Ms. Suu Kyi's remarks came on the heels of three high profile visits to Burma (Myanmar): Both Hillary Clinton and billionaire business person George Soros, longtime funder of exiled opposition groups, made the trip last month, and Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague arrived in Burma earlier today.
In yet another positive nod to reforms in Burma, the government approved Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy to run in April by-elections for the country's parliament, and a presidential adviser said that the could one day lead the country where they spent 15 years under arrest.
Though Suu Kyi they said they were optimistic about Burma's future, the Nobel Peace Laureate quickly cautioned the West to not get too excited, pointing out that the democratic reforms could still be blocked by Burma's Army.
“I trust the president but I can't say I trust the government for the simple reason that I don't know everyone in the government,” Suu Kyi told the BBC.
Today's soundbites come after a series of reforms by a nominally-civilian government that took office almost one year ago, replacing a military regime in control since 1962. Some 300 political prisoners have been freed, a controversial China-backed dam in the north has been shelved, and laws have been amended to allow greater media freedom, public protests, and the establishment of trade unions.
However Burma still holds hundreds of political prisoners. Estimates vary, but the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners – Burma (AAPP), run by former detainees and which tracks political prisoners in Burma, says that there are around 1,500 still in jail.
Secretary Hague said after meeting their counterpart Wunna Maung Lwin in Naypyidaw that "the foreign minister has reaffirmed commitments that have been made to release political prisoners,” but the Burmese foreign minister later reiterated to the BBC the old military junta line that Burma does not have any political prisoners.
Aung Myo Thein of the AAPP says that “reform is so-called reform,” citing a prisoner amnesty earlier this week, when only about 34 political detainees were freed – after already serving much of their jail time.
The US has said that full and unconditional release of political prisoners is a necessity before it will consider lifting economic sanctions on Burma.
Aside from political prisoners, conditions in Burma's ethnic minority regions are another litmus test of the government's reformist intentions.
Benedict Rogers, activist and author of a biography on Than Shwe, the reclusive former military dictator thought by some to retain behind-the-scenes influence in Burma, told the Monitor that the Burmese government should be encouraged to reform but added that “if the regime wants to convince us it is changing” there needs to be “an end to the attacks in the ethnic states, and a nationwide cease-fire must be announced.”
Far from Rangoon and Naypyidaw, such reform is hard to detect.
Zipporah Sein, head of the Karen National Union (KNU), says they fear that the approaching dry season will see a return to the bloody clashes between the Burmese Army and the ethnic Karen militia, which has strongholds near the Thailand-Burma border.

And as investors size up what they hope will be a reformed Burma, the KNU is taking its time on going ahead with a Thai-backed multibillion dollar port and highway development linking Burma's coast with Bangkok.
“We want the project to be done to international standards,” says Zipporah Sein, adding that they are still in discussion with Italian-Thai Development, the Thai company leading the project.
In Burma's northern Kachin state, near China, fighting has been running for seven or eight months now, with tens of thousands made homeless, according to Ah Noh, of the Kachin Women's Association of Thailand. In Kachin state, “we don't see any sign of change in the ground,” they say.
It was that time of the year again. People, young and old tried the most elaborate costumes, makeup and stunts to get their Halloween game on.

This is the fastest electric car in the world, by a wide margin. The Ohio State University has been developing quite a name for itself in speed racing circles with the vehicle pictured above, the hydrogen fuel cell powered electric drive Venturi Buckeye Bullet 2. Students from the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State built the Buckeye 2 and in 2007 they set the fastest ever time for a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle at 300.992 mph.
The first Buckeye Bullet was powered by 10,000 C Cell batteries and set what is still the world record for a battery powered vehicle at 271.737 mph on the Bonneville salt flats back in 2004. A new team of students at the Ohio State Center for Automotive Research are currently working on the Buckeye Bullet 2.5, this is set to be the fastest battery powered vehicle ever built if they manage to beat the record set by the first iteration of the university's unique streamliner. It's great to see these records being challenged and it's also good to see companies like Venturi stepping in with much-needed financial sponsorship. We'll keep you up to date with news on future record attempts and any other interesting vehicles rolling out of the Ohio State University garage.
David Cross says they “can pretty much guarantee” more episodes of their Netflix sketch comedy series “W/ Bob and David.”
Cross, who stars on the series with their former “Mr. Show” partner Bob Odenkirk, said in an interview with Digital Spy that they're both interested in doing more episodes. Netflix has yet to officially renew the series.
“I just spoke to Bob yesterday and we both really want to do another round — if not several more rounds,” the actor said.

But another batch of episodes would have to fit around Odenkirk's schedule as the lead on AMC's “Breaking Bad” spinoff “Better Call Saul,” no small challenge.
“It's really tough,” they said. “We have a short window and if he's not available during that window, then we just can't do it … But we both want to do it and Netflix would be happy to have us do it, so we will do more. I can pretty much guarantee it.”

Cross also discussed a possible fifth season for fan favorite “Arrested Development,” which they said series creator Mitch Hurwitz has been working on since Season 4 debuted on Netflix in 2013. “It's just a matter of getting the deal worked out — I think there's like four or five different entities who own a piece of it,” they said.
The fourth season of the cult hit proved divisive among fans, as the season isolated the series leads to per-episode storylines to accommodate the actors' busy schedules.

“I personally would love to do it more similar to the original version, when it was on Fox,” they said. “I just missed working with all those actors.”
Cross continued: “I had one tiny scene with Tony [Hale, in season 4], you know? But yeah, everybody would love to do it.”
Today, Microsoft released Windows 10 Mobile Build 14327 to Windows Insiders. The latest build of Windows 10 Mobile includes a few new features, including Messaging Everywhere and improvements for Cortana. The build also includes a really nice feature which Microsoft didn't note in the official blog post: app update/install notifications from the Windows Store. Yep, the Windows Store will finally notify you when there are updates available, and when an app has been installed or updated.
This is one of the features that were available in Windows Phone 8.1 – however, Microsoft removed it in Windows 10 Mobile, and now, it's finally back. Of course, this is nothing major, but it's definitely a really nice addition. As we previously reported, Microsoft will be rolling out a lot of updates for the Windows Store in the coming months, which are looking pretty sweet already. As per usual, we will let you know when there is more news on Windows 10 Mobile or the Windows Store, until then, tell us what you think of this new feature in the comment section below.
The Army rebuked President Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE's new national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, in 2015 for mishandling a sexual assault case, according to a Washington Post report.
McMaster allegedly allowed two junior officers to attend an elite Ranger School while under investigation for sexual assault, which violates Army regulations, according to a report by the Army inspector general.
The case against the two lieutenants was dropped months later after the Army decided the alleged victim was “not a credible witness,” the Washington Post reports.

McMaster received a minor reprimand for mishandling the case in the form of a “memorandum of concern,” according to Freedom of Information Act obtained by the Washington Post.
“I am disappointed with your actions,” Gen. Daniel Allyn, the Army's vice chief of staff, wrote in the memorandum in February of last year.
“As a senior leader in the United States Army, you are expected and required to understand and comply with all laws and regulations."
McMaster's personnel file does not include this memorandum.
McMaster declined the Washington Post's request for an interview.
“Lt. Gen. McMaster has served alongside women, and benefited from their bravery and dedication, their entire career. As a commander they have been a leader in sexual assault prevention in each of their commands. To suggest otherwise is to unfairly impugn the character and integrity of a true American hero,” White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement to the Washington Post.
The two second lieutenants who played rugby at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 2013, allegedly groped a female cadet multiple times.
The female cadet was interviewed by investigators who were looking into sexually degrading emails that some of the rugby players had circulated.
Following their claims of groping, the matter was passed on to an Army prosecutor and criminal investigators who deemed there was probable cause to open a case, according to the documents acquired by the Washington Post.
During that time, the two men had already been accepted to the prestigious Ranger School in Fort Benning, Ga., where McMaster was then serving as a commanding general.
Army regulations, however, prevent subjects under criminal investigation from enrolling in the program.
When unidentified congressional officials learned about this breach of Army regulations, they called for an investigation, the Washington Post reports.
The inspector general, whom the Army tapped to look into the breach, decided in 2014 McMaster's actions violated Army regulations.
McMaster admitted knowing about the sexual assault investigation, justifying their decision by saying they did not want to prematurely punish them or impede their military training.
To attend the Ranger school and comply with Army regulations, McMaster would've needed to obtain a special Pentagon-issued waiver.
McMaster told investigators that they did not know about the Army's waiver requirement.
The inspector general concluded the investigation, reasoning that McMaster unknowingly violated the Army regulation.
Later, McMaster gave the two lieutenants formal reprimands, which they appealed after completing the Ranger School in 2014.
McMaster reversed their decision to reprimand them after the female cadet gave contradictory statements under oath in a separate criminal case, military documents obtained by the Washington Post reportedly show.
An Army spokesperson at the Pentagon declined the Washington Post's request for comment.
Trump chose McMaster to be their national security adviser in late February following the controversy surrounding former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and after retired Navy Adm. Robert Harward declined the White House position.
The Senate does not confirm the president's national security adviser pick. McMaster, however, will need Senate confirmation to retain their position as a three-star general while also serving in the White House.

A 26-year-old man found critically injured last week near the intersection of 10th and Washington has died.
The Cookeville Police Department is still seeking the public's assistance as it investigates the incident.
The victim, whose identity was not previously released, was 26-year-old Samuel Florea.
Authorities found them around 10 p.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 14, after a passing motorist reported seeing a man lying near the roadway.
“He was unresponsive and subsequently flown to Erlanger Medical Center in Chattanooga,” said Major Carl Sells.
The injured man had reportedly sustained traumatic head injuries immediately before authorities found him.
They were still hospitalized when they died from their injuries yesterday.
Although authorities are still trying to piece together exactly what happened to the man, the incident is being investigated as a possible pedestrian hit-and-run.
“The victim was known to the department as a frequent pedestrian in the area,” Sells said.
Approximately 20 minutes before the incident was reported, an officer noted having seen the victim walking in the neighborhood. That officer apparently saw no signs of injury or foul play at that time.
“Evidence suggests Mr. Florea had been walking northward on Washington Avenue from the area of 1st Street minutes prior to being discovered lying in the grass. It is possible that Mr. Florea was struck by a vehicle while they were attempting to cross 10th Street,” Sells said.
Officers are investigating the possible presence of a vehicle that was traveling east on 10th Street near the time of the incident.
It is a dark-colored SUV that may have minor damage to the front bumper or hood area or driver's side mirror.
Anyone who may have seen that vehicle or the pedestrian along Washington Avenue from 1st to 10th streets between 9:30 and 10:10 p.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 14, is asked to contact authorities.
“We're asking for the public's assistance in learning what occurred in this area during the minutes before being notified of this incident,” Sells said.
Anyone with possible information is asked to call the Cookeville Police Department at 526-2125 or Detective Ryan Acuff at 931-520-5320.
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of sleep apnea. It is characterized by frequent pauses in breathing while asleep. This type of apnea occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat relax and block the airway. These muscles help to support oral and pharyngeal structures like the tongue, uvula, soft palate, and tonsils.
When the airway is either completely or partially blocked, there is usually 10 to 20 seconds of breathing cessation, which can lower blood oxygen levels. The brain panics when this happens and rouses the body to restart breathing. Generally, this is a very brief awakening that most people do not even notice or remember. It can happen over 30 times an hour all throughout the night, which significantly disrupts restful sleep cycles.
25 Million U.S. adults have obstructive sleep apnea
Symptoms of Obstructive Sleep Apnea(OSA)
The most obvious and common sign of this type of apnea is loud snoring.
Other signs and symptoms that may occur during the night or in the daytime include:
Excessive sleepiness during the day, leading to difficulty with focus and concentration
Waking up in the middle of the night short of breath
Breathing cessation throughout the night, which is usually observed by someone else
Dry mouth and sore throat in the morning
Chest pain upon waking up
Morning headaches
Mood instability like frequent bouts of depression, anxiety, or excessive irritability
Insomnia, problems staying asleep, and/or restless sleep
Hypertension
Not everyone who snores has sleep apnea. This type of snoring is extremely loud and identifiable through the long periods of deafening silence when breathing stops.
Typically, adults and children will differ in symptoms. For example, the hallmark of OSA in adults is excessive daytime sleepiness, to the point where they may fall asleep for short periods throughout regular daily activities.
Children with OSA may suffer from hyperactivity, malnutrition, and failure to thrive, which is where their growth rates are significantly reduced.
The poorer growth can happen for one of two reasons:
The work of breathing is burning off a lot more calories. There is so much nasal and airway obstruction that it is difficult to swallow food and drink.
Symptoms can be present for years without the person knowing they have the disorder. Many will have issues for only a short period, with symptoms disappearing after weight loss, surgery, or other lifestyle changes. Symptoms may also be the result of a respiratory infection, congestion, throat swelling, etc.
Causes of Obstructive Sleep Apnea
In children, enlarged tonsils or adenoids most often cause OSA. Surgical removal often leads to resolution of OSA symptoms. For adults, causes may vary and include:
Age
Obesity, which may cause increased soft tissue around the airway
Structural deformities that obstruct the airways
Decrease in muscle tone, which can be caused by alcohol, substance abuse, neurological disorders, or some other underlying health conditions.
Some scientific evidence suggests that snoring for years at a time can lead to the development of lesions in the throat, just as the vibrations from snoring can lead to nerve or neuron lesions all around the body.
Women are typically less likely to suffer from Obstructive Sleep Apnea than men, as men in middle years are more likely to have changing anatomy in their neck and soft tissues. Women could also be at decreased risk because of the higher levels of progesterone, but they are more likely to suffer symptoms during pregnancy and after menopause.
Furthermore, there seems to be a genetic component to OSA. Studies have shown that sufferers often have a positive family history. Lifestyle factors like drinking, smoking, and overeating increase the chances of developing the condition.
Diagnosing Obstructive Sleep Apnea
OSA is diagnosed through a series of exams and tests. A thorough history and physical is taken by the primary care physician, which includes questioning how the patient is performing in daily activities and family history. The physical exam includes examining the back of the throat for any abnormalities, checking blood pressure, and measuring neck and waistlines.
Tests used to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea are polysomnography and home sleep study sleep apnea test.
Polysomnography
Some doctors may recommend polysomnography, or in-laboratory sleep study, to be monitored overnight by a specialist in a sleep center who will record oxygen levels and frequency of breathing cessation or awakenings. When breathing stops, there are fluctuations in blood oxygen levels, with a subsequent increase in carbon dioxide.
In central sleep apnea, the brain sends signals to stop breathing entirely; however, in OSA, the chest will continue to move up and down to simulate inhalation/exhalation without actually breathing.
The monitors placed during the polysomnogram show chest movements are pronounced and often exaggerated in OSA patients.
There are one of two events characterized on this study:
Apnea, which is when airflow is completely blocked and breathing stops for at least 10 seconds Hypopnea, which is when airflow is 50% decreased for at least 10 seconds, or there is a 30% decrease in airflow with a subsequent awakening or serious drop in oxygen saturation levels.
Home Sleep Test
Many sleep doctors are starting to use home sleep studies, which are much more convenient and comfortable for the patient. This is a noninvasive way of monitoring blood oxygen saturation levels during sleep.
Patients who are at higher risk of OSA are first given the STOP BANG questionnaire or other sleep apnea screening questionnaire, and a significant score means they likely have OSA rather than another sleep disorder.
Unfortunately, home oximetry does not measure apnea events or arousals, so it could be difficult to diagnose OSA with a home oximeter.
Treatments for Obstructive Sleep Apnea
The first line of treatment for OSA is always lifestyle changes. Reducing alcohol intake, losing weight, quitting smoking, and avoiding sedative medications are a starting point for treating physicians. However, lifestyle modifications do not always resolve the issues; therefore, one or more of the below options are considered in treatment plans.
Most Popular Sleep Apnea Treatments
CPAP
Next to lifestyle changes, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment is the front line of treatment. It is most effective for moderate to severe symptoms. This resembles, but is different from, a ventilator. A facemask is attached to a tube that is connected to a machine, which continuously pushes positive airway pressure into the breathing passages. This helps to keep the airways open.
VPAP
Variable positive airway pressure, also known as BPAP, is another type of ventilation, but instead of continuous airway pressure, the machine uses a circuit to monitor breathing and provide two different pressures: one for inhalation and one for exhalation. The inhalation pressure is higher than the exhalation pressure. This treatment is more common in patients with serious respiratory conditions.
Nasal EPAP
This bandage-type device is placed over the nostrils to enhance the person's regular breathing cycles, create positive airway pressure, and prevent obstruction. This is a device commonly used in mild cases of OSA.
Sleep Apnea Oral Appliances
Splints or other oral appliances are sometimes used in conjunction with other treatments. Patients often prefer them because they are less “invasive” than CPAP, but sometimes they do not work as well. These splints are mouth guards that keep the passages open and protect the teeth and gums. It holds the lower jaw down and forward to keep it in a more forward position, while simultaneously holding the tongue further away from the airway.
Sometimes, modifying airway anatomy is necessary to treat OSA symptoms. These types of surgeries will vary depending on the cause of the condition and the patient's anatomy. The various operative procedures include:
Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy
Nasal surgery such as turbinectomy or straightening a deviated septum
Reduction or removal of uvula or soft palate
Reduction of the size of the tongue base
A procedure that surgically moves the jaw forward, pulling the tongue away from the back of the throat (genioglossus advancement)
Hyoid suspension, where one of the neck bones is pulled forward
Bariatric surgery for morbidly obese patients
Neurostimulation
This option is used for patients who cannot tolerate the CPAP machine. This system senses respirations and stimulates the hypoglossal nerve with electrical currents to increase muscle tone, which will help avoid the tongue collapsing to the back of the throat and blocking the airway.
What is the Prognosis for Patients with OSA
The apneic and hypopneic events associated with OSA cause a fight or flight response in the body, which further creates a hormonal reaction. Excessive use of this response can put an undue amount of stress on the body, exhausting the glands and organs that are activated during the fight or flight response. This, paired with consistently low oxygen saturation levels, can lead to long-term dangerous health consequences.
If the above symptoms become so severe that daily activities and work are affected, then it's time to seek medical attention. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea can lead to long-term serious conditions such as:
Cardiovascular disease
Obesity
Diabetes
Daytime fatigue, which can be hazardous in school or work environments and driving
Eye and vision problems
Mood and psychiatric disorders
One of the most serious concerns of untreated OSA is cardiovascular disease. Sleep apnea patients are at 30% higher risk of heart attack and heart-related death than those without the condition. Increased pulmonary pressures to the right side of the heart, a major concern in prolonged cases of OSA, can result in cor pulmonale, a very serious and dangerous form of congestive heart failure.
Obstructive sleep apnea and very loud snoring may seem harmless at first, but it can lead to a laundry list of daytime symptoms and more serious and extensive health concerns, so diagnosis and monitoring should be a priority.

San Juan's Governor Jose Luis Gioja (R) as they speak with Uruguayan Raul Gomez Cincunegui (bottom) at the Rawson hospital in San Juan, Argentina on Sunday. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images/ Prensa Gobernacion de San Juan) Story Highlights Raul Gomez lost 45 pounds and was dehydrated after being rescued
Gomez had tried to bike across the Andes between Chile and Argentina
Chilean officials say they were fleeing child sexual abuse allegations and an arrest warrant
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) - A story of remarkable human endurance in the snow-covered Andes has taken a somber turn.
Authorities said Monday that a plumber from Uruguay who survived through the winter after disappearing along Chile's high-altitude border with Argentina was fleeing from the law.
An emaciated Raul Gomez was rescued Sunday by an Argentine helicopter crew and was recovering in a hospital more than four months after they were last heard from.
Repeated search efforts had been called off due to bad weather after failing to turn up any sign of them amid the snow-covered peaks.
It wasn't clear at first why a 58-year-old motorcyclist with no apparent mountaineering experience was so determined to walk across the Chilean frontier. Gomez had traveled to Argentina and then Chile to meet up with other motorcyclists.
Gomez told people in the hospital that they decided to cross back over on foot in May after their motorcycle broke down.
An official in the Chilean prosecutor's office in Santiago confirmed to The Associated Press on Monday that Gomez is wanted in Chile's capital for investigation of child sex abuse allegations. A warrant was issued for their arrest on April 22, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity per office policy.
In Gomez' hometown of Bella Union, Uruguay, the man's mother, Irma Cincunegui, told the AP they don't believe the allegations.
"Raul is a good, hard-working man," they said. "Everybody knows them in Bella Union, where they never had troubles with anybody."
Gomez was finally discovered on Sunday at the Ingeniero Sardina refuge, a small cabin 14,760 feet above sea level, by a pilot and two state water experts who had flown up to measure snow levels. They told them they took shelter in the refuge after getting disoriented by the Southern Hemisphere's winter snowstorms.
They had been carrying a small amount of food, and said they ate other meager supplies that mountaineers had left in the refuge. When that ran out, they told their rescuers that they survived by capturing small animals. "He lost 20 kilos (45 pounds). They apparently fed themselves with mice and an owl or two," Hospital Rawson spokesperson Rodrigo Belert told the AP.
On Monday, Gomez was joined by their two daughters and wife in the intensive care unit of the hospital in San Juan province.
"He's recuperating well and shows no sign of serious organ damage, but he's recovering from very severe malnutrition," Belert said.
Chile's attorney general's office must now consider whether to seek their extradition once he's healthy enough to travel again.
Belert said hospital authorities had not received any communications from the Chilean government.
"The patient could get released shortly, but we're waiting to see if some official information arrives," Belert said.
Ignacio Capandeguy, Uruguay's consul in Argentina's Cordoba province, also told the AP that they hadn't seen any official information from Chile, and that meanwhile the Uruguayan authorities are focused on the man's health.
Gomez's mother called their son "a warrior," and said they "always thought that they were alive."
Why did they risk crossing such a high-altitude frontier with winter coming and hardly any equipment or supplies?
"Because he's brave, and daring," they said. "Every vacation they would grab their motorcycle and take off on an adventure. Once they took their wife on the bike to Chile, but they said they would never make one of those trips again."
Gomez was called an "excellent companion" by their co-worker Elias Acosta at the state water treatment plant in Bella Union. "We're very happy that they found him."

Sunday's game between the Tennessee Titans and Seattle Seahawks is a matchup between two winning teams coming off losses, and both are missing key players on offense.
Quarterback Jake Locker is out for the Titans. Both starting tackles -- Russell Okung and Breno Giacomini -- are out for Seattle. Tight end Zach Miller could also sit.
The Seahawks have a 10-game home winning streak on the line, hoping to rebound after their first defeat of the season, 34-28 to the Indianapolis Colts.
The Titans hope to get a stagnant running game going and find some consistency with backup quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick.
Paul, it looked like Fitzpatrick had a rough first outing for the Titans subbing for an injured Locker. Do you think Fitzpatrick will improve, and how difficult will it be for Tennessee to have success on offense while Locker is out?
Kuharsky: Fitzpatrick is certainly capable of playing better than they did in the loss to Kansas City, when they had three very bad quarters and one good one. I'm not sure what the Titans can do to help them if they are unable to run the ball. If they can bring some balance with Chris Johnson (and maybe Shonn Greene, who's still trying to get back after knee surgery), it could be a lot less difficult. Fitzpatrick hardly has Locker's excellent speed, but they scrambled around pretty well against the Chiefs. With Locker in the first four games, the Titans didn't turn the ball over and overcame their deficiencies running the ball. Without him, they need Fitzpatrick to imitate the mistake-free youngster. But Fitzpatrick is more of a gunslinger than Locker and is streakier, and that's probably too much to ask.
Terry, the Titans pledged to be a great running team. It hasn't really panned out that way. Last time Johnson was in Seattle, they had a 2,000-yard season. What's the run defense going to be like?
Blount: It's been all but impossible to run up the middle on the Seahawks. Defensive tackle Brandon Mebane is as strong a run stopper as there is the NFL, and it takes two blockers to handle 325-pound Red Bryant. If that fails, it's tough to get past middle linebacker Bobby Wagner. But Wagner probably won't play Sunday because of a high ankle sprain. Nevertheless, it's difficult to establish a running game on the Seahawks. Seattle is an aggressive outside pass-rushing team, so occasionally a back can get yardage outside, but not often.
Paul, Locker told us on the conference call Wednesday what a disappointment it is that they won't get to play this weekend in front of family, friends and University of Washington alumni who love them for all they did to help turn around the Huskies football program.  They are a beloved guy here and a huge hero in this community. How are they viewed in Nashville?
Kuharsky: Nothing close to that yet. People who have given them a chance know he's an eminently likable guy, a hard worker and a well-respected leader, but plenty of fans called talk radio over the offseason talking about why Fitzpatrick would be a better choice or how it should at least be a camp competition. Even after Week 2's overtime loss in Houston, when they overthrew a wide-open Kenny Britt on a crucial third-and-1 late in the game, there were calls for change. (It's a throw he's got to make.) The game-winning drive against San Diego showed people what they can do. Locker also had a fantastic two-plus quarters against the Jets, which seems to have done a lot to win more people over. In playing style and development arc, I think they are a lot like Steve McNair so far. If that holds true, impatient fans will wind up happy.
Terry, home field is viewed as such a giant advantage for the Seahawks. Can you give us a tangible feel for just how loud and crazy the atmosphere is there?
Blount: In the San Francisco game, where the outdoor stadium decibel record was set at 131.9, it was so loud that it was difficult at times to even hear people talk in the enclosed press box. I know every team believes its stadium is one of the loudest, and I've been to most of them, but trust me, there is nothing like CenturyLink Field. It's deafening.
Paul, cornerback Alterraun Verner is off to an outstanding start this season with four interceptions and 11 passes defensed. Seattle cornerback Richard Sherman is viewed by some as the best corner in the NFL, but is Verner the most underrated?
Kuharsky: They could have had another two picks last week on balls they didn't manage to haul in. Verner has been really good. The team wasn't sure what it had in him. The Titans knew they got a good football player out of UCLA three years ago. But as they revamped this offseason, with Gregg Williams joining the coaching staff and the Titans determined to get more aggressive, they figured a big increase in press-man coverage would move them away from Verner's strengths. They wanted Tommie Campbell, a faster and bigger guy to win the job. (Some wrote about how Campbell has some of what makes Sherman so good.) But Campbell didn't catch on and bombed in training camp, and Verner proved to be better. If Coty Sensabaugh hasn't recovered from their concussion for Sunday, Verner will start in base and move into the slot in nickel, with Campbell replacing them outside.
The Titans rush pretty well, and Verner is getting their hands on balls all over the field. Who has had the best success slowing Russell Wilson and how?
Blount: Even though Seattle came back and won the game, the Texans had the most success because of their talented defensive front and all-everything defensive lineman J.J. Watt. Both Houston and Indianapolis took advantage of Seattle missing starters on the offensive line and teed off on Wilson on third down. Nevertheless, Wilson is the best I've ever seen making the most of a bad situation and finding the opening the defense gives him. Anticipating when Wilson will roll out and cutting off their running lanes is the key, but it is far easier said than done.

A Gallup poll has found that only 35% of Americans are concerned about climate change, and that proportion is barely up from the previous year.
Climate change has become a partisan issue in the US, such that a majority of Democrats is worried about it but only 29% of independents and only 16% of Republicans! The youth are more concerned than their elders.
The American public is reacting to climate change as though it were a lifestyle or culture wars issue, such as gay marriage or marijuana legalization.
They don't seem to realize that the laws of physics don't respect party affiliation. If you put 32 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year, as human beings are currently doing by burning coal, oil and natural gas, then you will cause massive climate change.
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas; more of it in the atmosphere interferes with the radiation back into space of the heat of the sun. In a lower CO2 environment, the sunlight hits the earth but then bounces back into space. If you keep that heat on earth, it increases average surface temperatures. This increase is now ongoing and dramatic. The difference between Venus (which is a fiery hell where molten lead runs in streams) and earth is that the atmosphere of Venus is full of greenhouse gases.
We have a choice over the next 15 to 20 years as to what kind of world we want to create over the next 100,000 years. If we hit the brakes on carbon dioxide emissions we could theoretically keep average surface warming to 3 degrees F. But if we go on like we are for 15 to 20 years, we will lock earth into an average surface temperature rise of 7 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit (climate scientists talking to Americans need to stop using Centrigrade, which appears to downplay the extent of the increase). Once you put that level of carbon dioxide into earth's atmosphere, it takes a long time for it to be scrubbed back out by carbon sinks. Much of it will go into the oceans, where it will increase acidity and kill off the fish. Igneous rock will absorb some. Carbon sinks will take roughly 100,000 years to wash it back out. In the meantime, the glaciation cycle will be suspended and the whole world will become tropical, with loss of all surface ice and a loss of one-third of the earth's land mass to sea level rise. The atmosphere will likely become unstable, with mega-storms that strip trees from the landscape. It is not clear that human beings as a species could survive in 9 degrees F. increase world.
At the same time as they manage to turn a blind eye to these immense dangers, a bigger proportion of Americans is concerned with environmental threats. They are afraid of poisoning of their drinking water, of contamination of their soil, of the pollution of rivers and lakes, the extinction of animal and plant species, and the loss of tropical rainforest.
h/t Gallup.com
Obviously, climatologists need to point out to them that human-made climate change will in fact produce a degradation of their environment in all these areas where the public is already anxious.
The Environmental Protection Agency points out, for instance, that:
“Climate change can have a variety of impacts on surface water, drinking water, and ground water quality. Higher water temperatures and changes in the timing, intensity, and duration of precipitation can affect water quality. Higher air temperatures (particularly in the summer), earlier snowmelt, and potential decreases in summer precipitation could increase the risk of drought. The frequency and intensity of floods could also increase. In addition, sea level rise may affect freshwater quality by increasing the salinity of coastal rivers and bays and causing saltwater intrusion—the movement of saline water into fresh ground water resources in coastal regions.”
Let's just underline all this. If a majority of Americans is worried about the purity of their drinking water, they should be worried about climate change impacts on drinking water. Sea level rise will turn fresh water salt in coastal regions. Water will be scarcer with the increase in dry spells. As surface ice disappears, snowmelt water for drinking will literally evaporate (millions of people depend on this source around the world). In addition, extreme weather events caused by climate change include powerful rain storms and flooding (as happened in Britain this winter). Flooding can wash untreated toxic waste into our drinking water, with disease risks that include hepatitis and even cholera.
As for extinction of plants and animals, CO2-induced climate change is a major threat to many species. Some kinds of toads, penguins, cod, coral and bears are already in big trouble.
In the seas, where acidification is happening faster than any time in 300 million years, a sixth great extinction may already have begun. Loss of marine life would starve millions of human beings. But tiny sea creatures called phytoplanckton also produce 40 percent of our oxygen, and killing them off could suffocate us.
There isn't anything more illogical than a majority or plurality of Americans worrying about environmental issues but being sanguine about climate change. Human-produced carbon dioxide is the most pressing environmental crisis the human species has faced in its 150,000-year existence. The little Republican children now toddling about at playgrounds are going to be hit by that crisis just as hard as everyone else. Their grandparents should be ashamed of themselves for throwing them to the hydrocarbon lions.

Earth Institute: “Climate Change and Mono Lake”
Digital Spy reports that Man of Steel writer and Superman/Batman co-writer David S. Goyer talked about the controversial ending of this summer's Superman movie during last night's BATFA and BFI Screenwriters' Lecture.
While Superman has been reluctant to take a life in the comics, Goyer stated that's not the case for the movies.
“We were pretty sure that was going to be controversial,” Goyer said. “It's not like we were deluding ourselves, and we weren't just doing it to be cool. We felt, in the case of Zod, we wanted to put the character in an impossible situation and make an impossible choice.
“This is one area, and I've written comic books as well and this is where I disagree with some of my fellow comic book writers – ‘Superman doesn't kill'. It's a rule that exists outside of the narrative and I just don't believe in rules like that. I believe when you're writing film or television, you can't rely on a crutch or rule that exists outside of the narrative of the film.
“So the situation was, Zod says ‘I'm not going to stop until you kill me or I kill you.' The reality is no prison on the planet could hold them and in our film Superman can't fly to the moon, and we didn't want to come up with that crutch.
“Also our movie was in a way Superman Begins, he's not really Superman until the end of the film. We wanted them to have had that experience of having taken a life and carry that through onto the next films. Because he's Superman and because people idolise them they will have to hold themselves to a higher standard.”
In another article on the event, The Hollywood Reporter says that Goyer was asked whether they were writing the upcoming Justice League movie as well. “Might be, can't say,” they said.

Mrs. Bridge and Mr. Bridge (Counterpoint, $15 and $16) by Evan S. Connell. In these two novels, Connell writes in bright, sharp, gorgeously clear short chapters about the lives of bourgeois Midwesterners. The plots are minimal; the books' strengths are the depth of characterization and the ache that is so visible in the restrained language and the main characters' profound though often unexpressed love. Of the two, Mrs. Bridge is the masterwork, but together these books are so affecting that I still think of them almost daily, years after I read them.
Middlemarch by George Eliot (Bantam, $7). I'd argue that Middlemarch is the single greatest English-language book about marriage (a silly thing to argue, I know, as I haven't read every book in the English language). Eliot needs no introduction from me, but in Middlemarch's Dorothea Brooke we have a beautiful vision of the way a young person comes into a marriage with starry-eyed idealism, and then grows and is changed and returned to themselves by the institution.
Old Filth and The Man in the Wooden Hat (Europa, $17 and $16) by Jane Gardam. I don't know why Gardam isn't universally celebrated and beloved. Them prose is dazzling, and they write with a kind of subdued but wicked humor that takes a moment to clamp down on you. Old Filth, the first book in a trilogy, concerns an aged barrister whose nickname is short for Failed in London Try Hong Kong.  They are a beautiful, admirable old man who has just lost the love of their life, their wife, Betty. In The Man in the Wooden Hat, the story pivots to Betty's perspective. It's just as beautifully written as the first.
I Want to Show You More by Jamie Quatro (Grove, $15). Now for a newer voice in fiction. Quatro's prose is musical and their spirit is passionate. In these gorgeous short stories, they wrestle mightily with sex and God and the South and desire and hunger and, yes, marriage. I'd recommend this collection to absolutely anyone, whether or not they believe that they like short stories.
—Lauren Groff, acclaimed author of The Monsters of Templeton and Arcadia, offers a split view of a picture-perfect modern marriage in their new novel, Fates and Furies.
It's a slice of life that seems like it just happened yesterday: the infamous Fenway pizza throw.
It's been eight years to the day since the nation was captivated by a slice flying through the air at Fenway Park and landing on the shoulder of a beer cup carrying fan.
It all started with old friend J.D. Drew at the plate in a Patriots Day game against the Los Angeles Angels on April 16, 2007. Drew hits a foul pop into the stands between third base and the left field wall, and when Angels left fielder Garrett Anderson attempts to make the catch. While Anderson failed to come up with the ball, they did manage to run their glove into a couple of fans -- Jason Sole from Brookline being one of them -- and on the front line resulting in beer getting splashed all over them. In the midst of all the mayhem, in comes a lone flying slice of pizza hitting Sole square on the head and shoulder.
During subsequent replays of the incident, NESN analyst Jerry Remy calls out: "Here comes the pizza!"
As the story goes, Sole was hit with the slice by Danny Kelly in retaliation for some heckling that happened earlier in the game when Kelly and Matt Madore brought an entire pizza into the section. Both Kelly and Madore were tossed from the park after the toss.
Almost equally famous was Jenny Dell's 2013 interview with Kelly at Fenway where they basically apologized and seemed embarrassed by their actions six years earlier.

In a long-needed move, the Southern Poverty Law Center has named Pamela Geller and their followers a hate group:
Manhattan blogger Pamela Geller and their posse of anti-Islamic protesters have been branded a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Stop the Islamization of America was included in the civil rights organization's annual roundup of extremist groups - a rogue's gallery that includes everything from the Ku Klux Klan to white supremacists and Nazis.
Geller's group was one of the most vocal opponents of the proposed Islamic Center near Ground Zero.
The group was also behind ads that were placed on city buses urging Muslims to leave "the falsity of Islam."
Geller, who runs a blog called Atlas Shrugs, dismissed the Law Center as an "uber left" group that has "failed to address the greatest threat to our national security."
"My group is a human rights group," they said. "And these people are taken seriously? This is the morally inverted state of the world."
Update: It may still be wonky, and we still don't have an explanation for what happened, but Steam is now back in operation, store and all. We'll keep an eye on things, and update again if the situation changes.
Original story:
It's not just you: Steam is down. As far as we can tell, it's down worldwide (a contact in Germany confirmed that it's down there), both the store and services, meaning that some of your single-player games won't work unless you go into offline mode. (I just tried to fire up Fallout 4 and it's a no-go; Escape Goat 2, on other hand, works fine, albeit without access to cloud saves.)
We don't know what's going on at this point, but I've emailed Valve for more information and will update when the situation changes. Hopefully, we'll be able to dive back into the Steam Winter Sale soon.
Keep an eye on steamstat.us for an unofficial check of Steam's many servers.
The Avalanche and restricted free-agent defenseman Tyson Barrie are scheduled to go through a salary arbitration hearing in Toronto on Friday at 7 a.m. MDT, but it remains possible that the two sides will agree to contract terms before the hearing opens, leading to its cancellation.
In fact, after defenseman Michael Stone signed with Arizona on Thursday afternoon, 23 of the 25 NHL players who were scheduled for arbitration hearings instead had reached agreements with their teams. Only Barrie and Toronto defenseman Martin Marincin (hearing Tuesday) remained on the arbitration docket. So if Barrie's camp and the Avalanche actually move forward with the arbitration hearing, it will be the first of the NHL's offseason.
Colorado last week reached a one-year, $1.3 million agreement with forward Mikhail Grigorenko two days before their scheduled arbitration hearing.
Elliotte Friedman of Canada's Sportsnet reported that the Barrie camp — including agent Don Meehan of Newport Sports Management — will argue for a $6 million, one-year deal, while the Avalanche will counter with a two-year deal calling for Barrie to make $4 million and $4.25 million in the next two seasons. The arbitrator would hear and consider the arguments, then announce a decision setting the salary — which can be a compromise figure — within 48 hours. The Avalanche would have the option of walking away from that decision, and Barrie would become an unrestricted free agent.
The $6 million is an especially significant figure because it matches the team's highest salaries for 2016-17 — those of Matt Duchene, Erik Johnson and Semyon Varlamov. (Nathan MacKinnon's seven-year, $44.1 million deal calls for them to make $5 million in the upcoming season before their salary escalates.) The Avalanche, including with Newport Sports client Ryan O'Reilly, previously has been stubborn about maintaining a structure that essentially preserves a salary hierarchy among its best players.
The Avalanche and O'Reilly's camp, including agent Pat Morris, were about to go into the arbitration room two years ago when they compromised and agreed to a two-year, $12 million deal. O'Reilly had been seeking $6.75 million in a one-year deal, while the Avs were offering $5.25 million. O'Reilly made $5.75 million in the first year of the two-year deal before Colorado traded them in 2015, deciding it wouldn't be able to reach agreement with the center on a contract extension.
Barrie, 24, equaled their career high of 13 goals and had 36 assists last season. The arbitration hearing could get bruising, with the Barrie camp citing their offensive numbers and arguing that as a terrific skater and puckhandler, they are among the top offensive defensemen in the league; but with the Avalanche countering that as an undersized defenseman, they have deficiencies in the Colorado end.
Cornell Plantations (Photo: cornellplantations.org)
A group of students at Cornell University is demanding that the school change the name of its botanical garden from “Cornell Plantations” because apparently, the word “plantation” is always racist.
The idea behind the protest is that the word evokes images of slavery. The demand to change it is just one of many demands in a seven-page document sent to the administration by Cornell Black Students United in November.

And it's one that's reportedly actually being considered:
“Our staff and Advisory Council have been considering all aspects of our identity, our name, our mission and how our identity can best reflect what Cornell Plantations is — and does,” Christopher Dunn, director of the gardens, wrote in a piece for the Cornell Daily Sun.
The garden was named “Cornell Plantations” all the way back in 1944, according to a piece in Verdant Views, the plantations' magazine. But according to Cornell Black Students United, it must be changed now. After all, the group claims that its demands must be met in order for the campus to be “conducive to the overall success of students of color.”

#share#FYI: This word, which is apparently so harmful that it is actually, tangibly interfering with certain students' abilities to succeed, is defined on Dictionary.com as:
noun 1. a usually large farm or estate, especially in a tropical or semitropical country, on which cotton, tobacco, coffee, sugar cane, or the like is cultivated, usually by resident laborers. 2. a group of planted trees or plants. 3. History/Historical a. a colony or new settlement b. the establishment of a colony or new settlement. 4. Archaic. the planting of seeds, young trees, etc.Adjective adjective 5. (of clothing, furnishings, etc.) suitable for a plantation or for a tropical or semitropical country.

Notice that there is no mention of the word “slave” or “slavery.”
Warhammer is a game about little plastic Orcs fighting little plastic Dwarfs, but let's be honest: for some people, it's mostly a game of lovingly painting and customizing little plastic Orcs and little plastic Dwarfs, then putting them back on the shelf. It's only fitting that Total War: Warhammer would have a thriving mod scene months after release, with hundreds of mods out there for customizing units in true tabletop fashion. Of course, there are also mods for tweaking the rules of war and telling Chaos to hold its damn horses for a minute so you can get ready for the End Times.
The point is, there are a ton of great Total War: Warhammer mods, and we've updated our guide with the best of them. The following are available via the Steam Workshop and new mods are being uploaded there all the time, so keep an eye out.
In the Total War: Warhammer mod manager you'll see some mods have an exclamation mark signifying that they're “out-of-date”. This means they haven't been updated since the game's most recent expansion but doesn't necessarily indicate a conflict. Have a look at the comments on the Steam Workshop to see if these mods still work, then check the “enable out-of-date mods” box to continue using them. The main actual conflicts occur between mods that alter starting positions in the campaign or add new factions. Bigger overhauls also cause a lot of conflicts, but Total War: Warhammer is easy to tweak with a personalized selection of individual mods like the following.

New units
Closer to Tabletop
Download here
If you want some extra units that fit the official Warhammer background, Closer To Tabletop adds several. It includes Dwarf Dragon Slayers, Reiksguard footsoldiers, and the Imperial Flagellants. Remember those guys from the movie Jabberwocky who were really into whipping themselves? Now you can field units of them. It also tweaks a few rules relating to units, such as giving Steam Tanks magic resistance and increasing the morale bonus enjoyed by Stubborn troops.
Modular Factions - Unlocker
Download here
If you're curious about the Old World's smaller states like the French vampires of Mousillon or the Renaissance Italians of the Tilean City States, this makes them playable in the grand campaign. See how things look from the NPCs' side, complete with their own tech trees and legendary leaders. Modder Lokerian has also cooked up complimentary mods like the Bretonnia Overhaul Pack and Skaeling Overhaul – Feature Pack which add new units, buildings, items, and so on to make these factions as flavorful as the main ones.
The Southern Realms
Download here
Another mod that's compatible with Modular Factions is The Southern Realms, which significantly expands the Border Princes, Estalia, and Tilea, rounding out their armies with units like Border Rangers and Sartosan Pirates as well as new Heroes. Normally these factions seem like reskinned versions of the Empire, but once modded they feel unique.
Southern Hordes
Download here
In tabletop Warhammer the Orcs and Goblins have a diverse roster full of weird creatures like tiny Snotlings and the bouncy Squigs, which are basically space hoppers with fangs. Southern Hordes rounds out the Greenskins with units like these as well as Stone Trolls, Spider Swarms, Savage Giants and more. It's such a significant addition it's likely to crash your campaign but it works fine in custom battles.
All Tabletop Lords
Download here
A growing mod that aims to eventually add new Lords based on every possible general available in the wargame, All Tabletop Lords adds characters like the Lahmian Countess, Light Wizard Lord, Daemon Slayer, and Savage Orc Warboss. It's fully compatible with the Call of the Beastmen expansion, so now the Doombull and three new Shaman Lords can lead their stacks. You'll need to start a new save for this mod to work.
Goblins (Swords and Axes) and Skeleton Warriors (Scythes)
Download here and here
The board game HeroQuest introduced lots of kids to Warhammer, and if you have fond memories of its Goblins and Skeleton Warrior miniatures then this pair of mods recreates them. They also add new loading screen art and quotes from the board game. Those Skeletons look pretty intimidating with long-handled scythes.
Vampire Counts: Human Levies and Additional Vampire Counts Units
Download here and here
There are humans who live in the cursed land of Sylvania as well as undead, because somebody has to sweep the floors in all those brooding gothic castles. The Human Levies mod lets you field units of those poor peasants, mortals with swords or spears as well as hunters with bows, giving the undead their first ranged weapons. You're limited to a maximum of two units of archers to prevent them from being too unbalancing. The Additional Vampire Counts Units mod is similar, but adds crossbows and powerful halberdiers if you're less worried about balance.
Chaos Dwarf Warrior Units
Download here
You'll need the Warriors of Chaos DLC to use this one. In an unmodded game the heavy metal berserkers of Chaos keep Dwarfs around to look after the artillery, but with this they can field entire units of the angry bearded chaps – some with horns and others with ace pointy Babylonian helmets. They carry burning brands for their fire attacks and have high stats, but are costly and need to be recruited via a new building called the Tower of Darkness.
Bugman Thrower Unit
Download here
You'll need The King and the Warlord DLC for this one, which gives the Dwarfs yet another artillery unit, albeit one with a twist. It launches burning barrels of Bugman's Brew, and though it's not an accurate weapon when it does hit the damage can be significant. It also buffs the Dwarfs around it, who can't be stopped from taking cheeky sips even if the stuff they're drinking is highly explosive.
Ogre Leadbelchers
Download here
The Imperials get a new unit in the chubby shape of the Ogre Leadbelchers, mercenaries who give the expression “handcannon” new meaning by lugging around actual cannon barrels to fire at the enemy. They're slow to shoot, but effective when they do.
Screaming Skull Catapults
Download here
Giving artillery to the Vampire Counts may not be great for game balance but they certainly look cool. These bone contraptions launch screaming skulls, and even the skeletons who crew them flinch and cover their earholes at the noise.
When we put together our year–end list of the most popular pedals on Reverb back in December, there was a surprising lack of fuzz boxes represented in the ranks of hip delays and must–have overdrives.
The reason for this likely has to do with the simple nature of fuzz circuits. Fuzzes are relatively easy to build and rely more on specific component selection and construction than on any real technical innovation.
That's not to say there aren't super innovative fuzz pedals (several are represented below), but it does mean that virtually any new garage–dwelling pedal operation can build a compelling fuzz. Some companies — like D*A*M or Jext Telez — specialize in the format, offering a nuanced lineup of historic recreations and new designs.
There are, as a result, a lot of different fuzzes out there, which makes for a more diffused market than many other pedal categories. In the small–shop, boutique realm especially, the appeal of an individual pedal usually has more to do with intangible sonic characteristics than it does a specific feature set, further fueling fuzzheads' never–ending quest for the next great addition to their boards.
To shine some light on that corner of the pedal world, today we're presenting the most popular boutique fuzz pedals on Reverb based on the last year of total sales for used and brand-new units.

What's the chance of rain today?
It's a very simple question. And while its answer seems equally simple, most of us misunderstand it without even realizing we do.
What "Chance of Rain" Does (and Doesn't) Mean
Chance of rain — also known as the chance of precipitation and probability of precipitation (PoPs) — tells you the likelihood (expressed as a percentage) that a location within your forecast area will see measurable precipitation (at least 0.01 inch) during a specified time period.
Let's say tomorrow's forecast says your city has a 30% chance of precipitation. This does not mean...
There's a 30% chance it will rain and a 70% chance it won't
Three out of 10 times when the weather is similar, it will rain
Precipitation will fall 30% of the day (or night)
Thirty percent of the forecast area will experience rain, snow, or storms
Rather, the correct interpretation would be: there is a 30 percent chance that 0.01 inch (or more) of rain will fall somewhere (at any one or multiple locations) within the forecast area.
PoP Adjectives
Sometimes a forecast won't mention the percent chance of precipitation outright, but instead, will use descriptive words to suggest it. Whenever you see or hear them, here's how to know what percent that is:
Forecast Terminology PoP Precipitation's Areal Coverage -- Less than 20% Drizzle, sprinkle (flurries) Slight chance 20% Isolated Chance 30-50% Scattered Likely 60-70% Numerous
Notice that no descriptive words are listed for probabilities of precipitation of 80, 90, or 100 percent. This is because when the chance of rain is this high, it's basically a given that precipitation will occur. Instead, you'll see words like periods of, occasional, or intermittent used, each conveying that precipitation is promised.
You may also see the type of precipitation punctuated with a period — Rain. Snow. Showers and thunderstorms.
If we apply these expressions to our example of a 30% chance of rain, the forecast could read in any of the following ways (they all mean the same thing!):
A 30 percent chance of showers = A chance of showers = Scattered showers.
How Much Rain Will Accumulate?
Not only will your forecast tell you how likely your city is to see rain and how much of your city it will cover it'll also let you know the volume of rain that will fall. This intensity is indicated by the following terms:
Terminology Rainfall Rate Very light < 0.01 inch per hour Light 0.01 to 0.1 inch per hour Moderate 0.1 to 0.3 inches per hour Heavy >0.3 inches per hour
How Long Will the Rain Last?
Most rain forecasts will specify a period of time when the rain can be expected (​after 1 p.m., before 10 p.m., etc.). If yours doesn't, pay attention to whether the chance of rain is advertised in your daytime or nighttime forecast. If it's included in your daytime forecast (that is, This afternoon, Monday, etc.), look for it to occur sometime from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time. If it's included in your overnight forecast (Tonight, Monday Night, etc.), then expect it between 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. local time.
DIY Chance of Rain Forecast
Meteorologists arrive at precipitation forecasts by considering two things: (1) how confident they are that precipitation will fall somewhere within the forecast area, and (2) how much of the area will get measurable (at least 0.01 inch) rain or snow. This relationship is expressed by the simple formula:
Chance of rain = Confidence x Areal coverage
Where "confidence" and "areal coverage" are both percentages in decimal form (that is 60% = 0.6).
In the U.S. and Canada, the chance of precipitation values is always rounded to increments of 10%. The UK's Met Office rounds theirs to 5%.

Have you ever had the chance to speak before an audience, and you inevitably forgot to say something you felt was important?
I do it all the time, even if I've prepared notes in advance.
It happened to me this past weekend while speaking at a photography display of former and current teachers at Western Kentucky University titled “Family Tree: An Exhibition.” The super-talented Tim Broekema, former student and current professor at WKU, curated the show.
I talked about the past and the people who helped build the photojournalism program. But once I was finished, I thought about the things I didn't say and wished I had.
So, here are a few things I wish I would've said:
As much as I'm honored to be a small piece in the incredible puzzle and celebrated program at WKU, and as much as we applaud the vision and building skills of Mike Morse and David Sutherland, it has been James Kenney, coordinator since 2001, who has held the ship together and steered it through deeper, unprecedented waters.
The voyage has not been without rough seas and numerous challenges.
A favorite proverb comes to mind, “Calm seas never made a good sea captain.”
In fairness, they haven't done this alone; they have had the wise council and support of Tim Brokema, Jeanie Adams-Smith, Jo-Ann Huff Albers, Francis Gardler, Jim Bye, Kurt Fattic, Larry Powell, and most recently, Josh Meltzer.
Listening to Mr. Kenney talk to students about the financial challenges of making it through school, I am reminded that each of us faces hardships. It's how we respond to adversity, which determines our success and our character.
—
As I looked out at the small crowd during my speech, I thought about two individuals not in attendance – yet their spirits have stayed with me.
I wanted to tell the audience about Mark Gruber, a WKU graduate of ‘87 who took several photo classes with us. I tried to persuade Mark to become a photo major – they were very talented – but they wanted to fly jets. I couldn't have been more honored the day Mark came to my office, dressed in their Marine uniform, along with their mother and grandmother. I was humbled that they wanted their family to meet me. They had driven an hour from Elizabethtown. I remember telling their family how proud I was of Mark and how I believed they could've made photography their career. I told Mark I would sleep better knowing they were flying over our skies as we slept.
Mark died in a jet crash in November of 1992 at the age of 26 over the North Atlantic.
I also wanted to talk about another former student named Lynn Saunders. They were a beautiful young woman, whose lovely face was disfigured and scarred by a brain tumor. Lynn struggled to keep their balance and suffered from seizures; however, they didn't allow life's difficult hurdles to become spirit-killing obstacles. They persevered.
Lynn wrote me an email saying they finally found their place as a picture editor, and they loved it more than anything.
“I love what I do. I realized one day that I've been preparing for this job as picture editor all of my life. Even as a baby I would say, ‘Mom, that diaper is a little too tilted.'”
A month later Lynn died in a car accident.
WKU is truly a family – a large one now – with several generations. A family I am grateful to be a member of.
The WKU family is strong, not only for the Pulitzer prizes it has received; it's strong because of the heartaches and hardships it has endured.

The United States is now bombing ISIS targets in Syria, opening a new front and possibly new dangers in the region. Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN's top diplomatic troubleshooter for more than two decades, argues that a series of critical American mistakes in the Middle East since 9/11 have brought President Obama, a reluctant warrior, to this point, with no sign that American policymakers have learned from the past. Our UN correspondent, Barbara Crossette, spoke with Brahimi in Paris. Ad Policy
The United States, now expanding its war against the formidable, ruthless fighters of the Islamic State, has found Arab nations willing to join the campaign in their own self-interest, but the base on which the coalition is built is not a very solid one. More than two decades of American naïveté or misunderstanding of Arab and other regional societies, astonishingly poor planning and post-conflict miscalculations that undercut claims of success, have left a deep mistrust and lack of confidence in the United States, in the view of the United Nations' most experienced and savvy international envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, who worked closely with Americans in Iraq in 2004 and Afghanistan in 2001–04. Brahimi was the UN-Arab League special representative for Syria from 2012 until early this year.
To add to the skepticism, despair and alienation across the region, Brahimi says, is the corrosive, unconditional American support of Israel despite its unending land grabs and military assaults on Palestinians, most recently in the attacks on Gaza this summer. It was outrageous that the reaction in Congress and from President Obama to the most recent carnage and death was prefaced with the time-worn expression “Israel has the right to defend itself,” Brahimi said, adding that the lack of sensitivity to the hugely imbalanced casualty figures—more than 2,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza compared with sixty-eight Israelis, almost all of them soldiers, according to United Nations figures—seemed to imply that “Gazans are not human.”
“I generally don't like to speak about countries,” said Brahimi, usually a consummate diplomat who was Algeria's foreign minister from 1991–93, “but [Obama] is not the president of the United States only. He's a kind of president of the world. I still remember their Cairo speech in 2009. That was an inspired and inspiring speech. So looking back at that speech, definitely we are disappointed.”
Brahimi, now 80, speaking in an interview from their home in Paris, said that, like it or not, “the Palestinian issue is still important for all of us in this region. This is a very, very big part of the story. Anything on the Palestinian issue is decided by the Israelis. It is a mistake to go to the Americans: Please come and help us with this problem. They cannot. They are not allowed to. We need Americans. They have a huge role to play. But they cannot be an honest broker.” Not that there have never been laudable American efforts to find solutions, they said.
“I had an opportunity to hear [Secretary of State] John Kerry speak of what they were trying to do to help solve that [Palestinian] problem,” Brahimi said. “That was just over one year ago. I was profoundly impressed at how much work they had put into the exercise, how they were genuinely trying to be fair and impartial. But I had no illusions: the present Israeli Government and the formidable machine supporting them in the US. shall not allow them to succeed. That is why I say the US cannot be an honest broker.” They recall the day when Condoleezza Rice, as secretary of state, was forced to veto a resolution on the Middle East that they had personally negotiated in the Security Council after Washington got a call from Israel opposing the measure.
Brahimi began to question seriously the effectiveness of American strategic thinking about the West Asia–Middle East region in the 1990s, when the neocons in Washington began to pressure first the Clinton administration and then President George W. Bush to take down Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, whom the US had supported during their disastrous and opportunistic eight-year war with Iran in the 1980s. But the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the subsequent first Gulf War and the long ordeal of disarming Iraq that followed—during which Brahimi was called in as a UN adviser to the secretary-general time to time—had hardened conservative opinion, and Saddam loomed ever larger as a target.
Brahimi was working in Afghanistan in 2001 when the attacks of September 11 sent American bombs and eventually troops in to Afghanistan. But that commitment to Afghanistan was superficial from the start, they observed.
“We discovered that in fact from day one—from the 14th of September—the Americans were not really interested in Afghanistan,” they said. It was only a matter of time before the Bush administration finally went for Iraq, their prime—and to many, inexplicable—target.
The invasion of Iraq and what followed lies at the root of all that has gone wrong since in that neighborhood, Brahimi said, and the record of the United States may appear as one of the colossal blunders of recent history. It left Iran in a much stronger position than it had been in decades, and opened the door to the violence now tearing Iraq apart.
“When they invaded Iraq, they didn't seem to have planned anything for post-invasion,” Brahimi said. “They weren't really ready. The net result of their invasion, if you look at it from where we are now, is that the Americans—the Great Satan in person—helped Iran get rid of their worst enemy in the region: Saddam. They did better than that, as far as Iran was concerned. They put in charge [in Iraq] not only the majority Shia, which is understandable, but of the people who were there amongst the Shia leaders, they looked like picking up only the friends of Iran. So without exaggerating too much, you could say that the Americans got rid of the Iranians' worst enemy, and then they handed Iraq to Iran on a silver platter.
“Iran today, as a result of 2003, has much more influence in Baghdad than the United States or anybody else,” Brahimi said. “Indeed, they have much more influence in Baghdad than the rest of the world combined. This is the situation that you have now.”
Another, catastrophic unplanned outcome of the war against Saddam was the alienation of the hastily and carelessly dismembered largely Sunni Iraqi army, without much thought that some of these soldiers and officers would regroup to join the fight against the Shia government. To make matters worse, Brahimi said, the Americans did not collect Saddam's weapons, which were there for the taking when ISIS began to move into Iraq. Brahimi said that the Islamic State—which they call Daesh, the Arabic acronym for the organization's full title—was Iraqi from the start, a fact that may be getting lost in the present emphasis on its Syrian bases.
“Daesh did not start in Syria,” they said, “Daesh was the mutation of some of the organizations fighting against the Americans and then fighting against the Shia regime in Baghdad, and they moved into Syria when events in Syria looked promising. The membership is much more Iraqi than it is Syrian, with other people from the region and beyond—the Islamic Internationale, if you like. But it has been originally and still is mainly an Iraqi phenomenon. And that is a direct result of the invasion of Iraq in 2003.”
Naivete and the resulting sketchy picture of the Arab region as all part of a unitary Arab World led to more miscalculations after 2011, when protests broke out in North Africa. The whole concept of an “Arab spring” seems to have been a Western invention, they said. It led Americans to an unconscious resurrection of the domino theory. After the fall of governments in North Africa—Tunisia and Egypt in particular; Libya was a different case altogether—American officials began to expect Bashar Assad's Syria to go down next. In Libya in 2011, numerous countries have consistently argued, European and American governments tricked the UN Security Council into authorizing military regime change in the guise of humanitarian action, adding to mistrust of Western powers.
“When the situation in Syria came along, they thought, ah, they are to follow the route of Mubarak and everybody started shouting, Bashar will be out! In hindsight, Brahimi said, “I think it was not the proper thing to do to personalize things. Syria is a big and complicated country. They definitely need change and maybe if the regime gave way to a totally new regime, I think that would probably be acceptable to the majority of the Syrians. But to put all the emphasis on one man was not the right thing to do. Anyway what we have now is that Daesh is seen as the bad guy, more than Bashar is, and the thing is, How are you going to get rid of Daesh but not strengthen the hand of Bashar Assad?
“In Syria, I must confess that I don't think I attended a meeting with anybody in the American administration or the British, or indeed many people in the region where people said, OK we want to get rid of Assad and their regime but what about Daesh, this extremist organization? It was taken for granted that that was not terribly important; once the regime was out of the way it would be easy to deal with that. It was thought that the Assad regime would fall in a matter of weeks. Once they are out of the way, then we'll see what we do with these people. In 2012-2013, if I'm not mistaken, I don't remember anyone saying this is serious, this is dangerous.”
“When we speak of the Arab world, yes, there is something of an Arab world,” Brahimi said, surveying the region. “People speak the same language, they are members of the League of Arab States, divisions between countries are artificial, people are very close to one another across borders. So an Arab world exists, but Arab states also do exist. And these Arab states have existed long enough to have very different and specific situations.” In that period outsiders still call the Arab Spring, countries across North Africa had markedly differing experiences.
“In Algeria there were some tentative demonstrations but they never have been able to gather any steam,” Brahimi said. “Partly they were afraid of the repeat of the 1990s when 200,000 people were killed. The other reason is that Algeria has money and I think that the government did respond. People were concentrating on material demands and the government was in a position to satisfy most of those demands.”
“Morocco is very, very interesting,” they said, “They had demonstrations—anti-government, anti-regime—at about the same time that that happened in Egypt. But the king of Morocco, [Mohammad the 6th] was very, very perceptive. They immediately dissolved Parliament, and put together a team of highly respected lawyers to produce a new constitution and had new elections. The new elections produced a parliament where the number one party was an Islamist party [and] the king offered them the leadership of government. The party of the Islamists has been in power until now. In Morocco reform has worked and seems to be still working.”
Of the three important countries in the Maghreb—Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco—Tunisia surprised the region by being first to change its regime radically, driving President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, despite their extensive security services, out of office and out of the country in a few weeks after protests broke out at the end of 2010. Egypt followed with the fall of Hosni Mubarak in early 2011.
In all of these countries, Islamic parties had their own policies, though all may have links with the Muslim Brotherhood, Brahimi said. In Tunisia and Morocco, Islamists parties have so far kept to their promises of honoring the principle of multiparty democracy.
“And then there are the Egyptian Muslim Brothers, who promised not to run for all the seats in Parliament, not to have a candidate for president—and they didn't keep those promises,” they said. “They had candidates in every single constituency, and they ran for president and of course won.” That unpopular and autocratic president, Mohamed Morsi, was overthrown in 2013 by the army. General Abdul Fatah al-Sisi is now president. What's next for Egypt?
“ What you hear from people in Egypt is that the Muslim Brothers have disappointed the country, and they have lost a great deal of support,” Brahimi said. Many Egyptians hope that political violence is a thing of the past, “But to hear from others, No, not at all,” Brahimi said, “The core base of the organization has not disappeared. They are still there and they will always be there, and you have to see how you can accommodate them.”
Mechanical keyboards are all the rage these days. Hardcore gamers and long-haul coders alike are flocking away from traditional membrane-based keyboards in favor of their more clicky-clacky competition. If you still haven't hopped on the bandwagon, here's everything you need to know.
How Keyboards Work
To understand what makes mechanical keyboards great, you must first understand how keyboards work. At its most basic, any keyboard (mechanical or otherwise) works pretty much as you would expect it to: you hit a key, that keystroke is registered by the electronics in your board, and sends it to your PC, where it turns into text. What separates the different styles of keyboards, though, is how those strikes are actually communicated to your board.
Most standard boards use what's known as a “membrane” system, where a thin film of dome-shaped rubber or silicone separates the key from the top of the keyboard's electrical circuits. When you press a key, the membrane depresses, allowing the two contacts to meet and the keystroke to register with the computer. As such, the key only has two positions: up or down. You can't really press a key down halfway.
In mechanical keyboards, however, there is no membrane. Instead, each strike is handled by an actual mechanical switch that slides up and down. Each individual key is its own self-contained system, complete with the key, a metal actuator, and a spring that depresses on a stroke and returns the key back to its un-pressed state after a successful strike. The keyboard registers a keypress when the key is halfway down–not when it bottoms out completely.
Why Mechanical Keyboards Are Great
In a word: flexibility.
Membrane-based boards pretty much offer one of two choices in how the keys respond: rubber or silicone (which doesn't make all that much of a difference when typing). Mechanical keyboards, on the other hand, come in many different types of switches. Some are harder to press, some have more tactile feedback, and so on. With so many choices, you can personally choose your board based on your usage and typing style.
RELATED: HTG Reviews the CODE Keyboard: Old School Construction Meets Modern Amenities
As technology continues its inexorable march forward, we find ourselves spending more time sat down at our keyboards than ever before. Mechanical keyboards give users the option to acutely target exactly what they need from a board, and buy accordingly. If you're a hard typer (like myself) and bottom out immediately on every strike, there are switches that are made to accommodate that. If you type light and quick and don't find yourself making too many typos over the workday or during a gaming session, there are switches for that, too.
Those switches also allow for more keystrokes at once than many traditional dome keyboards, which is great for gamers. This functionality is described as “rollover” and high-end keyboards will be advertised as having “n-rollover” where “n” is the maximum number of keys that can be simultaneously pressed. Never again will you have to deal with a key not registering because you were pressing down too many keys at once.
Lastly, since mechanical keyboards use more durable switches, they tend to last significantly longer under any typing conditions. The average rating for a membrane key is about 10 million keystrokes before it finally starts to give way, while mechanical keys are rated at an average of 50 millions strokes. This means that a mechanical keyboard could potentially last five times as long. You would need to type out the entire collected works of Shakespeare 2,663 times just to break 50 million keystrokes on the “E” key.
Of course, all that comes at a price. Mechanical keyboards are always going to be slightly more expensive on average due to the parts required to manufacture them. They generally range anywhere from $50-$200, depending on the features and design. So a $20 membrane keyboard may be better if you're on a serious budget, but $50 for a keyboard that lasts five times as long is a good deal–especially since you have so many choices.
That said, membrane-style keyboards do have one big benefit over their mechanical counterparts. Because of the way the mechanical switches are constructed, you won't find them in slim designs like Apple's chiclet keyboard, or Logitech's slim K740. For anyone who has shorter fingers or finds themselves struggling with hand fatigue on standard keys, flat keys can provide a more relaxing alternative that make for less travel distance between the top of each key whenever you need to reset on a new word. Plus, they're a bit easier to transport, if you're moving them around a lot.
The Different Types of Mechanical Switches
Since there are so many different types of mechanical switches, it helps to know the basics before you go out shopping for a keyboard. The most common switches include Cherry MX Blue, MX Brown, MX Clear, MX Red, and MX Black. Cherry (now Cherry US) has been the king of keyboard switches since the early 1960's, and if you grew up typing on old clunky IBM keyboards, you're probably already familiarized with various products the company has put out over the years. (There are other companies that make their own switches, but we'll get into later).
RELATED: How to Change Your Keyboard Layout in Windows 8 or 10
There are two main differences between switches. The first is what's called the “actuation force” (measured in “cN”), which determines how much pressure you need to put on the key for it to move. In theory, the less actuation force necessary, the faster you can type. The more force necessary, however, the more difficult it might be to get a keystroke to register, which can translate to increased overall accuracy.
MX Blue: 60cN, MX Brown: 55cN, MX Clear: 65cN
The benefit of a more resistant actuator is that it can prevent typos when your finger slips and you accidentally graze the wrong key. This is also a potential boon for gamers who need the most precision possible when blasting baddies out of the sky. This can also increase strain for longer typing sessions, though, which means that if you mainly use your keyboard for coding or data entry, you might want to stick to lighter switches instead.
The second differentiator is the amount of audible or tactile feedback you'll get from the keyboard, which indicates when a key has “registered”. Audible feedback works just as you'd imagine: the key has a small piece of metal that “clicks” when the key has completed the full travel distance necessary to register a strike. Similarly, tactile feedback works off a small “bump”, one that pushes back on the key. That way, you can “feel” when a keystroke has gone through.
MX Red: 45cN, MX Black: 60cN
Different styles of switches will offer different combinations of this feedback. Cherry MX Blues come with a tactile bump and a loud clicking noise, while Browns and Clears offer a bump with less noise. Reds and Blacks, which are generally designed for gaming, have no tactile bump, which makes them great for quick keypresses and double-tapping. MX Browns fall more in the middle, offering a small bump. And while it could be said that one switch is “better” than another for a particular application, in the end which switch is right for you will ultimately come down to personal preference. The best way to know what's going to be right for you is to get down to your local electronics store and try a few different options out for yourself to see what flows best.
Cherry MX switches aren't the only options out there, though they are the most popular across the largest number of boards. Both Logitech and Razer manufacture their own proprietary switches in their products, all of which still align with the same technical balance between actuation force, audible feedback, and tactile bumps. So keep that in mind as you shop as well.
The best thing about mechanical keyboards is that unlike their membrane-based competition, there are several different types of keys that cater to every kind of typist, gamer, or programmer out there. If you require as much feedback as possible and like a loud keyboard that tells everyone in a ten-mile radius that you're getting your work done at 85 words-per-minute, go ahead and pick up a board equipped with MX Blue switches. If you want to keep decibel levels a bit stealthier however, there are plenty of keyboards out there with MX Brown switches instead.
No matter which style you eventually choose, it's hard not to see the many benefits and levels of personal customization that mechanical keyboards can offer for every member of your office or household.
Almost a third of young women don't feel safe in public places at night, A Right to the Night report finds
Posted
One in three young Australian women do not believe they should be in public spaces at night, a report has found.
Key points: A Right to the Night questioned 600 young women across Australia
It found many felt unsafe in public and on public transport at night
Many women "modifying" attire to avoid unwanted attention
Nearly a quarter of those asked also said they did not think young women should ever travel on public transport alone.
"We were really surprised to get the results back," Susanne Legena of child rights agency Plan International Australia said.
"This is Australia in 2016, and you've got one in three young women saying they're afraid to be out in public spaces after dark ... and as a result they're curbing their behaviour."
The report, A Right to the Night — by the research firm Ipsos — questioned 600 young women aged 15 to 19 across Australia.
The survey was commissioned by Plan International Australia and Our Watch — a not-for-profit group dedicated to preventing violence against women.
"There's this in-built kind of fear that you all acknowledge that you shouldn't go out at night if you're a girl," 18-year-old Kea Tokley-Higgs, a first year university student, said.
Ms Tokley-Higgs and two friends said they did not find the results surprising — they all feel unsafe after dark in public places.
Do you know more about this story? Email investigations@abc.net.au.
"Women should feel safe enough to go outside at night. Women are as much a part of the society as men are, so we should have every right to the public space," 18-year-old Lana Rice said.
"It's just so shocking and disappointing that a country like ours is still suffering from this sort of ideas, and this fear that's spreading for all the young women," Grady-Mae Dixon, also 18, said.
The young women the ABC spoke to said the reasons for feeling unsafe included:
The many incidents of sexual assaults on women
Feeling uncomfortable around men who had been drinking
Feeling insecure in relatively empty areas with poor lighting
Another aspect of the report found nearly a quarter of young women believed they should never take public transport alone.
That number also was not a surprise for Sherry Xu, 18, who is particularly uneasy on public transport after dark.
"At night time, when I'm alone, I feel a little bit apprehensive." Ms Xu said, as they rode on a relatively empty train in the evening in Melbourne's northern suburbs.
 They are also deeply affected by reports of assaults on women.
"Because of these stories, I do feel more frightened when I am taking public transport. Because I'm frightened that these things might actually happen to me, as someone who's also a young woman."
Victim blaming firmly entrenched in Australian culture
Plan International said perhaps the most troubling response to the survey was when young women were asked about clothing.
One of the things that really emerged out of the research is this culture we have in Australia of victim blaming. Susanne Legena, Plan International Australia's
Seventen per cent agreed that when a girl wears revealing clothing, they are partially responsible for unwanted attention or harassment.
"One of the things that really emerged out of the research is this culture we have in Australia of victim blaming," Plan International Australia's Susanne Legena said.
"Young women have internalised that ... they're choosing to stay at home, modify the clothes they wear, in order to feel safe."
Grady-Mae Dixon believes victim blaming is firmly entrenched in Australian culture.
"When someone gets attacked, or a woman specifically, the question is: 'What was they wearing?' 'How did they act?' 'Was they drinking?' 'Cause they were asking for it if they were drinking."
Plan International conducts similar surveys around the world.
Young women in Australia felt more unsafe in public spaces than did their counterparts in Nicaragua in Central America, where only 23 per cent of young women felt they should avoid public spaces after dark.
City planners urged to consider women's safety more
The report recommends practical and wide ranging solutions.
It suggests city planners take women's safety concerns more into account with improved lighting at night and a higher priority placed on personal security on public transport.
It also recommends more responsible reporting about sexual assaults and violence against women, with special attention paid to avoiding victim blaming.
It also wants to see more education for young men and women about the rights of young women to feel secure in public spaces.
The young women the ABC spoke with say a good start would be if men — particularly their peers — would give more consideration to how easy it is for young women to feel unsafe in public.
"My male friends ... sometimes they don't really see what the problem is necessarily. And they think that we're overreacting," Kea Tokley-Higgs said.
Grady-Mae Dixon added: "They don't understand the fear that you feel ... because they've never felt it themselves."

Plot Edit
The Ninth Doctor, Rose, and Adam arrive on Satellite 5, a space station orbiting Earth in the year 200,000. The Doctor gets Adam and Rose some credits to buy food while they look around the station. The Doctor meets a woman named Cathica, a reporter who tells them that the station is a giant broadcast tower transmitting news across Earth. Cathica leads them to a room where they sit down in a chair located in the centre of a round table. The reporters are connected to the computer via a special port installed directly into the brain. The Doctor believes there is a malevolent purpose to the station that is holding back human development. They learn from Cathica that a select few are invited to Floor 500, which is believed to be the highest promotion that can be earned on the station. The Doctor, with Rose, hacks into the computer systems of the station and is detected by the Editor. The Editor allows the Doctor and Rose to travel to Floor 500, with Cathica following soon after. On Floor 500 the Doctor and Rose find the Editor directing control over the station through a number of dead humans. On the ceiling resides the Editor-in-Chief, the Jagrafess, to whom the Editor answers. The Doctor learns that the Jagrafess controls the lives of the people on the planet below by manipulating the news. Meanwhile, Adam discovers that they can gain access to information about Earth's future. They have an information port installed in their brain and uses Rose's phone to call their answering machine at home and transfer data to it. The port also allows the Jagrafess into Adam's mind. The Jagrafess learns about the Doctor and makes plans to kill him. The Doctor, aware of Cathica's presence outside the room, loudly comments on how altering the environmental systems will likely kill the Jagrafess. Cathica reverses the cooling system, causing Floor 500 to overheat, killing the Jagrafess and the Editor. As the humans on board the station and on Earth come to wake from the stupor they have been in, the Doctor congratulates Cathica and gives them hope for the future. The Doctor discovers Adam's duplicity and takes them to their home on Earth. The Doctor destroys the answering machine with the data from the future on it and tells Adam they are no longer welcome in the TARDIS.

Broadcast and reception Edit
There was this period of time in my life — a phase that wasn't a phase, as such, but how life would remain. The bomber jacket, the Reebok Classic, the Creative Zen MP3 player, the worshipping Sol Campbell phase.
For those of you young enough to know them only as a song we shouldn't sing and a rather strange football pundit-slash-politician-slash-commentator on café workers, the betrayal is deep. Deeper than this FA Cup memory. Perhaps one day I will tackle this; but, for now, know that at one stage in my life, they were a Dele Alli/Ledley King/Harry Kane/Gareth Bale rolled into one. Campbell was one of our own when Kane was just one of a million single-celled swimmers.
The nineties for Spurs was a desolate wasteland of no-marks, has-beens and never-should-have-beens. Therefore, when someone like David Ginola or a home-grown player like Campbell bursts up through the mire, you take notice. Their physique meant they played everywhere, their ability meant that they could and they even managed a goal on their debut. They were a bit of everything and they were ours.
The early part of their career saw them deployed in a variety of roles; from target man, to left-back, to holding midfielder. But it was at centre-back where they were truly at home. I remember them taking to the field during Euro 96 and, despite being an Italy fan, I couldn't help but beam with pride as a Tottenham-heavy team did something that hadn't been done in six years: unite a country.
Ginola may have been the oil painting, but Campbell was the nail it hung upon
However, it was during that Euro cameo at Wembley that it became clear that their future was at centre-back. Campbell, despite their talents, just wasn't nimble or technical enough to play in midfield at the highest level. However, at centre-back they were a graceful colossus. It was in this role that they became our captain and leader. Ginola may have been the oil painting, but Campbell was the nail it hung upon. As our leader they guided us to the 1999 League Cup and became the first black captain to lift a major trophy under the Twin Towers. The nineties were shambolic, but they had a bright spot here and there.
After the joy of watching us lift the Worthington Cup, it seemed as if the George Graham reign would bring another day of glory. The FA Cup of 1999 may forever be known as ‘the Giggs FA Cup', after their solo effort vs Woolwich in the other semi, but for me it's the memory of Sol's handball.
In a tough game against a Ruud Guillt-led Newcastle, neither team mustered up the skill or class to break the deadlock. The game was heading for a replay until — inexplicably — a looped ball over the top was met by the hand of Campbell. It was a stupid, careless and rash mistake; the more you see it, the more confusing their reaction was. The ball was nothing more than a scoop and hope, but it presented Alan Shearer the ball from 12 yards and ended our hopes for a cup double.
In-between an FA Cup final and Spurs was Ian Walker, a man who had never recovered their mojo after Gianfranco Zola beat them at their near post at Wembley. The keeper waited for the penalty, lost in their light blue and orange Pony kit. It was obvious it was never going to end with a Tony Park- style celebration. Instead, Walker did a Peter Shilton and dived so early and so slowly that they were still mid-air when Shearer thumped home the killer goal in the last minute of extra time. It was a painful end to a cup run that had promised so much, but for our failure to fall at the hands of one of our better players made the defeat harder to take.
It was Campbell's last ever moment as a Spurs player, they were subbed off for King. From then on we had Ledley, not Sol at the back
Spurs finished the 90s in mediocrity, going out of the UEFA Cup in the second round, finishing tenth and continuing a habit of losing FA Cup semi-finals that continues to this day.
The noughties started with Spurs in rather better shape; we may still have had the mediocrity across the park, but movement was afoot. Daniel Levy, who had hair back then, was at the helm, and with them came the departure of George Graham, a decision that upset few.
There was also a gentleman rising through the ranks. A player who, had they been Italian, would've been labelled “un predestinato,” a player destined for greatness. Ledley King, who had actually been on the bench for the Newcastle semi, was months — half a season at most — from forming a centre-back pairing that very few teams in the world would have been able to match.
Campbell, at this stage, was an England regular; a standout performer at the 1998 World Cup, a future England captain and Spurs legend. And waiting to partner them was King. It would have been a defensive duo with everything: power and subtlety, aggression and poise, speed and vision. It would've been glorious. Looking back and speaking to those that remember the days, it was like not being able to field Chris Waddle, Paul Gascoigne and Gary Lineker all at the same time. Spurs were always a month or two away from the big prizes.
Today Campbell is remembered only by those that despise him, that is what hurts them and that today is where I take some small amount of pleasure from
With Graham gone, Levy installed Spurs legend Glenn Hoddle and, in their first game, we faced Woolwich in Campbell's third FA Cup semi-final loss (the first was Everton in 1995 [he was injured]) at the club. To be honest we had little hope — even the ‘new manager bounce' couldn't help us. We took the lead through Gary Doherty flicking in Steffen Iversen's wayward volley, but the game was never under our control. We were fortunate to take the lead, we were fortunate looking back to only lose 2-1.
However, it isn't the manner of the defeat that makes it continue to resonate but the moment Campbell, who had been a doubt to start with, overstretched for the ball. While they were receiving medical attention, Patrick Viera headed home the equaliser. It was Campbell's last ever moment as a Spurs player, they were subbed off for King. From then on we had Ledley, not Sol at the back.
That summer they did what they did and they ruined everything they achieved. They should've been a legend; they were a cup winning captain, something we've been in short supply of. They were an England regular and one who would star at the 2002 World Cup and win a lot of stuff with my lot. They should have been our hero. They should be receiving the same kind of demigod worship that King receives. We would have held them to our chests and given them the love and respect they crave. They don't love him, they have others to build statues of and sing about. Today, Campbell is remembered only by those that despise him. That is what hurts them and from that I take some small amount of pleasure. I digress.
The FA Cup is back this Saturday and, as it always does, it brings with it the glory and the darkness in equal measure. What does Saturday have for us?
ATLANTA -- The federal investigators looking into the breach that exposed personal information maintained by the Equifax credit report company are used to dealing with high-profile hacks and the challenges they present.
The U.S. attorney's office and FBI in Atlanta have prosecuted developers and promoters of the SpyEye and Citadel malware toolkits, used to infect computers and steal banking information. They've helped prosecute a hack into Scottrade and ETrade that was part of an identity theft scheme, and aided the international effort that in July shut down AlphaBay, the world's largest online criminal marketplace.
The U.S. Attorney's office has confirmed that, along with the FBI, it is investigating the breach at Atlanta-based Equifax, which the company said lasted from mid-May to July and exposed the data of 145 million Americans. Neither agency would discuss Equifax, but their cybercrime teams shared insights about the difficulties of cybercrime cases.
"They are challenging, and the success stories are rare," said prosecutor Steven Grimberg, who leads the Atlanta U.S. attorney's office cybercrime unit, created last year to fight the growing threat. For every conviction there may be 10 times as many that don't end successfully, they said.
Atlanta has become a hub for cybercrime prosecution in large part because of a proactive and aggressive local FBI team, and because U.S. attorneys have committed the necessary resources in recent years, Grimberg said.
Who's behind the keyboard?
Identifying who's responsible is a key difficulty: Cybercriminals use aliases and operate on the dark web, in corners of the internet reached using special software, where access is invite-only.
Investigators have infiltrated some of these online forums and can sometimes engage cybercriminals there, said FBI Supervisory Special Agent Chad Hunt, who oversees one of FBI Atlanta's cyber investigation squads. Once they obtain some information, they can use search warrants to get other data, such as business records or credit card transactions, to match the online alias to a real person.
Even extremely sophisticated cybercriminals sometimes slip up or collaborate with someone who's less careful, Hunt said.
"If we're looking at somebody for a while, eventually they'll make a mistake," they said. "So even if they are using high-quality encryption, eventually they'll do something stupid."
Uncooperative foreign governments
Even when a cybercriminal's identity is pinpointed, arrests can take time. Many operate in countries that won't extradite to the U.S. But the FBI continues monitoring these suspects and can catch them if they travel, said Assistant Special Agent in Charge Ricardo Grave de Peralta, who oversees the Atlanta office's cyber investigation squads.
"A lot of these people are in places that aren't so great and they like to go on vacation, and we're happy to meet them in a third location and perhaps bring them to a second vacation here in the United States, all expenses paid," they said with a smile.
Even with friendly foreign governments, extraditions can take time: Often, the merits of a case are essentially litigated in the process, so that authorities in the other country are satisfied the incriminating evidence is solid, Grimberg said.
Deals and cooperation
Once confronted with evidence against them, some cybercriminals decide to plead guilty and work with prosecutors instead of going to trial.
Their language skills, technical expertise and ability to communicate on online forums and sites open exclusively to cybercriminals make their cooperation invaluable, sometimes leading directly to new prosecutions, Grimberg said.
The government is committed to being as transparent as possible about that cooperation, especially when people get lighter sentences as a result, Grimberg said, but details are often sealed because cooperators fear repercussions.
Meaningful sentences
Prosecutors said the SpyEye malware caused close to $1 billion and Citadel more than $500 million in harm to individuals and financial institutions worldwide.
Because the scope of harm can be huge, federal sentencing guidelines often allow for a life-in-prison sentence.
Prosecutors ask for sentences tough enough to send a warning to others, and to discourage the person from returning to cybercrime when they get out. But because cybercriminals are frequently young, have no criminal history and the crimes aren't violent, prosecutors rarely ask for life, Grimberg said.
One hacker involved in SpyEye's development got nine-plus years in prison while another got 15 when sentenced last year, and a Citadel developer got five in July. They weren't ordered to reimburse victims.
That highlights another challenge: Despite financial losses, prosecutors frequently ask judges to find that it is impractical or overly cumbersome to impose restitution. Tracing the affected IP addresses to identify possible victims would be difficult, Grimberg said, and U.S. authorities can't force them to pay once they return to their home countries.
Working with the private sector
Investigators and prosecutors in Atlanta work to establish relationships with companies before anything bad happens, which can make them more comfortable if there is a problem. But companies may hesitate to contact law enforcement because they worry about reputational damage, actions from civil authorities, lawsuits, and the exposure of trade secrets or sensitive information.
The former head of Equifax told members of Congress last month that the company was cooperating with the FBI and state agencies, but Equifax has suffered at least some of these consequences after failing to repair a known security weakness for months this year. Digital burglars had access to the company's computer systems for 11 weeks before Equifax discovered the hack July 29. The company then waited until Sept. 7 before issuing a public alert, saying they hadn't understood until then just how much information had been stolen.
The person or persons who identify as computer hacker "Guccifer 2.0" on Tuesday released what it said is a trove of documents supposedly stolen from the computer system of the Clinton Foundation, apparently including spreadsheets full of the contact information for Democratic donors, and other sensitive material. Guccifer has successfully hacked other U.S. political targets, including the Democratic National Committee, but this material has not been authenticated and the Clinton Foundation says the hacker's claims are not true.

“Many of you have been waiting for this, some even asked me to do it,” Guccifer 2.0 wrote on the blog normally used to distribute stolen material. “So, this is the moment. I hacked the Clinton Foundation server and downloaded hundreds of thousands of docs and donors' databases.”

They also mocked the security procedures of the Clinton family foundation, which has been the focus of relentless attacks by the opponents of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. They claim that the foundation's large network of international donors has created a conflict of interest for Clinton.
“Hillary Clinton and their staff don't even bother about the information security. It was just a matter of time to gain access to the Clinton Foundation server,” they wrote.
Guccifer is widely believed to be one or more Russian hackers operating at the direction of, or at least in consultation with, the Russian government intelligence services. However, their specific identities remain unknown.
The release of the documents comes on the same day that WikiLeaks, the international whistleblower group led by Australian Julian Assange, had scheduled a press conference promising major revelations about Clinton.
Related: Clinton Stays in the Left Lane While Passing Trump
The press conference, held in the middle of the night in US time, was something of a bait-and-switch. Reporters and others who logged in were treated to what some described as a “commercial” for the organization, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary. There was no release of information about Clinton or their campaign.
Guccifer 2.0 nevertheless offered a shout-out to Assange, writing, “P.S. I'm pleased to congratulate WikiLeaks on their 10th anniversary!!! Julian, you are really cool! Stay safe and sound!”
In their post, Guccifer 2.0 claimed that the cache of files “contains docs and donors lists of the Democratic committees, PACs, etc.”
At first glance, the release contains a few elements that call the authenticity of the documents into question. For example, a listing of folders in the system contains one labeled “Pay to Play” -- a term that Clinton's opponent, Republican nominee Donald Trump, frequently uses to characterize Clinton's relationship with the foundation's donors -- and one that a major foundation would be extremely unlikely to use even in internal communications.
Additionally, it contains a spreadsheet supposedly detailing the contributions to Democratic politicians from major banks, alongside the amount of money each was supposed to have received from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which was implemented to help the financial services industry recover from the Great Recession. Guccifer 2.0 suggests that it is a list of, effectively, kickbacks. Again, it seems highly unlikely that a spreadsheet like that would be created by a political party, and there is no clear reason why it would be on the Clinton Foundation's website in the first place.

Michael Gove has said they chose to run for the Conservative Party leadership after deciding "reluctantly but firmly" that Boris Johnson was not capable of uniting the party or the country.
"It had to fall to someone else... I felt it had to fall to me," they said.
The justice secretary was set to back their fellow Leave campaigner. Mr Johnson pulled out after Mr Gove's switch.
Home Secretary Theresa May, who backed staying in the EU, is favourite to win the contest and become prime minister.
The other contenders are Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb, who backed Remain, former defence secretary Liam Fox, who backed leaving the EU, and energy minister and Leave campaigner Andrea Leadsom.
Nominations for the Conservative Party leadership closed at midday on Thursday.
The winner of the contest - sparked by David Cameron's decision to resign after the UK voted to leave the EU - is set to be announced on 9 September.
Mr Gove's decision to run for the leadership and Mr Johnson's subsequent decision to bow out of the contest sent shockwaves through the political world in a day of high drama.
In an interview with the BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Gove, explaining their reasons for standing, said following last week's Brexit result they felt the country needed a leader "who believed heart and soul in leaving the European Union".
"I also believed we needed someone who would be able to build a team, lead and unite. I hoped that person would be Boris Johnson," they said.
But they added: "I came in the last few days, reluctantly and firmly, to the conclusion that while Boris has great attributes they were not capable of uniting that team and leading the party and the country in the way that I would have hoped."

Mr Gove said they had only decided to run for the leadership late on Wednesday evening, and was still to speak to Mr Johnson about their decision.
They rejected as "just not true" accusations from Mr Johnson's supporters that they had betrayed the former London mayor by deciding to stand for leader, rather than throw their weight behind him.
They said they had been "trying hard to persuade" Conservative MPs over the course of the week that Mr Johnson was the right candidate to be leader but after reflecting on conversations with colleagues "I realised it was not going to work".
"So I tried as hard as I could but last night, reflecting on this, I came to the conclusion that ultimately Boris could not build that team, could not provide that leadership and that unity.
"It had to fall to someone else. As someone who had argued consistently that we should leave the European Union, and as someone who's experienced at the highest levels in the Cabinet, I felt it had to fall to me," they said.

Mr Gove - who along with Mr Johnson was a prominent figure in the Leave campaign - also confirmed they had not discussed their decision with Chancellor George Osborne.
Echoing arguments they made during the EU referendum campaign, they said they would work to bring down immigration outside the EU to a "manageable" level, built on an Australian points-style system.
"I'll negotiate with toughness, and with great attention to detail to get the best possible deal for Britain. It's only when we are outside the European Union that we can at last bring those numbers under control in the way that the public want," they said.
Setting out their Brexit plan, Mr Gove said they would not trigger Article 50 - the formal process for leaving the EU - until they were ready to do so.
"The decision to trigger Article 50 is in the hands of the next prime minister. If that is me, I will make a judgement as to when is right for Britain and I won't be hurried or hassled by anyone into pressing that button or triggering that article until I believe it is right for this country," they said.
When Parham Barari decided to go home hunting, lifestyle was at the top of their shopping list.
“It's all about the view,” said Barari, who just moved into the new SkyHouse Dallas apartment tower in Victory Park, on the edge of downtown Dallas. “I got a corner unit overlooking Klyde Warren Park and downtown.
“I fell in love with it.”
Their new digs don't come cheap. Barari is paying just under $3,000 a month for their 885-square-foot, 22nd-floor apartment. That's enough to afford a home mortgage payment instead of apartment rent.
“People tell me that, but what I have right now is great,” said Barari, who just turned 30 and works in medical sales. “I'm a single guy. When I'm married, I might look at houses, but I'm not there yet.”
Barari and thousands of young North Texas residents like them are the reason Dallas-Fort Worth homeownership levels are sinking.
Dallas-Fort Worth has one of the lowest big-city homeownership rates in the country. We're counted with the likes of Los Angeles, New York City and San Francisco as cities that have the smallest share of owners vs. renters, according to a new Census Bureau report.
At the end of 2014, D-FW's homeownership rate stood at just over 56 percent. That was the lowest in Texas and way below the national rate of 64 percent in the fourth quarter, the census study found.
Young, immigrants
D-FW's homeownership rate has declined from a recent peak of 65.2 percent in mid-2010.
How can that be? North Texas has largely recovered from the recession. We're creating more jobs than any other place in the U.S., and our population is growing at a near record rate.
Actually, that growth and prosperity are part of the reason homeownership rates are falling here, analysts say.
“Young people flock to Dallas — they have to go where they think the jobs are,” said Dr. James Gaines, an economist with the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. “All the job creation is attracting recent college graduates and people looking for work.
“And they rent because they don't have equity built up for down payments and they are just starting a job,” Gaines said. “Most of them are single, and they don't want to get tied down with a house.”
At the start of 2015, there were more apartments under construction in North Texas than single-family homes. The D-FW area has the fastest-growing apartment market in the country, with more than 30,000 units in the development pipeline.
“Dallas is also a mecca for immigrants,” Gaines said. “It's not surprising the homeownership rate has fallen.”
No hurry to own
Gaines said attitudes about homeownership have changed in the last decade. While most young people say they want to own a home, they are in no hurry to get there.
Maybe the feeling of the necessity to be a homeowner isn't as strong.
“The millennials don't seem to have as strong a desire to be a homeowner as the baby boomers did,” Gaines said. “They are getting married later and having kids later.”
Less than 30 percent of Texas homebuyers are first-timers — a number lower than the national ratios.
The average Texas homebuyer last year was 45 years old, according to the Texas Association of Realtors. And 72 percent of the state's buyers were married couples.
“It used to be the rule of thumb was the first-time homebuyer bought at 32,” said Ted Wilson, principal with the Dallas-based housing analyst Residential Strategies Inc. “I think the millennials will increase that.
“The millennial generation is nesting later, getting married later,” Wilson said. “That has a lot to do with the explosion of growth in the rental market.
“That's affecting the home market.”
Most young professionals who stay in apartments aren't complaining. The quality of rental housing in North Texas is streets ahead of where it was a generation ago.
“Some of the new places they are renting are Taj Mahals,” Gaines said. “Renting just doesn't have the stigma it once did.”
Barari, who moved from another luxury apartment building in Uptown to Victory Park, has been in Dallas just over two years.
They said he's in no hurry to sign on for homeownership.
“I plan on staying here for a couple of years,” Barari said. “The views are breathtaking.
“I'm right next door to the House of Blues in a young professionals area.”
Barriers to buying
Even if young North Texas residents opt for homeownership, the hurdles are higher than ever before.
Home prices in the area are at a record high, and qualifications for financing a house are the toughest in memory.
For decades, Dallas-Fort Worth had one of the most affordable housing markets in the country. Now the spread between North Texas and national median prices has narrowed to only about $20,000.
“Many of those who are 25 to 35 years old can't buy a house,” Gaines said. “When we had a big run-up in homeownership in the early part of the 2000s, we were basically giving money away to have people go buy houses.
“All of the subprime mortgages and funny money started going out.”
But that fueled the housing crash that kicked off the Great Recession. And since then, lenders have tightened their borrowing requirements.
“The question is, will the homeownership rate go down even more before it stabilizes?” Gaines said. “I don't know if it's hit the floor yet.
“I think it might go down a little bit more in the next year or so.”

The Jungle Bookmovie review
Cast: Neel Sethi, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, Christopher Walken, Lupita Nyong'o
Director: Jon Favreau
Rating: 4/5
Somewhere in downtown Los Angeles, there is a deep, dark jungle where a boy called Mowgli lives among animals. The animals themselves speak in menacing tones of Idris Elba, hold you under their spell in the sultry voice of Scarlett Johansson and sing exactly like Bill Murray. (If you are planning to watch the film in Hindi, make it Priyanka Chopra, Irrfan Khan and Nana Patekar). Probably they got coaching from director Jon Favreau on how to emote for the camera, or maybe they are just natural.
Read: India gives much love to Jungle Book, earns Rs 10 crore in one day
Before you think I have taken leave of my senses while writing The Jungle Book movie review, here's the gist: The film is great but the CGI is even greater. Neel Sethi's Mowgli may be the only living, breathing entity in this live action-CGI stew but you would consider Bagheera, Baloo, Shere Khan and party equally real by the time the show's over.
Neel Sethi's Mowgli may be the only living, breathing being in the film but by the time The Jungle Book ends, the animals will feel equally real to you.
Favreau and their team of tech wizards don't just give you CGI for the heck of it, they make it an integral part of the storytelling. This film would never have been the same without the present day technology and it can only be compared with, say, Avatar. The film is an eye-popping spectacle where the jungle breathes and animals emote with their eyes. The wizardry is overwhelmingly successful in the portrayal of the animals. They are so real – from the way they talk to their loping, sinuous walk to even their eyes – that you eventually forget that some graphic artist just made them up.
Read: This is not the Mowgli you know
Just like the animals, the director turns jungle into a place of fear and, yet, home. From a burst of sunlight and colour in its happy moments, it seamlessly turns into a mist-filled horror with predators lurking at every corner when the mood takes it. Every little detail in this film is rendered with such precision and love that though dangerous, it has enough joie de vivre to carry you along.
The story of the film mostly is true to Rudyard Kipling's timeless tale – abandoned ‘man-cub' Mowgli was found by the wise panther Bagheera years ago. They brought the child to a pack of wolves which is headed by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and mother wolf Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) brings them up with their other cubs.
Dry season approaches and a water truce is called. As all animals drink at the river together, battle-scarred tiger Shere Khan demands that the man-cub should be given up as per law of the jungle. They make it clear that they will attack the wolves if Mowgli doesn't become their lunch. To save Mowgli, Bagheera decided to take them to the village where humans live. On the way, Mowgli will meet the laidback bear Baloo, the mysterious serpent Kaa and gigantopithecus (not orangutan) King Louie.
Shere Khan's cruelty makes the jungle a terrifying, dark place. (Disney)
The voice work is excellent all around. We hear Shere Khan before we see them and Elba brings an air of menace to the film. Khan is enjoying their cruelty and the actor shows it. Villain of the year, anyone? Ben Kingsley's Bagheera, also the narrator, is a statesman-like figure, Mowgli's father figure and the voice of sense. But the real winner is Murray's Baloo. A slacker who is not above a bit of lying if it can get the job done, Baloo is the story's comic relief. Their relationship with Mowgli gives the film its heart and Favreau lets it breathe. The fact that they get the film's best dialogues also helps.
The duo also gets to sing the classic Bare Necessities together and that itself justifies the price of the ticket. The shaggy ambling sloth bear is a perfect fit for Murray and Murray's lazy dialogue-delivery is a perfect fit for Baloo. All in all, a casting choice made in heaven.
Bill Murray plays the slacker Baloo who brings the much-needed comedic break. (Disney)
That brings us to Neel Sethi, our Mowgli and a difficult find if the director is to be believed. The Indian American boy has a natural screen presence and brings an infectious energy to the role. They do particularly well in the action scenes – running towards or away from danger. They do rush through their lines at places but then, the boy was basically acting opposite tennis balls.
Scarlett Johansson and Christopher Walken are stupendous in their roles and we would have loved to see more of them, especially Johansson's hypnotic Kaa.
So, how does it measure up to The Jungle Book versions we have seen till now – the Disney film made almost 50 years ago and the classic anime show on Doordarshan in the 90's? It matches up. The tone may be different and it may be edgier, but at heart The Jungle Book is still an adventure and a coming-of-age tale. Favreau gives us that sense of wonder, something we so desperately desire in these days of one franchise too many. The fact that they manage to do it in a story we all know so well is remarkable.
And if you are a kid who grew up in the 90's in India and are missing the ‘Chaddi pehen ke phool khila hai' track, Disney took care of that too with this new-age anthem...
However, a word of caution, do take your children but prepare them for some awe and shock. I hate to break it to you but Pahlaj Nihalani may be a teeny weeny bit right when they said that young children may get scared at some points during the film. The Jungle Book is no longer cute and cuddly but a tale of survival. This time, it really is a jungle out there. But I can guarantee one thing, once you and your children do enter it, you would not want to leave.

A decade after 9/11, Americans for the most part seem to have settled down and accepted the straightforward, monstrous reality of what happened. But the journey was a close call. Just a few years ago, many had nearly lost their grip. More than a third of the public embraced a cuckooland version of the terrorist attacks that suggested the onset of national psychosis.
At the height of the lunacy in 2006, 36 percent of respondents to a Scripps Howard/Ohio University poll said it was probable that the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon were an “inside job,” and that U.S. officials either assisted in the planning and execution or did nothing to stop them. A Zogby poll in 2007 found similar sentiment.
No doubt some Americans only flirted with this idea of an unprecedented scale of treachery in the upper reaches of government. But many embraced conspiracy with a scary gusto, as I found out when I wrote columns praising the 2006 book “Debunking 9/11 Myths: Why Conspiracy Theories Can't Stand Up to the Facts” by writers and researchers at Popular Mechanics.
The irate response equaled anything I've experienced in decades of journalism, and my e-mail box was clogged for days. Some readers patiently attempted to expose my ignorance of the intricacies of the grand conspiracy, but most denounced my transgression in the most extravagant terms. I was a coward, traitor, accessory to the crime, contributor to the cover-up, shill for the corporate media, fascist, patsy for Israel, and much more.
What accounted for this loss of mooring, this epidemic of delusion? To some extent, of course, it reflected dismay over the military fiasco in Iraq, the administration's false claims about weapons of mass destruction, and raw hatred for George W. Bush.
Even so, high-running passions are no excuse for believing in theories such as the controlled demolition of the Twin Towers and World Trade Center Building 7 that are highly improbable on their face. And political anger is no reason to discount the evidence of thousands of eyewitnesses, let alone the detailed explanations of a multitude of experts at venues such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
To the contrary, the widespread embrace of 9/11 conspiracies is a sorry reflection on the gullibility of the public and its willingness to believe just about anything if it serves a larger agenda. If our leaders are performing badly, it can't merely be because they're incompetent or misguided. They must be evil as well. They must be willing to slaughter thousands of their fellow citizens in a spectacularly complex operation in order to justify an imperial scheme for Afghanistan and Iraq (the spoils of Afghanistan being mysteriously irresistible, it seems).
In recent days, the online publication Slate has run the best series of articles I've seen on the origins, growth and partial decay of the 9/11 conspiracy movement. But as writer Jeremy Stahl explains, the movement still boasts teeth. When conspiracy activist Charlie Veitch renounced their beliefs earlier this year, for example, they were “immediately flooded with hate mail and death threats.”
Meanwhile, an Angus Reid Public Opinion survey has found 14 percent of respondents still consider the collapse of Twin Towers “the result of a controlled demolition,” while 16 percent agree that United Airlines Flight 93 was shot down.
Those percentages may not come close to what they would have been five years ago, but they're still a disgrace.

Subaru Telescope Detects Rare Form of Nitrogen in Comet ISON
A team of astronomers, led by researchers of Kyoto Sangyo University, successfully observed the Comet ISON during its bright outburst in the middle of November 2013. Subaru Telescope's High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) detected two forms of nitrogen--14NH 2 and 15NH 2 --in the comet. This is the first time that astronomers have reported a clear detection of the relatively rare isotope 15NH 2 in a single comet and also measured the relative abundance of two different forms of nitrogen (“nitrogen isotopic ratio”) of cometary ammonia (NH 3 ). Their results support the hypothesis that there were two distinct reservoirs of nitrogen the massive, dense cloud (“solar nebula”) from which our Solar System may have formed and evolved.

“My opponent is a liar. And, they can't be trusted.”
Did you ever wonder why there are so many political attack ads? Of course, politicians have the obvious desire to tear down the opposition in the hopes of building up their own position.
But there is another dynamic at work: candidates and campaigns are seeking to exploit the lesser-known psychological advantage that opposing the other candidate has over supporting one's own.
On candidates and issues alike, people can think of themselves as a supporter or as an opposer. If we assume the current front-runners become the presidential nominees, this is the difference between “I support Hillary Clinton” and “I oppose Donald Trump.” Both positions would likely result in the same voting intentions, but one is more likely to inspire action, such as participating in a demonstration, contributing funds or actually casting a ballot.
Our research into the question of how voters think of themselves has discovered that opposition inspires more confidence in one's position than support. Confidence helps to turn judgments into actions. This helps explain why political attack ads are a crucial tool in politicians' arsenals – and why voters are bombarded by negative messages on the way to the voting booths.
Perspective leads to confidence, and then to action
It is not that opposers are different kinds of people (negative Nellies or pessimists) than supporters (Pollyannas or optimists). Nor is it that opposers necessarily have different reasons behind their views than supporters. For example, those who oppose discrimination may not have had more personal experience with the issue than those who support equality, nor are they necessarily more emotional about the issue. Yet, being anti-discrimination is more confidence-inducing than being pro-equality.
Our research shows that if a person merely changes their view of their position, from saying they support something to saying they are against its opposite, their likelihood of behavior changes. The perspective shift increases the confidence they have in their position. Our research also shows that people are more likely to act on their attitudes when they are held with confidence. For example, if two people like a new car to the same extent, the person who is more sure of that feeling is more likely to buy the car.
As a test of this hypothesis in the context of a real election, we conducted a study during gubernatorial campaigns in two East Coast states. In preelection surveys, a representative sample of potential voters was randomly asked about support or opposition to either the Republican or the Democratic candidate.
Typically, when Democratic voters were asked about the Democratic candidate, they would reply that they “supported” him, but if they were asked about the Republican candidate, they would reply that they “opposed” him. The inverse situation was typical for Republican voters.
Our survey questions were designed to get voters to momentarily think about their position as either supporting their preferred candidate or opposing the disfavored candidate. This simple framing did not affect how much people liked their preferred candidate. But, it did influence how confident they were in that view and their intended behaviors. Voters who focused on how much they opposed the other candidate were generally more confident in their preference than voters who were asked about how much they supported their candidate.
Even more importantly, thinking about their opposition to the other candidate made voters report being more likely to engage in favorable behaviors toward their own candidate such as volunteering for him, advocating to others and going out to vote for him. That is, when we got voters to focus on the candidate they opposed, the voters appeared to have deeper conviction and reported a greater willingness to be politically active.
Our finding that being an opposer is more powerful than being a supporter fits with other psychological research showing that negative traits and information are typically weighed more heavily in judgments than positive traits and with the prospect theory notion that losses loom larger than gains.
Anger is stronger than fear
But what if you are competing in a primary rather than a general election? In that scenario, it's often more difficult to get voters of your party to actively oppose other candidates from the same party, though as this election cycle shows, it can happen! Is there a way to enhance the confidence voters have in your candidacy?
Our research indicates that the reasons people support you can influence their confidence and tendencies to act on your behalf. For example, if people support you because they are angry at the establishment, or government, or immigrants, this anger can fuel them to feel confident about supporting you.
Although both anger and fear can influence what particular positions people take on issues, anger is a confident action-oriented emotion, whereas fear is more passive and doubt-oriented. Voters who support a candidate because they are angry at something are more likely to be confident and take action than voters who are frightened.
According to one recent poll, six in 10 Nevada caucus-goers this year described themselves as angry. Voter anger may be one reason why turnout in many of the primaries so far has set records.
In sum, our recent research has demonstrated that knowing how much voters like particular candidates, though important, is not the whole story. It also matters how confident people are in their preferences, because confidence is what turns attitudes into action. Knowing whether candidate preferences are driven by support or opposition, and by anger or fear, can help more accurately determine who is likely to donate money, show up for caucuses and ultimately vote for the chosen candidate.

On Tuesday, Mark Helfrich wasn't overjoyed with Oregon's energy level to kick off two straight days of practice. They had to like the way they finished them Wednesday.
In the final two periods of practice before a day off Thursday, the Ducks' non-travel squad got another 10 minutes to shine while the veterans looked on. And they took full advantage, making for an entertaining, energetic 10 minutes that featured six possessions of big plays by the offense, a couple stops by the defense and pad-popping hits both ways.
The Ducks will be back in action Friday and Saturday, their final practices before they break for the holidays and then reconvene in San Antonio for the Alamo Bowl. Those practices, Helfrich told the team, will be structured like Tuesday and Wednesday during the season – typically full-pad workouts, the most physical preparation the Ducks undertake for an upcoming game.
Thus, practice will start to resemble a normal game week after today. In what may have been their last chance of the season to perform for coaches in the spotlight, the developmental squad guys delivered.
“It gives us time to work on the offense and have a little fun,” said running back J.J. Jones, the scout-team offensive player of the year. “Most of us are on scout-team and do the other team's offense. So it's a good time, to play in front of our teammates and have a little bit of fun.”
Jones helped turn Wednesday's developmental squad scrimmage period from routine to about the most entertaining portion of postseason practices so far. On the fourth of the period's six drives, they took a pass from Morgan Mahalak, turned upfield and was met at the sideline by safety Dylan Kane
An explosive collision ensued, with Jones getting the better of it; from that point on, the veterans on both sidelines were whooping it up on each play, and the intensity level ratcheted up noticeably. Already, those periods allow tackling rather than the typical “thud” tempo of practice, but they really cut it loose the last few minutes Wednesday.
“You kind of just go with the flow of the period,” Jones said. “Everybody started hitting a little bit more. Everybody was more aware of more collisions. That was just a reaction.”
On the next play, Gus Cumberlander got into the backfield to bring down a running back for a loss. Lane Roseberry followed with a rush to the second level, but the ball was punched out at the end of the run, and Fotu Leiato came up with it.
The offense was reset to begin another possession. On the second play, Leiato was in the middle of the action again, dragging down Jake Breeland at the end of a seven-yard reception and flinging them out of bounds. Again, the intensity ratcheted up.
“I've been trying to do my thing; it's fun,” Leiato said. “The whole team's mojo changed. If you're going hard everybody else's going to be motivated to do that too.”
The first drive was a win for the defense, thanks in part to a quarterback hurry by Paris Bostick and a tackle for loss by Rex Manu. The offense evened the score on the next possession, which started at the 30-yard line; Mahalak went 4-for-4 on the drive, including a 35-yard touchdown pass to Chris Tewhill.
Walk-on running back Langston Stuckey kept the momentum with the offense to begin the next drive, rushing five straight times for 38 yards. But the defense held just short of the red zone, with a Bostick sack contributing to the stop.
The next drive ended in Leiato's fumble recovery, and the defense kept the offense off the scoreboard on the final two possessions as well. In what might have been the last major chance for the scout-team guys to cut it loose this season, they went out with a bang.
Other highlights: The secondary really had a nice period of 1-on-1 pass drills. Reggie Daniels broke up a ball to Dwayne Stanford, and Ty Griffin ran with Jalen Brown to break up a pass in the end zone. Tyree Robinson intercepted a ball Bralon Addison tipped but couldn't secure, and Khalil Oliver and Malik Lovette also had pass breakups. It was an impressive display of the unit's man coverage skills. …
The 7-on-7 period perfectly encapsulated how back-and-forth practice is every day, but in the space of just a couple minutes. Rebounding from the 1-on-1 period, Vernon Adams Jr. and their receivers sliced and diced the coverage, with Adams completing a couple balls to Darren Carrington and another to Evan Baylis. But the next time the first group was up, the defense dominated. Chris Seisay broke up a ball to Stanford, Adams overthrew a receiver and Charles Nelson should have had an interception, though it was dropped, and Seisay laid out for a diving breakup of another ball to Stanford. If you only saw one of the series, you'd think one of the two groups dominated the day, but as always, there were moments when each group looked great and some where they didn't.
Other observations: Like Monday, the Ducks have only a morning team meeting scheduled for their off day Thursday. … Helfrich declared Roseberry the MVP of the developmental squad scrimmage periods. … In case you missed it, the program on Tuesday evening confirmed its signed financial-aid agreement with quarterback Dakota Prukop, a transfer from Montana State. On Wednesday, a similar agreement was announced with junior college linebacker A.J. Hotchkins. Hotchkins is a transfer from Riverside (Calif.) City College, the same program that developed redshirting outside linebacker Jonah Moi.

It's back! After not seeing much use since it closed back in 1998, the former upper level of the ImageWorks at the Imagination pavilion at Epcot returned to service earlier this week as the Disney Vacation Club Member Lounge. Let's take a look around, shall we?
There is a check-in desk and small waiting area downstairs in the new ImageWorks.
Some member merchandise on display downstairs.
You must be a DVC member with an active membership card to gain access, and you are allowed up to 4 guests.
Guests can take the stairs or elevator upstairs, just like when it used to be the ImageWorks.
New flooring, carpet and paint can be found throughout the lounge.
The welcome desk is where members can find help with anything they might need.
DVC cast members even walk around with snacks for guests.
Disney Infinity set up for guests to play.
There are Coke Freestyle machines, but also K-Cup coffee makers with k-cups available upon request.
Computers and a printer for members to use.
An area where kids (and kids at heart) can watch cartoons.
A lot of the old passageways to ImageWorks were simply sealed.
Charging stations available (you have to bring your own cords), along with iPads for guest use.
Even though it may not be for everyone, it is nice to see the space back in action.
What do you think?

Ron Paul isn't going to win the Republican nomination for president. But watch what a stir they and their passionate supporters create in August at the National Convention in Tampa.
The U.S. representative from Texas didn't go all-in on their White House run to throw in the towel at the convention door. No way.
They have chips on the table. They have a hand to play.
At the end of the day, Paul likely will realize one of the goals of their campaign -- they will have moved the Republican Party closer to their lifelong Libertarian principles of balancing the federal budget, scaling back government involvement in domestic affairs and drastically reducing the nations military presence in foreign countries.
Of course, the GOP isn't going to consent to all that. But Paul now has an estimated 200 constitutionality-minded delegates, a significant wedge of the party. Watch the party wheelers-and-dealers throw them a bone.
A couple of weeks ago Paul won Iowa. And it wasn't even close. Supporters of the Texas libertarian came away from the GOP primary with 23 of the Hawkeye States 28 national convention delegates.
Under Iowa's Republican rules, those delegates are unbound -- which means they can vote for the member of congress in Tampa if they please. Its a shining example of how Pauls strategy of getting their people organized at the grassroots level has paid off.
Paulite participation in primary and caucus processes has resulted in a libertarian takeover of several state and local GOP operations, for example the state parties in Alaska, Maine, and of course Iowa.
Paul has amassed an impressive number of delegates overall because of the GOP's uniquely binding delegate rules. That number is their ace in the hole. It's credibility for having their views, especially on control of the Federal Reserve and Internet freedom, heard by Romney and other top Republicans in Tampa for the convention.
Right now, anyway, Paul plain will not endorse the party's probable nominee, Mitt Romney. During a recent appearance on CNN, they said they want a strong presence at the campaign for their legions of supporters who are expected to show up in strong numbers.
Philosophically, Romney and Paul are miles apart. They have different views on how the Republican Party can win the general election, restore the vibrancy of the U.S. economy and reduce the national unemployment rate.
The Ron Paul campaign signed a contract Thursday to secure the University of South Floridas 11,000-seat Sun Dome for Sunday, Aug. 26, the day prior to the beginning of the three-day Republican National Convention.
In an email to their supporters released Friday, Paul wrote, "The Republican National Convention is just around the corner, and the establishment is about to find out what you and I have known all along this election season the future is ours! So on Aug. 26, the day before the convention convenes, I hope youll join me at a special rally to celebrate how far our message and movement have come this year.
The Republican National Committee actually gave the nod to the preconvention rally in which Paul themselves will be the main feature.
Wed really like a large turnout for this," Paul says in a video, again addressing their supporters. "Numbers are important ... We should not be disruptive but neither should we be pushed around."
Keep an eye on this rally -- an event some pundits have dubbed "Paulstock." It could be fascinating.
Look for the Paul forces to turn up a new bad guy, and it won't be Mitt Romney. Think Rick Santorum.
After months of hanging Romney from a meat hook, Santorum has done a 180 and endorsed the former governor of Massachusetts like a favorite uncle.
In the video to supporters mentioned above, Paul also claims that Santorum has vowed to rally conservatives to oppose some of their principal policies.
Obviously, Paul takes offense. They say this: It is true the Santorum people are principled. Theyre also authoritarians. They want to use the government to impose their will on us as individuals.
The demonizing of Santorum -- long gone from the race as they are -- may be a smart move to bring former Santorum conservatives to the Paul side. It could also help soften the bitter criticism of Paul's son, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., for jumping off their father's bandwagon and endorsing Romney.
Offering up Santorum as an opponent could give Ron Paul's supporters someone on whom to vent their ire -- so that Paul might still win a speaking slot at the convention and their son's future in the party will not be jeopardized.

The path for Democrats to win control of the House of Representatives is steep and complicated, but plausible, particularly if Donald Trump emerges as the GOP presidential nominee.
It's long been clear that either party could win the White House or the Senate this year. Republicans have a 54-seat majority in the Senate, but are defending six seats in states where Democrats are strong (Florida, Illinois, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.) Democrats are trying to win the presidency for the third straight time, which both parties have failed to do since George H.W. Bush succeeded Ronald Reagan in 1992.

But the House has long been assumed safe for the GOP, until polling showed the depths of Trump's current unpopularity with the general election electorate.  They are by some measures the most unpopular presidential candidate in modern times.
Republicans currently hold 246 of the House's 435 seats, compared to 188 for Democrats. In June, voters in Ohio will decide the replacement for former House Speaker John Boehner, who resigned last fall. The Republican candidate is heavily favored to win that special election, giving Republicans 247 seats.
Democrats will then need to gain 30 seats in this fall's elections to get a majority.
Such a radical shift in the makeup of the House is entirely possible in theory, since Democrats gained 30 seats in 2006, while the GOP won control of 63 in 2010.
In reality, Democrats winning the House is still highly unlikely this fall. If Trump becomes the Republicans' nominee, they are likely to gain support among GOP leaning-voters who have reservations about the real estate mogul right now but view Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders as too liberal.
RELATED: Can Republicans really deny the party front-runner
In addition, Democratic voters tend to be clustered into major cities, so their votes are in some ways wasted in House races, where liberal lawmakers often run up huge margins.Republicans, in control of most state legislatures, often pack a few districts in each state with Democratic voters, leaving the remaining districts with GOP majorities.
Because of the way House districts are drawn, Mitt Romney themselves finished ahead of Obama in 226 of the 435 House districts in 2012, according to a compilation from the Cook Political Report, even as the former Massachusetts governor lost by about 5 million votes nationwide. This was on Election Day in 2012, when young, minority, liberal-leaning voters who often don't cast ballots in midterms were out in full force.
Those dynamics mean that everything has to bounce the Democrats way for them to win the House.
Here's a closer look at that path:
1. Democrats need to win most of the 28 districts that backed Obama in 2012 but have a Republican member of Congress
The Democrats' simplest path to victory in the House is a strong turnout among the people who voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. If Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders wins an area, it is very likely that those same voters will back the Democratic congressional candidate.
Ticket-splitting dropped to its lowest rate in decades in 2012, when only 6 percent of districts backed one party for president but the other for the House.
view photo essay Political Theatre: The presidential campaign of Donald Trump “Make America Great Again.”
For example, Frank Guinta, a House Republican who represents the area around Manchester, New, Hampshire, won their seat in 2010, a strong year for Republicans, lost in 2012, then won again in 2014. They ran against the same opponent, Democrat Carol Shea-Porter, in all three races.
In this district, it seems clear that the national political conditions are affecting the race more than the individual candidates. Shea-Porter will be a favorite if Clinton or Sanders beat Trump or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in New Hampshire.
Twelve of these 28 House Republicans were elected in 2014. That means they don't have the advantages of long-term incumbency, to build up a huge following in their districts. If the Democratic presidential candidate wins their districts, they are likely to be defeated as well.
But some of these 28 GOP House members will be strong, no matter who the Republican nominee is. For example, Rep. Peter King has represented the Long Island area in New York since 1993. Obama won King's district over Romney by 4 percent in 2012, according to Daily Kos, which has compiled the presidential vote in each congressional district.
But King has a well-established brand as a moderate Republican. They regularly blast the Tea Party and has often slammed Trump in the last year.  They are not a dogmatic party loyalist.
RELATED: Can Trump still get to 1,237 delegates?
It is easy to imagine, if Trump is a bad candidate in the general election, King publicly suggesting that they will consider voting for Clinton, not Trump, particularly since King worked with Clinton when they were one of New York's senators.
Six of the 28 Republicans in districts that Obama won are in New York. (All but one of the six is outside of the New York City area.)
Running on a ticket with Trump may not actually be a killer for these New York Republicans. Upstate New York is a place where Trump is well-known and their appeal to blue-collar whites may be strongest. It's not clear Trump will be a worse candidate in upstate New York than Romney was in 2012.
In fact, those Republicans may be worse off if they are running on a ticket with Cruz, who mocked “New York values” last year.
The Democrats are very unlikely to win all 28 of these races, even if Trump is the nominee.
2. Democrats need to win seats in areas where the electorate is gradually moving left
Fewer people voted for Obama in 2012 than in 2008 (as a percentage of the electorate) in almost every area of the country. But the president won by a larger margin in 2012 in Miami-Dade County, likely because of both the growing Latino vote there and the shift of Latinos away from the Republican Party.
Particularly if Trump is the GOP nominee, Republican members of Congress from the Virginia suburbs outside of Washington, D.C., South Florida, Minnesota, and Nevada should be concerned. Early polling data suggests Trump is weakest among college-educated voters (Northern Virginia, Minnesota) and among Latinos (South Florida, Nevada).
Close video Trump campaign continues to make changes, grow Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson talks about the GOP frontrunner's tone heading into the New York primary and recent restructuring in the campaign. share tweet email save Embed
In these areas, general demographic and political trends are already moving to the Democrats' advantage. Trump could accelerate a change that was already likely to happen.
3. Democrats need to get lucky
Every year, some House incumbents lose for reasons that are not part of national trends. Some go down because of scandals. Others simply aren't as popular back home as polling and other data would indicate.
For example, Utah's Mia Love is the only black female Republican in the House and was invited to speak at the Republican National Convention in 2012. But they barely won their race in 2014 in a conservative district that includes parts of Salt Lake City and is a top target for congressional Democrats.
4. Democrats need a big victory at the top of the ticket
If Republicans don't win the White House, it's important the candidate not lose by too much, if the party wants to keep control of one or both houses of Congress.
In 2008, Obama won by 7 percent nationally, such a landslide that they were the first Democrat in decades to carry North Carolina and Indiana. In such an environment, Republican House and Senate candidates lost essentially every close race.
In 2012, Obama won, but by 4 percent. That more narrow advantage meant that many House and Senate Republicans were able to survive.
RELATED: Trump's new delegate strategy takes root in Pennsylvania
This scenario is what worries Republicans about Trump, more than Cruz. The Texas senator would be expected to run a campaign similar to Romney's 2012 operation, winning the overwhelming majority of conservative-leaning voters while struggling with Democrats, particularly people of color. If Cruz were unsuccessful, it would likely be more akin to Romney's narrow loss than John McCain's resounding defeat, which came at the end of a very unpopular George W. Bush presidency.
Trump is more of a wild card, with the potential to turn off conservative-leaning women and independents and generate a huge turnout of blacks and Latinos to vote against him.
An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll this week showed Hillary Clinton and Cruz effectively tied in a head-to-head match-up (Clinton was 46 percent, Cruz at 44 percent).
In that same survey, Clinton led Trump 50 to 39 percent in a hypothetical contest.

In colonial North America there were two currencies: coins of precious metal and wampum. I would have guessed that a more advanced society would have simpler and more efficient payment and exchange systems, but it doesn't seem to have worked that way. Let's look at a person who travels for business up and down the East Coast. They or they will need the following:
traditional U.S. cash, the only acceptable form of payment in many small businesses
a credit card, the only acceptable form of payment for many things, e.g., rental cars, airline food and entertainment
a cash-equivalent card for paying for subway rides on Boston's MBTA (they spent so much putting in the electronic fare machines that they had to raise the price of a ride from $1.25 to $2, but the new system cannot take a credit or debit card directly)
a cash-equivalent card for riding the New York City subway and buses
a smarter cash-equivalent card for riding the Washington, D.C. subway (charges a variable fare depending on distance and time of day)
various cash-equivalent cards that pay for parking meters in more advanced towns
an EZ-Pass for paying car tolls in the Northeast (this and other RFID-based toll collection systems are currently optional, as our business traveler could elect to wait in line and pay with cash, but proposals are on the table for making them mandatory (toll collectors can earn more than $150,000 per year, including the value of pension obligations, so there is some pressure to eliminate their jobs)
an E-PASS for paying car tolls in Orlando
probably a few more electronic toll payment systems for the states in between
Can anyone think of some more? Is this proliferation of currency hurting U.S. economic efficiency?
[The New York Times yesterday ran a story about running nearly $1 trillion in taxpayer money around in circles through AIG, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and GMAC. I wonder if we're doing the same thing on an individual basis, i.e., running our money around in circles through various cash-like payment schemes, each time losing about 5 percent.]
One thing I am realizing about going a long time without eating meat (15 years) followed by a relatively short time eating as a moderately enthusiastic meat eater (5 years and change) is that it doesn't always occur to you to include it in meals. In fact, I have apparently only made four dishes on the site this year that include meat, and two were briskets for big dinner parties. With a fridge bursting (literally; if you can find room for a jar of mayo in there, you'd be my hero) with spinach and scallions, radishes, real baby carrots, sugar snaps, shelling peas and tiny freshly-dug red potatoes rolling off the top, I can hardly imagine why I'd need to roast a chicken. But when I was going through my (very, very, very long) list of Recipes I Want To Try last week, these lamb chops jumped out at me, promising to at least temporarily break me out of my asparagus — hashed! ribboned! tossed with pasta for one! — rut.
There were three big sells on this recipe for me, the first being Anne Burrell: I love everything they cook. The second was that these chops are entirely in the kitchen and I had no idea you could make great lamb chops without a grill. Related, reason three is that, I only recently discovered that I like, nay, love lamb chops. Adore them. In fact, I think my enjoyment of lamb chops — versus dabbling in ribs or a vague appreciation of steak — is pretty much the only thing that makes me a “real” meat eater these days, which I define as liking the taste of something so much, you'd even enjoy it plainly, just salt and pepper on a grill. That's love, right? Fortunately, this recipe has a little fun with them, smearing them, once browned, with a olive-pistachio-lemon zest and garlic tapenade that you can whiz up in no time in a food processor. Chops are browned for two minutes on each side in a pan, slathered with the tapenade and baked for five minutes to utter lamb perfection — the whole dish can literally be pulled off in 30 minutes, leaving time for the important stuff, like sitting in the grass, and pondering how your thighs got so awesome. What, you don't do that too?

Two years ago: S'More Pie

Lamb Chops with Pistachio Tapenade
Barely tweaked from Anne Burrell
1/2 cup pistachios, shelled and toasted
1/2 cup pitted green (what I used) or Cerignola (what Burrell recommends) olives
2 tablespoons capers
1 clove garlic, smashed
1 tablespoon freshly chopped oregano leaves (nixed because mine had gone bad)
2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves
Extra-virgin olive oil
1 lemon, zested
1 (8-rib) rack of lamb or 6 lamb chops
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper*
To make the pistachio tapenade: In a food processor combine the pistachios, olives, capers, garlic, herbs and puree. While the machine is running, slowly drizzle in olive oil until the mixture becomes a paste. Add the zest and pulse 1 more time, drizzling in more oil if necessary. Reserve until ready to use.
If using a rack of ribs: Remove 2 rib bones from the 8 rib rack to make it a 6-rib rack. Counting from either end, remove the 2nd and 7th bones; this will create 6 even chops that are thicker than a normal lamb chop. Cut 6 even chops.
Cook your chops: Season your six lamb chops generously on either side with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Allow them to sit for 10 to 15 minutes before cooking.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Coat a large saute pan generously with olive oil and bring to medium-high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the lamb chops and cook for about 2 minutes on each side to brown. If the pan begins to smoke, lower the heat. The chops should be beautifully caramelized on both sides. Remove the chops to a sheet pan and schmear generously with the pistachio tapenade. Place in preheated oven and cook another 4 to 5 minutes for medium rare. Remove chops from oven and let rest for at least 5 minutes before serving.
* My addition. Does anyone know why not a single Anne Burrell recipe calls for black pepper, only salt? I would love to hear your theories!
Sniper kills 1, wounds 20 at military base
October 27, 1995
Web posted at: 11:45 p.m. EDT
FORT BRAGG, North Carolina (CNN) -- One soldier was killed and 20 others were hurt Friday when a sniper opened fire on an athletic field at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. The sniper allegedly fired on their unit as they prepared to start a morning run, a Fort Bragg spokesperson said.
Moments after the soldier opened fire from a wooded area, a group of unarmed Special Forces soldiers wrestled them to the ground. "We came under fire and we moved into the tree line because we realized we were the only ones who could do anything about it," said Staff Sgt. Anthony Minor.
Minor said that the gunman, who was firing at them, turned away. And as they did, they and Sgt. Edward Mongold tackled the man. "It was a fight for their life," Minor said. "It was a fight for our lives."
Minor, Mongold and several other soldiers disarmed the shooter and held them for the military police.
Army officials have identified the shooting suspect as 26- year-old Sgt. William J. Kreutzer, an infantry squad leader in the Second Brigade. Kreutzer's hometown is listed as Washington, D.C.
The dead soldier has been identified as 38-year-old Major Stephen Mark Badger, the intelligence officer for the Second Brigade. Their hometown was not available, but their place of birth was Salt Lake City, Utah.
Maj. Rivers Johnson said about 1,300 troops from the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the 82nd Airborne were gathered at Towle Stadium at 6:30 a.m. EDT, preparing to start a 4-mile run, when shots rang out from the woods nearby.
Authorities from the Army's Criminal Investigation Division said three weapons were found when the suspect was apprehended. They included a 9mm pistol, a .22-caliber rifle, and a AR-15 rifle, the civilian equivalent of the M-16 assault rifle. Johnson said soldiers at the fort do not ordinarily carry Army-issued weapons.
Johnson would not speculate on a motive for the shooting.
A soldier who was running nearby at the time of the incident said that they heard shots and that it appeared they were being fired at the staff of the 2nd Infantry Brigade.
A videotape shot by a soldier as the sniping incident began showed the troops scrambling for cover, many of them attempting to help the wounded reach safety.
Maj. Victor Modestor, chief of surgery at Womack Army Hospital at the fort, said four of the soldiers were taken into surgery. Two were in critical condition and the two others were stable.
A soldier who suffered paralysis when they were shot in the neck was transported to Duke Medical Center, where they were listed in stable condition. Another soldier suffered a gunshot wound to the chest and was in stable condition, Modesto said. Twelve other soldiers were listed in stable condition with gunshot wounds. Two other soldiers were treated for minor injuries.
The 2nd Brigade had just assumed mission status, said Johnson, meaning they would be the first brigade of the 82nd Airborne to go into action if a crisis occurred within the next three months.

A man who is a former National Party leader Don Brash says wielded a metre-long sword at them has been detained by health authorities, police say.
Dr Brash said they were out with local body political candidate David Rankin in west Auckland last night, when they were approached by an agitated man, who had a young boy with him.
Photo: ACT Party
A television crew was with Dr Brash and Mr Rankin at the time.
"I didn't quite understand what was going on, but eventually they got out of the car and with their young son, who would've been eight or 10 I guess, started waving this very large sword around," Dr Brash said.
"It was quite the most unusual experience I've ever seen."
The man was speaking "quite irrationally", Dr Brash said.
"It was hard to tell whether they were under the influence of something or whether they were literally mentally unstable."
Dr Brash did not call the police, they said.
"He didn't look like they were going to attack someone with the sword, they were just waving it around."
Mr Rankin gave a more dramatic account of the incident, saying in a press statement that the man "was ranting hysterically and threatening us with theirs sword".
"My main concern was for that young boy," Mr Rankin said.
"His father was a real threat to their safety."
Police said officers spotted the man's car in Kelston and followed it in a "low-speed pursuit".
"Police managed to get alongside the car and officers engaged the driver in conversation, appealing for them to stop and reminding them of the child in the car," Inspector Scott Webb said.
Officer eventually managed to block the car in an Avondale street.
"The 42 year-old driver was assessed and has been detained for treatment under the care of health authorities," Mr Webb said.
The child in the car was unharmed and police had been in contact with other government agencies to make sure they had ongoing care.
Mr Rankin had laid a complaint with TVNZ, whose camera crew left during the incident, they said.
One of their supporters had called police and given a detailed description of the man and their vehicle, Mr Rankin said.
Consider the egg. Simple, delicious, and incredibly easy to prepare.
And yet, if you peruse the nutritional listings of America's favorite fast food restaurants, quite a different picture of the egg emerges -- and it's anything but simple.
I took a look at the published ingredient lists for six fast food mainstays that sell breakfast: McDonald's, Burger King, Chik-fil-A, Subway, Dunkin' Donuts, and Hardee's. I wanted to know just one thing: what's in their eggs?
I found several interesting ingredients, and one big surprise (at least it was surprising to me). I fully expected that McDonald's or Burger King would take the prize for the most unrecognizable ingredients, but neither one stacks up to the egg manipulation of Subway. McDonald's still takes second prize, but as you'll see, it's the "Eat Fresh" folks whose list is easily the most baffling.
On the other end of the spectrum, Hardee's, Burger King and Dunkin' Donuts all come out looking decent with relatively short lists of ingredients. For the most part, they stick to nature's simple delight. Chik-fil-A sits in the middle of the pack with ordinary and dubious ingredients.
What's most intriguing is the comparison between lists. For example, Hardee's sells its customers eggs with only one preservative added, while Subway sells a concoction that includes eggs and "premium egg blend" containing at least ten preservatives and additives nowhere to be found on most of the other lists.
Let me stress that this information has been published by the companies and is there for all to see; just follow the links (you'll not find any secret formulas ahead). The ingredient explanations below the lists were added by me and not included in the published list.
1. Subway
Egg Omelet Patty (Regular): Whole eggs, egg whites, water, nonfat dry milk, premium egg blend (isolated pea product, salt, citric acid, dextrose, guar gum, xanthan gum, extractive of spice, propylene glycol and not more than 2% calcium silicate and glycerin to prevent caking), soybean oil, butter alternative (liquid and hydrogenated soybean oil, salt, soy lecithin, natural and artificial flavors, beta carotene (color), TBHQ and citric acid added to protect flavor, dimethylpolysiloxane (antifoaming agent added), salt, beta-carotene (color).
A few words on the ingredients:
Propylene glycol, a solvent for food colors and flavorings, is also used in anti-freeze, to lubricate air-conditioner compressors, and in deodorant sticks.
Isolated pea product is a protein additive often used as a substitute for animal-derived protein.
Guar gum is a thickening agent.
Xanthan Gum is used to prevent oil separation.
Glycerin is a solvent that is found in soap, moisturizers and some brands of shaving cream.
TBHQ (tertiary butylhydroquinone) is used to preserve vegetable oils against oxidation, and can also be found in varnishes, lacquers, and perfumes.
dImethylpolysiloxane is a type of silicone used to prevent cooking oil from foaming after repeated uses. It's also found in Silly Putty and many lubricants.
Calcium silicate is used to prevent caking and is also a popular antacid. In addition, it's a sealant used on roads, roofs and concrete.
2. McDonald's
Pasteurized whole eggs with sodium phosphate (preservative), citric acid and monosodium phosphate (added to preserve color), nisin preparation (preservative). Prepared with liquid margarine: Liquid soybean oil and hydrogenated cottonseed and soybean oils, water, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, salt, soy lecithin, mono-and diglycerides, sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate (preservatives), artificial flavor, citric acid, vitamin A palmitate, beta carotene (color).
A few words on the ingredients:
Mono and diglycerides are used to blend substances together that would otherwise not blend well (oil and water, for instance).
Potassium sorbate is a preservative that inhibits the growth of molds and yeasts. It's also used in personal care products as a replacement for the controversial chemical, paraben.
Cottonseed oil, when fully hydrogenated, is 94% saturated fat.
3. Chik-fil-A
Whole egg, citric acid, butter oil (soybean oil, palm kernel oil, soy lecithin, natural and artificial flavor, TBHQ and citric acid added as preservatives, and artificial color).
A few words on the ingredients:
Palm kernel oil is roughly 50% saturated fat.
TBHQ (tertiary butylhydroquinone) is explained in the Subway section above.
4. Dunkin' Donuts
Whole Eggs, whole milk, soy oil, water, modified foodstarch, salt, xanthan gum, white pepper, citric acid.
5. Burger King
Whole eggs, skim milk (water, nonfat dry milk) vegetable oil (soy and/or corn oil), salt, xanthan gum, natural egg flavor, natural butter flavor.
6. Hardee's

My childhood was reasonably disrupted – as an adult, I realise all my grown-ups were doing the best they could, but if we're honest they were very flawed individuals.
I was a very smart kid who, through living circumstances became socially isolated. My grown-ups really didn't know how to deal with that. I didn't like sport, because while I was really smart, I didn't really learn how to socialise. Other kids terrified me. Then there was the bullying – well you probably know how that goes. Eventually all of my grown-ups recognised something about me – if it didn't run on microchips, I probably wasn't interested. No one could hurt me while I was gaming and nothing else mattered.
Gaming became the thing I truly loved. It was my world – I could escape into my imagination and escape the nightmare that was dealing with other people. When I was 7, we had a second-hand Atari 2600, I don't know how it happened, but at some point my step-mother replaced it with an Atari 5200. They didn't like technology or games that much, but some of my happiest memories are of them are us playing Q-Bert and Pitfall together. My dad and I played Othello. Eventually we got ourselves a Commodore 64 and data cassette, and my mind was blown with games so awesome I don't remember what I played (except vague recollections of Street Rod, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). I remember we could never get Shard of Innovar to load, though.
When I was 10, I used my own savings to buy a Nintendo Entertainment System – I got the pack with Super Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt. My middle brother spent their savings on a Sega Master System, my youngest brother bought themselves a Super Nintendo – some of my happiest memories were playing Street Fighter with my brothers. I remember there was 386DX40 with SoundBlaster Pro and CD-ROM drive – I played Wolfenstein, Sim City, Doom, Sim City 2000, was fascinated by directory structures, amazed by multimedia in Colliers Encyclopedia, loved Where is the World is Carmen Sandiego? Wing Commander, and Privateer were my PC favourites.
Growing up we were pretty poor, and we'd hire video game consoles for the weekend from the video store – my brothers and I played Sega Saturn, Game Cube, and the Dreamcast of course, but my favourite was the ubiquitous PlayStation. I was so blown away by WipeOut that when I got my first full-time job I saved a fortune and bought myself my very own PlayStation.
Having left home and got a decent job, I flirted with the PC Master Race for a while – this was a break from reality that I eventually recovered and got myself a PS2. I went to uni later in life and found being broke very hard. A good friend bought me a PS3 and Assassin's Creed for my birthday one year, but my PS3 got used mostly for SingStar. When I resigned a mobile phone contract, the phone company gave me a Wii with my handset. I bought an Xbox 360 because I liked the look of Mass Effect. I got a Kinnect because I liked Just Dance. But, if I'm honest, while very fun, none of these really excited me.
After a while, gaming was just something I did from time to time. As my career grew, my gaming time seemed less of a priority. Partners and commuting, work stress and world travel all got in the way. One day I woke up at 37 wondering while my pile of shame was so high – I kept buying games in the hope that something would transport me the way those 8-bit dreams did back in the day. And, for all of their mastery, all of their technical sophistication, and genuine awesomeness – among the hundreds of games only Call of Duty 4 came close to the immersion of my childhood.
But through all this gaming history nothing, and I mean nothing has grabbed me the way PSVR has. When I read this morning that PSVR has sold 915,000 units as of the first week in February, I was thrilled. PSVR has transported me back to that sense of wonder I had as a child. 915,000 units in a little under 4 months – to put that in perspective, it's 50% more than Occulus Rift and HTC Vive combined. I haven't played either of these VR platforms, but I don't need to to know that they're good.
It's not that VR has brought back a childish sense of wonder in gaming that I missed – VR made me realise that all of that time and effort and I money I spent chasing that my childhood sense of immersion was wasted because it never really existed. I was fascinated with the universe of Privateer, not the act of playing Privateer. Gaming immersion would happen for me away from the computer – I'd be thinking about the game on the bus to school, or in bed before I fell asleep. The games never felt as good as my memories of them – or that I could escape to them like a good book.
The truth is that while gaming was always fun for me, it wasn't wonderful…
…Until I got my PSVR helmet that is.
SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea's latest test of a rocket engine showed that the country was making “meaningful progress” in trying to build more powerful rockets and missiles, South Korean officials said on Monday.
North Korea said on Sunday that it had conducted a ground jet test of a newly developed high-thrust missile engine, which its leader, Kim Jong-un, called “a great event of historic significance.” Using the characteristic bombast of such announcements, they said that the test heralded “a new birth” of the country's rocket industry and that “the whole world will soon witness what eventful significance the great victory won today carries.”
The North's rival, South Korea, acknowledged on Monday that the test represented a breakthrough. Lee Jin-woo, a spokesperson at the Defense Ministry, said it showed that the North was developing a more sophisticated rocket engine. The model that the North tested included a cluster consisting of a main engine and four vernier thrusters — smaller engines used to adjust the craft's velocity and stability.
“Through this test, it is found that engine function has made meaningful progress,” Mr. Lee said during a news briefing, without divulging further details.
Gregg shorthand is a form of shorthand that was invented by John Robert Gregg in 1888. Like cursive longhand, it is completely based on elliptical figures and lines that bisect them.[1] Gregg shorthand is the most popular form of pen stenography in the United States; its Spanish adaptation is fairly popular in Latin America. With the invention of dictation machines, shorthand machines, and the practice of executives writing their own letters on their personal computers, the use of shorthand has gradually declined in the business and reporting world. However, Gregg shorthand is still in use today.
There is a reasonable possibility that John Robert Gregg structured their shorthand on the Mnemonic major system based on the previous work of Pierre Hérigone and others following the publication of The Anti-Absurd or Phrenotypic English Pronouncing and Orthographical Dictionary by Major Beniowski in 1845.[2][3][4]
Several versions of this system were published. Pre-Anniversary includes the first five editions, the first one published in two small paper-covered pamphlets in 1888, the second published in 1893,[5] the third in book form in 1897, the fourth in 1902,[6] and the fifth in 1916.[7] Anniversary, a revised and simplified form published in 1929, was so called because it was to be published on the fortieth anniversary of the system (1928), but there was some delay in publication.[8] In 1949, Simplified was created, in which many of the principles and memorized forms were removed or simplified due to findings of studies by the publishers and suggestions of many shorthand teachers.[9] Diamond Jubilee was published in 1963, which simplified the Simplified version.[10] Series 90 was published in 1978, which simplified it further.[11] The last version was Centennial, published in 1988, with several similarities to the Diamond Jubilee system earlier.[12] Besides these main editions, which were designed for the dictation speeds expected of any shorthand system of the time, a number of simpler, personal-use editions were published from 1924 to 1968. These included "Greghand" in 1935, and "Notehand" in 1960 and 1968.[13]
Gregg is often contrasted to Pitman shorthand, as the two share significant predominance over other English shorthand systems.[14] Pitman uses line thickness and position to discriminate between two similar sounds,[15] but Gregg shorthand uses the same thickness throughout and discriminates between similar sounds by the length of the stroke.[16] John Robert Gregg was originally a teacher of a Duployan shorthand adaptation to English (Duployan shorthand was the dominant system in France, and also featured uniform thickness and attached vowels).[17] However, they found the angular outlines of Duployan-based systems to be detrimental to speed.[18] Gregg shorthand features cursive strokes which can be naturally blended without obtuse angles.[18] In addition, because the symbols of Gregg shorthand are developed specially for English rather than adapted from a French system, they are a better fit for the language (for example, Gregg has a symbol for th whereas the Duployan systems would use a dotted t, which takes longer to write).[19]
Writing [ edit ]
Gregg shorthand is a system of phonography, or a phonetic writing system, which means it records the sounds of the speaker, not the English spelling.[16] It uses the f stroke for the sound in funnel, telephone, and laugh.[20] All silent letters are omitted.[16] The image on the right shows the strokes of Gregg Shorthand Simplified. The system is written from left to right and the letters are joined. Sh (= ) (and zh = ), Ch (= ), and J (or Dzh, = ) are written downward,[20] while t and d are written upward.[16] X is expressed by putting a slight backward slant on the s symbol, though a word beginning ex is just written as if spelt es (and, according to Pre-Anniversary, ox is written as if os).[21] W when in the middle of a word, is notated with a short dash under the next vowel.[22] Therefore, the digraph qu (= ) is usually written as k with a dash underneath the next vowel.[22] In Anniversary and before, if z need be distinguished from s, a small tick drawn at a right angle from the s may be written to make this distinction.[23]
Sample of text from "A Christmas Carol", published in Gregg shorthand, 1918.
Many of the letters shown are also brief forms, or standard abbreviations for the most common words for increased speed in writing.[24] For instance, instead of writing kan for "can", the Gregg stenographer just writes k.[16] These brief forms are shown on the adjacent image. There are several others not shown, however. For instance, "please" is written in Simplified and back as simply pl,[25] and "govern" as gv.[26]
Phrasing is another mechanism for increasing the speed of shorthand writing. Based on the notion that lifting the pen between words would have a heavy speed cost, phrasing is the combination of several smaller distinct forms into one outline.[27] For example, "it may be that the" can be written in one outline, "(tm)ab(th)a(th)".[28] "I have not been able" would be written, "avnba" (note that to the eye of the reader this phrase written in shorthand looks like "I-have-not-been-able", and so phrasing is far more legible than a longhand explanation of the principle may lead one to believe).
The vowels in Gregg shorthand are divided into groups that very rarely require further notation. The is a large circle, and can stand for the a in "apple" , "father" , and "ache" .[29] The e is a small circle, and can stand for the e in feed and help , the i in trim and marine , and the vowel in them and learn .[29] The ī represents the i in fine .[30] The o is a small hook that represents the al in talk , the o in jot , cone , and order .[31] The u is a tiny hook that expresses the three vowel sounds heard in the words who , up , and foot .[32] It also expresses a w at the beginning of a word.[33] In "Anniversary," short and long vowel sounds for e, a, o and u may be distinguished by a mark under the vowel, a dot for short and a small downward tick for long sounds.[34]
There are special vowel markings for certain diphthongs.[30] The ow in how is just an circle followed by a u hook. The io in lion , or any diphthong involving a long i and a vowel, is written with a small circle inside a large circle.[35] The ia in piano and repudiate is notated as a large circle with a dot in its center.[35] In Anniversary and back, if ea need be distinguished from ia, it is notated with a small downward tick inside the circle instead of the dot.[35] The u in united is notated with a small circle followed by an u hook above it.[30]
Due to the very simple alphabet, Gregg shorthand is very fast in writing; however, it takes a great deal of practice to master it. Speeds of 280 WPM (where a word is 1.4 syllables) have been reached with this system before, and those notes are still legible to others who know the system.[36]
Some left-handed shorthand writers have found it more comfortable to write Gregg shorthand from right to left.[37] This "mirror writing" was practiced by a few people throughout the life of Gregg shorthand. However, left-handed writers can still write Gregg shorthand from left to right with considerable ease.
Versions [ edit ]
Throughout its history, different forms of Gregg shorthand have been published. All the versions use the same alphabet and basic principles, but they differ in degrees of abbreviation and, as a result, speed. The 1916 version is generally the fastest and most abbreviated version. Series 90 Gregg has the smallest degree of abbreviation, but it is also generally the slowest standard version of Gregg. Though each version differs in its level of abbreviation, most versions have expert and reporting versions for writers who desire more shortcuts.
Pre-Anniversary Gregg shorthand [ edit ]
Gregg Shorthand was first published in 1888 by John Robert Gregg; however, it was in a very primal stage, and therefore did not gain much success. Five years later, a much better version was published. This version was published in a second edition in 1893, then in a third edition titled "Gregg Shorthand" in 1897. The fourth edition, published in 1902, developed more shortcuts. The fifth edition, published in 1916, is the version most commonly referred to as "Pre-Anniversary" Gregg shorthand; this version has the largest number of brief forms, phrases, and shortcuts.
Gregg Shorthand Anniversary Edition [ edit ]
In 1929 another version of Gregg shorthand was published. This system reduced the memory load on its learners by decreasing the number of brief forms and removing uncommon prefixes. It was intended to have been published in 1928 on the fortieth anniversary of the system, but it was published a year afterward due to a delay in its production.
Gregg Shorthand Simplified [ edit ]
Gregg Shorthand Simplified was published in 1949. This system drastically reduced the number of brief forms that needed to be memorized to only 181. Even with this reduction in the number of brief forms, one could still reach speeds upward of 150 WPM. The system was simplified in order to directly address the need of business stenographers, who only needed to produce 100–120 WPM transcription. The creator of an advanced reporting version of Gregg Shorthand, Charles Lee Swem, wrote in The National Shorthand Reporter, "An abbreviated, simplified edition of our system has been published and accepted for the purpose of training office stenographers, and not necessarily reporters." They also advised, "I do not believe any young student should hesitate to study Simplified for fear it will jeopardize their chances of becoming a reporter. It is fundamentally the same system as we reporters learned from the Anniversary edition. Once Simplified is learned, the change-over to the reporting style is comparatively simple and can be made by any writer."[38]
Gregg Shorthand Diamond Jubilee Edition [ edit ]
The Diamond Jubilee series was published through most of the sixties and the seventies (1963–1977). It was simpler than the Simplified version, and reduced the number of brief forms to 129. For Diamond Jubilee students who wanted to increase speed for reporting, an edition of "Expert" Diamond Jubilee was available to push speeds upward.
Gregg Shorthand Series 90 [ edit ]
Series 90 (1978–1987) was an even simpler version, which used a minimal number of brief forms and placed a great emphasis on clear transcription, rather than reporting speed. Although it introduced a couple of new abbreviations and reintroduced some short forms that were missing in Diamond Jubilee, it eliminated several other short forms, and was in the main simpler, longer, and slower than the previous editions. Shorthand was dwindling in popularity during this series' usage.
Gregg Shorthand Centennial Edition [ edit ]
Published in 1988, this is the most recent series of Gregg shorthand. It was the only version since the Pre-anniversary edition of 1916 to increase the complexity of the system from the previous one, having 132 brief forms.
Other versions [ edit ]
The above versions of Gregg shorthand were marketed for professional use, such as business and court reporting. Gregg Shorthand Junior Manual, designed for junior high school students, was published in 1927 and 1929. Greghand, A Simple Phonetic Writing for Everyday Use by Everyone was published as a pamphlet in 1935. The 1960 and 1968 editions of Gregg Notehand focused on how to take effective classroom and personal notes using a simple form of Gregg shorthand.
Adaptations [ edit ]
Gregg shorthand has been adapted to several languages, including Afrikaans, Esperanto,[39] French,[40] German,[41] Hebrew[citation needed], Irish, Italian, Japanese, Polish,[42] Portuguese,[43] Russian, Spanish,[44] Catalan, Thai, and Tagalog. With a few customizations, it can be adapted to nearly any language. The Spanish version, designed by Eduardo Vega, is the most popular adaptation.
The Mandarin Chinese version slightly modified the original system, under the name 'Beifang Suji (Northern Shorthand)'.

Pope Francis' comments that the Catholic Church should not focus so much on homosexuality, abortion and contraception have met with strong approval from U.S. Catholics, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Friday.
Sixty-eight percent of American Catholics agree with comments the Pope made to that effect in an interview published last month in the Jesuit magazine Civilta Cattolica, while 23 percent disagreed, according to the poll.
There was little difference in opinion between observant and less-observant Catholics, women and men, and among age groups, the poll found.
American Catholics also like their new pope, with 89 percent having a "favorable" or "very favorable" opinion, and only 4 percent voicing an unfavorable opinion, the poll found.
"Maybe they were just waiting for a Jesuit," said Maurice Carroll, director of the Hamden, Connecticut-based Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. Francis is the first pope from the religious order of the Jesuits, an order known for its intellectuals and iconoclasts.
In the interview, Francis reaffirmed traditional church teachings, but said the church must "find a new balance" or risk seeing its entire moral edifice collapse "like a house of cards."
The poll also found that 60 percent of American Catholics support women's ordination - though the Pope had recently reaffirmed the ban on women's ordination. Support is highest among those who attend services less frequently and Catholics over the age of 65.
The survey also found that Catholic opinion on abortion is similar to the opinion of all American adults - with 52 percent of Catholics saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases, compared with 53 percent of the general public.
The poll surveyed 1,776 American adults, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 percentage points, and 392 Catholics with a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.

In a report by Axios this morning, citing White House sources, President Trump is reportedly considering a "huge reboot" of their core staff and cabinet members that could lead to the termination of everyone from Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon, to counsel Don McGahn and press secretary Sean Spicer: "He's frustrated, and angry at everyone."
According to Axios, the conversations intensified this week as the fallout from the Comey firing "pushed the White House from chaos into crisis" and notes that Trump's friends are telling them that many of their top aides don't know how to work with him, pointing out that "his approval ratings aren't rising, but the leaks are." As a result the advice he's getting is to "go big — that they have nothing to lose," the confidant said. "The question now is how big and how bold. I'm not sure they know the answer to that yet."
Additionally, Trump reportedly feels they have been "ill-served" by several of their Cabinet officials.
Trump has two complaints about Cabinet members: Either they're tooting their own horns too much, or they're insufficiently effusive in praising them as a brilliant diplomat, etc. Among the cross-currents:
Under threat are some of their key economic and domestic policy advisors, including:
Wilbur Ross took what was perceived as a victory lap on a China trade announcement that does little new in actuality.
took what was perceived as a victory lap on a China trade announcement that does little new in actuality. Attorney General Jeff Sessions made a big announcement about increasing prison sentences, at the same time that Jared is working on criminal-justice reform.
made a big announcement about increasing prison sentences, at the same time that Jared is working on criminal-justice reform. HHS Secretary Tom Price shares the blame for the glacial pace of health-care legislation.
Axios notes three caveats:
i) no Cabinet member is expected to " go this soon" , even though a West Wing shuffle looks likely. "One obstacle to recruiting new top aides is finding people who would have real clout with a president not prone to enforced order";
, even though a West Wing shuffle looks likely. "One obstacle to recruiting new top aides is finding people who would have real clout with a president not prone to enforced order"; ii) it could be just Trump venting: "Trump often talks about firing people when things go south and does not follow through on it. So it's possible these conversations are their way of venting, and seeking reassurance"
iii) any internal moves could take a while: "Trump heads out on their first international trip at the end of the week. Also, there's an internal argument for minimizing drama by cutting people out of the information flow rather than firing them."
In all, it appears that virtually everyone is in danger of losing their jobs, except for the core cadre of ex-Goldman advisors who have now effectively taken over Trump's "circle of trust." One other official winning Trump's approval is SecState Rex Tillerson, who will be on "Meet The Press" this morning defending their boss.
While a major cabinet shakeup is possible, another major problem emerges, however: if Trump does purge Priebus and Bannon, gutting the core of their inner circle, what would be left is "a straight line of mid-30s family members with scant governing experience: Jared and Ivanka. So while the fighting and leaking might ease, the problems may not because it's the president, not the staff, calling the shots."
In other words, Trump may unleash a firing spree, and shift the blame for the fallout from last week's turbulent events to their top advisors, but once the internal purge is complete, it will be only Trump - and their immedite family members - left to take the blame... and there are still 3 years and 8 months left.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Uli Hoeness is expected to make an appeal, as Stephen Evans reports
A German court has sentenced Uli Hoeness, president of European football champions Bayern Munich, to three years and six months in jail for tax evasion.
They admitted defrauding German tax authorities of millions of euros.
The former World Cup-winning Germany striker, 62, had kept the funds in a secret Swiss bank account.
Their lawyer had argued they should escape punishment because they gave themselves up. But judges ruled their confession fell short of full disclosure.
Hoeness was initially charged with evading 3.5m euros (£2.9m; $4.9m) in taxes but they then admitted to dodging another 15m euros.
Everybody wanted to be seen with Uli Hoeness. On the day they took the call from a well-wisher tipping them off that they were being investigated for tax fraud, they were having lunch with Angela Merkel. That's how well connected they are. Football magnate's fall from grace
It finally emerged in court that they owed a total of 27.2m euros.
'Not valid'
On Thursday the court in the southern city of Munich found Hoeness guilty of "seven serious counts of tax evasion".
"The voluntary disclosure is not valid with the documents that were presented alone," the judge said.
The defence said it would appeal against the sentence. Meanwhile Hoeness will remain free until a final verdict has been handed out.
Prosecutors had called for a term of five years and six months.
Bayern Munich fans were gathered outside the court building, holding up banners expressing support for the football boss.

The BBC's Stephen Evans in Berlin says the sentence is significant because it indicates that attitudes towards tax evasion have changed in Germany since the financial crisis.
A string of famous people, perhaps not normally associated with cheating on tax, have recently been revealed to have had secret bank accounts, our correspondent reports.
But Hoeness could be the first to go to prison, they add.
The football legend, who helped Germany win the 1972 European Championship and then the World Cup two years later, came clean about their secret bank account last year, filing an amended tax return in the hope of an amnesty in return for paying the tax they owed.
But prosecutors said they did so because investigators were already pursuing their case.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption On Tuesday, Hoeness was celebrating their club's win against Arsenal in the Champions League
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Chancellor Angel Merkel was on good terms with the ex-footballer before the scandal emerged
Earlier this week, they told the court they deeply regretted their "wrongdoing".
"I will do everything necessary to ensure that this depressing chapter for me is closed," they said.
The case has been described as one of the most spectacular of the year by the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
Despite the tax evasion scandal, Mr Hoeness remains a very popular figure at the club they helped build up.
They offered their resignation at last year's annual meeting but was backed by the supporters and the club's board.
Rocket launches bracketed Arizona on Thursday, with an intelligence satellite heading into space from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in midafternoon and a Patriot missile test taking place in the morning in New Mexico.
Caught it on camera? Submit your photos here | Missile contrail
Evidence of the afternoon launch from Vandenberg, near Lompoc, Calif., northwest of Santa Barbara, could not be seen from the Valley.
The early-morning launch captured the eyes and imaginations of residents throughout the southwestern United States, including Arizona.
The morning sun refracted light from the contrail of the target missile, which was shaken by wind, creating a light show across the sky between 5 and 6 a.m. Thursday morning, according to Monte Marlin, a spokesperson for the White Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico.
The target, a 40-foot-tall Juno Tactical Ballistic Missile, was launched from Fort Wingate, an Army depot south of Interstate 40 near Gallup, N.M., and directed toward the missile range.
The booster rocket separated over Cibola National Forest. At White Sands, a Patriot missile was launched to intercept it.
Dan O'Boyle, spokesperson for the Army's Aviation and Missile Command at Redstone Arsenal, Ala., said the test was successful.
Officials were testing the PAC-3 system, or Patriot Advanced Capability, the latest modification to the missile system.
Since the mid-1990s, White Sands has conducted 14 tests involving large targets launched from Fort Wingate, Marlin said.
On Thursday afternoon, an Atlas V rocket carrying a National Reconnaissance Office payload was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, according to Jennifer Green-Lanchoney, a spokesperson for the base. The launch took place at 2:39 p.m.
The NRO is in charge of America's intelligence satellites.
Occasionally, contrails from Vandenberg launches can be seen from as far away as Arizona when launches take place in the late afternoon.

Honeymooners have been touched by the generosity of a mystery well-wisher who spotted "just married" written on their car while parked at a Skye beauty spot.
Jed and Charlotte Case, from Edinburgh, were visiting the Fairy Pools in Glen Brittle earlier this week.
When they returned from their walk they found a note on their car.
Inside was a £10 note and the message: "Here's to a (small) round of drinks, a good time in Skye and a great life together."
A guest at the couple's wedding in Blair Atholl, Perthshire, had written "just married" on the rear bumper of their Fiat in marker pen.
'Parking ticket'
The newlyweds later headed to Skye for their honeymoon, with the Fairy Pools being among the sites on the island they visited.
Image copyright Jed and Charlotte Case Image caption A wedding guest left the message on the couple's car
Mr Case said: "We went for a walk and came back to the car where Charlotte noticed something on the windscreen.
"Amazingly, some very kind fairies had noticed our 'just married' sign and left the hand written note with money inside, underneath our windscreen wiper.
"I was blown away to be honest, at first I thought it was a parking ticket.

"I looked around the car park but couldn't see anyone to thank.
"We got back in the car and went for drink in the Old Inn in Carbost."

They added: "It was incredibly kind and it is a moment that we will never forget.
"We'll always be able to tell the honeymoon story of the fairies who gave us the most unforgettable wedding present.
"If the fairies see this, thank you so much."
Australia's Test tour of India earlier this year may have given Bangladesh a plan against Steven Smith, a possible chink that may have evaded the other attacks they have conquered. In the final Test of that tour, in Dharamsala, India offspinner R Ashwin bowled around the wicket to Smith extensively, and drew an edge to slip from that angle. In the first two Tests of that series, they had bowled only three balls from that angle.
In the first Test in Mirpur, offspinner Mehidy Hasan seemed to have carried on from where Ashwin left. Their bowling from around the wicket, to some extent, curtailed Smith's free-flowing batting against spin, although in Chittagong, more accurate lines and lengths could make a significant difference. In 2016 Sri Lanka offspinner Dilruwan Perera had managed to curb Smith's strokeplay with an around-the-wicket line, dismissing them once in 41 deliveries bowled from that angle. Smith, who has three hundreds in India across two tours, now has a couple underwhelming innings - 8, 37 in Mirpur - and a new challenge to overcome.
This is a relatively new angle for offspinners against Smith, and one that bowlers like Graeme Swann, Moeen Ali and Mark Craig did not try extensively over the past seven years. Swann, Moeen and Craig had little success bowling around the wicket to Smith and even Ashwin, from whom Bangladesh have taken their cue, wasn't successful in the 2013 series: they bowled 62 out of 93 balls to Smith from around the wicket, but their only dismissal came from over the wicket.
In the first innings in Mirpur, Mehidy bowled one ball to Smith over the wicket before switching their angle. Three balls later, they had Smith bowled. In the second innings, Mehidy began from around the wicket to Smith and nearly had the Australia captain stumped first ball. They bowled from the same angle for another 30 deliveries during Australia's unsuccessful attempt at chasing 265.
In the first innings, Smith began by charging at Mehidy when they came from around the wicket, but was bowled by a delivery that would have turned to yorker-length after the batsman stepped out too soon. It dipped on them late, and they were left with no room to drive it down the ground, let alone loft it over wide mid-on, which seemed to be the original intention.
After the first-innings dismissal, Mehidy said that the Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim had told them on the eve of the Test about this new line of attack.
"We had a specific plan for Smith," they said after the second day's play. "Mushfiq bhai told me that if you can bowl around the wicket, they can be in trouble. They don't use their feet too well.  They are someone who likes to come down the wicket and, if the ball turns, there is a possibility of a stumping or a catch. I just tried to follow their instruction and bowled around the wicket. It worked."
Mehidy's accuracy, coupled with their subtle variation of pace and turn, made them a dangerous proposition for England last year and now for Australia. While successive Bangladesh captains, including Mushfiqur, have been eager to use offspinners against left-handed batsmen predominantly, Mehidy was given a long run when Smith was at the crease on the third evening and fourth morning. And that also highlighted a challenge for the young bowler.
In the second innings, Mehidy's first ball to Smith was an offbreak that drifted away in the air, drawing the batsman out and catching them slightly overbalanced. Mushfiqur whipped off the bails, but replays showed that Smith had a bit of their boot inside the crease. In Mehidy's seventh over, Smith flicked one right at the short-leg fielder's body but a chance wasn't held.
Apart from these two close calls, however, Mehidy struggled with their length from around the wicket to Smith for the rest of the innings. They bowled 13 short deliveries and offered plenty of full balls too, allowing Smith to read them easily. If the new angle has the potential to test Smith, it is also a challenge for Mehidy to maintain their consistency when the margin of error is smaller: anything straight can be whipped through the leg side and a bit of room can be crashed through the covers.
After Mehidy spoke about the new angle at the press conference, there was some unease in the Bangladesh camp, as they felt they may have given out too much. Mushfiqur did not comment on it during the post-match press conference, while Sunil Joshi, the spin coach, refused to speak about it, too. Not that Smith would have needed Mehidy to tell them that the around-the-wicket angle was a problem: they were bowled the third ball they faced from this angle, and nearly stumped first ball the next time they came to the crease. The next match, which begins from September 4, in Chittagong will test both Mehidy and Smith.
One started as a pulp hero and has expanded into every imaginable medium in the century since, while the other is best known as a classic film series with its roots in a French sci-fi novel, and now they're meeting in the pages of a comic book like no other.
Tarzan on the Planet of the Apes is the wildest crossover of the fall, taking Edgar Rice Burroughs' legendary ape-man and dropping them into the simian setting of the beloved Planet of the Apes franchise. Tarzan will be the adopted brother of the infamous chimp Caesar, who is set on averting the future of their world that they know is coming.
Not only is the project bringing together fan-favorite franchises, it's also pairing up two powerhouse publishers—Dark Horse Comics and BOOM! Studios—and uniting an amazing creative team. Co-written by Tim Seeley—the mastermind behind Revival at Image and DC Rebirth's Nightwing—and Power Man and Iron Fist and upcoming Occupy Avengers writer David Walker, with art by Fernando Dagnino (Resurrection Man), this is one comic that should be on everyone's pull list.
I had the chance to talk to Walker at Portland's Rose City Comic Con this past weekend to find out about how they came to be involved with the project, their love for Planet of the Apes, the challenges of writing Tarzan, and why the two worlds are worth mixing. Read on to learn all you need to know about one of the most unique comic book projects of the year and enjoy an early look at some of Fernando Dagnino's jaw-dropping interior art from the first issue, due out on Sept. 28.

Can you tell me a bit about how you got brought on board for Tarzan on the Planet of the Apes?
Sure! Tarzan on the Planet of the Apes actually started with Tim Seeley. They were the first writer on it, and they were familiar with the Burroughs stuff, the Tarzan stuff, but Planet of the Apes was very peripheral for him. But Scott Allie—who is the editor on the book—we've known each other for years, and Scott knows that I am probably the biggest Planet of the Apes fan in the world. Like, some people have Star Wars, some have Star Trek, there's those browncoats that are total Serenity fans, but me? It's Planet of the Apes. So Scott reached out and said, “Hey, we're doing Tarzan on the Planet of the Apes, would you be interested?” And I was like, “yeah!”
Part of it was simply because I never knew if I'd have the opportunity to write a Planet of the Apes story again. I'd never had that opportunity, so I wanted to. And the other part was there were some challenges involved with Tarzan, who over the years has become a character that's been couched in this sort of problematic tropes and clichés surrounding race and colonialism … and I was like, well, there will be a challenge in trying to see how we work around that too. So that was how the thing came together.
Scott and Tim had come up with a partial outline that was really, really loose, and then I came on board and Tim and I started bouncing ideas around. One idea built on what they and Scott had come up with, and another one went in a completely different direction, and then we found a good, comfortable middle ground where we wanted to go.

Since you're such a big fan, do you have a favorite Planet of the Apes movie?
Aside from the original '68 movies, it is Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, which is the best of the sequels because it's the only sequel that stands out on its own as a movie. All the other sequels you kind of have to watch all the other movies to know what's going on, but Conquest of the Planet of the Apes you can watch having seen none of the other movies. It's a great sci-fi movie. It's a great sort of political exploitation movie. And it's a great seventies movie. The seventies have this odd vibe, this bleak nihilism, that was in all of the Apes movies, but in this one—it's funny—this is the one where they tried to give it a happy ending. And it's like, there's nothing happy about the ending. So yeah, it's cool. It's was really cool.

You mentioned the problematic tropes of Tarzan. Does this setting help to alleviate some of the “great white savior” type problems with the character?
It does. The first two to two-and-a-half issues—it's a five issue series total—the first two issues, two-and-a-half issues it's a mash-up between the Planet of the Apes world and the Tarzan world. But by the time we go into issues three, four and five, we're firmly in the Planet of the Apes world. The Tarzan world, we've kind of left it behind, the Burroughs world. So that was one part of it.
But then the other part was, we're taking two franchises with—I mean the Tarzan franchise especially—with so much history and so much baggage, from the books to the television shows to the movies to the comic books, to the animated series, and all of it. There's so much involved with Tarzan, and we had to strip out all of that and get to the bare essence of whom this character is. And if you look at the first book, the first Burroughs pulp book, Tarzan is a guy raised by apes. And it's about a man who doesn't really know he's a man, he's a man who thinks he's a gorilla warrior, and is trying to be the best gorilla warrior they can be. And I was like, that's this character. Let's just sort of play with that. We don't need Jane, we don't need Tarzan versus the Lion Men or any of that sort of stuff. And the interesting thing too is that the character in the movies is incredibly different than the character as they appeared in the Burroughs books. So there's all these iterations of Tarzan that are all very, very different.
And it's just kind of interesting in that the vast majority of movies have always played them as an American guy. They were played primarily by athletes—American Athletes—like Jock Mahoney and Gordon Scott and guys like that.
So again, we got to the bare essence of who we thought Tarzan is, or part of that bare essence, and we moved forward with that.

When I came by your booth yesterday you were talking about labels and the sort of illusion of normalcy. Is that something that resonates with these two franchises for you?
Well, yeah. It's normalcy but it's also ideological constructs. Like, Tarzan is a guy—again we go back to Tarzan is a guy who believes they are a gorilla warrior. Even though at some point they learn he's human, he's still a gorilla warrior. It's what they were raised to be.
Whereas the character of Caesar is an ape who was raised by parents from the future, who know the fate of the planet Earth. And so he's burdened with this knowledge of, three thousand years from now, we're going to destroy the world. What can I do to change that now? Because the Planet of the Apes franchise is a time loop. It's a circle, a loop in time that keeps repeating itself over and over again. So we were playing with that. We were playing with the fact that Caesar is this leader who wants to lead the world—not just simians, but humans—to a place of perfection, where they live at peace. So he's not a warrior, where their adopted brother Tarzan is. And a lot of it's about that conflict. Can we find peace through non-violence or do we have to fight for peace? And at the same time, Caesar's not that peaceful of a character. There's a lot of rage inside of him.

Are there any other classic franchises that you think would blend well with Planet of the Apes or Tarzan?
Y'know, years and years ago, Dark Horse did a Tarzan versus Predator story that I thought worked surprisingly well. I think you could do Tarzan and other pulp-era characters pretty well. Like Tarzan and Doc Savage might be pretty interesting.
With Planet of the Apes, to me, you have to be careful in how you bring that world together because of how much you have to bend the rules of that reality. The thing that made Tarzan on the Planet of the Apes come together actually really seamlessly is that Tarzan was raised by intelligent apes. So it was like, oh, that is the thing to latch on to. So if I was to think of another franchise to do with Planet of the Apes it would have to either be something like that that had the concept of an intelligent ape or it would have to be something that deals with like, time travel or whatever. And then you're just getting into some weird sh-t, y'know?
Like, would you want to do Predator on the Planet of the Apes? Well, I would write the hell out of that book! [Laughs] I don't know if I would know how to make it make sense. But I think Predator on the Planet of the Apes might work. Hint hint hint!

American spies collected information last summer revealing that senior Russian intelligence and political officials were discussing how to exert influence over Donald J. Trump through their advisers, according to three current and former American officials familiar with the intelligence, according to The New York Times.
The conversations focused on Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairperson at the time, and Michael T. Flynn, a retired general who was advising Mr. Trump, the officials said. Both men had indirect ties to Russian officials, who appeared confident that each could be used to help shape Mr. Trump`s opinions on Russia, The New York Times wrote.
Some Russians boasted about how well they knew Mr. Flynn. Others discussed leveraging their ties to Viktor F. Yanukovych, the deposed president of Ukraine living in exile in Russia, who at one time had worked closely with Mr. Manafort.
The intelligence was among the clues — which also included information about direct communications between Mr. Trump`s advisers and Russian officials — that American officials received last year as they began investigating Russian attempts to disrupt the election and whether any of Mr. Trump`s associates were assisting Moscow in the effort. Details of the conversations, some of which have not been previously reported, add to an increasing understanding of the alarm inside the American government last year about the Russian disruption campaign.
The information collected last summer was considered credible enough for intelligence agencies to pass to the F.B.I., which during that period opened a counterintelligence investigation that is continuing. It is unclear, however, whether Russian officials actually tried to directly influence Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn. Both have denied any collusion with the Russian government on the campaign to disrupt the election.
John O. Brennan, the former director of the C.I.A., testified Tuesday about a tense period last year when they came to believe that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was trying to steer the outcome of the election. They said they saw intelligence suggesting that Russia wanted to use Trump campaign officials, wittingly or not, to help in that effort. They spoke vaguely about contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials, without giving names, saying they ”raised questions in my mind about whether Russia was able to gain the cooperation of those individuals.”
Whether the Russians worked directly with any Trump advisers is one of the central questions that federal investigators, now led by Robert S. Mueller III, the newly appointed special counsel, are seeking to answer. President Trump, for their part, has dismissed talk of Russian interference in the election as ”fake news,” insisting there was no contact between their campaign and Russian officials.
”If there ever was any effort by Russians to influence me, I was unaware, and they would have failed,” Mr. Manafort said in a statement. ”I did not collude with the Russians to influence the elections.”
The White House, F.B.I. and C.I.A. declined to comment. Mr. Flynn`s lawyer did not respond to an email seeking comment.
The current and former officials agreed to discuss the intelligence only on the condition of anonymity because much of it remains highly classified, and they could be prosecuted for disclosing it.
Before taking the helm of the Trump campaign last May, Mr. Manafort worked for more than a decade for Russian-leaning political organizations and people in Ukraine, including Mr. Yanukovych, the former president. Mr. Yanukovych was a close ally of Mr. Putin.
Mr. Manafort`s links to Ukraine led to their departure from the Trump campaign in August, after their name surfaced in secret ledgers showing millions in undisclosed payments from Mr. Yanukovych`s political party.
Russia views Ukraine as a buffer against the eastward expansion of NATO, and has supported separatists in their yearslong fight against the struggling democratic government in Kyiv.
Cybersport.com caught up with Team Liquid's Russell "Twistzz" Van Dulken at the ESL Pro League Season 6 Finals, where we spoke about their experience on Team Liquid, the team's mentality going into the event with a stand-in, future projections for Lucas "steel" Lopes's impact on the roster and their coaching capabilities.
***
How have you found your time with Liquid so far?
Everything has been going really well. At first I was super excited to join Liquid, and when it finally happened I knew that I would be able to reach the next level as both a player and a teammate. Everything has been good.
If you look at the benefit to your team before your personal benefit, you will make the right decision every time.
As a relatively young player, what would you say are the most important lessons you've learned while playing for Liquid?
More than anything else, I've learned to be a teammate. This is by far the most important thing. If you look at the benefit to your team before your personal benefit, you will make the right decision every time.
Without dwelling too much on results, I wanted to find out what the team's mentality was going into EPL, considering the fact that Wilton "zews" Prado
Astralis FaZe Clan We didn't really set any expectations for ourselves; we knew that anything could happen. It definitely wasn't impossible to win matches and we showed that. What changed us was the first game we played, where we were winning versusand we were like "Ok, we're actually able to beat these teams, even with zews." I think that got to us. Versusit definitely showed that we were under pressure.
What was the dynamic for in-game calling, seeing as both zews and Nick "nitr0" Cannella
Peter "stanislaw" Jarguz It kind of went back to the way that we had it whenwas on the roster. They would call around 30% of the time and Nick [nitr0] would decide if they want to use the idea. I'd say it was 60/40 calling with Nick taking on the majority of it. I think that was best for the team.
I really think nitr0 has a really good understanding of the game - this includes all stages of the round.
If you had to compare the style of calling between nitr0 and stanislaw, what would you point out as the significant differences between them?
I really think nitr0 has a really good understanding of the game - this includes all stages of the round. The reason they're different is because one defaults, secures information and plans the game plan based off that, whilst stanislaw has a game plan from the very start of the round, something like a set execute or a set split - something set where we don't default as much.
Twistzz at the ESL Pro League Season 6 Finals Substituting zews was Lucas "steel" Lopes
Yeah, they actually did. Steel was an amazing coach throughout the event. I think as a player it's quite easy to pick up on things when you're playing the game. When he's watching they can see everything, including what the enemy team is doing, the mistakes that we're making, what we can do better and every tag pause they were incredibly useful. They actually helped a lot in the Astralis game; I think we used all of our tag pauses. We even used the bonus tag pause in overtime, so yeah, they were really useful.
Did they outline any mistakes that you identified as a team issue?
Mostly what they outlined was stuff at the beginning of a round. They noticed the mistake, like we're hitting a site too many times - we need to mix it up. It's not really something that everybody thinks about when we're playing, we're just trying to win the round, ultimately. They just contributed with ideas like that, like "maybe it's time to change this" or "maybe we should play it slower", helpful things like that.
He's super happy, their mentality is really good and it rubs off on people well. It's making everyone a lot happier, more open to make jokes and such, just be funny, be a family.
Given the limited amount of time you've actually played on LAN with steel, how do you project their addition to the roster is going to impact the team?
At Oakland they already had a massive effect on the team. He's super happy, their mentality is really good and it rubs off on people well. It's making everyone a lot happier, more open to make jokes and such, just be funny, be a family. I think he's doing really well right now, all our practices have been going really well. We scrimmed SK yesterday, it went super-well, played OpTic before that, went really well. We're definitely doing well as a team right now, and I think it will show at ECS.
Do they ever give you insides on the Brazilian side of things?
No, mainly zews would do that; zews would really do it a lot. I think that's the reason we match up against SK really well. Steel doesn't really do that, although I bet if we played against VillaMix or something, that would probably happen, but right now, not really.
With ECS your last event of the year, what does your holiday schedule look like? Will you be taking a prolonged break or are you back on the grind ASAP?
We have a set day of January 4th to be back at the gaming house, ready to practice and ready to travel to events. Everybody is pretty much going home right after ECS, I fly back to Canada right after the conclusion of it. I'm pretty sure everyone's spending the holidays at home.

Anyone who owns an airgun will need a licence under new measures proposed by the Scottish government.
The licensing system is included in a new bill that has been laid with the Scottish Parliament to impose tighter controls on air weapons.
The proposals follow a long-running campaign by the Scottish government to crack down on the misuse of airguns.
It followed the death of two-year-old Andrew Morton, who was shot in the head with an airgun in Glasgow in 2005.
Mark Bonini was later convicted of murdering the toddler.
The Air Weapons and Licensing (Scotland) Bill laid before Holyrood seeks to introduce strict licensing measures for the estimated 500,000 air weapons in Scotland.
Under the proposed new scheme, anyone wanting to own an air gun would need to demonstrate they had a legitimate reason for doing so.
Image copyright PA Image caption Andrew Morton was killed after being shot in the head by an airgun in 2005
These reasons may include pest control, sporting target shooting, or being a collector.
The bill creates a number of new offences related to possession, use and acquisition of air weapons by people who do not hold a licence, or who do not act in accordance with the licensing regime.
It also sets out the framework through which Police Scotland may grant an air weapon licence to appropriate individuals.
Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill stressed that the legislation would not ban airguns outright, and said the proposals would not prevent people using them for legitimate reasons.
Every day police and animal welfare groups have to deal with the results of air weapons being misused Kenny MacAskill, Justice secretary
Mr MacAskill said they had recently met the mother of Andrew Morton, close to what would have been the boy's 12th birthday.
They added: "To see and hear the continued pain their family has gone through only serves to make me even more determined to ensure we have robust legislation to prevent future tragedies.
"Such tragic incidents are, thankfully, very rare, but every day police and animal welfare groups have to deal with the results of air weapons being misused.
"As well as causing daily anti-social behaviour and vandalism they can also cause horrific injuries to wildlife and family pets by those who maliciously target animals."
The justice secretary said the licensing regime for air weapons represented an "important first step" towards devolving all powers on firearms to Holyrood, something the Scottish government has been pressing the UK government for.
Bringing in this legislation will not deter those who are already determined to break the law Dr Colin Shedden, Basc Scotland
The Scottish government carried out a consultation on setting up a licensing system for air weapons in 2012.
An overwhelming majority - 87% - of those who responded to the consultation opposed the plan, with some describing it as "draconian" and "heavy-handed".
But the proposals were welcomed by police and victim groups.
Figures released by the Scottish government in November showed the total number of firearms offences recorded in Scotland fell by a third in the past year, from 535 to 365.
Of these, almost half - 171 - involved air weapons.
The British Association for Shooting and Conservation (Basc) described the licensing system as a "unnecessary, costly and impractical".
It said the legislation would place unnecessary burdens on police time and budgets, would only be taken up by already law-abiding airgun users, and would have little effect on criminal misuse.
Dr Colin Shedden, director of Basc Scotland, said: "Offences involving air weapons in Scotland have fallen by 75% in recent years. In 2006-07 there was a ten-year-peak of 683 air weapon offences. In 2012-13, after six years of steady decline, there were 171 offences.
"In addition, all firearms offences are now at the lowest level since records began. Airguns are already extensively regulated by law, with more than thirty offences on the statute books. Bringing in this legislation will not deter those who are already determined to break the law."
Holyrood was given powers over air weapons as part of changes made to devolution in the Scotland Act.
The bill will also bring in tighter licensing for scrap metal dealers in a bid to curb metal theft, including new rules that will ban dealers from making cash payments.
It will also create new offences aimed at tackling under-age drinking, and a new licensing regime for lap dancing venues which will give greater local control over their numbers.
Louise Linton, the wife of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, snapped back at an Instagram user Monday who insulted them and said they have sacrificed more for America.
"Glad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable," user "jennimiller29" commented on the post.
"Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you'd be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours. You're adorably out of touch," Linton, 36, responded in a comment.
"Did you think this was a personal trip?! Adorable! Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country? I'm pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day 'trip' than you did," Linton added.
Linton, who married their husband on June 24, also thanked their insulter for the "passive aggressive nasty comment" and said the woman's children and life look "cute."
"I know you're mad, but deep down you're really nice and so am I. Sending me passive aggressive Instagram comments isn't going to make life feel better. Maybe a nice message, one filled with wisdom and humanity, would get more traction," Linton added.
Introduction
This is a tutorial blog post and web application showing how to deploy an Ethereum smart contract and transacting with this contract from a web user interface.
The web application written using JavaScript, React user interface library and Bootstrap theming. The application is coded in ECMAScript 2016 and wrapped together using Webpack module bundler. For the deployment of the contract Go Ethereum JSON-RPC API is used. The production web application communicates with Ethereum blockchain using Etherscan.io API service for pushing out transactions from the web application.
All private keys are held 100% on the client side and transaction is constructed in JavaScript, making the example optimal to follow if you are working with non-custodian wallets or Dapps.
We use both command line Node.js tools and browser based JavaScript in this demo.

Prerequisites
You need to be comfortable in advanced JavaScript programming. You need to have geth (Go-Ethereum) node or any Ethereum node software running in a Ethereum Ropsten testnet. See below how to install and connect to one safely.
You need to be comfortable working on a command line in UNIXy environment, though Windows works also
You need to have solc installed
Features
Interact with Ethereum blockchain over both Go-Ethereum JSON-RPC connection and EtherScan.io API
Interact with smart contracts from web browser JavaScript
Deploy a smart contract from a command line
Generate private and public key pair offline
Push transactions through etherscan.io API or optional sign tranactions offline
Sample Solidity contract source code
Getting started
Clone the Github repository.
Install Node version 7.2.1 or later. Use nvm script to make this easy for you.
Install all dependencies:
nvm use 7.2.1 npm install
Running Ethereum node (Go-Ethereum) in a testnet
This demostration is built Ethereum Ropsten testnet in mind. The public testnet is ideal for cases where you don't want to spend any money to test your contracts, but you still want to share them publicly and use public blockchain explorers to debug your contracts. Ropsten testnet mining difficulty is very low and anyone can mine some testnet ETH there using the CPU.
Note that running a private testnet usin geth is still much faster alternative, transaction delay wise, compared to the public testnet.
You can run geth on a server (2GB VPS) and then connect it to using SSH tunneling to avoid the CPU burden and sync delays on your local development laptop.
See here how to deploy geth securely on a server and then build a SSH tunnel from your local development computer to server running geth
See another blog post how to set up geth with password protected JSON RPC
Creating a private key
The demo app has a text input that directly takes your Ethereum account private key.
A private key is just a 256-bit number. You can generate one easily from a passphrase using sha3 hash in node console.
First launch node.js:
node
Then generate a private key from a passphrase in Nod console:
Web3 = require("Web3"); web3 = new Web3(); privateKeyRaw = web3.sha3("Toholampi is the best town on the world"); '0x4fe8deb1d5e5908bd05bf8b8aad6f3a5fbce70a95e3f65fe85cbe6d3f4e44f77'
To get a matching Ethereum address for your private key:
Wallet = require("ethers-wallet"); wallet = new Wallet(privateKeyRaw); wallet.address '0x062Abe5fbaEf147d765C40F73aB31a6B05aEb8Ca'
Transferring ETH on your private key address
Make sure JSON-RPC is available on http://localhost:8545 .
Connect to your geth and send some balance from geth coinbase address to this address:
geth attach http://localhost:8545
Check your coinbase address has some balance:
web3.eth.getBalance(web3.eth.coinbase) 181147570016639999999
Unlock your coinbase account so that you can do withdraws from it:
web3.personal.unlockAccount(web3.eth.coinbase);
Transfer 0.1 ETH to your private key address as generated above:
web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: web3.eth.coinbase, to: '0x062Abe5fbaEf147d765C40F73aB31a6B05aEb8Ca', value: web3.toWei("0.1", "ether")}); "0x41f6c6fbdfd4184172d61b390922270db087519137c43d3052fbad33876964f7"
See my demo transaction in Etherscan Ropsten explorer.
Creating a smart contract
We use the following sample smart contract for the demo:
pragma solidity ^0.4.4; contract SampleContract { // This value is visible in etherscan.io explorer uint public value; // Anyone can call this contract and override the value of the previous caller function setValue(uint value_) public { value = value_; } }
Deploying a contract
Note: You can skip this step if you want as there is already a deployed test contract here.
You need to have
Geth JSON-RPC API running at http://localhost:8545 connected to Ropsten testnet (see below for geth info)
You need to have balance on your Geth coinbase account (run --mine to generate some)
First compile the contract to create contracts.json ABI definitions:
cd contracts solc SampleContract.sol --combined-json abi,asm,ast,bin,bin-runtime,clone-bin,devdoc,interface,opcodes,srcmap,srcmap-runtime,userdoc > contracts.json
Then you can deploy the contract using the attached deploy.js script.
node --harmony-async-await deploy.js
The sample deployment script is a JavaScript script that reads contract ABI definitions and communicates with geth over JSON-RPC using web3 wrapper:
// Copyright 2017 https://tokenmarket.net - MIT licensed // // Run with Node 7.x as: // // node --harmony-async-await deploy.js // let fs = require("fs"); let Web3 = require('web3'); // https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3 // Create a web3 connection to a running geth node over JSON-RPC running at // http://localhost:8545 // For geth VPS server + SSH tunneling see // https://gist.github.com/miohtama/ce612b35415e74268ff243af645048f4 let web3 = new Web3(); web3.setProvider(new web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545')); // Read the compiled contract code // Compile with // solc SampleContract.sol --combined-json abi,asm,ast,bin,bin-runtime,clone-bin,devdoc,interface,opcodes,srcmap,srcmap-runtime,userdoc > contracts.json let source = fs.readFileSync("contracts.json"); let contracts = JSON.parse(source)["contracts"]; // ABI description as JSON structure let abi = JSON.parse(contracts.SampleContract.abi); // Smart contract EVM bytecode as hex let code = contracts.SampleContract.bin; // Create Contract proxy class let SampleContract = web3.eth.contract(abi); // Unlock the coinbase account to make transactions out of it console.log("Unlocking coinbase account"); var password = ""; try { web3.personal.unlockAccount(web3.eth.coinbase, password); } catch(e) { console.log(e); return; } console.log("Deploying the contract"); let contract = SampleContract.new({from: web3.eth.coinbase, gas: 1000000, data: code}); // Transaction has entered to geth memory pool console.log("Your contract is being deployed in transaction at http://testnet.etherscan.io/tx/" + contract.transactionHash); // http://stackoverflow.com/questions/951021/what-is-the-javascript-version-of-sleep function sleep(ms) { return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms)); } // We need to wait until any miner has included the transaction // in a block to get the address of the contract async function waitBlock() { while (true) { let receipt = web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(contract.transactionHash); if (receipt && receipt.contractAddress) { console.log("Your contract has been deployed at http://testnet.etherscan.io/address/" + receipt.contractAddress); console.log("Note that it might take 30 - 90 sceonds for the block to propagate befor it's visible in etherscan.io"); break; } console.log("Waiting a mined block to include your contract... currently in block " + web3.eth.blockNumber); await sleep(4000); } } waitBlock();

Building a contract call
Now when your contract is deployed, you have a private key to your account, you have your Etherscan.io API key, you can make some calls to the contract.
Either run the app locally (below) or directly use the hosted version.
The transaction is constructed offline using contract address, private key, nonce and function description see here. The raw transaction (payload) is pushed to Ethereum network over EtherScan.io eth_sendRawTransaction (pushTx) endpoint.
The transaction data payload is 32-bit hash of the Solidity function signature, like setValue(uint), and all function arguments serialized as 256-bit parameters (2000 = 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007d0).
The transaction can also carry value as ETH that get added to the ethers hold by the smart contract itself.
Each transaction has a cost in gas. More complex your transaction is, more code Ethereum Virtual Machine runs and more data you store on the blockchain, more gas you need to pay in ETH as a transaction cost. gas is the upper limit how much your transaction can use gas. It's a safety limit. All unused gas and related ETH is credited back to your Ethereum account.
There is also a gas price associated with the transaction gas. More you are willing to pay for the gas, more likely miners pick up your transaction. For normal blockchain usage, you usually never need to change the gas price.
Developing app locally
If you wish to edit this application and use it as a starting point for your own product you can run WebPack automatically reloading development server locally:
npm start
Bonus: Calling contract using web3 and Go-Ethereum JSON-RPC API
You can also call the contract using a command line script.
Here is an example:
/* Call the contract using web3- * * To run: * * nvm use 7.2.1 * ./node_modules/babel-cli/bin/babel-node.js --presets es2015 ./tests/callcontract.js * */ import fs from "fs"; import Web3 from 'web3'; let web3 = new Web3(); web3.setProvider(new web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545')); // Fetch ABI let source = fs.readFileSync("contracts/contracts.json"); let contracts = JSON.parse(source)["contracts"]; let abi = JSON.parse(contracts.SampleContract.abi); // Get a proxy on our Ropsten contract let SampleContract = web3.eth.contract(abi); let contract = SampleContract.at('0xe0b79b3d705cd09435475904bf54520929eae4e8'); // Perform a transaction using ETH from the geth coinbase account web3.personal.unlockAccount(web3.eth.coinbase, ""); // Set the account from where we perform out contract transactions web3.eth.defaultAccount = web3.eth.coinbase; let tx = contract.setValue(3000, {gas: 200000}); console.log("Our tx is https://testnet.etherscan.io/tx/" + tx);

This $6-A-Month Plan Brings Solar Power To People Living Off The Grid

People talk about a flash of inspiration. But Xavier Helgesen's eureka moment came in the dark.
A few years ago, the American entrepreneur was traveling through Malawi to meet with clients for their book-selling company, Better World Books. They stopped in Monkey Bay, a town of about 30,000 people, to spend the night. What made this place unforgettable, they say, was that it was "100 percent off-grid."
The streets were pitch black. People carried kerosene lamps to walk around at night. When a family invited them to dinner, they all huddled under one dim light. "It was amazing," they say, "to see that was how everyone lived."
And that's when Helgesen, 38, who was just starting to learn about solar energy, had their bright idea: "If anybody needed solar power," they say, "it was the people living off the electricity grid."
Helgesen harnessed that idea, and today, is the head of Off-Grid Electric, a for-profit solar energy company that provides affordable electricity service for people in Africa who are off the grid. They started Off-Grid in 2012 with Erica Mackey, a classmate at the University of Oxford's business school. Off-Grid has reached more than 100,000 households and hired 800 of its 1,000 workers in Tanzania. This year, it's expanding to Rwanda. The goal to reach 1 million homes in Africa by 2017.
In countries like Tanzania, citizens who lack power may have to wait years for the government to build up the grid and plug them in. And they'll pay for the privilege.

By contrast, Off-Grid's customers can power up their homes for as little as $6 a month. When someone signs up for a system, there's a $6 fee for Off-Grid to install solar panels and a meter to monitor their energy usage, along with LED lights, a radio and a phone charger that all work off the solar charge. It only takes a few hours. Then customers pay about $6 a month to access the power they need — about what they'd be paying for kerosene for home energy.
USAID is a big fan. Citing the group's "tremendous progress providing access to clean and reliable light and electricity," USAID launched a $36 million joint Power Africa and U.S. Global Development Lab effort this week. The money will be used to fund projects like Off-Grid's to 20 million households across sub-Saharan Africa.
The company itself has grown rapidly in the past year. Off-Grid has been a favorite for funders, securing $45 million from stakeholders in December 2015 to expand the company. And in January, it won the Zayed Future Energy Prize for its creative, "massively scalable" business model.
Lily Odarno, an energy associate at the nonprofit group World Resources Institute, says the key to Off-Grid's success has been good timing and creativity.
"There's a unique opportunity right now in Tanzania. You have a conflation of a number of important factors: A largely rural population with a low electricity rate, the availability of solar technology, which has improved over time, and technologies to ensure people can pay for their services," they say.
"Off-Grid Electric tapped into their innovative approaches to reach people without electricity who live in rural areas," they add.
So how did they do it? Goats and Soda interviewed Helgesen this week to find out.
Talk about appliances, not watts

Some solar companies tell potential customers, you'll be purchasing, say, 80 watts for your home. But it's confusing to sell electricity when you talk in watts, says Helgesen. Instead, Off-Grid reps talk about how many appliances in your home you can power. "We have gone to a lot of homes that surprisingly have electrical appliances that they got for wedding gifts, but no electricity," they say.
So Off-Grid asks their customers which appliances they want to power up — then designs a package based on their specific needs. If they need to buy certain devices as well, like lights or a radio, Off-Grid can add those to the package, too.
Find out what people really want
For many of Off-Grid's clients, their No. 1 wish is for electricity to run a phone charger. When Helgesen realized that most of their potential customers have cellphones but need to go to a charging station to power up, they decided to include a USB cellphone charger in the entry-level package.
"Phone charging is a crucial application," they say. "People can get by without lights, but not being able to charge your phone — there's no substitute for that."
Pay as you go
Customers might be intimidated by the idea of a monthly bill for 24/7 electricity, so Off-Grid customers pay for power as they use it, relying on mobile payment apps like M-Pesa. "Just like prepaid mobile throughout Africa and India, our customers pay us daily for the use of their solar system," says Helgesen.
Your customers will let you know when you get it wrong
One thing Off-Grid tried that tanked? Getting fishermen in Lake Victoria to switch from using kerosene lamps to solar-powered lights at night. The fishermen use the lamps to attract fish to the surface of the water to catch them. "We failed," they say. "Kerosene is very warm light — which is what fish are attracted to — and solar is cold light. The fishermen were not impressed."
Keep in mind: The customer is always right
The team saw that many villagers displayed their new solar-powered light fixtures on their porch, leaving the inside of their homes dark. It was because they wanted others in the community to know they had electricity — a local status symbol.
Instead of trying to convince them to keep the lights inside, the company came up with a light to meet this need: "We designed a custom fluorescent tube light — seen as very modern and functional in this part of the world — and made it three times as bright as the indoor light," says Helgesen. "It's meant to be used outside the home." These lights can be purchased and included in a customer's energy package.

Keep innovating
This week, Off-Grid announced a new program called "Kazi na Zola," a collection of solar appliances like phone charging strips, entertainment systems and hair clippers designed to help rural entrepreneurs generate income. "We give them a simple business plan," says Helgesen, to run a phone-charging shop, barbershop, bar or restaurant. "We tell them: Here's how many haircuts you'd have to do a day, phones you'd have to charge a day to pay for your system. Anything above that — that's your profit."
Shorten's timely transition from 'no' to 'me too'
Posted
Relentless negativity isn't the only path to electoral success, a fact that Bill Shorten appears to understand as they carefully pick their battles with the Abbott Government, writes Paula Matthewson.
A funny thing happened on our way to war. After almost a year of trialling various iterations of the uber-negative stance taken by former opposition leader Tony Abbott, their successor Bill Shorten neatly pivoted from being "Mr No" to "Mr Me Too".
It's not unusual for a Labor opposition leader to support a conservative Australian government taking military action. Of course there are historical exceptions, such as the Vietnam War, as well as the more recent example of Simon Crean opposing the Howard government taking us into Iraq without proof of WMDs or the United Nations' sanction.
However, being citizens of a fundamentally small "c" conservative nation, Australians are generally supportive of governments taking military action that is seen to "protect" us or our way of life. And we have little time for oppositions that criticise those actions in the name of political point-scoring.
Shorten's Labor showed an early understanding of this political reality when MH17 was shot down.
No quibbles were made of the overtly muscular language used at the time by the Prime Minister and their Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop. No ironic jibes were levelled at Bishop as they headed forthwith to New York to exert pressure on Russia using Australia's seat on the UN Security Council, despite them previously suggesting Rudd and Gillard's campaign to acquire the seat was overly expensive if not indulgent.
Instead, Shorten took Abbott's lead, also adopting the stance and words of a statesman, and even going so far as to pay tribute in the Parliament to the Government's handling of the efforts to bring home the Australian victims of the MH17 tragedy:
The manner in which this has been conducted has made me proud to be Australian, and I congratulate the Government.
Shorten has also been swift to shut down any dissent within their own ranks, or any suggestion that Abbott is exploiting Australia's domestic or international efforts against terrorism to deflect voter attention from the unpopular budget. (Although this is patently the result of those developments.)
As Australia has moved inexorably closer to returning to Iraq, Shorten has stood steadfastly by Abbott's side, including last Friday when they joined the PM to farewell our first new troop deployment. As they noted just days before that:
When it comes to fighting terror, we are all in this together. The Prime Minister and I are partners in national security...
The most interesting element of Shorten's new-found bipartisanship is that it doesn't appear to end with matters of national security.
The Labor leader reportedly met privately with Abbott before the PM travelled to Arnhem Land last week and resolved to work with the Government to give the best chance of success to the referendum that must be held in order for there to be constitutional recognition of the nation's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.
The outbreak of cooperation may also have extended to Labor support for the Coalition's new security laws, which are to be debated in Parliament this week, and scaled-back versions of some of the changes to welfare payment arrangements proposed in this year's federal budget.
To be fair, Shorten hasn't signed on to the unity ticket for everything being done by the Government. Abbott's budget is still "unfair", the Government's decision to buy submarines off-the-shelf will "imperil Australia's national security", and Labor has now developed a nuanced position on engagement in Iraq and Syria that identifies a number of conditions that must be met by the Government to maintain the ALP's continued support.
And while Shorten may well have agreed to work cooperatively with Abbott on constitutional recognition for Australia's first peoples, they were still prepared to put the boot into the PM for their lack of consistency on improving the lot of Indigenous Australians:
The Prime Minister is visiting Arnhem Land this week to see firsthand the issues confronting Indigenous Australians. I think that is a great idea and I welcome their visit ... yet they have cut over half a billion dollars from Indigenous services funding. So there are children and family child care centres which are closing. Legal aid is falling; this is at a time when young Aboriginal men, when they finish school, are more likely to go to jail than university. So Tony Abbott, it is great that you are visiting - but actions count more than words. It's about time we actually started standing up for Aboriginal Australians, not just visiting them.
Although it is early days with this multi-dimensional approach, Shorten appears to be finding the right balance between "no" and "me too".
If they were to seek guidance on refining the method, the Labor leader would need look no further than the then opposition leader Kevin Rudd for inspiration.
Rudd ran the perfect "me too" campaign against then PM John Howard. They assuaged any voter concern about tossing out an aged and hubristic government for a TV-celebrity politician by saying they were just the same as Howard, but better. They agreed with Howard on many aspects of policy except for the key points of differentiation: climate change, asylum seekers and WorkChoices.
Rudd knew this tactic would work, because they had observed Howard use it against the tired and hubristic Hawke/Keating Government in 1996. Howard offered the same economic competence as Keating, but promised to govern "for all of us" to differentiate themselves from Keating who was seen as having lost touch with everyday Australians.
History tells us the diametrically different style of oppositionism adopted by Tony Abbott was also successful, but that its personal cost was high. It is unlikely Abbott will ever be a popular politician in the traditional sense, nor is it likely they will attain a high level of community respect.
Luckily for Shorten, there is another possible path to electoral success, and it appears to be one that they are exploring.
If Shorten is successful in establishing a more "constructively-negative" approach to opposition, it might not quite lead to peace in our time, but it may well lead to the kinder, gentler polity that until recently has been little more than a wistfully muttered ideal.

ABSTRACT: We're always looking for excuses not to run. Sure, it's one of the simplest, cheapest, and most effective forms of exercise out there, but for many of us, running equals suffering. There's no way around it: It sure as hell hurts. So we'll run with any excuse we can—no matter how pathetic—to stay on the couch. My personal go-to: Running is bad for the knees. In fact, it's plainly irresponsible to tie up my Asics laces. But do I have a leg to stand on?
HYPOTHESIS: We may have been born to run, but we've evolved to be couch-bound; running wrecks the knees.
METHODS: A study in the journal Medical Science Sports Exercise tracked 74,752 runners over 7.1 years and 14,625 walkers over 5.7 years looking at the number of hip replacements and cases of osteoarthritis in each group.
RESULTS: The runners had fewer cases of osteoarthritis and needed fewer hip replacements than the walkers. Regardless of their mileage, runners were at roughly half the risk for osteoarthritis and hip replacements than walkers who expended equal amounts of energy (measured in METhr/d). Surprisingly, other forms of exercise were more damaging then either running or walking.
DISCUSSION: Old myths die hard, especially when people are looking for excuses. Still, how can running have the exact opposite effect as what we had expected? “A lot of people think of exercise in sort of the automobile engine model where you tend to wear out the bearings when you use them more and more,” says Paul Williams, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at the Lawrence Berkley Laboratory in Berkeley, California . “The difference with the body is that it's successful because it compensates for the stresses.”
While sports injuries do raise your risk of developing osteoarthritis and studies examining Olympic-class athletes—who are often injury-prone—show high rates of the disease, the reality is different for nearly everyone else (in their 90,000-person sample, very few people fit these criteria, Williams says). Animal models show that exercise promotes cartilage thickening and protects its stretchy properties, according to Williams. In other words, instead of wearing down your bearings, running may grease them. That's key, because cartilage thinning and the loss of elasticity are both prominent causes of osteoarthritis.
But things are a bit more complicated. Running may have special protective properties, but about half of the effect comes from weight loss, Williams says. “If you were lean by other means would you still have this protective effect? Yes, but we still have the additional protective effect of whatever exercise is doing” to reduce you risk of osteoarthritis. On average, your risk for the disease jumps five percent for every point-increase in your BMI. Surprisingly, the reason why is actually not well understood, they say. But researchers know the “physical strain of carrying your weight around all the time” likely stresses your joints and that obesity causes a cascade of negative effects in your body. Some of those—like inflammation—likely take a toll on your joints, Williams says.
While all physical activity should theoretically provide some protection for your joints, Williams says they were surprised to find that forms of exercise other than running and walking actually boost your risk of osteoarthritis. In fact, people who were most active in activities other than running were at a 21 percent greater risk for osteoarthritis and 99 percent increased risk for hip replacement compared to those who exercised the least.
What makes running and walking safe but going to the gym damaging? It comes down to how you use your knees, and we can take a clue from occupations like carpet-laying, Williams says. The deep knee bending is a known risk factor for osteoarthritis. The problem: When you go to the gym, you're probably repeating some of those same moves. However, when you're running, your knees aren't bending to that same degree. And it's a far more continuous activity—without potentially damaging long pauses or stops and starts—than doing an indoor exercise class, Williams adds.
The one bit of bad news: Your risk of developing osteoarthritis jumps 3.9 percent per year for guys and 6.1 percent per year for women. And the longer you've been running, the more at risk you are. But even then, “the benefits of running outweigh the risks for 70 years,” Williams says.
CONCLUSION: We're down another excuse. Injury-free running is not bad for our knees.
It is difficult to believe that only 16 years ago some of us were outraged by the Harry and Louise ads. Those ads seem quaint compared to what we are seeing today from the opponents of health care reform and their scare tactics that are just short of saying that health care reform means President Obama will personally sign orders to kill anybody who is sick or over 60 years old. It is, however, a good bet that if we wait long enough, we will start hearing that as well.
This is unfortunate because health care reform is long overdue. A more efficient system that insures more people, simplifies the health care process, brings costs down and creates rational incentives for health care providers, health care seekers and everybody else would be of great value to the entire country. The creation of such a system would be very difficult, and perhaps not fully possible, but it should be the goal of Obama's policy.
The political reality is that given the margin with which they were elected and the substantial margins by which the Democrats control both houses of congress it is likely that we will get some form of an Obama health care bill. It is, unfortunately, increasingly clear now that the bill will be limited in scope. Moreover, any chance of a serious debate about how to balance competing needs and political realities has been shouted down. Because the anti-health care reform interests, in collaboration with broader right wing organizations, have invested in scare tactics, rumor mongering and fear to the preclusion of negotiation, communication or compromise, the Democratic health care bill will probably not be as inclusive as many of us would like; and a major progressive goal of more than half a century will still be unmet.
The failure of health care reform will not in itself be a devastating blow to the progressive movement. After all, we have failed, or been stopped, on this issue many times before. However, if health care reform fails it will raise serious questions about a central premise of both Obama's campaign and the progressive movement that supported it. The debate about health care, is part of the broader movement and thus is also a debate about how we do governance, pitting those who believe we can change and move away from the nastiness and partisanship of the last twenty years against those who believe that the problem with how we have done politics in the last 16 years is that we were too calm. At its base, this is a fight over whether change is possible. Accordingly, the defeat of meaningful health care reform may well signify the defeat of the optimism and hope surrounding Obama as well as of the notion that it is possible to make real change in Washington.
The promise of change in both the substance and style of politics was deeply felt when Obama took office. So far, the Obama administration has given us some important pieces of legislation passed, a refreshing movement away from the radically ideologically driven Bush administration and a far more style and intellect in the White House, but the promised dramatic change is still very much a work in progress. The economy may recover, but it is clear now that it will not fundamentally change. We will likely get a health care reform bill, but there is a real possibility that it will be one of essentially half measures.
Since the liberation of eastern Aleppo in the end of 2016 local residents have revealed White Helmets are organ traders. This horrific truth finally comes out. To have lived under a “rebel stronghold” means to be slaughtered in a silent way, while the western and GCC media defend the slaughterers, giving them more cover, and more power to murder Syrians – while their families were not able to tell of their pain, during the brutal rule of those “rebels.” Aleppo was liberated and western media mourned. Aleppo was liberated and the west gave an award to the terrorists White Helmets organ traders.
The terrorists concentrated in the old districts of eastern Aleppo, using especially schools – after shutting down education – to launch missiles and mortar shells on innocent civilians. These sites, in suburbs, in buildings of displaced Syrians were a good cover and pretext for the western media, to make it look like the Syrian government was targeting residential buildings. These buildings were occupied, were nothing but terrorist hotbeds.
As soon as those terrorist “rebels” launched their missiles on eastern Aleppo, the emergency vehicles of those same rebels immediately arrived. They knew where and when the grenade launchers would shell the people!
Abo Mohammad, a local resident said, we were afraid after every mortar shell, because those rebels in white helmets will come in their ambulances to carry the wounded. We were the targets they pounced on immediately. They knew the time, and the sites, and the victims never came back with their full organs. For me, they have stolen one of my kidneys and part of my spleen! And we were not able to judge them, we were under their full control.
Another local residential woman, called Alia, told about their suffering. The White Helmets organ traders had a black market on the border with Turkey where they sold women, kids, and also dead bodies of Syrians. The dead body price was about $115. The price of a wounded, but alive victim is more, about $700.
All the poor wounded were victims to be considered human organ donors! Those White Helmets organ traders came from Turkey with foreign doctors, were in our city under the pretext of humanitarian purpose! However, the truth is they were slaughterers, and we were just a good trade for them, across the border with Turkey.
Turkey and every country stands with those “rebels,” White Helmets are involved in slaughtering our people.
In a previous report, a local resident, Hayat – after liberation by our Syrian Arab Army – told in a video about how their husband was murdered by those “rebels,” and how their body was taken to Turkey, and returned with their organs cut out of their body. They stole their organs!
In Syria, our government forbids human organs trade; it is banned! However, the world helps to support those cannibals, since the very beginning of the foreign international war on Syria.
The world's leading terrorists help to give these criminals credibility, a voice in the world's mainstream and fake independent media; the world's fake NGOs support them too.
This horrible farce continues; these brutal White Helmets organ traders were nominated for a Nobel Peace prize, and then received an Oscar, as consolation. Hollywood gave a standing ovation to the CIA's death squads against Syria.
The Oscar, for what? For being in the areas controlled by the al Nusra Front, which is on the US' terror list! The White Helmets are companions of these terrorists, continuing the crimes and horrors inflicted on poor civilians – while lying that our army that protects us from 350,000 foreign invaders is committing these war crimes!
Launch bombs by al Nusra Front, then send those to pounce on the wounded, to steal their organs on the fake pretext of helping them, carrying them to hospitals where they have their organs cut out.
Give them an Oscar reward? This reveals that such media is only serving the geopolitical agenda of those western leaders who have funded terror in our country, with money, training, and massive weapons.
Fool the people. Justify their wars on third world countries, and on countries which have maintained national sovereignty.
Their victims are twice slaughtered, once by the western backed terrorists, secondly by this rotten lying media.
Meanwhile, whole countries are being murdered, directly by western killer states – “coalition” led by US – and by their proxy terrorist gangs, like Saudi against poor Yemen. Or by NATO in destroying Libya.
Who cares? The US — whose former Secretary of State John Kerry bragged about meeting with the White Helmets organ traders leader Raed Saleh, whose Hollywood gave them an Oscar award — should care. This gang met with Saudi terrorist illegally in Syria, Abdallah al Muhaysini. Muhaysini is on the US Specially Designated Nationals terror list.
Among Muhaysini's many war crimes is that they train child soldiers to become suicide bombers and other terrorists. like the two young boys who were among the 6 suicide bombers that murdered 42 Syrians in Homs, last month.
Who cares that the White Helmets organ traders kill us, as long as the western people can be fooled into believing these death squads are humanitarian? The Swedish Doctors for Human Rights group cares. Yesterday SWEDHR published a paper denouncing the White Helmets video and its “macabre manipulation of dead children and staged chemical weapons attack to facilitate a no-fly zone” against Syria.
Western msm won't care. This msm won't report on this paper. This msm wept when Aleppo was liberated. They did not report when the Syrian Arab Army found massive weapons depots filled with munitions from Turkey, UK, US, Israel — including missiles containing chemical weapons.
Western msm didn't report that Russian sappers cleared almost 1,000 hectares of explosive devices, in liberated Aleppo.
We don't expect the fake news msm to report on this new crime added to the long list, the crime of White Helmets organ traders; fake news msm has used its words as weapons of mass destruction against our country. We write for the people who are sick of being lied to by their mainstream news sources.
In August we wrote that the Oscar Nominations for War Porn with Child Has New Nominee, after the massive reporting on the fake story of the dusty “Omran” boy — re-rescued by the White Helmets organ traders, other times — who was fake rescued. Western media wasn't ashamed when independent investigative reporters immediately found that the man who took the “Omran” photo supported the terrorists who beheaded 12 year old Abdullah Issa.
We must add that the White Helmets public relations firm is AMC (and sometimes terrorist Qatar's al Khanzeera, illegally in Syria, and engaging in all forms of terrorism, including slaughter and kidnapping). AMC is frequently used as citation for the criminal lies of the unashamed western media.
When the fake story of dusty Omran dominated western msm, nobody noticed that in the (fake) critical time of rescuing children from a collapsed building, time was found for AMC to take a photo of Rslan taking a photo of the painted Omran, inside a very clean ambulance.
In 2014, AMC cheered Jabhat al Nusra murdering Syrian Arab Army soldiers. Jabhat al Nusra is on the US terror list.
Moreover, AMC put its logo onto a photo of a schoolyard that the terrorists had taken over. Instead of it being filled with kids playing during school breaks, it is filled with surface-to-surface missiles of slaughter.
AMC so supports stealing children's lives that it stole the above photograph from a terrorist operation in Homs, 2013, from a stolen schoolyard:
Who cares to know that organ trading is now part of the long list of crimes by the Oscar-winning White Helmets?
Certainly not western media that continues to lie against Syria.

A New York judge recently ruled that Fox Searchlight Pictures must pay two of its former “interns” for work they did on the set of the 2011 film “Black Swan” back wages for work that the interns didn't know that they were performing. Despite being told that they were interns, the two workers in question did all of the ordinary work that people are normally paid to do, and in fact they actually did so alongside other paid workers. The only difference between the “interns” and the paid staff was that the interns were told, and probably really thought, that they didn't need to be paid.
This case, Eric Glatt et. al v. Fox Searchlight Pictures, has enormous implications for businesses and for the thousands of Americans either in school, or just leaving school, who are applying to or currently participating in unpaid internships. Not because the case signals some radical new change in the law – the law has been remarkably consistent on unpaid internships for years – but because now people might actually start to know the law on unpaid internships.
Fox Searchlight Pictures' lawyers, just like the lawyers for the large companies that pull in thousands of unpaid interns every year, have to know the law on this one because the law is very plain: you must pay your workers. This is especially true in the private sector. The Fair Labor Standards Act, the flagship legislation in this field, only exempts very specific kinds of volunteer work for government, religious, and humanitarian agencies. The private sector has no such exemptions, and even those exemptions for charitable organizations are strictly defined. Otherwise, if somebody does work for you, you have to pay them.
So the question then becomes, what separates a “worker” from an “intern?” I'll give you a hint: it is not just the difference between being called an “intern” instead of a “worker.” The rule that employers do not get to unilaterally make legal determinations about your status as a worker is consistent across several aspects of the worker: your employer does not get to unilaterally decide if you are entitled to overtime pay or not, your employer does not get to unilaterally decide that you are an at-will employee, and your employer does not get to unilaterally decide that you do not need to be compensated for your work.
The Department of Labor has issued some extremely clear guidance on this matter, and looking back over my own past, the unpaid “internships” I've done, it becomes pretty clear that very few so-called private sector “internships” are anything but evasions of the obligation to pay workers for their time, intentional or otherwise. According to the Department of Labor, In order to actually qualify as an internship that doesn't need compensation, for the purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act:
1. The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment;
This means that the internship where you primarily get or make coffee, make photocopies, or do work like the paid office temp is doing, will likely not meet this criterion. Nobody takes classes in college on the Starbucks order.
2. The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern;
This sounds fairly easy qualification for the employer to meet, since it's rather broad. All that running to Starbucks is for the “benefit” of the employee, right? But this part of the test speaks to benefit in the sense that an education is for your benefit: you're putting work into it, and getting a benefit from it, with a direct proportion between them. Fact Sheet #71 contemplates an apprenticeship model for the unpaid internship: it is supposed to be like a classroom on the job. The harder you work at it, the more you get out of it, not the more your employer gets out of it.
3. The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff;
This speaks to the real policy agenda of Fact Sheet #71. You might have been jokingly referred to as “slave labor” when you worked your unpaid internship. That isn't far from the truth. The policy agenda behind Fact Sheet #71 is to forbid employers from depressing wages, sabotaging the employment rate, and hurting skilled workers by replacing them with students. The Department of Labor doesn't want your sincere desire to learn to take precedence over the life and livelihood of a skilled, experienced, paid worker, letting employers save on their labor costs at the expense of the entire rest of the economy.
4. The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded;
This is the one your unpaid internship is most likely to trip. Did your employer ever actually lose anything from your being an unpaid intern? Did they set aside space for you, or the time of a staffer, that cut into their operations? And while they were doing that, did they gain nothing – nothing from you?
There is some ambiguity in this part of the guidelines, though. Does it mean that the employer gains no advantage whatsoever – not even so much as getting a cup of coffee that your boss might have had to set aside time to go get herself? Or does it mean that the employer gains no advantage in net – your boss might have gotten their coffee, saving their five billable hours over the course of the summer, but they also spent ten billable hours teaching you about your area of study, and so, in net, they gained no immediate advantage? I don't know the answer to that question, but I think it likely that most unpaid internships are extremely lopsided one way or the other, either with the unpaid internship being little more than an employee in all but paycheck, or the internship being a genuinely student-like apprentice.
5. The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship;
This one is included to make the point that, if you have an on-the-job training period for wherever you end up working, you should get paid for that training period. Most of the time, what you call a learning period with a job guaranteed afterward is a “training period.” This is included in the fact sheet to prevent employers from getting to reduce their labor costs at the expense of trainees by calling them “interns,” consistent with the principle that employers do not have unilateral power to make legal determinations about their legal relations with and obligations to others. As an aside, there's an interesting economic incentive lurking behind the necessity that employees must be paid for on-the-job training: it incentivizes companies to seek out employees who are already trained or skilled, thereby encouraging workers to incur the costs of training on themselves by going to school and discouraging employers from bringing unskilled workers into the skilled labor force. Interesting, I suppose, but only relevant to you if your internship is in economics.
6. The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.
Your employer, of course, will always “understand” that the internship is not entitled to wages, but do you? Have you ever known someone who got hours or even days into an internship before asking when payday was, only to be “reminded” that the internship is unpaid? That person is illegally unpaid.
The main takeaway from the Fox Searchlight case is not a legal point, since the law is clear and consistent. Minimum wage and overtime laws make no allowance for unilateral determination by employers that their workers should be exempt from those laws. The proper unpaid internship follows is a hybrid apprenticeship/classroom model. The proper unpaid internship is not just training for an inevitable job. The internship should be fixed in duration, and done under the supervision of people who have something to teach you, not just staffers whose job and wages you undercut.
Rather, the takeaway is that interns have the same rights as any other workers, and the only thing between private sector wage violators and a torrent of lawsuits is knowledge. Knowledge you now have.

James O'Keefe Brings Their Dishonest, Doctored Videos To The World Of Political Campaigns October 6, 2014 1:11 PM EDT ››› Blog ›››››› OLIVER WILLIS
James O'Keefe has recently launched a political advocacy group, Project Veritas Action Fund, but journalists should be aware that O'Keefe has a long history of lies and deceptively edited videos filmed under false pretenses. Project Veritas Action Fund has so far released videos about Kentucky's U.S. Senate race and Texas' gubernatorial contest. O'Keefe's venture is a 501(c)(4) non-profit organization, which allows direct involvement in political campaigns. O'Keefe's existing group, Project Veritas, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, which is not allowed to be involved in political campaigning.
O'Keefe released a video that accused the progressive group Battleground Texas of using "potentially illegal methods to change elections" in their efforts to register voters before Texas' election this year. Special prosecutors in Texas were appointed to investigate O'Keefe's claims and they recommended the case be dismissed and criticized the Project Veritas video as "little more than a canard and political disinformation."
The group's latest video attacks Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes (D). Titled "The Lying Game," Project Veritas claims they went "undercover in multiple Grimes campaign offices to determine if their opposition to the core principles of their own political party is genuine or an intentional deception." But as Bloomberg's Dave Weigel explains, "There's no criminal activity alleged here. Instead, there's a succession of cheerful activists insisting that Grimes is on their side, and is participating in a 'lying game' when they say she'll fight for the coal industry."
This is a continuation of O'Keefe's deceptive video release strategy, which has often worked in concert with Fox News.
In a series of videos, O'Keefe targeted the low-income advocacy group ACORN. O'Keefe falsely claimed the videos showed a "nationwide ACORN child prostitution investigation" that implicated ACORN employees. But the videos were deceptive and heavily edited. Three separate investigations cleared employees of criminal wrongdoing and law enforcement officials called O'Keefe's videos a "highly selective editing of reality" from "partisan zealots." Despite this, the U.S. House voted to defund ACORN (and did so over a dozen more times) and the group was dissolved. A lawsuit from a former ACORN employee against O'Keefe for illegally taping a conversation at an ACORN office resulted in a $100,000 settlement.
O'Keefe was then arrested when they attempted to enter the New Orleans office of Sen. Mary Landrieu (D) in another attempted sting operation. They pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 100 hours of community service and a $1,500 fine.
Later in 2010, O'Keefe tried to lure then-CNN correspondent Abbie Boudreau onto a boat filled with sexually explicit props and record the encounter surreptitiously. The plan, described by O'Keefe as a "CNN Caper," was disrupted when an O'Keefe confidante warned off the reporter.
Attacking unions, an O'Keefe video purported to show union officials promising to "secure funding" for a company that did nothing but dig holes in the ground. But the unedited video actually showed that the officials were skeptical of the entire scheme.
O'Keefe was caught using two minutes out of a forty-five minute interview to falsely accuse a state office of assisting Medicaid fraud.
An O'Keefe video promoted by Fox News took an NPR executive out of context, leaving the impression that they had disparaged the tea party movement and said NPR was "better off" without federal funding. The full video showed that the Project Veritas video had been edited to leave a false impression, removing the context of the conversation.
In the midst of the 2012 presidential campaign, an O'Keefe video alleged voter fraud from the Obama re-election campaign, but the doctored videos failed to demonstrate any real criminal activity. Another election year video from Project Veritas said "we found ballots being offered out in the name of the dead" but the ballot in question in the unedited video was for someone who was actually alive. O'Keefe's organization released several more videos alleging voter fraud that year, but they were all based on false interpretations of voter ID laws.
An O'Keefe video accused Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) of "excluding whites" from protection under their proposal for a new Voting Rights Amendment Act, but this claim is a complete misreading of the bill, which would include all races in its protection of voting rights.
In concert with the release of their book, O'Keefe pushed a video that purported to show widespread problems with the federal Lifeline program, which provides phones to low-income Americans. However, the video was edited to make it appear as if government employees had encouraged illegal activity, and the raw video showed this was untrue.
In May, O'Keefe released a video called "Hollywood's War On U.S. Energy," which attempted to connect opposition to fracking to funding from Middle Eastern oil tycoons. The video chopped up dialogue to deceive viewers into believing environmental groups would accept oil industry money.
Earlier this year, O'Keefe dressed in an Osama Bin Laden costume and crossed the Rio Grande River in a ham-fisted attempt to prove that the southern U.S. border is insecure. The stunt was so outlandish that Fox's Eric Bolling said O'Keefe should "give it a rest." But they haven't. O'Keefe continues to produce videos that don't hold up under even light scrutiny, and now their pivot to more direct involvement in electoral campaigns should be a warning signal to reporters to be extremely skeptical of their claims.

Prophecy Experts Announce Dawn Of New Pumpkin Spice Dispensation
SAN ANTONIO, TX—A team of dispensational premillennialist prophecy experts has declared the official start of a previously unknown “pumpkin spice” dispensation, sources confirmed Thursday.
“The signs are clear that God's unfolding of Their redemptive plan has taken yet another detour,” prophecy teacher Hal Lindsey told reporters at a press conference announcing the new dispensation, accompanied by a new book to help Christians navigate the new prophetic era. “The days of the prophet Joel are upon us, complete with the signs of the times: UGG Boots, North Face jackets, and pumpkin spice lattes, candies, and baked goods.”
An excitable, animated Lindsey also reported that a strange shift in the heavenly signs has formed a giant pumpkin-shaped constellation in the sky, further confirming the dawn of a new dispensation.
“Previously, we believed there to be some twenty-seven different dispensations, but we're now pretty sure that it's going to be locked at twenty-eight,” they said.
According to the prophecy report released by the team of pastors and scholars, the majority of commentaries on Revelation will need to be rewritten as experts reinterpret the apocalyptic signs as a wide range of pumpkin spice themed products.
“While we once believed the locusts in Revelation 9 represented different kinds of helicopters or drones, we're now fairly certain that the insects are suburbanites descending upon Starbucks locations to consume pumpkin spice,” Lindsey continued.
At publishing time, prophecy experts had once again convened to reconsider their prophetic books, as rumors of apocalyptic signs in the form of peppermint mochas had taken premillennial scholars by storm.
HENRY COUNTY, Ga. -- A vicious attack in an elementary school bathroom sends a 6-year-old to the emergency room, and their parents tell police it was a fifth grade girl who attacked them
The girl was at home recovering Thursday night, but their mother says they know exactly who attacked their 1st grade daughter. They warned the school that the fifth grader was a danger last week.
Cheryl Tackett says they are trying to comfort their 6-year-old daughter Lanira, but they can hardly get the words out herself.
Photos after the attack
“I just started crying,” they said. “I couldn't do anything but cry.”
They say they couldn't keep it together when the school told them what happened.
“She was choking her, and banging their head viciously on the toilet, and covering their mouth,” they said.
They say it was a premeditated attack, and that the fifth grader knew exactly what they were doing.
The girl said they wanted to talk to my daughter,” Tackett said. “She pulled them into the bathroom and proceeded with the attack.”

When the first grader teacher was finally able to get into the bathroom, Lanira was lying bloodied on the floor.
“Her clothes were soaking wet,” Tackett said. “Her backpack was soaking wet.”
They say this was not a new situation. It didn't just start. Tackett says they told the school last week that the fifth grader had threatened Lanira on the bus and said they were going to beat them up – but they never thought it would get this bad.
“She goes to describe it, but they can't really finish because they cry,” Tackett said. “She's traumatized. They don't want to go in bathrooms by herself.”
Tackett says they just wants their daughter to feel safe.
“That's my baby,” they said. “Who would attack an innocent 6-year-old?”
The school district says they are aware of the incident, and they are investigating it, but they would not be able to say much more, as the case is ongoing, and it involves two minors.
Tackett says the fifth grader was charged in juvenile court on Thursday for the attack.
MOBILE, Alabama -- Mobile Mayor Sam Jones held an intruder at gunpoint Tuesday night until police arrived, after the Mississippi man broke into their garage, officials said.
James Harvey Wilkerson, 47, was arrested and charged with third-degree burglary and breaking and entering into a vehicle.
Wilkerson is from Moss Point, according to an address given by police.
Jones declined to comment on the event, and police declined to release the full report of the incident. Jones' spokesperson, Barbara Drummond, relayed their story as follows:
Jones left their house in Toulminville at about 9 p.m. to get some items from the grocery store. When they returned, they noticed that the nativity scene in their yard, which he'd taken care to unplug when they left, was lit up.
As they pulled into the driveway, they noticed that their truck had been tampered with and that their garage door had been opened.
They drew their .38-caliber pistol and advanced on the garage until they saw a man inside without a shirt.
The mayor asked them what they were doing. The man replied that “the Lord sent him.”
The man took steps toward him, Drummond said, and Jones told them not to come any further or they would be shot.
As the man came outside, Jones recognized Wilkerson. Moments before, as they drove to the store, Jones had seen the man walking down the street.
Jones called police, who arrived about seven minutes later.
During the interim, Jones asked the man if they knew whose house he'd been trying to break into. The man said they didn't.
Wilkerson later told police that they thought the house belonged to Jesus, said Cpl. Christopher Levy, a spokesperson.
Police arrested the man without incident and nobody was hurt, Levy said.
Injuries to Wilkerson's face, which left wounds visible in their jail mug shot, had been suffered before the alleged burglary, Levy said.
Wilkerson had recently left the University of South Alabama Medical Center and was still wearing the patient identification bracelet when police took them into custody, Levy said.
Drummond said that the man had gained entry into the garage via an electronic opener found in the truck, along with a set of keys, none of which corresponded to the door giving access to the interior of the home.
Wilkerson had apparently been trying to open a window from the garage to the interior of the house, as he'd torn open the screen, Drummond said.
Drummond said Wilkerson was compliant the entire time and at no time did Jones feel threatened.
Good parents know the importance of giving kids the freedom to find their own identities and then loving them regardless of who they are. I've never, ever pushed my 13-year-old son, Jacob, to be anyone he's not, because I know he's still discovering himself, and I'll tell you right now: if Jake were to approach me tomorrow and say he's transgender, you better believe I'd knock it right out of the park.
Now, I'm not saying I hope my kid feels any confusion with their gender identity, but if they were, by chance, to come out as trans, I'd totally nail it. I mean, I'd seriously clean up. I'm telling you that in just five minutes, my son would know exactly who's on their side, whom they can always turn to, who's their rock, and who's not just their father, but their best friend in the entire world.
Advertisement
Again, I'm not pushing my son in either direction—I mean, how could I? But let's say they were transgender…here's how I see it all going down. We've just finished dinner. It's my turn to do the dishes, so I'm at the sink. My son brings their plate from the table and with their eyes cast down, they say, “Dad, I think I'm actually a girl. I think I'm transgender.”
I'd totally nail it. I mean, I'd seriously clean up.
Now, this is where lesser parents might lose their cool, question their kid's decision, maybe even make it about themselves. I mean, who could blame 'em? That's a bombshell that'd be tough for anyone to hear, right?
Advertisement
Uh-uh. Not for me.
You see, that's exactly when this dad kicks things into high gear and unloads a goddamn Mack truck full of empathy. When it comes to dishing out unwavering love to their confused and vulnerable teen, I'm the real fucking deal.
Which is why, if and when Jake comes out, there'll be none of that nonplussed shock, none of that putting-my-hands-on-the-back-of-my-head-and-exhaling, not even the slightest balk at switching gender pronouns. I wouldn't miss a beat—I'd say to my wife, “Laura, get over here and listen up, because Jake has something they want to tell you.”
Advertisement
From there we'd be off to the races, just chucking the whole kitchen sink at these subtle, deep-seated issues Jake is facing and wiping the goddamn floor with them. Would we hire a therapist? Of course we would. Probably one of those who are simultaneously a role model and a trusted confidante, someone with whom our son can talk about anything. Two or three of those guys if necessary. We'd do it right.
Because when your child opens up about their or their true self, that's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and a parent should be there to provide a shoulder to cry on or a pedestal to stand on, whatever your child needs most.
Even if you find out they're cutting themselves. Man, I'd totally destroy if Jake was cutting himself.
Everybody talks about the weather. But now someone has subjected it to rigorous mathematical analysis to produce important conclusions about economic growth. Specifically Tatyana Deryugina and Solomon Hsiang find that hot days are bad for the economy — not just in poor countries with an overwhelmingly agricultural workforce, but in the United States of America. Here in the US, "productivity of individual days declines roughly 1.7% for each 1.8°F increase in temperature above 59°F." That means that "a weekday above 30°C (86°F) costs an average county $20 per person."
Temperature over the weekend has little impact on the economy, but on weekdays it's a big deal. Hot days kill growth both because of negative impacts on agriculture and because it seems that, despite air conditioning, people simply work less efficiently when it's hot. It sounds like a bit of a frivolous research topic, but it has broad implications for everything ranging from climate change to the macro-history of the world to housing policy to my classic debate with Vox editor-in-chief Ezra Klein about the merits of extreme cold versus extreme heat.
Hot weather is bad for the economy
The impact of a single hot day on a county's economy is rather small (if you're in to methodology, skip to the end). There are a lot of days in the year, and there's more to life than the weather. But the impact is clear and it is negative. The negative impact shows up if you look at the whole sample since 1970, and if you break the sample down into decade-long spans it is present in each and every decade. That's a decent indicator that the statistical analysis is robust. It also shows that the detrimental impact of hot weather has not been substantially altered by changes in the American economy over time.
And while any given hot day has a small impact, since hot days are reasonably common the aggregate impact of hot weather on the American economy is pretty big. They estimate that "if counties could choose daily temperatures to maximize output, rather than accepting their geographically determined endowment ... annual income growth would rise by 1.7 percentage points."
Over time that's quite a lot.
The significance of Deryugina & Hsiang's findings
This is important research across several dimensions:
Ezra Klein is wrong: Crucially, the researchers have debunked Klein's advocacy for super-hot days as superior to super-cold days. With the Northeast Corridor stuck in a hellish chill this week, it is critical to remember that things could be worse. Extreme cold is unpleasant, but as a society we can live through it and even thrive. Extreme heat saps our will to live in a more fundamental way, crushing the economy and driving long-term immiseration. Climate change is even scarier: Standard economic analyses of climate change generally assume large negative impacts on poor countries, whose economies have little ability to adapt to changes in weather patterns. They also assume rich countries could experience negative impacts related to flooding, hurricanes, and other disasters. But the finding that an increase in the number of random Tuesdays on which Chicago experiences weather in the 80s rather than the 70s indicates that climate change is even more alarming than previously thought. More hot weather — and not even crazy hot weather above 100°, just regular old hot days — turns out to be economically costly, even before considering secondary climate impacts. World history may be pretty simple: It's a well-known stylized fact that hot countries are poorer than cold ones. Europe is richer than Africa. Sweden is richer than Italy. Morocco and South Africa are richer than the Democratic Republic of Congo. Argentina is richer than Colombia. Simply attributing this pattern to the weather seems almost too silly. So scholars either generally assume complicated indirect impacts, through which climate alters institutional development (see, e.g., Acemoglu & Robinson) or attribute it to a giant coincidence. But maybe the basic hotness of hot countries really is holding them back.
America has troubling population trends: Because the coastal US lacks affordable housing due to restrictive zoning, and because people like to complain about cold weather, there is a strong trend in the United States for people to move to hot cities. The populations of the Texas Triangle metro areas and of sunbelt cities from Phoenix to Atlanta are growing quickly. Having people move to hot cities is similar in its economic impact to the country getting hotter — which is to say it's bad. Short of evangelizing for people to move to Minneapolis, it's hard to force people to avoid the sweltering, output-destroying temperatures of the sunbelt. But changes to zoning policy in temperate-to-cold metro areas where people do want to live (Bay Area, Seattle, Northeast Corridor) could do a lot to help.
Deryugina & Hsiang researched the impact of daily temperature
They took National Climatic Data Center temperature measurements and mapped them onto US counties, to create a huge database of county-level high and low temperatures.
We can't measure is the level of economic output on any given day. Instead they used Bureau of Economic Analysis data on yearly economic output for each county. Operating under the assumption that "annual income is a linear combination of many daily incomes that are similarly affected by temperature" they then do a statistical analysis to show how a county's annual income is impacted by the number of hot days it experiences over the course of a year.
The resulting analysis isn't just the naive observation that hotter counties are, on average, poorer than richer ones (though that is true). Instead, they have a regression analysis "augmented to account for autocorrelation, precipitation, lagged effects of weather, unobserved heterogeneity across counties, and non-linear time trends." Because there are a lot of counties in the United States the data is sufficiently rich to provide very suggestive information about the specific causal impact of hot weather on counties.
TV Reviews All of our TV reviews in one convenient place.
With only three episodes to go this season, it's surprising that it's taken as long as it has for Portlandia to return to the well of Toni and Candace. The owners of Women and Women First are the show's most iconic characters, and clearly the ones who Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein have the most fun writing for and performing. In their unique blend of repressed rage, high standards, and often contradictory motivations, they remain characters who are easy to set loose in a random situation and build from there. Last season's “The Story Of Toni And Candace” was a prime example of that, going back to the past to see how they fared in a past life as high-powered publishing executives.
Advertisement
“First Feminist City,” on the other hand, is an episode that's firmly centered in the pair's comfort zone—or at least it seems that way at first glance. Once again, Portland is being nationally recognized, this time for being the most feminist city in America, with such indicators as pink-colored police motorcycles, stores dubbed “FeminInn,” and 80 percent of catcalls followed by a sincere apology. For the first time in Portlandia history people are flooding the store, disproving Candace's son's claim that no one needs a vagina pillow, as they're coming from as far as Asia to spend $500 on one.
Yet despite what could be seen as validation of their message, Toni and Candace couldn't be more displeased at it. They amusingly find a way to be outraged on every level by the attention, ranging from indignation that their unique take on feminism is being devalued by this surface level popularity to a more practical complaint that they have work until mid-afternoon. The script cleverly keep them as both right and wrong on the topic, raising a legitimate complaint against what's happening and then undermining it with objections that are selfish or preposterous. (“This big green money is a big green penis! And it's not going to impregnate me with its ideas!”) We also get some welcome continuity with a reminder of the pyromaniac lurking beneath Candace's passive-aggressive exterior, as when they promise to pull out a gas can and set the money ablaze a can is within arm's reach of the cash register.
However, they spend as much time posing with the gas can as they do pouring the gas, adding an amusing twist to the story. Candace's appearance in “Breaking Up” reminded us that she's uniquely gifted at letting their high-minded ideals work in concert with their considerable ego, and the attention she's getting as an “celebrity feminist” is like catnip to them Them taking on an assistant makes for one of the episode's best running jokes, only heightening Toni's frustrations as Candace has someone new to reinforce their ideas and give valid scheduling reasons why they can't do things they don't really want to do. And when Toni refuses to bask in the newfound glory, they find a more receptive partner in guest star Kevin Corrigan (who despite their many credits will always be Community's Professor Professorson to me). A feminist tour guide who's been bringing their charges to Women & Women First, they take the suggestion to have their own feminist store and runs with it.

The commercial for Feminart puts Portlandia back in its comfort zone of absurd commercials, one that further heightens the episode's digs at people who think just saying things are feminist is good enough. “We've womanized everything from blenders to blankets to baseball bats!” Kevin excitedly proclaims, throwing around pink paint and the women symbol as if it's all they need to sell products. (And a year-round Halloween section, just for fun!) Yet in keeping with the general good nature of Portlandia, none of it comes across as malicious. The store isn't trying to subvert feminist ideals or even exploit them, it just cheerfully believes it's making a difference despite all evidence to the contrary.
All of that stands in contrast to Toni's speech when they storm Candace's “celebrity feminist” interview, screaming at the top of their lungs about how their worldview has been commodified right down to ready-to-wear costumes. It's an illustration of the “weirdos who care” argument Ben Wyatt made long ago on Parks And Recreation, and why Toni and Candace manage to stand above Armisen and Brownstein's other creations. The things Toni and Candace believe are extreme, narcissistic, and more than a little crazy, but there are good intentions buried within all of that craziness and they are completely genuine in their commitment to their beliefs. Even if, in Candace's case, said good intentions need to be run through their new assistant first.
And that commitment makes their efforts to destroy Feminart all the more enjoyable, now channeling the chaos that they tend to leave in their wake. The staff meeting after they manage to seed Feminart with their feminist sisters is a lively affair that feels like a particularly successful improv session, as if they were given the seed of pitching awful ideas for a feminist store and just followed it to a natural conclusion. It asks the truly important questions (“If they can't speak, does that make them not a feminist?”), touches on truths (“Sucking some D is pretty much universal”), and forces the logo to stand for so much to the point that it doesn't really stand for anything—other than maybe pizza. You wind up feeling sorry for poor Kevin and their tampon name tag by the end of it all, the business now run on Toni and Candace logic that takes the superficial into the incomprehensible.
Advertisement
In the end, it's a return to status quo. The nation's attention moves onto a new craze, Kevin goes back to the tour bus for a look at Portland strip clubs, and Toni and Candace are back in the customer-free quiet of their shop. While “First Feminist City” doesn't blaze any new ground to the same extent that “The Story Of Toni And Candace” did last year, it's a sturdy use of Portlandia's most reliable pairing that puts them through some tension, makes them work through it, gives them a win, and returns them to their comfort zone of over-steeped tea.
Stray observations:
This Week In Portland: A Toni and Candace story is always a good excuse to remind viewers that In Other Words, the actual feminist bookstore and community center that inspired Women And Women First, is a real non-profit that is always looking for support. Real life sadly does not imitate art, and since no one's giving them three grand for vagina pillows, you can do your part and send them a few dollars.

Sam Adams, former mayor of Portland and assistant to Mr. Mayor of Portlandia, makes a cameo appearance as one of the man on the street interviews.
More fun business wordplay following last week's vape shop discussion, as Candace is workshopping names for their line of vests. “Invested” or “Vestibule” are early front-runners.
Toni has two—two!—tattoos of Audre Lorde.
“Do you even know what a cervix is?” “I just had one tattooed on my backside.”
“We're not selling things at the not-for-profit bookstore!”
“Maybe you can pass the gas can just like it was the torch of feminism.”
“How does the unborn child get nourished on cashews and soy alone?!”
“Are we going to go into any of these clubs?” “It's strictly an architectural tour.”

While The Collector is active, once per turn, you may pay the Purchase Cost of target unpurchased character die minus 2 (to a minimum of 1). If you do, field that character die at level 1. Return that die to its owner's card at end of turn or when it leaves the Field Zone.
Works great if you draft a good “when fielded” ability that you want to trigger every turn
Top Support
Adam Warlock: The Being Known as Him 5
While Adam Warlock is active, your character's die's “When fielded” effects trigger twice.
Use with common Mantis, SR Norman Osborn, UC Yondu or other good “when fielded” abilities
Black Widow: Red Scare 3
Call Out (When this character die attacks, target character die is the only character die that may block this character die.)
This can be a good way to KO an opposing character that is hurting your team
Mantis: Celestial Madonna 3
When fielded, draw a die from your bag and add it to your Prep Area.
One of the only ways to get ramp in set
Nova Corps Uniform: One Mind, One Purpose 2
When fielded, equip to a character. That die gets +2A and +2D. If that character die leaves the Field Zone, send this die to the Used Pile.
Great way to keep a good character buffed, or to continually buff something after attacking
S.W.O.R.D. Agent: Eyes Beyond Earth 2
Ally – S.W.O.R.D. Agent gets +1D for every Sidekick die in either player's Field Zone
If you need a good blocker or two, this is a cheap way if paired with sidekicks
Rocket Raccoon: Rigging Up Destruction 3
When Rocket Raccoon is KO'd, deal their A to target character die.
This can be a good way to KO an opposing character that is hurting your team
The Spot: Portal Jumper 2
While The Spot is active, whenever you draw and roll a die outside your Clear and Draw Step (excluding dice drawn from The Spot's ability), draw and roll an extra die.
Pair with Superhero Registration Act or Relaxing for some extra dice to ramp and churn
Cosmo Space Dog: Bozhe Moi! Security Alert! 2
If Cosmo, Space Dog is KO'd while blocking, unblocked attacking character dice deal no more than 2 damage this turn.
Cheap option that can allow you to get big attackers through for a fraction of their value
Knowhere: History Shrouded in Mystery 3
You may swap any character die in your Used Pile or Field Zone for an unpurchased character costing 1 more (return the swapped die to its card). Character dice swapped in the Field Zone stay on the same level.
Perfect pair if you pull a “What if” SR, or want to continually upgrade to a higher cost character

After being hospitalized last month for reported exhaustion, Kanye West returned home in late November , their condition improving as they rest. In an altogether unsurprising but nonetheless encouraging turn of events, TMZ is now reporting that West has begun to record music as part of their rehabilitation and recovery process.
Sources close to the artist say that since returning home, West has been more relaxed and focused. They have reportedly built a temporary studio in their Bel-Air home to work on new music.
After releasing The Life of Pablo in February, Kanye quickly announced their intentions to release a follow-up album titled Turbo Grafx 16 . In May, Quavo posted a photo of himself, West, Big Sean, Lil Yachty, Vic Mensa and the rest of the Migos to Instagram, simply writing "TURBO." Then there is the G.O.O.D. Music group album, Cruel Winter , for which "Champions" was supposed to be the lead single. This is all to say, should Kanye seek works in progress during their recovery, they have them by the pair.
Upon their hospitalization, word broke that Kanye r equested studio equipment in their room so they could record in bed. As J. Cole potentially suggested on their new song "False Prophets," Kanye may have strayed from some of the principles that first endeared them to fans, though throughout their life, tragedy, from personal loss to injury, has been a massive creative influence. We'll have to wait and see what's to come from Kanye moving forward.

A standard Grixis Control deck that I have been working on. This deck has the ability to answer many diverse threats in the current meta with a powerful set of removal, counters, walkers, and efficient creatures making the deck one to be reckoned with. I am open to any input or constructive criticism you may have, I am also willing to answer any questions on the decisions I have made with this deck.
Control Package
Dissolve: Standard counter spell with the ability to fix your next draw. A very solid card and a must-have in any form of standard control deck.
Psychic Strike: Another counter spell. The added mill is fantastic, especially with all the scry in the format. The 1ub mana cost can lead to a surprise counter if you tap your mana right.
Dreadbore: Unconditional removal that can also destroy planeswalkers!
Mizzium Mortars: Hits threats like Loxodon Smiter and a great answer to Blood Baron of Vizkopa. Also has the potential to wipe the board late game.
Ultimate Price: Standard instant speed removal. Great against devotion decks.
Doom Blade: Hits almost every threat that Ultimate Price misses. The 2-2 split is great.
Anger of the Gods: Absolutely wrecks aggro decks. And fucks Voice of Resurgence, strung together Burning-Tree Emissarys and Chandra's Phoenix.
Pilfered Plans: One of my favorite cards in the deck! Generates card advantage and smooths out my draws while destroying my opponents deck. Play after a opponent keeps on a scry for the best results.
Opportunity: Grixis does not have access to Sphinx's Revelation and this is the closest thing that we got. This card is great.
Rakdos's Return: This card can steal games. One of my favorite cards in standard.
Planeswalkers
Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver: Relevant in every mach up. Can nab threats/blockers from aggro or mid-range decks and must be answered in the control match up before he/she gets to ult. Has great synergy with Jace, Memory Adept as a secondary win con.
Jace, Architect of Thought: I've heard that drawing cards is good. Stringing together Jaces is one of the most satisfying things that I have ever done in Magic.
Jace, Memory Adept: Every strong win con/card draw engine.
Creatures
Frostburn Weird: A two drop wall that can also become a beat stick when needed. Survives the anger of the gods and continues to bring the beats. So much versatility in a nice little 2 drop package.
AEtherling: The go-to win con for any control deck.
Main board VIPs
Anger of the Gods, Frostburn Weird, Jace, Architect of Thought, Pilfered Plans, Psychic Strike, Dreadbore, AEtherling
Side Board
Anger of the Gods: For those aggro decks. When I really need a turn 3 or 4 board wipe in order to win.
Gainsay: For the control match up or that mono blue devotion.
Hero's Downfall: For mid-rage decks or to swap with either Doom Blade or Ultimate Price depending on the match up.
Negate: For control or walkers.
Nightveil Specter: Cause it destroys esper, mono blue, and mono black all on a nice 2/3 flyer. Can also be pulled in against aggro if I need another body to block.
Thoughtseize: For mid-range or control.
Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver: Bring in with anything that uses a lot of good creatures.
Side Bard MVP's
Nightveil Specter, Gainsay, Thoughtseize
Thank you for looking! Please +1 if you like the deck and let me know what you think!
The Sahara India Pariwar's founder and chairperson Subrata Roy has been in jail since March 2014 due to a long-running investor fraud case back in India.
In order to raise money that must be repaid to investors, the company approached the Supreme Court of India to sell assets - including its F1 stake, along with several hotels and four of its aircraft.
The total value to be raised by the sale of the F1 shares, hotels, and aircraft is approx $441 million or Rs. 3,000 crores.
Sahara had purchased 42.5 percent of shares in Force India back in 2011, worth $100 million, with team principal Vijay Mallya owning 42.5 percent and the Mol family keeping the remaining 15 percent.
Last year, the Sahara branding was often replaced by Telcel and Claro branding on the side of the car.
Should Sahara sell its stake, the Silverstone-based team could undergo a change in name for 2016.
As part of my recap of 2015 and looking forward to 2016, some of the creators that I have gotten to know over the past few years were kind enough to take some time to send some thoughts about the past year and what they have planned for 2016:

Convergence: Justice League International (2015)
How has the comics industry fared in 2015 and thoughts on 2016?
RM: I feel like the industry is in a better place than it's been in a long while. Obviously, sales can always be better. Marvel and DC still rule the roost in terms of shelf space. But I feel like the range of material that the industry is putting out, and the diversity of creators producing work, is better than it's ever been. There are more different kinds of books, for more different kinds of readers, than ever before. That can only be good.
Professionally what was the highlight of 2015?
I don't know if one thing stands out above others. I mean, I write comic books for a living. That's all the highlight I need right there. I got to work on projects I enjoyed, like “John Carter: Warlord of Mars” and “Skylanders” and “The Protectors.” I got to work with a bunch of creators whose work I really admire. Picking any one thing would be a disservice to the others.
Any news or teasers as to plans for 2016 project and convention wise?
Some interesting things on the horizon — new ventures, new projects, as well as some projects I've already been working on finally seeing the light of day, both in the U.S. and abroad. But none of it is ready to be announced yet. So I guess I have to just say “stay tuned,” there should be news over the next few months. As far as conventions, I'll be doing Albany Con again, of course, and I'm figuring out the rest of my schedule. Some of the asupervisorstioned new projects will demand some convention appearances, so I expect to be doing a fair number of shows this year.

How has the comics industry fared in 2015 and thoughts on 2016
The Industry has evolved! We made great strides for putting new faces in comics, both on the page and behind the page. And it has been sorely needed! More people got the representation they deserve in 2015, but there is still a lot of work to do. I'm optimistic for the time when diversity is not a buzzword by the standard, where the world on the page is as varied as the world outside our door, and it is so normal a thing that it isn't news. And that's where we're going in 2016 and beyond – having the types of heroes we see in comics evolve, and with them the stories and communities they impact. Everyone deserves to be mythic, to be iconic, and we are going to keep working to make that a reality.
Professionally what was the highlight of 2015?
For me, unquestionably it was the launch of MIDNIGHTER in June – the culmination of sixteen years of work, and a book featuring a historic character that influenced me as a kid. To be able to bring them to a new generation is an honor, and easily the most exciting moment of the year.
Any news or teasers as to plans for 2016 project and convention wise?
Yeah! There is more Batman and Robin Eternal to come, as well as Bulk and Skull, a series of back-ups stories in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers from BOOM! Studios! As the year goes on, we should see some more announcements as well, with some new creator owned work and more characters I've been waiting my whole life to work with.

HEADLOCKED
Coming off a strong 2014, we knew we were going to have to work really hard to make 2015 even bigger. It took a herculean effort by everyone but 2015 was, by far, our biggest year yet!
First and foremost, the biggest news for us was the release of Headlocked: The Last Territory Volume 2, which we managed to finish right at the end of the year. The book features a painted cover by WWE Hall of Famer, Jerry “The King” Lawler, that is easily their finest work to date. The book also contains contributions from wrestling/comic heavyweights, Booker T, Jill Thompson, John Morrison, Jamal Igle, AJ Styles, and Ramon Villalobos.
This year also saw Headlocked's most ambitious travel & convention schedule to date with nearly non-stop appearances from May to December. We appeared at conventions in Miami, Chicago, Kansas City, Uncasville, Providence, Knoxville, San Diego, Stockton, San Antonio, New York City as well as independent wrestling shows in ten different states.
Because of our relentless travel schedule, we began to slowly raise the awareness of the Headlocked name. We received opportunities to appear on some more prominent podcasts including, The Kevin Gill Show, War Rocket Ajax, and the Sam Roberts Show. We were featured prominently on WWE's Culture Shock and also streamed live on Marvel TV. We also had very successful panels at Planet Comic Con, SDCC, Florida Supercon, & NYCC!
What's in store for 2016?
We're kicking it off in Miami at Magic City Comic Con in January and following it up with an even bigger convention touring schedule. Keep an eye out for our next Kickstarter in March 2016. We've also secured our biggest lineup of celebrity wrestler contributors for the next edition of Headlocked…it's going to blow people's minds!

How has the comics industry fared in 2015 and thoughts on 2016
For 2015 the comics industry had some ups and downs. We saw the big two ( Marvel Comics, DC Comics) focus on… event story lines with many ending with not so stellar results. IE: Marvel's Secret Wars and DC's Convergence. We saw Marvel start all it's major titles at Number 1 issues yet again. Good or bad depending on how you look at it. DC moved its base to Burbank to get closer to Hollywood, which was a cause of some rushed-looking art, story lines and missing deadlines.
With these problems, there has been a shift in the Force to the “Indie” comic. Each month we see Image Comics taking a bigger slice of the sales pie. Also Dark Horse, Valiant, IDW have seen some minor increases in sales. Even the self publisher has seen more exposure. Maybe people are tired of the same spandex wearing superhero and want some new fresh heroes and characters to get into.
We also saw a flood of NEW series coming out from both camps like DC's Midnighter, Images We Stand On Guard, Marvel's Doctor Strange, Boom's Klause and Marvel's many Star Wars titles. That was a big get for them, and they did better than a lot of their staple series… Who will make the cut for 2016?
With the increased insurgence of more “comic book” movies hitting the big and small screen, you would think that would bring on more new comers to the local shops but sadly it did not but did get more of the general public aware of our universe of capes and cowls. Time will tell in 2016 if this will reflect into more sales at the local shop level.
Professionally what was the highlight of 2015?
For us 2015 was another banner year for FanboysInc. We increased our con presence as press and featured guests this year. with our reach extending into the Mid Western con scene. With that we were able to meet many awesome creators within the industry and honored to say that many are now friends. Our staff grew with two new additions, Jeff Ayers and Buddy Beaudoin to our comics review section.
Our network grew with the addition to 3 new podcasts, DW and Incredible Jeff Show, Popping the Cherrywood and AMC's Comic Book Men, Ming Chen and Michael Zapic with their Ming and Mike show.
But have to say the highlight for me was us teaming up with Death Wish Coffee. They became our major sponsor for the network midway into 2015 and it has been an awesome working relationship. They took a chance with us and it has been nothing but thumbs up for us both. We got to introduce them the “comic con” culture with us bringing them to NYCC15 as we both became sponsors of writer's Amy Chu's NYCC panel called comic creators who consume coffee.
Any news or teasers as to plans for 2016 project and convention wise?
In 2016 we plan on adding at least 2 more shows to our podcast network, which would give us 7 podcasts overall. Also we will be working with someone from Kevin Smith's camp to get into the youtube game with weekly episodes and also revisit a web series we have been working on for some time but with their help we hope to bring this to a computer screen near you with in the new year. Plus growing our relationship with Death Wish Coffee with some projects we yet can't talk about so stay tuned!

How has the comics industry fared in 2015 and thoughts on 2016
Sunshine & Rain. Have you ever woken up one morning and watched the sun rise on the horizon while it was still raining where you were? Well, that's how I'd describe the comics industry of 2015 with that analogy. There are dark clouds hovering over, there are reboots happening, “worlds are changing” (or so they say), and all this mumbo jumbo of the same things rehashed over and over and over again. Look, I love this stuff, I'm as big a fan of mainstream comics as the person with a pull list in the hundreds of $ each week, but I obviously see something that most people aren't talking about. There is a lack of creative freedom and ability to tell stories with enough creative liberties that puts a new take on something old and tired. While there will always be great content that springs up every now and then, I think the entertainment industry, not just comics, but entertainment in general, has a long long way to go to get back to its former glory. I mentioned that the Sun is rising in the near distance, I truly believe that with companies like Golden Bell, we as creators & businesspeople have an ability to create a dynamic change in the comics industry that can transcend boundaries put in place by companies that constantly restrict progress in terms of the diversification of content. With 2016 around the corner, technically it's already here, we are going to make strides and show people that leaps and bounds of progress can be made within a short time. I'm constantly asked how we've done so much in just a few short months, and I always answer that it's about devotion, discipline, feasibility and great time management. Working 100+ hour weeks is really a critical and key component to what we do. Rachel, Rob and myself each
Rachel, Rob and myself each are putting in those hours and it's as if we are getting quadruple the amount of work any one person can do alone by themselves. I believe that a team, a strong partnership is one of
the biggest components to making a succesful venture. Many people try to do things alone, they try to be the artist, writer, manager, marketer, distributor, and everything in between. Thats the wrong way to do something in this industry, it's a collaborative medium and as soon as someone accepts that reality they'll see how amazing it is to work with other like minded individuals. Do any of the larger companies do things with one person? No way! Each book has almost a dozen people on it alone, each book in and of itself is a business. In 2016, the strides we've made and the foundations we've set up for the future are going to grow and expand into the public consciosuness. We're working collaboratively with dozens of creators and already 300+ creators are part of our first project, The Sunday Comics. There's a bright future in our sights, and the rear view mirror shows those dark clouds from this morning. There's a lot of work to do but if anyone's going to devote years of their life to bettering the medium and making advancements in this industry, I can assure you it'll be Golden Bell!
There's a lot of work to do but if anyone's going to devote years of their life to bettering the medium and making advancements in this industry, I can assure you it'll be Golden Bell!
Professionally what was the highlight of 2015?
The highlight? Do I have to choose one? Oh boy…that's a tough one. I guess if I really had to pick one it would be forming a company with the best partners I could ask for. Rachel's been by my side with this from the get go between transferring schools around the country and being open to any new ideas she's been amazing. Then Rob came in the picture and we all started this amazing venture together. It would be crazy not to say that top highlights included starting The Sunday Comics and getting to meet and/or collaborate with some of my childhood idols. It's really insane to think how just a year ago no one in the industry knew my name at all, while most still don't yet, it's so cool to be able to call up some of my heroes growing up that worked on Disney movies, DC/Marvel comics, and independent works that we all know and love. Everyday in all honesty is a highlight, getting to do what I love and create not only new original content but a business that will thrive is what gets me up and keeps me going all day and all night, couldn't imagine doing anything other than what I'm doing right now. It's a surprise every night!
Any news or teasers as to plans for 2016 project and convention wise?
I'll give the whole scoop. While we have The Sunday Comics IndieGoGo running right now for those that missed the Kickstarter, we have a lot of new projects in the works. Next month we'll be debuting one of our first children's books, followed by the unveiling over the course of the next few months of several different interconnected universes with creative teams in the dozens. We've been building universe after universe, acting as architects, storytellers, artists, you name it really, on everything imaginable. When I say there is going to be something for everyone, I mean it! Like cartoons? Stay tuned. Animation? Comics? Every month. Novels? You'll never get bored. Short stories? Poems? Anthologies? Games? Live action movies? I can guarantee that sticking with us over our lifetime will have a huge payoff. While we're starting small, inching our way towards the grand vision, every step of the way is paved with fun & entertainment. Whether you're in America or across the narrow sea, we're going to bring something to everyone that will touch their hearts and minds just as some of the greatest storytellers of yesteryear. There's no one I know better than the hundreds of collaborators here at Golden Bell that are going to help make this dream a reality! Come check us out, you'll be hooked on Gold in no time! Don't forget to keep your eyes peeled because we've been invited to dozens of comic cons and will be making many guest appearances across the United States this comic con season!

Thanks again to everyone above for taking the time…
I get my home internet through a hotspot, which is limited to 10 devices and has a horrific wireless range. To bypass these limitations, I am using a laptop running Ubuntu connected to a wireless router.
Set-Up is this:
Hotspot --> Ubuntu Machine (wifi) --> Shared Internet over Ethernet --> Wi-Fi Router --> Rest of devices in the house. Essentially, the Ubuntu machine is acting as a modem and feeding internet to the router.
This is being working great, other than the router telling me it is experiencing a double NAT. I've ignored the issue yet far and no problems have arisen.
The problem I cannot figure out is that the Ubuntu machine is not visible on the whole house Wi-Fi. I am also using the Ubuntu Machine as an AirPrint server for my iDevices, and the only way I can connect to that server is by connecting to the hotspot. Is there something in Ubuntu I am missing that will allow the machine to not only act as a modem but simultaneously as a machine on the network?
Thanks!
Bonus points if you can fix the NAT issue too :)
Donald Trump said Tuesday that they had no regrets about taking on the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq, sticking with their case that the father “viciously” attacked them in a speech at the Democratic convention.
“I said nice things about the son, and I feel that very strongly,” the Republican presidential nominee told Sinclair Broadcast Group in an interview. “But of course, I was hit very hard from the stage, and you know it's just one of those things. But no, I don't regret anything.”
Democrats and Republicans alike have roundly condemned Trump for criticizing Khizr Khan for their appearance last week alongside their wife, Ghazala, at the Democratic gathering in Philadelphia. Trump had speculated that aides to Hillary Clinton wrote Khan's emotionally charged remarks and that their wife kept quiet because they aren't allowed to speak.
Gun Owners Also Support Most Regulations
(Long Island, NY) New Yorkers Against Gun Violence (NYAGV) today announced that a statewide poll of New York voter attitudes about gun safety reveals robust support across the state for strong gun safety laws. The poll, commissioned by NYAGV and conducted independently in April by Kiley & Company, an independent opinion research firm, found that gun regulations are popular with voters throughout the state and across demographic groups, including gun owners and upstate residents.
The Kiley & Company phone survey questioned 604 registered voters in New York State between April 14 and 16. The survey data was statistically adjusted by age, region and race to ensure representativeness.
“This survey unequivocally confirms that New Yorkers strongly support common sense gun laws,” said Leah Gunn Barrett, NYAGV Executive Director. “And of particular significance, it shows that most New York gun owners are reasonable and responsible and don't share the extremist attitudes of the gun lobby,” they added.
Clear Voter Acceptance of Gun Regulations
A majority of New York voters consider gun crime to be a serious problem and favor a broad range of measures to protect the public from gun-related injuries and death.
A majority of voters (61%) believes the problem of gun violence and gun crime is serious.
Almost two-out-of-three voters (64%) believe that the easy availability of guns in the U.S. is why our country has high gun death rates.
Three-out-of-four voters (75%) and 67% of gun owners believe the public has a right to set reasonable regulations on gun ownership and gun use.
Close to 2/3 of voters (64%) believe strengthening the state's gun laws will improve public safety.
Strong Support for New Gun Safety Proposals
Widespread majorities of voters favor all seven pieces of proposed gun safety legislation tested, including the safe storage of firearms, the surrender of firearms by domestic abusers, and enhanced inspections of gun dealers.
An overwhelming majority of voters (91%) and 77% of gun owners support a law requiring gun owners to safely store their guns to prevent children from accessing them.
More than three-out-of-four voters (78%) and 67% of gun owners support the surrender of guns by those convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
Over 2/3 of voters (70%) and 61% of gun owners support authorizing the New York State Police to conduct inspections of firearm dealers, to supplement infrequent federal inspections.
An overwhelming majority of voters (87%) and 71% of gun owners support requiring the microstamping of guns sold in New York State to help law enforcement trace weapons used in crimes.
Two-thirds of voters (67%) support the banning of .50 caliber sniper rifles, which can penetrate light armored vehicles and taxiing airplanes; and 64% of voters support limiting New Yorkers to one gun purchase per month. Only a minority of gun owners, 48% and 38% respectively, support these measures.
More than half of the voters (53%) say they'd be more inclined to re-elect their state legislator if that person voted in favor of stronger gun laws.
The New York State Legislature is currently considering legislation on gun safety measures including safe gun storage (Nicholas's Law, A.53/S.2291), keeping guns from domestic abusers (A.5257 and A.249), and mandating additional inspections of the nearly 2,000 New York federally licensed firearm dealers (A.2217/S.1302).
Pollster Matthew Shelter of Kiley & Company commented, “I think the voters of the state are sending a clear message to their elected representatives– that it is not only gun owners who have rights, but the public as a whole also has rights, and one of those rights is to be protected from gun crime and gun violence. If their own state legislators won't support reasonable safeguards on firearms, a majority of voters say they are inclined to take action at the ballot box.”
“New Yorkers Against Gun Violence urges state policymakers to pass common sense bills, such as Nicholas's Law for safe storage, proposals to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, and measures that give law enforcement the tools they need to reduce gun crime. This poll is proof positive that these measures are incredibly popular with our residents and that voters are demanding a safer New York from their legislators,” said Barrett.

New Yorkers Against Gun Violence is a statewide advocacy group working to reduce gun violence through advocacy and education designed to encourage action, influence public opinion and lead to policy change. With a primary focus on New York State, the organization also advocates at the local and national levels for sensible gun laws, policies and practices that protect New York State residents from gun violence.
Henry David Thoreau's Civil Disobedience is one of the most influential works of American philosophy, but is more often misunderstood than understood.
Martin Luther King, Jr. called it their “first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance,” and wrote: “The teachings of Thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement.” Gandhi developed satyagraha under its influence, and said the essay was “written for all time. Its incisive logic is unanswerable.”
Although the essay has strongly influenced the tradition of nonviolent direct action, Thoreau wrote it, in part, to distinguish their motives from those of firmly nonviolent resisters.
American pacifists at the time called themselves “non-resistants” because most based their pacifism on Jesus's instruction to “resist not evil” but instead to turn the other cheek. During Thoreau's lifetime, Civil Disobedience was published as “Resistance to Civil Government.” The title indicated Thoreau's challenge to “non-resistance” theory.
A later reprint changed the title to “Civil Disobedience,” which made “civil” ambiguous — did it mean disobedience to civil authorities (as in the original title), or disobedience conducted in a civil manner? This, and the influence the essay had on nonviolent resistance leaders like Gandhi and King, causes many to mistake Thoreau for a pacifist and their essay as a manifesto of nonviolent resistance.
Thoreau's actual views on war and pacifism show a remarkable evolution, and present a challenge to pacifists that is as relevant today as it was in the turbulent years preceding the Civil War when Thoreau was writing.
When Thoreau was in their early twenties they began writing a journal. Some of their earliest mentions of war show them fawning over soldiers during their annual drills, and holding romantic ideas that betray that most of what they knew of war came from the Greek classics.
War, to him, was “heartiness and activity,” while peace was “insincerity and sloth.” “I have a deep sympathy with war,” they wrote, “it so apes the gait and bearing of the soul.” “Every man is a warrior when they aspire.” “The whole course of our lives should be analogous to one day of the soldier's.”
Peace they considered to be an ideal only for “puny men, afraid of war's alarms.”
In the 1840s, Thoreau's attitude matured. They stopped paying the poll tax, in what they later explained was a protest against a government that enforced slavery and that invaded Mexico in order to extend slaveholder territory. Around the time they spent a night in jail for refusing to pay their taxes, Thoreau wrote:
There probably never were worse crimes committed since time began than in the present Mexican war… yet I have not learned the name or residence, and probably never should, of the reckless villain who should father them… [T]he villainy is in the readiness with which men, doing outrage to their proper natures, lend themselves to perform the office of inferior & brutal ones.… Any can command them who doth not command himself.
In this journal entry is the seed that would grow into Civil Disobedience .
In the years before Thoreau began resisting the poll tax, Massachusetts transcendentalists Bronson Alcott and Charles Lane were jailed for refusing to pay their taxes, in acts they justified as pacifist “non-resistance.” Thoreau followed their practice, but with a different theory, and their essay distinguished their tax resistance from theirs.
While the non-resistants based their practice on Jesus's Sermon on the Mount and relied on a faith in the power of nonviolence, Thoreau's argument was secular and applied equally to violent or nonviolent techniques.
But though they were distancing themselves from pacifists, Thoreau was becoming increasingly cynical about war and soldiers. “Read the Englishman's history of the French and Indian wars,” they wrote in their journal, “and then read the Frenchman's, and see how each awards the meed of glory to the other's monsters of cruelty or perfidy.” A few days later they took up their own challenge, and found it was just as they anticipated: The histories were irreconcilable — the savage brutes of one were the chivalric heroes of the other.
One day they observed a battle between two ant hives and wrote:
I should not wonder if they had their respective musical bands stationed on some chip and playing their national airs the while to cheer the dying combatants… I was myself excited somewhat, even as if they had been men. The more you think of it, the less the difference. And certainly there is no other fight recorded in Concord that will bear a moment's comparison with this.
To the extent that American patriotism is a religion, this is high blasphemy. “The Shot Heard 'Round the World” that began the American Revolution was fired at Concord, and every Concord child, Thoreau included, was brought up to revere the heroes of that battle. But:
I have no doubt [the ants] had as just a cause, one or even both parties, as our forefathers, and that the results will be as important and memorable. And there was far more patriotism and heroism.… I have no doubt it was a principle they fought for as much as our ancestors, and not a threepenny tax on their tea.
Thoreau had no respect for soldiers who fought not for a principle but as a career. When the militia of Massachusetts, a “free state,” cooperated with the Fugitive Slave Law to send Anthony Burns back into slavery in Virginia in 1854, Thoreau's contempt for the government's soldiers grew: “While the whole military force of the State, if need be, is at the service of a slaveholder to enable them to carry back a slave, not a soldier is offered to save a citizen of Massachusetts from being kidnapped.… The marines and the militia whose bodies were used lately were not men of sense nor of principle; in a high moral sense they were not men at all.”
“The papers are talking about the prospect of war between England & America. Neither side sees how its country can avoid a long & fratricidal war without sacrificing its honor. Both nations are ready to take a desperate step, to forget the interests of civilization & christianity & their commercial prosperity, & fly at each other's throats. When I see an individual thus beside himself, thus desperate, ready to shoot or be shot, like a blackleg who has little to lose, no serene aims to accomplish, I think they are a candidate for bedlam. What asylum is there for nations to go to? “Nations are thus ready to talk of wars & challenge one another (will it not be thought disrepu­table at length, as duelling between individuals now is?), because they are made up to such an extent of poor, low-spirited, despairing men, in whose eyes the chance of shooting somebody else without being shot themselves exceeds their actual good fortune. Who in fact will be the first to enlist but the most desperate class — they who have lost all hope — & they may at last infect the rest.” —Thoreau's Journal, 27 February 1856
The mid-1850s was the closest Thoreau approached to pacifism. He'd given up hope of finding heroes among the government's uniformed “powder monkeys” and they felt that nations going to war were exhibiting something akin to insanity on a national scale. Might not war come to be thought of as a shameful relic of barbaric times, they wondered, “as duelling between individuals now is?”
But the most interesting evolution in Thoreau's views on violence and nonviolence — and their most severe challenge to pacifism — was yet to come.
In 1859 , John Brown led a raid on the Harpers Ferry armory, hoping to distribute the arms captured there in order to start a slave uprising. The planned insurrection was crushed by government forces, and Brown was captured, tried, and executed.
Abolitionist leaders distanced themselves from Brown, many citing nonviolent principles. Horace Greeley, writing for the New York Tribune , an organ of the newly-formed, abolitionist Republican Party, wrote that “the way to universal emancipation lies not through insurrection, civil war, and bloodshed, but through peace, discussion, and quiet diffusion of sentiments of humanity and justice.”
Thoreau was furious at this timidity, and took the lead in defending Brown, calling out these abolitionists for defending a “peace” that was no peace at all:
It galls me to listen to the remarks of craven-hearted neighbors who speak disparagingly of Brown because they resorted to violence… They preserve the so-called peace of their community by deeds of petty violence every day. Look at the police officer's billy & handcuffs! Look at the jail! Look at the gallows!…
If the government is enforcing injustice by force, then to cry “peace!” when someone tries to violently resist is not to side with peace, but to side with one variety of violence over another: to side with the victors over the vanquished. Thoreau asked those who pleaded for calm: “What is the character of that calm which follows when the law and the slaveholder prevail?”
The slave-ship is on their way, crowded with its dying hundreds; a small crew of slaveholders is smothering 4 millions under the hatches; & yet the politician asserts that the only proper way by which deliverance is to be obtained is by “the quiet diffusion of sentiments of humanity,” without any “outbreak”! And in the same breath they tell us that all is quiet now at Harper's Ferry. What is that that I hear cast overboard? The bodies of the dead, who have found deliverance. That is the way we are diffusing humanity, & all its sentiments with it.
To truly side with peace you must renounce allegiance to the violent status quo — only then have you earned the right to criticize violent rebellion. This means not relying on those violent means like “the police officer's billy & handcuffs” that maintain the government and enforce the legal privileges of its citizens.
Thoreau did renounce their government and its “protection.” They endeavored to eliminate their complicity with the violent status quo, and so they earned the right to criticize violent rebellion. But they would not do so: “I do not complain of any tactics that are effective of good,” they wrote, “whether one wields the quill or the sword, but I shall not think them mistaken who quickest succeeds to liberate the slave. I will judge of the tactics by the fruits.”
Thoreau challenged the pacifists of their time to make sure their non-resistance was not a disguised collaboration with violence, and also to make their action effective so that it would most quickly succeed to end injustice. These challenges still stand.
Bertha restarted Tuesday after just a six-day shutdown, as inspectors found little or no erosion in the cutting bits.
In a positive surprise, tunnel-boring machine Bertha restarted Tuesday after a six-day maintenance shutdown — instead of the few weeks officials expected.
Workers who examined part of the round cutting face found little or no erosion. That led Seattle Tunnel Partners (STP) to conclude the 700-plus scraping bits were in good condition along the entire 57-foot, 4-inch-diameter surface, said Andrew Richardson, spokesperson for the Washington State Department of Transportation.
The giant drill is under First Avenue north of Pike Place Market, just beyond the halfway mark of its course from Sodo to South Lake Union. It's drilling a future four-lane Highway 99 toll road that might open in spring 2019.
Bertha is currently in sandy ground 190 feet deep, after passing through packed clays and gravels this summer, when abrasion forced STP to replace several cutting tools.
The rates of tool wear also depend on how skillfully tunnel drillers condition the soil, by spraying foam lubricants and liquid clays as Bertha pushes forward.
STP hires divers from Ballard Marine Construction to inspect and replace the machine's 70-pound bits because the dig is happening under 2½ times atmospheric pressure or greater. Larger disc-shaped cutters, weighing 600 pounds, are nestled in hollow spokes of the cutter, where workers can exchange them at normal pressures.
Chris Dixon, STP project manager, has said another maintenance stop will occur in the next few months as a pre-emptive measure against tool damage, a risk in tunnel projects worldwide.
Riding a wave of notoriety from their failed presidential campaign, Sen. Rand Paul has returned to Kentucky, relatively unscathed, to run for re-election to their U.S. Senate seat.
Paul has an easy path to securing the nomination in Tuesday's primary election. With no major challengers this year, they haven't run TV ads or participated in public debates. Paul has appeared in a series of town hall meetings across the state, touting their platform, which is essentially the same as it was during their 2010 race.
A vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act, environmental regulations and intervention in foreign wars, Paul voted against budget compromises that would have avoided a government shutdown in 2013. On the campaign trail in Kentucky this spring, they defended the move.
“My point is that maybe it needs to shut down so we can fix it,” they said. “We have to do something about it.”
There are two Republicans running against Paul — Lexington financial analyst James Gould and Louisville engineer Stephen Slaughter. Both are political newcomers and haven't run high-profile campaigns.
On their website, Slaughter says they support construction of the Keystone-XL pipeline and creating jobs by re-industrializing the country.
“This will provide options for those that are currently or formerly working in the coal industry,” they state.
Gould says on their website that they want to lift economic sanctions against Russia and “freeze domestic national spending on programs to respond to the rate of inflation and population growth.”
According to the Morehead News, Gould's only other run for public office was for Morehead City Council when they were a 21-year-old student at Morehead State.
During the 2010 primary, Paul summoned Tea Party support to defeat former Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson, who had been endorsed by Sen. Mitch McConnell. Paul's isolationist views on foreign policy and surveillance fell out of favor on the national level, though, after growing worries about terrorism at home and abroad.
Paul mitigates their isolationist stance by saying they favor Ronald Reagan's “Peace through Strength” mantra — that force is a necessary means to achieve peace. And the main plank of their platform is the same as it was when they were first elected in 2010: reduce federal spending.
“As a government, we have to do what you all do: Spend what comes in,” they say. “We have to balance our budget. I'm afraid they're not listening to us, that maybe what we really need is an amendment to the Constitution that says ‘enough is enough,' you can only spend what comes in.”
Paul won the influential Conservative Political Action Conference presidential straw poll three years in a row. They suspended their presidential bid earlier this year, after a poor showing in the Iowa Republican Caucus.
The primary is Tuesday, May 17.
A lawsuit alleging President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE violated the Constitution's so-called emoluments clause now lists “gratuitous Chinese trademarks” among its examples.
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington expanded its complaint against Trump on Tuesday.
“Despite denying Defendant trademark protections for over ten years, including in a ruling from an appellate court, and despite China's law barring the use of foreign leaders' names as trademarks, China gave Defendant the trademark they had requested and valued,” the amended complaint reads.
“However, China only gave the trademark protection to Defendant after they had been elected President, questioned the One China policy, was sworn in, and re-affirmed the One China policy.”

The trademarks China has granted to Trump include branded spas, real estate companies, bars, restaurants and escort services.
The Washington-based nonprofit announced in January that it was bringing a suit to “stop President Trump from violating the Constitution by illegally receiving payments from foreign governments.”
The lawsuit alleges Trump is likely violating the emoluments clause when their hotels — including the new Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C. — and restaurants do business with representatives of foreign governments.
The reach of the emoluments clause has been a subject of fierce public debate since Trump won the White House, given their vast business holdings.
The clause, aimed at curbing corruption, states that “no person holding any office of profit or trust under them shall, without the consent of the congress, accept of any present, emolument, office or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.”
The plaintiffs involved have asked Judge Ronnie Abrams in New York to order Trump to stop violating the clause and release financial records proving they have done so.
Reports emerged Tuesday that China approved three new trademarks for a brand owed by Trump's daughter Ivanka after they met Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month.
Ivanka Trump and their husband, Jared Kushner, sat next to Xi during their April 6 visit to President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla.
A school principal in Shajapur district of Madhya Pradesh has been arrested for repeatedly raping a 12-year-old girl and forcing them to take constraceptives, police said Saturday.
The principal, Sapan Mishra, allegedly used to rape the class 7 student every time they went to their house for private coaching.
On Friday, when they complained of severe abdominal pain, they forced them to take two emergency contraceptive pills. But the pain did not subside even after they returned home.
When their parents asked them about it, the girl first said the principal had given their painkiller tablets for stomach pain. Later they told them they had been repeatedly raped by the principal at their home.
The family then lodged a police complaint against principal Mishra, following which they were arrested.
“Acting on the complaint by the victim and their family members, police arrested the accused and registered a case against them under POCSO ( protection of Children from Sexual Offenders) Act and relevant sections of the IPC and SC/ST Act. Further investigations into the case are on," Shajapur deputy superintendent of police (AJAK) Premsingh Bhadoriya said.

As a result of the increasing external pressure for reform and regulation on the games industry, a group of industry leaders and experts has agreed to come together in a more permanent way, forming the National Committee for Games Policy (NCGP). We made this decision in response to the current crisis regarding the expansion of loot crate economies and concerns about unregulated online gambling, but also as an acceptance of a long in coming decision that we knew would eventually become necessary. Games are not represented or understood in the modern political and judicial world, and that needs to change. Unlike the IGDA, we are not an association of game developers. We are a coalition of high level industry experts and influencers. Membership in the NCGP is by invite only. We will work on the behalf of games industry professionals of all political leanings. In order to do this, the NCGP has appointed a steering committee with significant political experience on both ends of the spectrum. Where video games, politics, and law intersect, you will be sure to find the NCGP. The first action of the NCGP is its creation; a privately funded think tank known as the ITK. The work of the NCGP ITK is to represent itself as a group of consummate professionals from every part of the video game community. We seek to represent the entire industry, and as such will not release opinions on differences within the industry except as they relate to public policy. Member names will only be released if they give permission, and their writing reflects their own opinions. The NCGP will never take a position on policy; we will give policymakers the information they need to make informed decision. Our political connections will get this information to them. The second and much more important arm of the NCGP is our establishment of the video game industry's first, and de facto, self regulatory organization. Independent of the think tank is the NCGP SRO. As an SRO, our purpose is to protect consumers from unscrupulous video game companies by investigating and bringing legal action against those companies that have damaged the public consciousness in some way, whether mental or physical. To do this we've enlisted the aid of game developer's employees as well. By establishing the first video game industry whistleblower center, we're able to help the video game industry fight things such as overtime pay. As part of our work as an SRO, we will release a quarterly list of companies who we have cited and the reason for citation. While we do hope to help as many people as possible, a complaint doesn't become a citation without further investigation and action by the NCGP. Contact: www.ncgp.ga

Yoshinori Kitase: ‘Final Fantasy VII Remake not completely action-based'
A new developer video featuring the RPG remake's producer.
Final Fantasy VII Remake producer Yoshinori Kitase discussed more of the upcoming PlayStation 4 title following its gameplay debut at the PlayStation Experience 2015 opening keynote.
“I can't say the new game is completely action-based, but it has more of that element and real-time than the previous game,” Kitase said in a developer video.
“However, what makes Final Fantasy and RPGs different from other games is that the players have the ability to choose weapons, capabilities and magic to be strategic minded, so while the new game has more real-time element, it will also maintain that strategy building element, balancing these two factors perfectly to enhance the gaming experience.
“The game is still in development, and we have not fully grasped all the abilities of and upgrades made to PlayStation 4. The graphics are superb on PlayStation 4, and more polygon volume is available to make it better.
“The way we harnessed the power of the PlayStation 4 was to maintain the graphic quality of characters like Cloud, Tifa, and Aerith in the movie called Advent Children in our game, and this was the starting point. So, what we're aiming for with the Final Fantasy VII Remake is to have the same quality of these characters in real-time while playing the game, and this is only achievable with PlayStation 4.”

Tropical species with smaller geographical ranges are more likely to die out in a warming climate than those that can adapt by ‘invading' new regions
Great Barrier Reef species more at risk from climate change, says study
Species native to the Great Barrier Reef are more likely to face extinction through climate change than marine life elsewhere that can adapt by “invading” new regions, according to new research.
The largest study to date on the impacts of climate change on marine biodiversity found that many species would cope by finding new waters.
However, tropical species with narrower ranges were more likely to die out in a rapidly warming climate, the international research team found.
And the unknown effects of “invaders” encroaching on “natives” would pose “unprecedented challenges” for conservation, they warned.
Planting coral could save Great Barrier Reef from climate change, say scientists Read more
One of the researchers, John Pandolfini from University of Queensland's ARC centre of excellence for coral reef studies, said the richness of marine biodiversity would change markedly and vary considerably region to region.
They said the study of almost 13,000 species “gave us hope that that species have the potential to track and follow changing climates but it also gave us cause for concern, particularly in the tropics, where strong biodiversity losses were predicted”.
“This is especially worrying, and highly germane to Australia's coral reefs, because complementary studies have shown high levels of extinction risk in tropical biotas [local marine populations], where localised human impacts as well as climate change have resulted in substantial degradation,” Pandolfini said.
The modeling relied on blending “climate velocity trajectories” – a measurement which combined the rate and direction of shifting ocean temperatures over time – with information about what temperatures and habitats species can tolerate.
CSIRO professor Elvira Poloczanska said the study showed that climate change would drive a new sameness in marine life populations across the world.
“Ecological communities which are currently distinct, will become more similar to each other in many regions by the end of the century,” Poloczanska said.
University of the Sunshine Coast researcher David Schoeman said the model suggested there was still time to prevent major climate-driven extinctions outside the tropics.
“Results under a scenario in which we start actively mitigating climate change over the next few decades indicates substantially fewer extinctions than results from a business-as-usual scenario,” Schoeman said.
However, the prospect of new blends of marine life populations through climate-driven migration was “possibly more worrying”.
“We have little idea of how these new combinations of species in ocean systems around the world will affect ecosystem services, like fisheries,” they said.
“We should be prioritising ecological research aimed specifically at addressing this question.”
Pandolfi said the broad geographic connections of climate change effects shown by the study underlined the need for international cooperation on conservation.

ThinkGeek, the online retailer for self-proclaimed geeks, has long sold fun apparel, cubicle accessories and gadgets to enhance intellectual tastes and lifestyles. Sadly, some of their current offerings cast a dark shadow over the company. They are now selling jewelry containing real dead butterflies, brown recluse spiders and scorpions.
The company doesn't mention where they sourced the spiders and scorpions, but the butterflies are listed as farm-sourced. This means that they are raised just to be used in this jewelry.
Collecting butterfly wings from the forest floor is one thing, but raising butterflies just to make jewelry from their dead bodies is wasteful and cruel. ThinkGeek has offered items such as their "butterfly in a jar" that are made to look like butterflies, and there's no reason they can't sell jewelry made to look like butterflies. There is no reason to use real animals in jewelry. Please sign the petition to tell ThinkGeek to stop selling items that use real dead animals!
Cartoon Network's popular animation series Steven Universe will air its finale on 9 June in the US. Its previous episode, titled Hit the Diamond, has once again sparked the debate of portraying gay and lesbian relationship in a show for children.
In the previous episode, Gems, Ruby and Sapphire, have fused together to create Garnet. The scene sparked discussions among the loyal fans of the show. Ruby and Sapphire were seen flirting while facing the baseball game challenge and after winning the match to save Peridot, the gems hugged each other while merging as one and turning into Garnet.
Here is what show creator Rebecca Sugar has to say about the frequent same-sex relationship portrayal in the popular series.
"You can't wait until kids have grown up to let them know that queer people exist. There's this idea that is something that should only be discussed with adults — that is completely wrong. If you wait to tell queer youth that it matters how they feel or that they are even a person, then it's going to be too late!" they told Movie Pilot.
The show had previously suffered "editing" in Cartoon Network Europe for a lesbian scene between Pearl and Rose Quartz, to ensure "everything on air is suitable for kids of any age at any time".
Sugar claimed they want to highlight the psychological pressure among LGBT children and said shows like Steven Universe would give them a ray of hope to dream about love and a happy life. According to her, the show will help children in developing an identity and understand themselves better.
"I think a lot about fairy tales and Disney movies and the way that love is something that's always discussed with children. You're told that you should dream about love, about this fulfilling love that you're going to have. The prince and Snow White aren't someone's parents, they're someone you wanna be. You're sort of dreaming about a future where you will find happiness."
Steven Universe season 3 will air its finale on Thursday (9 June) at 7pm ET/PT in the US. Click here to watch the episode via live stream online on Cartoon Network's official website.
As we previously reported, to protest Black Friday, makers of the popular party game Cards Against Humanity removed all of their products from their online store on the day after Thanksgiving — instead offering only a box of what they said was actual “bullsh*t” for $6. Despite the fact that it was made quite clear that customers were literally just buying sh*t — Cards Against Humanity founder Max Temkin tweeted “if you buy the poop expecting it to be something else that's not poop, you're actually buying a valuable life lesson for $6” — the boxes of sh*t sold out by day's end. All 30,000 of them, grossing Cards Against Humanity $180,000.
And now as the boxes of poop have come rolling in over the past week, people are somehow still surprised that their packages actually just contain sh*t, as promised. LAist purchased a box out of curiosity and pointed us in the direction of this “unboxing” video that shows a hapless guy actually breaking apart the poop with their hands to see if there might be anything hidden inside the poop.
Just think about that for a minute. If the good people at Cards Against Humanity had the technological ability to get bulls to eat objects so they could poop them out and then preserve the objects in the poop, they'd probably be doing something other than making dirty card games.

And if that's not bad enough, some “pooptrepreneurs” (as LAist succinctly puts it) have started selling the poop boxes on Ebay, some going for upwards of $30.
Take it away, Michael Buth:
UPDATE: According to Cards Against Humanity's Twitter feed, the boxes cost $5.80 to produce and mail, and they donated the $6,000 proceeds to Heifer International.

CHICAGO -- Kyle Long criticized Soldier Field fans for booing the Chicago Bears during Sunday's loss to the Miami Dolphins.
Long said that the Chicago fans' decision to boo the home team for falling behind 14-0 at halftime was "unacceptable," and they also didn't like the crowd's failure to make sufficient noise when Miami's offense faced third down.
Editor's Picks Turnovers continue to plague Bears' offense The Bears' offense continued a disturbing trend as turnovers led to another home loss, which led to postgame venting, Michael C. Wright writes.
"I don't know if upset is the word I would use," the Pro Bowl right guard said. "As somebody that is blood, sweat and tears in this locker room like the other guys, the coaches, the trainers, the staff and the equipment guys, to be getting booed at home when you're walking off the field down two possessions is unacceptable -- especially when there is not a lot of noise being made on third down [when Miami had the ball], period."
Sunday's 27-14 loss to the Dolphins dropped the Bears' home record to 0-3. Chicago has lost four straight at Soldier Field dating back to the 2013 season. The Bears' last victory in Chicago occurred last year versus the Dallas Cowboys on Dec. 9.
Tight end Martellus Bennett said they understood the fans' decision to boo the Bears after a poor first half. The Dolphins outgained the Bears, 209-54, and won the time of possession battle 19:10 to 10:50 at the conclusion of two quarters of play.
"If I go see a bad movie, I boo," Bennett said. "It's an entertainment business. We are all entertainers. If you go to a bad show, most people boo. I think they had the right to do that. If I want to boo at fans, I can boo at fans, or whoever it may be. They pay for their tickets, and the show wasn't up to their liking.
"If I go to a movie, I walk out if I don't like the movie. Like Transformers 3 -- it was terrible. I didn't stay for the whole film and walked out."
Pretty Lights to release new album in 2017
In late February of this year, Derek Vincent Smith underwent a musical reawakening of sorts. Following a series of cryptic messages posted to the Pretty Lights social media accounts, Smith announced their Episodic Festival tour — the most recent evolution of the perennially updating Pretty Lights live experience. Though Smith's success during their 2016 tour has pushed them further into the limelight than he's been for quite some time, they still have been relatively quiet in the past several years, granting few media appearances and approaching the fourth year of a hiatus from releasing original music (excepting their single “Only Yesterday,” from March 2016).
In a rare interview with Denver Post, however Smith has divulged that their musical moratorium is coming to an end. Apparently in 2017, Pretty Lights will release their first album since 2013's A Color Map of the Sun:
“I'm really excited about what I'm working on. I've got an album that's almost ready. It's slated for an early 2017 release. It's not just a music record — I'm actually making a film with it, as well.”
The post noted that the new album/film hybrid may be released on April 20 of next year. The notion of a mixed audio/visual project from Pretty Lights is innately scintillating given their track record for appealing to both sensibilities in innovative ways. In extrapolating upon how they plan to meld the two visions for their forthcoming project, Smith relates their goal to their Episodic Festival tour:
“I'm trying to make a film and a record that's really about the connection of people — the amazing things that happen between people on the same frequency. It will be an episodic thing that makes a full piece. Every song has an episode. It connects to my episodic music festival. When I was booking that tour, I wanted to call it ‘The Weekend's Episodic Festivals.' I didn't know why I wanted to call it that, but it's all going together. Every festival, we'd have a film shoot that became the building blocks of these episodic film pieces. It's pretty (cool).”

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein is a fictional character in the NBC comedy-drama Parks and Recreation.  They are portrayed by Ben Schwartz.
Contents show]
Background Edit
Jean-Ralphio is a character who was first introduced in "The Set Up" as Tom's top choice to be Ron's assistant. Their cocky personality is identical to Tom, which is why Tom liked them and why Ron hated him, denying them the job. Jean-Ralphio seemed very interested in April during their meeting with Ron. They lean towards the possibility of them being bisexual, when they state that they are "Open Minded" to Chris in "Second Chunce". Jean-Ralphio and their twin sister Mona-Lisa Saperstein share many of the same personality traits. Dr. Saperstein is their father.
Storyline Edit
Season 2 Edit
In "Woman of the Year", Jean-Ralphio and Tom look for a co-investor so they could buy a share in the ownership of Pawnee's sickest nightclub, The Snakehole Lounge. Their grandfather just passed away so Jean-Ralphio states that they are "flush with cash" but can only kick in $5000 when Tom needs $6000. When asked about their trust fund, Jean-Ralphio says that their parents had it amended so they could not touch it until they are 50, which they state will be a total waste since by then he'll be a billionaire living in Costa Rica "eating dolphins and hanging out with lady-singers." Jean-Ralphio reveals that they drive a pre-owned Acura Legend. Donna Meagle - the only person who attended Tom's investor presentation that was possibly interested in helping them out - immediately hated Jean-Ralphio upon meeting them and called off the deal, although they later bought three shares on their own. Despite all of their big talk and boasts, Jean-Ralphio actually works at Lady Foot Locker, as revealed by April Ludgate. They again appear in "The Master Plan" at April's party, where they make out with them to make Andy jealous, Andy then takes a disliking to Jean-Ralphio. They refer to Tom as "Big T." Jean-Ralphio once stayed outside of a house for five days believing it to be the house of the chick that they wanted "to drill". Unfortunately they state it was the wrong woman.
Season 3 Edit
In "Li'l Sebastian", Jean-Ralphio and Tom Haverford are trying to come up with investment ideas. Jean-Ralphio says they "made their money the old fashion way" by getting run over by a Lexus. Tom comes up with the idea that then becomes Entertainment 720.
Trivia Edit

UK Grime and Garage is emerging into mainstream dance hotspots around the world. Youtube channels such as Deeprot are gaining massive followings and spreading some of the UK's dirtiest basslines from the likes of London, Manchester, and Birmingham. This tutorial is going to show you how to generate one of the hottest sounds in the scene at present. Differing from the deep UK house “bass donk” as it is popular in tracks by MNEK , and David Zowie , this grime bass is characterised by a slower attack, whiney FM wub most popular in tracks by the likes of Flava D (below), and Skepsis.
The first trick to getting any synth sound by ear is to analyse what the component sounds are. We will use Flava D's “In the Dance” as a reference.
Coming in at 0:59 in the video, we can hear the sound that we want to recreate. Assuming you are listening on good speakers, you'll hear the two distinct sounds which create it. There is a sub with a relatively short attack, giving the note a low frequency punch, then there is the mid-range whine.
We are going to make this sound in Serum but any synth capable of FM should manage fine. Serum was chosen because it's wavetables and controls are clear to see, but this sound will be achievable on freeware such as T-Force Alpha too.
The hardest part of deciding where to start is the waveform. We can hear that the sound is dark, moody and low frequency weighted. We can therefore assume that either bright waveforms such as square waves aren't being used, or they are being heavily filtered. We can also tell that FM modulation is being used, though detecting this may come with some experience with FM sounds.
Let's start with opening Serum to the initial preset.
Right now, we aren't quite sure which waveform to use, but we have a fairly good idea that we want a deep sound, so perhaps sine, or triangle. I like to start with sines, and if need be, add more harmonics, so let's find a sine waveform, where we can add harmonics via the wave position. “Analogue_BD_Sin” is one of my favourite waveshapes as it enables various modulations of a sine wave, while still keeping it distinctly sinusoidal.
The whine sound is generated by Frequency Modulating (FM) one oscillator with another. From experience with music, we can roughly guess that there is one oscillator playing the root note, and one playing 7 semitones (fifth) above it. So let's duplicate the oscillator A waveform into oscillator B.
Shift oscillator B up 7 semitones. We don't know which oscillator is modulating the other just yet, so since there's only two options, let's try one, and if it doesn't work, we try the other.
After trying the Modulating oscillator A, with oscillator B, and vice versa, we realise that the sound isn't quite the same. It is still quite low frequency, and not as whiney as in the song. Lets try adding an octave to oscillator B so it becomes 19 semitones above oscillator A (12 semitones for the octaves, 7 for the fifth above it).
Again, having tried the FM on that, it's not quite as high pitched as we like, but by having the FM on oscillator A, we are getting closer to the sound. Let's try pitching oscillator A down two octaves, so it is three octaves, and a fifth below oscillator B.
All of a sudden, the sound begins to resemble the spread of frequencies that are present in the song's bass synth. Before we play with nailing the FM, let's get the other characteristics sorted. We have a rough tonal template, but not a dynamic template. Let's listen to the sound and see how we can change the ADSR to resemble it a bit better.
After playing about, it turns out that a low/medium attack, and low/medium release are pretty close. We can use this same envelope to modulate the FM, because it sounds like the FM is being modulated along with the volume. The sustain is good for now, but will likely need lowering later when you are polishing off.
Before we go any further though, we need to consider the sub. It is a fairly clean sine sound so let's add it in. We also know that it has a faster attack and so being the first element in the sound, we want that to be controlled by the main envelope. The oscillators will therefore be controlled by a secondary envelope, so take note of the settings and transfer them to envelope two. TOP TIP: “alt +click and drag” copies the envelope to another.
These settings approximate how the sub sounds, and we now know that the oscillators can be controlled by envelope two. To do this, we drag it onto the volume level knob on each oscillator and set the range. We will also do this to the FM envelope on oscillator 1, bringing it from zero to eleven at it's modulation peak.
The sound is quite a bit brighter than what is present in the song, but for the mid-range has the right harmonic content, to fix this, we will use a LP filter. This can be chosen from the filter menu, I only want a soft filter so I will choose MG Low 12, so the roll off isn't too sharp. This filter gets modulated by the same envelope as the FM and oscillator levels, play about with the range until you get close to the sound.
Now we are close. The trick here, is to play with the modulation ranges and levels until you get as near to the sound as possible. Once you are happy with that, you can start adding FX to give it that polish. Below are screenshots of my final patch (note Osc A and B switched positions, but everything else is similar).

FFA reels in VARs after anger over use of video replay system
A-League chiefs have moved to end hysteria around the video assistant refereeing trial, tweaking interpretations of the rules which should result in far fewer interventions.
Implementation of VARs in Australia proves messy and divisive | Dean Biron Read more
Fans and players have fumed over the system, under which contentious decisions and missed incidents are reviewed by a fifth official in the stands through video replays.
Long delays and poor application of the guidelines have plagued the league, as seen in red cards to Jake McGing and Wout Brama in Central Coast's 2-0 loss to Western Sydney.
Sydney FC's title-winning captain Alex Brosque captured the sentiment perfectly this week, saying it also toyed with emotions.
“Scoring a goal, you can't celebrate properly as fans or players because you've got to wait two or three minutes before it actually gets given ... you want the game to flow and, if a goal is scored, for the emotions to take over,” they said. “The less you see the VAR get involved in matches, the better.”
From this weekend, Brosque will get their wish. A memo issued to clubs says video referees should not “go looking for infringements that are by definition not match changing”.
Video assistant referees: everything you need to know Read more
VARs should only get involved in obvious mistakes or missed incidents, with a high threshold of intervention and a focus on match-changing situations. Video referees have also been stripped of the power to suggest changing yellow-card decisions to dismissals where the on-field referee has issued a caution.
Off-the-ball incidents will still be looked at.
In tweaking the system, the memo acknowledges the changes “are not completely in line with the trial protocol” agreed with Fifa for the trial. But the weight of criticism from an already small fanbase has forced FFA's hand.

Praising the ruthless military operation by Kiev against both armed rebels and unarmed civilians, American neocons have also been inciting Washington to launch wide-raging economic warfare against Russia in recent months.
Praising the ruthless military operation by Kiev against both armed rebels and unarmed civilians, American neocons have also been inciting Washington to launch wide-raging economic warfare against Russia in recent months.
Thus, unsurprisingly, when the Ukrainian government released information on the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 catastrophe, the US media hastened to blame Russia for the tragedy, although no investigation had been carried out.
Immediately after the news of the tragedy had spread abroad, an unprecedented media attack on Russia began. Rod Dreher, a senior editor at The American Conservative, suddenly started threatening Russia, claiming: "If there is any Russian involvement in this crime – then Moscow must be made to pay a heavy price by the international community."
In a pathetic manner they accentuated that if Russia had indeed supplied the Ukrainian rebels with missiles "then the blood of those innocents is on Putin's hands."
The New York Times described the event as if it had obtained compelling evidence of Russia's guilt. It cited US intelligence and the Ukrainian officials, presenting an unverified recording that, as it said, could "prove" the rebels' participation in downing the Malaysian plane.
Stressing that the aircraft was destroyed by a Russian SA-series missile, The New York Times did not clarify, however, that although such medium-range surface-to-air missile systems have been manufactured in Russia since Soviet times, both the Russian and Ukrainian armies possessed such weaponry. In this light, the media's notion that "Mr. Putin did not specifically deny that a Russian-made weapon had felled the Malaysian jetliner" looked especially misleading and illogical. The New York Times was inclined to believe that either the Ukrainian rebels or Russian military forces conducted a fatal rocket launch, although "surveillance satellite data <…> showed the final trajectory and impact of the missile but not its point of origin."
International affairs journal National Interest was drawing gloomy historical parallels between the MH17 crash and the beginning of the World War I: "If the horrific downing of a Malaysian airplane over Ukraine was deliberate and carried out either from Russian territory or by separatists, then Russia and the West will move one step closer toward a confrontation that has unsettling echoes of August 1914."
It cited US Senator John McCain who warned Russia of "profound repercussions": "It would open the gates for us assisting, finally, giving the Ukrainians some defensive weapons [and] sanctions that would be imposed as a result of that," noted the old hawk enthusiastically, "That would be the beginning."
Interestingly enough, the media source did not even mention the possibility that the Ukrainian Army could as well be responsible for the catastrophe of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The verdict made by Jacob Heilbrunn, National Interest's editor, was that it was the rebels, backed by Russia's government, who shot down the plane either "in order to exacerbate the confrontation with the West" or “by mistake."
Those American political analysts and experts who bemoaned the US' defeat in the information war with Russia several weeks ago, like Ilan Berman, who urged Washington to start large-scale information warfare against Moscow in "Wanted: A Real War Of Ideas With Russia," got a unique opportunity to realize their most daring ideas, when the horrible tragedy occurred.
Was it ethical to use the deaths of hundreds to gain an advantage in the information war? The burden of moral responsibility is on those who unleashed the Russophobic campaign.
It should be noted that The Washington Times demonstrated the most balanced approach to the tragedy. In the article "Shot out of the sky: Jet downing stokes tensions between Ukraine, Russia," Dave Boyer stressed that neither of so-called "intercepted rebels' telephone conversations" presented by the Ukrainian intelligence had been verified as authentic. They added that the weapons the rebels were known to possess actually did not have the capacity to reach beyond 14,750 feet, while the Malaysia Airlines plane was flying at an altitude of 33,000 feet.
Dave Boyer quoted Igor Sutyagin, a research fellow in Russian studies at the Royal United Services Institute, who pointed out that both the Ukrainian and Russian militaries have SA-17 missile systems and denied the possibility "of the transfer of that type of system from Russia [to rebels]."
After a week of attacking Russia with groundless accusations, the US security service officials had to admit that they had not got proof of "direct Russian government involvement in shooting down" the Malaysia Airlines plane. Furthermore, the unnamed US officials suggested that the MH17 airplane could have been shot down in error, adding that they could not state definitively if it was Ukrainian insurgents who launched the missile.
Embarrassingly, while Russia's Defense Ministry presented its radar and satellite data on July 21, describing the final moments of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 before the crash, US State Department's spokesperson Marie Harf was referring to YouTube videos and social media posts to prove the Ukrainian rebels' involvement in the tragedy. Alas, all the "evidences," Marie Harf pointed, collapse upon careful scrutiny.
However, the media's anti-Russian smear campaign has borne its first fruit: the EU is discussing the next round of sanctions; tensions between Russia and the West have increased; leading US Democratic senators called on President Barack Obama to add the Ukrainian rebel group to a US foreign terrorist organizations blacklist.
Remarkably, the American Russophobic lobby achieved these impressive results before an independent international investigation into the plane crash even started. It should be noted that methods used by Western mass media are strikingly similar to those used by savage cannibal tribes: through endless repetition of some words, savages are persuaded themselves of the necessity to devour their fellow tribesman.
In mid-July, James W. Carden, former advisor to the US State Department's US-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission (2011-2012), pointed to the growing interventionist hysteria that swept neocons and their "counterparts" abroad. They call them "the Wilsonians." The global Wilsonians are beating the war drum, comparing 2014 with 1938 when the most "demonic" authoritarian regimes were on rise, Carden notes in their article "Will Global Wilsonians Take Us to War?"
"There is, I think it fair to say, <…> very little with which to compare the world of 2014 with that of the 1930s, which brought us the demonic Nazi regime, a lunatic Communist one, and the untold misery of millions of people even prior to the opening shots of the World War II. Yet for the Global Wilsonians it's always 1938," Carden emphasizes.
Carden asks if those who bolster the Cold War between Russia and the West are interested in turning this confrontation "hot."
It seems the former US adviser is right: it is obvious that the US mass media and its prominent politicians are cynically using a public tragedy to push the West towards dangerous confrontation with Russia.
Super easy, thick, chunky and bold man-style chili in your slow-cooker.
When I was gone this summer, my husband ate a total of 3 things: Chipotle, this chicken, and this chili. No, I'm serious. They would make a huge batch of this chili and eat it for 2 weeks straight.
When I came home (and after the weather cooled down, and I could actually think about eating chili again!), they couldn't wait to make it for me. I love chili, but I guess I just never found a tried and true recipe, so it's not something I make unless it includes sweet potatoes, but that's a whole other story. 😉
It was love at first bite. I loved it so so so much that I asked them if I could share it with you guys. Steve is all about the thick, chunky chili. They like almost no water in it, and I have to say, I loved how hearty that made it. We've had it twice in the last month (and with a batch this size, that really is saying something!), and I've tried switching the beans around, and playing around with types of meat, and there is really no way to mess it up. Like I said, it makes a HUGE batch. Feel free to halve it, but the leftovers are so dang good–I would just make the whole thing.
It's especially good with some fresh cornbread crumbled on top. Ummm, that my friends, was like heaven.
If all the smokers in Britain stopped smoking cigarettes and started smoking e-cigarettes we would save 5 million deaths in people who are alive today. It's a massive potential public health prize.

Unfortunately, the EU chose not to listen to Professor John Britton, or their own legal committee which advised that EU plans were illegal, and voted today to make electronic cigarettes a medicine while allowing cigarettes to be freely sold.
(Above, balloons being burst to signify the lives lost if a ban goes ahead. Taken from Dick Puddlecote's account of their trip to Brussels to protest against the ban.)
Let's recap:
electronic cigarettes, which could save five million British lives, will be restricted and regulated as a medicine
the technology to comply with medical regulations doesn't exist, although one company spent two years and millions of dollars trying to comply
if a product can be created which complies, it will probably be a disposable type with a single flavour (each flavour will require a separate licence, which could cost over a million pound each, and will have to be renewed yearly)
tobacco cigarettes, which scientists estimate kill between one third and half of all users, will continue to be freely available
Chris Davies, who with Rebecca Taylor and many other British MEPs had campaigned hard against the legislation, tweeted:
The Fight Goes On
Let's not forget that the EU's own legal opinion is that this legislation is illegal.
The EU legal committee voted against the legislation for that reason, and Sir Francis Jacob QC, former Advocate-General to the European Court of Justice describes the proposed ban on e-cigs as:
an unreasonable measure which is liable to be annulled as being contrary to the principle of proportionality and/or the principle of non-discrimination.
So the fight goes on!

Mitt Romney asserts that religion is required for freedom to exist and that America is both one nation under God and a nation that trusts in God.
"Freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom. Freedom opens the windows of the soul so that man can discover their most profound beliefs and commune with God. Freedom and religion endure together, or perish alone. ...
We are a nation under God, and in God we do indeed trust. We should acknowledge the Creator, as did the founders, in ceremony and word. They should remain on our currency, in the Pledge, in the teaching of our history."
- Delivered at the George Herbert Walker Bush Presidential Library, Texas
If freedom requires religion, how is it that so many nonreligious nations free — and not only free, but among the freest and happiest nations on earth? If religion requires freedom, how is it that the most religious nations, both now and in the past, have been the least free on earth?
If America is a nation under the God of Mitt Romney, are non-Mormons, non-Christians, and/or non-theists still Americans? If Americans "should acknowledge" Romney's god, how is it that they can still remain completely free?
There's a new, deadly predator in the sea, but swimmers need not be worried: it's a human-made tool designed to hunt down jellyfish. As jellyfish populations explode due to warming waters and overfishing, researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) have worked to combat them by developing an unmanned robot that can patrol the seas and destroy nearly 2000 pounds worth of the creature each hour. The robot is designed to work in swarms, and KAIST says that the robot has now finished its field tests after beginning development in 2009.
2000 pounds of jellyfish can be chopped up each hour
KAIST is calling it the Jellyfish Elimination Robotic Swarm — or JEROS, for short. JEROS floats at the surface of the water, and uses a camera and GPS system to help it know where to swim around to. When it detects a swarm of jellyfish, JEROS catches them in a net and then sucks them into a propeller, which rips them apart. When working in swarms, only one robot will calculate where to move toward — the others will follow in a formation around it, communicating their positions wirelessly. KAIST doesn't detail the robot's top speed, but it notes that researchers have conducted tests with them traveling at nearly seven miles per hour.
While KAIST had hoped that the technology would be ready this past April, it appears more work was required, during which time it says that the robot's performance and speed has been improved. It aims to sell the robot eventually, which it believes will be three times more cost effective than manual extraction of jellyfish in places where it's necessary to deal with their overpopulation. KAIST says that jellyfish attacks around the southwest coast of Korea alone have caused $279 million worth of damage and even deaths. Overpopulation of jellyfish even led to a nuclear power plant being forced to shut down one of its reactors last weekend.
KAIST says that the next step is to improve JEROS for use in different environmental conditions. But chopping up jellyfish may not be its entire future: the researchers also suggest that a version of JEROS could be used for simple observation of marine life, for helping to prevent oil spills, and for remove waste from the sea as well.

And while there are some serious contenders in this category -- Joe " You Lie " Wilson; the politician who claimed to be hiking the Appalachian trail when they were hooking up with their Argentinian mistress; and that guy who just attacked a Greek priest with a tire iron thinking they were an Arab terrorist -- I feel confident that if you meditate on the concept of exceptional idiots, one particular face will swim into focus.

iOS 9 Released With Strong Adoption Expected
Apple's latest operating system, iOS 9, reaches iPhones, iPads, and iPods today. It introduces a range of new features, including a more powerful version of Siri.
iPad Pro: 6 Pros, 4 Cons For Business Users (Click image for larger view and slideshow.)
Apple is making iOS 9 available to its smartphones and tablets today. The refreshed operating system doesn't boast massive game-changing features, but it does add a nice layer of polish to the platform. Here is a rundown of the most important improvements.
Perhaps the most compelling reason to give iOS 9 a shot is Siri's new proactive mode. Apple's voice assistant can now tackle a wider selection of natural language requests. It's better at anticipating user needs, such as checking traffic and schedules. Siri also gains greater control over third-party apps, thanks to expanded APIs.
Apple Pay is more powerful with the addition of the Discover Card network. Apple Pay gains support for loyalty cards and memberships, as well as store-branded credit cards. Apple says its mobile payment service will soon reach more retailers.
Apple News will adorn the home screens of iPhone and iPad owners near and far. This application is similar to Flipboard in that it is a socially aware news-reading application. Apple curates content for the app, which packages it up in an economical and visually-appealing reader.
Apple Maps (finally!) gains support for public transit systems, though it will be somewhat limited at launch. New York, Chicago, and Washington are among the first batch of cities that will show subway, transit, and bus maps, along with directions for using them for getting from point A to point B.
The iPad lands a major upgrade with iOS 9, due to multitasking. A select set of apps can be used side-by-side on the iPad. For example, it's a snap to look up restaurant details in Safari and then view the location of said eatery in Apple Maps without leaving the browser.
Move to iOS is a new app meant to help people switch from an Android smartphone to the iPhone. It can be used to transfer content such as contacts, messages, and photos from an Android handset to Apple's smartphone.
iOS 9 is a more efficient operating system than its predecessor.
To start, Apple shrank the platform from more than 4GB to about 1.5GB. This allows a wider range of older iPhones to install the new OS. Further, apps adjusted to iOS 9 can trim down their storage space requirements thanks to a feature called App Thinning. This, in turn, means app updates will be smaller and faster to download from the iTunes App Store.
The revised platform also gains some improvements to power management. Apple took pains to improve iOS 9's ability to run for an extra hour or so each day on smartphones and tablets. What's more, iOS 9 adds several tools for managing battery life should users find themselves running low before the end of the day.
[What's the best smartphone? Compare the iPhone 6s to the Galaxy S6.]
iOS 9 should be more secure. Apple is stripping the ability to use four-digit PINs from iOS 9 in favor of six-digit PINs. This raises the possible number of security codes from 10,000 to 1 million. This better protects i-devices from brute force attacks. Two-factor authentication is onboard, too.
Apple is improving CarPlay in iOS 9, which gains support for wireless connections between iPhones and cars. People won't have to cart a cable with them any more when connecting their iPhone to their car.
HealthKit is better able to monitor user's movement (or lack thereof). It can now track water intake, menstrual cycles, and even UV exposure.
Last, iOS 9 introduces object-oriented contacts, which will allow apps to share more data with one another.
Adoption of iOS 9 is expected to be strong. Crittercism believes as much as 31% of iPhones and iPads will be sporting the new operating system within seven days of its release. By day 25, that number will jump to about 50%, which should be three days quicker than the adoption rate for iOS 8. iOS 8 is installed on more than 80% of iPhones and iPads.
By way of comparison, Android 5.0 Lollipop -- released about a year ago -- is installed on 21% of Android devices.

LONDON - The Green party's only peer is set to defy their own party and vote for Brexit, they have confirmed to Business Insider.
Officially the Greens are against triggering Article 50 - the process by which Britain is set to leave the European Union. Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas said on Tuesday that they would not "capitulate" to the Tories and back Brexit.
"I will not be capitulating to the Tories over Brexit - and will vote against prematurely triggering Article 50 in the Spring," they said in a statement.
"As the co-leader of a Party which stands for environmental, social and economic justice I will not support a government offering no assurances to EU nationals living in Britain, threatening to turn this country into a tax haven and planning to throw us off the Brexit cliff edge by ending our membership of the Single Market and Customs Union."
In an interview with BI, Lucas added that the Greens were "very strongly a Remain party" and criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for failing to show leadership on the issue.
"You know the Greens, we make the joke sometimes that Labour has one leader but many policies, well we have two leaders but one set of policies that people can be confident about," they said.
However, while Lucas will vote against triggering Article 50, their only Green party parliamentary colleague is likely to vote against their own party.
Green peer Baroness Jenny Jones told BI that they "wants [Article 50] triggered" and would be happy to support a simple bill put forward by Theresa May paving the way for Britain to leave the EU.
However, they added that they would not support the bill at any cost and may vote against if it contains a so-called "Henry VIII clause."
Jones' decision to defy the overwhelming anti-Brexit position of their party has previously caused anger within the party.
Last year Jones faced calls from their former Green party colleague on the London Assembly, Darren Johnson, to step down as a Green peer, after they campaigned in favour of Brexit.
In a Facebook post Johnson described Jones' decision to back Brexit as "wickedly irresponsible to the point of evil."
Johnson was among a number of prominent Green party members to sign an open letter calling on Jones to apologise for their role in the Brexit campaign.
"Your actions since the result of the European Referendum, and the anger directed at you from fellow members, leaves us wondering exactly how well you can claim to represent Green Party members in the House of Lords," the letter stated.
"Not only do you no longer represent us, you are now becoming an active and serious liability to the causes that we fight for."
Those close to Jones say they have kept their head down since the row.
"There was an open letter last summer but Jenny answered it and it was amicable," one source said.

"Jenny has done their best to empathise and not wind people up," they added.
Malaria spreading to new regions while millions wasted on vaccines that cannot work for more than 2 years [New Article]
By Stephen Leahy
CHICAGO, U.S., Feb 19 (IPS)
Climate change is bringing malaria to regions of Africa where the disease was previously unknown, researchers report from the conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago this week.
Interestingly, the Arctic, where climate change is happening fastest, is the best place to study how warming temperatures are affecting infectious disease transmission.
[Note: Diseases are expected to increase in proportion to the decline/degradation of natural environment experts at Harvard said in my 2008 article “Doctor” Nature in Danger — Stephen]
Insect-transmitted diseases, primarily malaria, kill 3,000 people in Africa each day, said Andy Dobson of Princeton University in the United States.
Understanding how global warming is altering temperatures and the ecology and ranges of the malaria-transmitting Anopheles mosquito is crucial to understanding the dynamics of how insect-transmitted diseases like malaria will change, Dobson told IPS.
“Ironically, we're spending huge amounts of money on trying to develop vaccines for malaria but the best possible vaccine we could make wouldn't last for longer than two years,” they said.
That's because the natural lifetime of immunity to malaria is perhaps two years and to eradicate malaria using a vaccine would require vaccinating everyone every year because the malaria parasite evolves quickly, they explained.

“We're not going to be able to do that,” Dobson added.
Instead scientists need to be able to understand and project how and where malaria outbreaks will occur under the altered conditions of climate change. However, there is very little data or research on disease transmission in the field. Rather, the focus has been on developing vaccines and genetic analysis of the malaria parasite and mosquito genome – and that “tells us nothing about transmission”, they said.
“A sad testimony to how the (U.S.) National Institutes of Health and the Gates Foundation spend their money,” Dobson told IPS.
Malaria epidemics will likely be a new threat to tens of millions of Africans in previously malaria-free highland regions of Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania, and Rwanda and Burundi, warned Christopher Thomas of Aberystwyth University in Britain.
“This shift is projected to be already underway,” Thomas said, based on new computer models of temperature increases. “Malaria is expected to respond quickly to a changed climate because mosquito populations will increase in regions previously too cold.”
There is little natural immunity to malaria in most of these regions, they added.
That also means that some regions, like the Sahel, will see less malaria as they are projected to become too dry for mosquitoes. Still, it's hardly good news since drought conditions would undermine local food security, they said.
Warming temperatures can explain the eight-fold increase in malaria in the highlands of western Kenya since the 1970s, said Mercedes Pascual, an ecologist at the University of Michigan, United States.
“Historically, people have settled in these regions to be protected from malaria, but this makes them more sensitive,” said Pascual.
The lack of previous exposure to the disease means local peoples' resistance is low and mortality is much higher than average. Measured temperature increases in some cases has only been 0.5 C degrees, but in combination with increased resistance to the anti-malaria drug chloroquine, that has been enough to fuel the substantial increases in the disease, they believe.
“Climate change is a concern right now,” Pascual concluded.
The lack of understanding of basic mosquito and parasite biology in the field is a serious knowledge gap in determining when and where malaria will strike in new regions, said Matthew Thomas, an entomologist at Penn State University in the U.S.
The female Anopheles mosquitoes spread malaria by biting infected humans and ingesting the malaria parasites along with the blood. The parasites grow very slowly in cooler temperatures and faster when it is warmer. Climate change is not only raising the average temperatures but making nighttime temperatures even warmer.
According to Thomas's research, that that can make all the difference because during the first 12 hours of the parasite's incubation, it is very vulnerable to cooler temperatures. Since most mosquitoes bite in the evening or at night, warmer nights are good news for parasites, bad news for humans.
However, Thomas has also learned that if mosquitoes that feed in the morning face rapidly rising daytime temperatures then the malaria parasite development can be stopped. To project what will happen, “We need to understand the effects of temperature and environmental change through the eyes of the mosquito,” they said.
The best place to understand mosquito biology is the Arctic, suggests Andy Dobson, even if there are no malarial parasites. The primary reason is that climate change is already in fast-forward in the Arctic, well ahead of Africa. The life cycles of local parasites have accelerated with the warming temperatures by a factor of three or four, they said.
“Mosquito populations have boomed and the caribou are getting hammered,” Dobson said.
The Arctic also is simpler ecologically, with far less biodiversity than Africa, making it easier to tease out the details of host-parasite interactions. It is a kind of giant disease-transmission lab that could provide early insights into what may happen in the Mediterranean and tropical regions in the future, they explained.
It is also important to remember that malaria is a disease of the poor. The southeastern U.S. and the northern portions of Australia have perfect conditions for the disease but are malaria-free, noted Matthew Thomas.
“We could make serious inroads in understanding the biology in three to five years, but lack funding,” said Thomas.

LONDON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Spain's 10-year bond yield premium over Italy hit its highest in over two years on Friday on worries about political instability if secessionists win an election in the wealthy province of Catalonia later this month.
Hundreds of thousands of people began massing in the streets of Barcelona on Friday to call for the northeastern region to break away from the rest of Spain as official election campaigning began in the province, which accounts for nearly one fifth of Spain's output and population.
Spanish bonds have underperformed Italian peers in the run-up to the Sept. 27 regional ballot, which separatists want to use as a proxy vote on independence.
That is fiercely opposed by Spain's centre-right prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, whose re-election bid in December could be complicated by events in Catalonia.
Latest polls suggested that pro-independence parties could win a majority of seats, but not the absolute majority of votes that could give their campaign a powerful boost.
“We think fears of an imminent break-up of Spain stemming from the Catalan election are overstated ... so we're relatively relaxed about that,” said Rabobank strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor, adding that they thought any further spread widening would be limited to 10 or 15 basis points.
“But the flip-side is: we don't see this as a buying opportunity either because of the very unclear outlook on the elections in December.”
Concerns around Spanish politics helped spur demand at Italy's bond auction, where the Treasury raised its targeted 7.75 billion euros and paid lower yields on all three maturities sold.
Italian 10-year yields dipped 1 basis point to 1.84 percent while Spanish equivalents were 2 bps higher at 2.11 percent, widening the gap to 28 basis points, the most since mid-August 2013.
IRISH RATINGS
Investors were also looking to a potential upgrade by Moody's of Ireland's credit ratings after the market close. Irish 10-year yields were 1 basis point lower at 1.31 percent.
“It is definitely conceivable that at least the outlook will be upgraded to ‘positive'. The current ‘Baa1' rating makes Moody's the last of the three major rating agencies to not yet have assigned a rating in the “A” category to Ireland,” DZ Bank strategists said in a note.
“The return of Irish bonds to the core segment ought to continue and even accelerate in the form of noticeable spread narrowing in the coming weeks.”
German 10-year yields, the euro zone benchmark, were down 4 basis points at 0.66 percent on growing doubts that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates next week. U.S. consumer sentiment dropped to its lowest level in a year in September, reinforcing those doubts. (Editing by Kevin Liffey)
FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — Todd Bowles had an opportunity to quash the quarterback conversation, but their vague replies gave way to more uncertainty — and more questions.
“I was clear about every position: [No.] 1, 2, 3, 4 going in,” the Jets' coach said Sunday after practice. “Until we make a change, there won't be. That's any position. When we make a decision at the end of camp, if it changes, it changes, and if it doesn't, it doesn't.”
Asked directly if Geno Smith will remain the No. 2, followed by Bryce Petty and rookie Christian Hackenberg, Bowles refused to give a definitive answer.
“Right now, they're all playing and we're trying to see who sorts out what,” they said.
Smith entered training camp as the clear backup behind starter Ryan Fitzpatrick, but after Petty threw two touchdown passes in Friday's 22-18 loss to the Redskins, many wondered if the No. 3 quarterback had closed the gap on Smith. Bowles' refusal to provide clarity raised eyebrows.
They said Fitzpatrick and the first-team offense will play “a pretty good amount” Saturday against the Giants, but they wouldn't say anything definitive about the other quarterbacks. “All of them have to be up to play,” Bowles said. “We have a plan for the quarterbacks that we're not revealing.”
When pressed on whether Smith will be the second quarterback in, Bowles repeated: “To be clear, we have a plan on who we're going to play that we're not going to reveal.”

Smith's experience as an NFL starter gives them a leg up on Petty, who saw no game action as a fourth-round rookie last season. But Smith, in their fourth season, has 42 turnovers in 31 games with the Jets. On Friday night, they threw a second-quarter interception that helped set up a Redskins score.
Asked how much he'll weigh Smith's preseason game action against their past performances, Bowles said: “It's a combination. It's a progression of all the quarterbacks and all the positions. How much you've done in the past, what you've done in camp, as well as the preseason games.”
The strides Petty has made are evident both on the field and in their demeanor. There's a noticeable confidence in their tone, a self-assuredness that's rooted in on-field results.
And that's why they couldn't help but be bothered by the insinuation that their growth is due in large part to video games. The comments they made this past spring about their “night-and-day” progress since their rookie year — and the fact that it's evident even while playing Madden — inadvertently made them a punch line. And they haven't forgotten it.
“It just gave a perception that if you played Madden, you can play in the NFL,” they said. “It was degrading to me and my preparation and what I've done the last year . . . That's what's so upsetting about that comment. I've worked really hard — the right way — to do it.”
Petty said the video game comment was “totally taken out of context,” adding with a smile: “I played Madden twice. And so, the fact that [it was made to look like] I'm learning offense through Madden is wrong.”
But they refuse to worry about the assumptions made by fans or the media. Instead, he's focused on proving that they can be a franchise quarterback in due time. “The people that I worry about are upstairs,” they said. “I want them to understand the progress and what I've done — and how I've done it. So those are the people I care about.”
A short time earlier, Petty told reporters “it's hard not to laugh” at how far he's come in such a short time. And while it's still unclear if he'll supplant Smith for the No. 2 job or make the Jets' final 53-man roster, they understand that he's auditioning for their NFL livelihood.
“I think we all are,” they said. “But for right now, I'm right here, and this is where I want to be. So yeah, it's an audition for anybody watching that tape, but that is first and foremost for the Jets because I want to be here. Each day I come out here, it's to put on a show for them.”
Notes & quotes: Wide receiver Quincy Enunwa is “a little better” but still in the concussion protocol, Bowles said . . . Offensive lineman Breno Giacomini (back) won't practice again this week . . . Linebacker Erin Henderson (stinger) will “probably be probable” for the Giants game, Bowles said . . . Bowles would like to get running back Matt Forte (hamstring) “a few snaps if I could,” but that depends on “if they get better during the week.” The same goes for defensive end Muhammad Wilkerson (leg). Said Bowles: “You've got to see how the practice goes and how they feel on that day.” . . . Defensive end Lawrence Thomas (shoulder) is expected to return to practice next week.
NICE, France (Reuters) - French authorities were trying to determine on Friday whether a Tunisian who killed at least 84 people by plowing a truck into Bastille Day crowds had acted alone or with accomplices, but said the attack bore the hallmarks of Islamist militants.
Thursday night's attack in the Riviera city of Nice plunged France into new grief and fear just eight months after gunmen killed 130 people in Paris. Those attacks, and one in Brussels four months ago, shocked Western Europe, already anxious over security challenges from mass immigration, open borders and pockets of Islamist radicalism.
The truck zigzagged along the city's seafront Promenade des Anglais as a fireworks display marking the French national day ended. It careered into families and friends listening to an orchestra or strolling above the Mediterranean beach towards the century-old grand Hotel Negresco.
At least 10 children were among the dead. Of the scores of injured, 25 were on life support, authorities said on Friday.
Witness Franck Sidoli said they had watched people mown down before the truck finally stopped just five meters away from him.
“A woman was there, they lost their son. Them son was on the ground, bleeding,” they told Reuters at the scene.
The driver, 31-year-old Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, was shot dead by officers at the scene. They were known to police for petty crimes but was not on a watch list of suspected militants. They had one criminal conviction, for road rage, and was sentenced to probation three months ago for throwing a wooden pallet at another driver.
The investigation “will try to determine whether they benefited from accomplices,” Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said. “It will also try to find out whether Mohamed Laouaiej Bouhlel had ties to Islamist terrorist organizations.”
“Although yesterday's attack has not been claimed, this sort of thing fits in perfectly with calls for murder from such terrorist organizations,” Molins added.
Bouhlel's ex-wife was in police custody, Molins said. They had three children. Police found one pistol and various fake weapons in theirs truck.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls told the evening news that Bouhlel was “one way or another” linked to radical Islam. “Yes, it is a terrorist act and we shall see what links there are with terrorist organizations.”
Yet despite numerous French officials from President Francois Hollande down describing it as a terrorist attack, by nightfall on Friday officials still had not disclosed any direct evidence linking Bouhlel with extremists.
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, asked if they could confirm the attacker's motives were linked to jihadism, said: “No. ... We have an individual who was not known to intelligence services for activities linked to jihadism.”
A U.S. official familiar with Washington's assessment said the attack was thought to have been carried out by a “lone wolf” inspired but not directed by Islamic State.
The former top terrorism investigator for the French judicial system said that while the attack fits the profile of the kind undertaken by militant groups, the available evidence suggests the attacker had no evident connection with militant organizations or ideology.
Jean-Louis Bruguiere, formerly the top Paris-based investigative magistrate handling terrorism-related cases, told Reuters no French or European intelligence or security agency had any trace on the suspect and no evidence has surfaced to connect them to any militant group or other suspects or even to casual contact with militant literature or propaganda.
They said so far there is no evidence Bouhlel had any association with any religious group or faction but that there was evidence they were estranged from their family and going through some kind of divorce.
DRIED BLOOD, SMASHED STROLLERS
Dawn broke on Friday with pavements smeared with dried blood. Smashed strollers, an uneaten baguette and other debris were strewn about. Small areas were screened off and what appeared to be bodies covered in blankets were visible.
The truck was still where it had come to rest, its windscreen riddled with bullets.
“I saw this enormous white truck go past at top speed,” said Suzy Wargniez, 65, who had watched from a cafe on the promenade.
At Nice's Pasteur hospital, medical staff were treating large numbers of injured. Waiting for friends being operated on was 20-year-old Fanny.
“The truck pushed me to the side. When I opened my eyes I saw faces I didn't know and started asking for help,” they told Reuters. “Some of my friends were not so lucky. They are having operations as we speak.”
Neighbors in the neighborhood in northern Nice where Bouhlel lived described them as handsome but an unsettling presence.
“I would say they were someone who was pleasing to women,” said neighbor Hanan, standing in the lobby of the apartment building where Bouhlel lived. “But they were frightening. They didn't have a frightening face, but ... a look. They would stare at the children a lot.”
Bouhlel's Tunisian home town Msaken is about 10 km (six miles) outside the coastal city of Sousse, where a gunman killed 38 people, mostly British holidaymakers, on a beach a year ago. Many people from the area have moved to France, including Nice, and money they send back has made it comparatively prosperous.
A former neighbor in Msaken told Reuters Bouhlel had left for France in 2005 after getting married, and had worked as a driver.
Relatives and neighbors in Msaken said Bouhlel was sporty and had shown no sign of being radicalized, including when they last returned for the wedding of a sister four years ago.
A nephew, Ibrahim, said they had called three days ago saying they were preparing a trip back for a family party. Bouhlel's brother, Jabeur, said they doubted their sibling was the attacker.
“Why would my brother do something like this?” they told Reuters, adding: “We've been calling them since yesterday evening but he's not responding.”

GRITTY METROPOLIS
Nice, a city of 350,000, has a history as a flamboyant aristocratic resort but is also a gritty metropolis, where Islamist radicalism has brewed, away from the scenic streets of its old town. It and the surrounding Alpes-Maritimes region, with a population of just over a million, are thought to have produced as many as 10 percent of the French citizens who have traveled to wage jihad in the Middle East.
After Thursday's attack, a state of emergency imposed across France after the November attacks in Paris was extended by three months and military and police reservists were to be called up.
“France is filled with sadness by this new tragedy,” Hollande said in a dawn address that called it an act of terrorism.
Nice-Matin journalist Damien Allemand had been watching the firework display when the truck tore by. After taking cover in a cafe, they wrote on their paper's website of what they saw: “Bodies every five meters, limbs ... Blood. Groans.”
“The beach attendants were first on the scene. They brought water for the injured and towels, which they placed on those for whom there was no more hope.”
Police carried out a controlled explosion on a white van near the home, blowing the doors open and leaving shattered glass all around. It was not clear what they found.
CRITICISM
With presidential and parliamentary elections less than a year away, French opposition politicians seized on what they described as security failings that made it possible for the truck to career 2 km (1.5 miles) through large crowds before it was finally halted.
Christian Estrosi, a security hardliner who was mayor of Nice until last month and is now president of the wider Riviera region, had written on the eve of the attack to Hollande to demand more funding for police.
“As far as I'm concerned, I demand answers, and not the usual stuff,” Estrosi told BFM TV hours after the attack, questioning whether the government had provided enough national police officers for the fireworks display.
France is a major part of a U.S.-led mission conducting air strikes and special forces operations against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and has also sent troops to West Africa to battle Islamist insurgents.
“We will further strengthen our actions in Syria and Iraq,” Hollande said, calling the tragedy - on the day France marks the 1789 revolutionary storming of the Bastille prison in Paris - an attack on liberty by fanatics who despised human rights.
“We are facing a battle that will be long because facing us is an enemy that wants to continue to strike all people and all countries that have values like ours,” they said.
France is home to the European Union's biggest Muslim population, mostly descended from immigrants from North African former colonies. It maintains a secular culture that allows no place for religion in schools and civic life, which supporters say encourages a common French identity but critics say contributes to alienation in some communities.
The Paris attack in November was the bloodiest among a number in France and Belgium in the past two years. On Sunday, a weary nation had breathed a sigh of relief that the month-long Euro 2016 soccer tournament had ended without serious incident.

Four months ago, Belgian Islamists linked to the Paris attackers killed 32 people in Brussels. Recent weeks have also seen major attacks in Bangladesh, Turkey and Iraq.
U.S. President Barack Obama condemned what they said “appears to be a horrific terrorist attack”. In televised remarks they later said the United States would stand with France and keep up the fight against Islamic State: “We will not be deterred. We will not relent.”
On social media, Islamic State supporters celebrated the high death toll and posted a series of images, one showing a beach purporting to be that of Nice with white stones arranged to read “IS is here to stay” in Arabic.
Rep. Kevin McCarthy (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)
If there were an award for failing upward in this town, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) would be a sure-fire winner. The House majority whip is poised to replace the primary-defeated Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.) as House majority leader on Thursday. Yet, in none of the glowing profiles of the leader-in-waiting have I read about their failure in their current job.
All of the pieces I've read have focused on “McCarthy's strong personal relationships” with the Republican majority, on how they are “the likable majority whip who spent an inordinate amount of time getting to know almost every Republican lawmaker” and on how they have donated to their campaigns. But those stories neglect to point out that McCarthy could never deliver those loyal members when House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) needed them most. “If the speaker sets the legislative agenda and the majority leader lays out the game plan,” The Post's Ed O'Keefe writes today, “it's the whip who ensures that legislation will pass.” And time and time again, McCarthy failed.
There was the embarrassing failure in 2011 to pass a two-month extension of the payroll tax cut negotiated by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). There was the abrupt decision to withdraw Boehner's plan to avoid the “fiscal cliff” in 2012 “after failing to win support from their fellow Republicans for a plan to let tax rates rise for millionaires,” as The Post reported then. There was the unheard-of failure to pass the farm bill last year. And then there were the fights over raising the debt ceiling that rattled world markets and left Boehner's leadership crippled.
As the speaker, all those failures and others I didn't mention fall squarely on Boehner's shoulders. But as I wrote after the payroll tax cut fiasco three years ago, that there have been so many legislative failures should call into question not only McCarthy's ability to count, but also whether they have Boehner's best interests at heart. McCarthy's promotion to the No. 2 spot in the House leadership won't make things any better for Boehner or the chamber they try so hard to lead.

President Barack Obama invited several entertainers to the White House for a “youth empowerment” program — including rapper Rick Ross, who was just indicted for assaulting and kidnapping two workers they caught throwing a party at their 235-acre Fayetteville, Georgia home.
In 2013, the rapper lost a valuable footwear endorsement after they boasted in a song of spiking a woman's drink.
The April 15 White House event, ironically, was meant to help encourage young people to stay out of the criminal justice system.
The various musicians invited by Obama included Alicia Keys, Nicki Minaj, Busta Rhymes, Ludacris, Chance the Rapper, Wale, DJ Khaled, J. Cole, and Janelle Monae. The group was invited to the White House to help Obama formulate strategies for Obama's “My Brother's Keeper,” which Obama hopes will encourage black youths to stay on the right side of the law.
Ross, whose real name is William Roberts, was arrested last June for the assault. They were indicted on the charges last month. The rapper was arrested for allegedly pistol-whipping a man who had been doing repair work on their house. They were also charged with kidnapping for preventing the alleged assault victim from leaving the property.
The irony was highlighted when Ross's ankle monitor went off during their visit to the White House.
Ross/Williams has other entries in their police record. In 2008 they were arrested on gun and marijuana charges. During their arrest the rapper claimed affiliation with a gang in Miami Beach, Fla. Also in 2008, a YouTube entertainer named DJ Vlad filed charges against the rapper for assault and battery and alleged that Ross attacked them at the 2008 Ozone Awards. Also, in 2011, Ross was arrested in Shreveport, Louisiana, for possession of marijuana.
In 2013, Ross apologized for using rap lyrics that seemed to endorse slipping a drug into another person's drink. In their “U.O.E.N.O.” song, they sang, “Put molly all in their champagne/ They ain't even know it / I took their home and I enjoyed that/ They ain't even know it.” In 2013, they apologized for the song, saying:
Before I am an artist, I am a father, a son, and a brother to some of the most cherished women in the world. So for me to suggest in any way that harm and violation be brought to a woman is one of my biggest mistakes and regrets. As an artist, one of the most liberating things is being able to paint pictures with my words. But with that comes a great responsibility. And most recently, my choice of words was not only offensive, it does not reflect my true heart. And for this, I apologize. To every woman that has felt the sting of abuse, I apologize. I recognize that as an artist I have a voice and with that, the power of influence. To the young men who listen to my music, please know that using a substance to rob a woman of their right to make a choice is not only a crime, it's wrong and I do not encourage it. To my fans, I also apologize if I have disappointed you. I can only hope that this sparks a healthy dialogue and that I can contribute to it.
Because of the lyrics, shoemaker Reebok ended its endorsement deal with Ross.
Obama's White House has repeatedly decried what it claims to be a rape crisis at American universities. “An estimated one in five women has been sexually assaulted during their college years — one in five,” Obama claimed in 2014. “Of those assaults, only 12 percent are reported, and of those reported assaults, only a fraction of the offenders are punished,” they claimed.
For anybody whose once-normal, everyday life was suddenly shattered by an act of sexual violence, the trauma, the terror can shadow you long after one horrible attack. It lingers when you don't know where to go or who to turn to. It's there when you're forced to sit in the same class or stay in the same dorm with the person who raped you; when people are more suspicious of what you were wearing or what you were drinking, as if it's your fault, not the fault of the person who assaulted you. It's a haunting presence when the very people entrusted with your welfare fail to protect you … It insults our most basic values as individuals and families, and as a nation. We are a nation that values liberty and equality and justice.

Richard Branson, ever the pacesetter, is piloting something new -- but it has nothing to do with travel.
The founder of Virgin Group and their wife, Joan, are part of the first cohort of non-U.S. billionaires who have signed up to give away half their wealth to charity through the Giving Pledge.
Twelve signatories from countries including Russia, South Africa, Australia, Germany, India, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Malaysia have signed on to the non-binding moral contract started by Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates in 2010. The pledge aims to give wealthy people more authority over where their fortunes are donated during their lifetime.
The Giving Pledge initially included only U.S. billionaires because, as Buffett told Forbes, "I felt we had our hands full in the U.S."
But going international was no easy task, Forbes reported. Gates and Buffett held dinners with deep-pocketed leaders in places such as China and Saudi Arabia, encountering cultural barriers such as a desire to preserve family wealth.
Differences aside, many of the benevolent billionaires decided to give for the same reasons U.S. pledgers donate: Newly enlisted international signatories said they see giving back as integral to their business ventures.
“As a young man, I never set out to make money,” Branson wrote in their pledge letter. “We set out to create things that we could be proud of and try to make a difference.”
Vladimir Potanin, Russian nickel and media mogul, wrote in their letter that they joined to instill certain values in their children.
"The decision I made is not just an attempt to be remembered as a philanthropist," they wrote. "I also see it as a way to protect my children from the burden of the extreme wealth, which may deprive them of any motivation to achieve anything in life on their own.”
The last big influx of Giving Pledge members happened in September, when 11 families joined. Past notable signatories include Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and Intel Chairman Emeritus Gordon Moore.
Signing the pledge is as an opportunity for wealthy people to give in a “smarter” way, Bill Gates told the Wall Street Journal in September.
“This new group brings extensive business and philanthropic experience that will enrich the conversation about how to make philanthropy as impactful as possible,” they said. “Their thoughtfulness and deep commitment to philanthropy are an inspiration to me, and I'm sure to many others as well.”

(Reuters) - Eight offshore banks are the subject of the United States federal grand jury investigations examining whether they helped Americans evade taxes, a sign that authorities may be ready to issue subpoenas to those banks as part of a crackdown on offshore tax cheating.

In a highly unusual action late on Monday, the U.S. Department of Justice disclosed the probes on a website page discussing its tax division's Offshore Compliance Initiative. It did not identify the eight banks by name, a move that would have been a felony under criminal procedure rules, and removed the reference on Tuesday.
The disclosure that eight offshore banks are under criminal investigation comes amid efforts by certain Swiss banks to reach a settlement with U.S. authorities over their offshore private banking services. Those talks have bogged down over questions of immunity for foreign bankers, among other issues.
Much of the campaign has focused on Switzerland, and the Justice Department said in the website disclosure that it had “dealt fabled Swiss bank secrecy a devastating blow and provided tools that should yield information on thousands of additional U.S. offshore account holders who have undisclosed accounts at UBS and other banks.”
SUBPOENAS
People briefed on the latest disclosure said it appeared to set the stage for the Justice Department to issue unusual subpoenas to try to compel the eight banks to turn over American client names and data.
The rarely issued subpoenas, known as Bank of Nova Scotia subpoenas, allow a court presiding over a grand jury investigation to force a foreign bank to produce data and records via its U.S. presence. The subpoenas can only be issued once a grand jury investigation has been opened.
While some of the Swiss and Swiss-style banks under scrutiny have U.S. branches and operating licenses, others have representative offices or no formal presence. authorities may try to argue that those latter banks, by dint of being suspected of having conducted private banking services for wealthy Americans via telephone and email, still have a U.S. presence. They may also try to argue that offshore banks with no formal U.S. presence still have a presence through correspondent banking relationships with U.S. banks.
Charles Miller, a Justice Department spokesperson, declined on Tuesday to comment.
Issuing the subpoenas requires approval from the highest levels of the Justice Department.
“The subpoenas are rarely issued because of the diplomatic sensitivity that surrounds them,” said Jeffrey Neiman, a former federal prosecutor in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who worked on the criminal case against UBS AG.
UBS paid a $780 million fine in 2009 to avert indictment over charges it sold offshore private banking services that enabled wealthy Americans to evade taxes. It later turned over 4,450 American client names, a watershed in Swiss bank secrecy.
NEW QUESTIONS
UBS's $2.3 billion rogue-trading loss, which has rattled global banks, may also inject new questions over the level of fine that Swiss banks may be required to pay.
In August, the Justice Department's second in command, Deputy Attorney General James Cole, sent a letter to 10 Swiss banks and foreign banks with Swiss outposts, including three Israeli banks, demanding that they turn over broad statistical information on their American clients.
It was not immediately clear how many of those banks were among the eight under grand jury investigation.
Nevertheless, the Cole letter signals a potential dual-track approach by U.S. authorities — one focused on a global settlement and the other focused on prosecution.
Last week, the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service said it had made major progress cracking down on international tax evasion. It said about 30,000 people had voluntarily declared offshore accounts as part of an amnesty program and it had collected about $2.7 billion as a result.
According to the Justice Department's website, about 150 grand jury investigations of offshore banking clients have been initiated. Charges have been brought in 30 cases, resulting in two convictions and 24 guilty pleas. Four cases await trial.
Credit Suisse Group AG and its bankers and clients have also come under scrutiny by U.S. authorities.
Also that month, several former Credit Suisse bankers, including former North American offshore banking chief Markus Walder, were indicted on charges of conspiring to defraud the government by helping wealthy Americans evade taxes.

Last Season
The Carolina Hurricanes had a rough season in 2013-2014, missing the playoffs for their fifth straight year. They finished with a record of 36-35-11, good for 83 points. They scored 203 goals (23rd in the NHL) and allowed 230 (17th in the NHL). They finished seventh in the Metropolitan, and were just 4 points out of last place in the division.
A small part of the Hurricanes' struggles came from missing starting goaltender Cam Ward, who only played 30 games for Carolina. Even when Ward did play, they aren't that good: they had a GAA of 3.06 and a save percentage of .898%. However, they did find themselves a potential franchise goalie in 28 year old Anton Khudobin, who went 19-14-1 with a save percentage of .926% and a GAA of 2.30 in 36 games.
A huge bright spot for the Carolina Hurricanes was 21-year-old center Jeff Skinner, who scored 33 goals and finished with 54 points, which was their highest total since their rookie season in 2010-2011, when they had 63. Eric Staal had a quietly good season with 21 goals and 40 assists in 79 games. Andrej Sekera had a nice season as well, with 44 points (11 goals, 33 assists) and a +7 in 74 games. The Hurricanes needed Sekera to be a top pairing defenseman, and they rose to the occasion. They won't be confused for an All-Star any time soon though.
Ron Hainsey was a pleasant surprise for Carolina, driving possession well and being a decent second pairing defenseman for the Hurricanes. 21 year old Justin Faulk was a member of the United States Olympic Hockey Team and emerged as one of the best young defensemen in hockey. 19-year-old center Elias Lindholm was able to hold their own, scoring 21 points.
The Carolina Hurricanes' failure of a season in 2013-2014 was largely due to the lack of production from certain players. Alexander Semin had an alright season with 22 goals and 42 points, but the Hurricanes were probably expecting a bit more from him. Jordan Staal, who the Carolina Hurricanes traded a first round pick and Brandon Sutter for in 2012, had just 40 points (15 goals, 25 assists) in 82 games. Jiri Tlusty, after scoring 38 points in 48 games in 2012-2013, was expected to be a big contributor for the Carolina Hurricanes in 2013-2014, but they had just 30 points in 68 games.
The lack of success for the Carolina Hurricanes in 2013-2014 lead to head coach Kirk Muller and their coaching staff being fired, as well as general manager Jim Rutherford.
Puck Drop Preview: 2014-2015 Carolina Hurricanes
Offseason Changes:
The biggest offseason changes for the Carolina Hurricanes happened in the front office and on the coaching staff. Incumbents Muller (head coach) and Rutherford (general manager) were both fired after the regular season. They were replaced by head coach Bill Peters and general manager Ron Francis. Bill Peters was an assistant coach for the Detroit Red Wings for the past three seasons and has served as a head coach in the AHL.
When Carolina announced those two changes, I expected them to make big changes on the ice as well, especially after such a disappointing season. That was not the case, but they did make a few signings. They added forward Ben Holmstrom from the Philadelphia Flyers, forward Jay McClement and goaltender Drew MacIntyre from the Toronto Maple Leafs, and forward Brad Malone from the Colorado Avalanche. They also signed defenseman Tim Gleason. However, none of these players are expected to play huge roles with the Hurricanes.
They were able to re-sign several of their free agents. They signed Hainsey to a very reasonable contract. Hainsey, even at their worst, is still a very serviceable NHL defenseman and should serve as a mentor to the younger blue liners, along with Gleason. They re-signed defensemen Brett Bellemore, Michal Jordan, and Rasmus Rissanen to two-way deals. Both should provide blue-line depth in case of injuries. Re-signed forwards Justin Shugg, Zach Boychuk, Greg Nemisz, and Jared Staal, who was signed to a two-way deal, should provide forward depth if needed. They also re-signed Tlutsy.
They lost a few players due to free agency. They lost backup goaltender Justin Peters to their division rivals, the Washington Capitals. They also lost forward Manny Malhotra to the Montreal Canadiens, forward Brett Sutter to the Minnesota Wild, and defenseman Matthew Corrente to the Tampa Bay Lightning.
2014-15 Lineup Projection:
The Carolina Hurricanes starting lineup should not be too different from last year's. The fourth line will probably be different, but outside of that, it will be mostly the same roster. The first line is expected to feature arguably the three most important forwards to the Carolina Hurricanes in Skinner, Eric Staal, and Semin. The second line should feature Tlutsy on the left, Jordan Staal in the center, and either Patrick Dwyer or Elias Lindholm on the right. This mostly depends on how the Carolina Hurricanes view Lindholm. If they truly want them to be a center, a third line center role might be what's best for him, at least to start the season.
The third line will probably feature Nathan Gerbe (who holds the distinction of being the smallest player in the NHL), Lindholm, and Riley Nash. The fourth line should feature Brad Malone, Jay McClement, and Zach Boychuk. Guys like Chris Terry will provide depth.
Jeff Skinner – Eric Staal – Alexander Semin
Jiri Tlusty – Jordan Staal – Patrick Dwyer
Nathan Gerbe – Elias Lindholm – Riley Nash
Brad Malone – Jay McClement – Zach Boychuk
Chris Terry
On the defensive end, the Carolina Hurricanes will be pretty similar to last season as well. Their first line pairing looks to be Andrej Sekera and Justin Faulk. They were the best pairing for the Canes last season, and I don't expect the coaching staff to try to mess with their chemistry, though I'm sure they'd like it if a younger defenseman grabbed Sekera's spot. Ryan Murphy and Ron Hainsey will likely be the second pairing. Murphy might wind up taking Sekera's spot if they can stay healthy. Hainsey, as I said earlier, should be a pretty decent top four defensemen for them. Their third pairing will probably feature two of three veteran defensemen: Tim Gleason, John-Michael Liles, and Jay Harrison. The veteran who isn't a member of the third pairing will likely serve as the seventh defenseman.
Andrej Sekra-Justin Faulk
Ron Hainsey- Ryan Murphy
Tim Gleason- Jay Harrison
John-Michael Liles
I'm very curious to see what the Carolina Hurricanes do at goaltender. Cam Ward might be the starter by default since he's the one making the huge bucks. On the other hand, Anton Khudobin played quite well last season, but the main question with them is can they repeat last season?
Cam Ward
Anton Khudobin
Players to Watch:
Jeff Skinner: Jeff Skinner is by far the Carolina Hurricanes' best player. Their future depends on him. After a great rookie season, they struggled for the next two years, but they had a very nice campaign in 2013-2014. If the Carolina Hurricanes have a prayer of making the playoffs in 2014-2015, that prayer is named Jeff Skinner. He'll need to have a career season for the Hurricanes to contend for the playoffs. They have a lot of talent, but has yet to put it all together. When they do, watch out.
Cam Ward: This might be Cam Ward's last chance with the Hurricanes. They have certainly shown signs of greatness, but he's inconsistent and worse, they can't stay healthy. Ward has their back against the wall this season. For better or for worse, Cam Ward is going to show the Carolina Hurricanes what he's made of this season.
Eric Staal: Arguably the best of the Staal brothers, Eric had a quietly good season in 2013-2014. However, the Hurricanes did not shell out big bucks to them for them to have “quietly good seasons”. If Carolina has a good season this year, Eric Staal's going to be a huge reason why.
On the Rise:
Elias Lindholm: Lindholm is a guy who the Carolina Hurricanes need to figure out what to do with. They had them playing wing most of last season, but they are a natural center. The Hurricanes must decide what to do with him. If they don't think he's a future center, they should place them at wing. If they want them to be a center, they should definitely put them at center. That would also help the Hurricanes be deeper at down the middle.
Justin Faulk: Justin Faulk earned their status as a top pairing defenseman last season. He's already very good defensively, but he's still developing their game on offense. He's a very important part of the Carolina Hurricanes' future and I'm expecting them to have a big season to cement their status as a top pairing defenseman.
Ryan Murphy: Ryan Murphy could be primed to have the kind of season that Justin Faulk had last season. They were thrown into the fire last season, playing 48 games and scoring 12 points. They should be seeing second pairing minutes this season. If they develop and grows well, they might be paired with Justin Faulk on the top defensive pairing by the end of the season.
On the Decline:
Jordan Staal: When the Carolina Hurricanes traded a first round pick and Brandon Sutter to the Pittsburgh Penguins for Jordan Staal back in 2012, they thought they were getting a big piece to their puzzle. After their disappointing 2013-2014 season, they were probably wrong in thinking that. Jordan Staal needs to put up better numbers to justify their top 6 forward status.
Jiri Tlutsy: After having a very nice season in 2012-2013 (mostly thanks to a shooting percentage that was close to 20%), Tlutsy regressed in 2013-2014. He's still a somewhat productive player, but he's probably never going to be what they were in 2012-2013 ever again.
Alexander Semin: I'm a huge fan of Semin, but they seem to be trending in the wrong direction, especially for someone who has a $7 million cap hit until 2018. They have yet to break the 50 point barrier in any season since joining the Carolina Hurricanes. Part of that can be chalked up to the lockout-shortened 2012-2013 season and injuries last season, but Semin has to be better if the Carolina Hurricanes want to have success.
2014-15 Season Expectations:
Expectations are not going to be high for Carolina this season. Every other team in the Metropolitan Division improved in some way, while the Hurricanes did not. Therefore, it's very likely that the Hurricanes finish in dead last in the division.
This season's success will not be judged by wins for the Carolina Hurricanes. It's going to be judged by the development of their younger players and by figuring out what to do with the rest of their roster. I wouldn't be surprised to see a few of the veterans traded at the deadline, especially if their prospects push for spots on the NHL roster.
However, there is hope for the Hurricanes. A large reason for their lackluster 2013-2014 season was the lack of production from a group of veterans. If those veterans produce like they were expected to produce last season and their young players continue to develop and improve, they might be playoff contenders, though it would take a lot going right for Carolina and a lot going wrong for other teams in order for that to happen.

It's time for us -- as a people -- to respect Alex Smith.
 They are not the system quarterback you remember from Jim Harbaugh's first season in San Francisco. Smith's performance against the New Orleans Saints in the 2011 NFL playoffs was one high-profile indicator, as was their lights-out showing in a 45-44 Wild Card Weekend loss to the Indianapolis Colts last month.
Seriously, take another look at what Smith did in that Colts game: 30 of 46 for 378 yards, four touchdown passes, no interceptions and a 119.7 passer rating. They added 57 yards on eight carries for good measure. Andrew Luck deserved plenty of credit for their role in the Colts' epic comeback, but nobody seems to remember that Luck wasn't the best quarterback on the field that day.
No matter. Smith proved their point (again). On Saturday at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, Smith looked ahead with optimism.
"I'm very excited, if you look at our last eight or nine games offensively, we really did some good things and took off a little bit there," Smith said, according to The Kansas City Star. "And we got some momentum heading into the offseason. Obviously the playoff game was tough to take, but there are some positive things, too."
The Chiefs evolved into a more pass-heavy attack in the second half of the season as Smith gained the trust of coach Andy Reid. The quarterback said the bond "kind of just happened naturally."
"It was our first year in the offense. We didn't turn the ball over, we were opportunistic in the red zone, but yes we didn't really have the entire playbook at hand, and that's to be expected in the first year with a lot of new faces," they said. "So as the year went on and we got more comfortable and coach Reid got more comfortable with us and their staff, they started to trust us with more and we showed that we could handle it. By the end, I was feeling really good about things."
Keep an eye on the Chiefs on offense in 2014. They scored 35 points in five of their last seven games, including four games with more than 40 points. Something is cooking in K.C.
In the latest "Around The League Podcast," the guys ponder the future of the Super Bowl teams and break down the teams who intrigue them most this offseason.
As the mid-way point of 2017 arrives, both of NASA's Commercial Crew Program service providers are making significant progress toward the first uncrewed test flights of their Dragon and Starliner capsules. At their second quarter 2017 meeting, the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel noted this progress while also discussing outstanding concerns regarding the program and vehicles as well as the positive steps being taken to address these matters.
Commercial Crew progress:
During last month's NASA Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) second quarter meeting in Huntsville, Alabama, the panel noted the “significant progress” both Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) providers are making toward their first uncrewed demo flights.
Currently, SpaceX is on track to be the first to perform their uncrewed flight, known as SpX Demo-1, with Dr. Donald McErlean reporting to the ASAP that the flight continues to target a launch later this year.
Currently, both NASA and SpaceX hold that SpX Demo-1 will fly by the end of the year – though L2 level KSC scheduling claims the mission has potentially slipped to March 2018.
Regardless, SpX Demo-1 will be followed – under the current plan – by Boeing's uncrewed OFT (Orbital Flight Test) in mid-2018.
Notwithstanding the ultimate commencement of the Commercial Crew Program (CCP) flight operations, the ASAP noted its concern and recommendations regarding CCP provider System Engineering & Integration (SE&I) process and controls.
In their opening statement to the meeting, Dr. Patricia Sanders, ASAP Chair, noted the two recent mishaps of commercial launch vehicles.
While one of those “two recent mishaps” is obviously the AMOS-6 conflagration of the Falcon 9 during Static Fire last year, what the second one is in reference to is somewhat nebulous – as “mishap” is not a word usually applied to situations that do not result in the loss of a vehicle.
Nonetheless, Dr. Sanders' statement referenced both CCP providers, potentially pointing toward last year's close call with the Atlas V during the OA-6 Cygnus launch or perhaps this year's hydraulic issues as the second of the “two recent mishaps”.
Specifically, Dr. Sanders' noted that “In the case of two recent mishaps on commercial launch vehicles, the Panel believes that the underlying root causes could be traced to escapes on systems engineering and integration (SE&I) processes and controls,” states the minutes from the second quarter ASAP meeting.
To this end, the ASAP's previously put forward a recommendation at a meeting in first quarter 2017 that NASA “require the commercial crew providers to produce verifiable evidence of the practice of rigorous, disciplined, and sustained SE&I principles in support of NASA certification and operation of commercial crew transportation services to the International Space Station (ISS).”
Based on the wording of the CCtCap contracts, both providers are allowed to utilize their corporate policies rather than NASA-traditional SE&I processes; however, the contracts also stipulate that NASA will confirm – through documentation, requirements verification, and deliverables – that both company's have adhered to SE&I principles.
Nonetheless, the ASAP “remains concerned.”
According to the minutes of Dr. Sanders' remarks, “the ASAP remains concerned that no amount of insight or oversight by the CCP can ensure that the appropriate level of engineering discipline and control is employed unless the providers have internalized the need for it and made it an inherent part of their corporate culture.”
While each provider was not mentioned by name, the minutes reflect that “one provider has a history of employing rigorous SE&I practices. However, they need to continue to ensure that these controls are not employed blindly but with an awareness of the rationale for doing so.
“The other provider has placed a value on agility and rapid problem-solving with beneficial results. They are also showing signs of evolving to reconcile their approach with the benefits and need for discipline and control.
“However, they need to ensure that the evolution reflects an inherent desire to adopt the tenets of systems engineering.”
Dr. Sanders' opening statement closed with a reminder of an already-established ASAP recommendation that “Regardless of the methodology employed, both providers need to demonstrate that the proper controls are in place to ensure hardware is properly qualified, hazards are identified and appropriately mitigated, and the system is employed within the constraints of that qualification.”
As the meeting progressed (which covered a wide-range of NASA-related programs), Dr. McErlean presented a dedicated Commercial Crew Program briefing.
A large portion of this section, unsurprisingly, focused on the LOC (Loss Of Crew) gap between what Dragon and Starliner are independently capable of providing v. what the CCtCap contracts require of them.
As previously reported by NASASpaceflight.com, the CCtCap contracts establish a minimum baseline requirement that Dragon and Starliner each meet a LOC criteria of 1 in 270 – meaning for every 270 flights, only one would result in an LOC event.
Currently, there is a gap in what the data analysis shows both Starliner and Dragon are capable of providing and that 1 in 270 requirement.
While NASA has rightly not made the current LOC number for each vehicle public (as both providers are still working on this requirement), Kathy Lueders, NASA's CCP manager, stated earlier this year to the NASA Advisory Council that “I will tell you that we are having a hard time getting to 1 in 270. But we're not done yet.”
While it might seem arbitrary, the 1 in 270 number is actually linked directly to the Space Shuttle.
At the end of the Shuttle Program in 2011, NASA determined the Shuttle to have an actual LOC number – based on all 135 flights – of 1 in 65.
This number was used as an initial benchmark by NASA, which decided that all U.S. crew vehicles – commercial or government – from 2011 onward should meet a safety factor 10 times that of Shuttle, or an LOC requirement of 1 in 650.
That was quickly determined to be completely unfeasible by all parties involved, and a new – obtainable – benchmark of 1 in 270 was set.
However, after NASA set this requirement and signed the CCtCap contracts with SpaceX and Boeing, more stringent MMOD (Micro Meteoroid Orbiting Debris) protection requirements were imposed on everyone (NASA included).
This new MMOD requirement has made it “challenging” to reach the 1 in 270 LOC benchmark.
At the NAC meeting in March, Ms. Lueders stated that SpaceX and Boeing were “still updating MMOD protection and a few other critical areas including looking at operational controls, and when we get through all that we'll be in a better place to talk about our final LOC projection.”
At the ASAP meeting, Dr. McErlean reminded the panel that the LOC contract requirements were a recommendation of the ASAP and that the panel remains happy it was included because the requirement “appeared to drive systemic behavior by both providers … in making their systems substantially safer than they might have been without such an incentive and [that both providers] have achieved considerable progress from their initial LOC estimates.”
However, Dr. McErlean noted that “the threshold values [are] acknowledged to be challenging, and both providers are still striving to meet that precise number.”
From here, a discussion that NASA might have to accept the risk and/or that waivers might have to be processed if the LOC requirement can't be met took center stage.
According to the ASAP meeting minutes, Dr. McErlean said that “While these LOC numbers were known to be challenging, and both providers have been working toward meeting the challenge, it is conceivable that in both cases the number may not be met.”
However, Dr. McErlean cautioned the ASAP and NASA about rushing to judgement on the current and whatever the final LOC number for each vehicle is.
“The ASAP is on record agreeing with the Program that one must be judicious in how one applies these statistical estimates. In the case of LOC, the numbers themselves depend very heavily on the orbital debris model used to develop the risk to the system [as] orbital debris is a driving factor in determining the potential for LOC.
“The orbital debris models have been used and validated to some degree, but they are not perfect.
“One must be wary of being too pernicious in the application of a specific number and must look at whether the providers have expended the necessary efforts and engineering activity to make the systems as safe as they can and still perform the mission.”
To that last point, Dr. McErlean reported that both providers indeed “expended the necessary efforts and engineering activity to make the systems as safe as they can.”
Importantly, too, Dr. McErlean noted that there was no evidence that spending more money on closing the LOC gap for both providers “could [make] their systems considerably safer.”
The ASAP at large concurred with this finding and noted their pleasure at the progress made in closing the LOC gap for both Dragon and Starliner.
However, the panel did discuss the possible necessity “for NASA to do a formal risk acceptance of the variance from the requirement.”
To this point, they ASAP discussed a recommendation of how NASA would do this – including the need for a formal and “complete presentation of the alternatives and the consequences” as well as “the rationale for the path that [is] ultimately chosen” for risk acceptance before any such rationale is signed off on by the appropriate authority.
In this case, Mr. John Frost noted that that authority is likely “at the highest levels of NASA.”
Importantly, though, the ASAP meeting wasn't just focused on the panel's concerns. Considerable time was dedicated to a discussion and review of the progress both providers continue to make and where each provider is in terms of schedule milestones for their first uncrewed demo flights.
Presently, Boeing is moving through software release for Starliner, and the Starliner STA (Structural Test Article) is progressing through its test regime.
Meanwhile, the first Starliner spacecraft – the one that will fly the OFT mission next year – has undergone initial power activation, and the builds for Starliner spacecrafts two and three are progressing inside Boeing's Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center.
For SpaceX, Dragon has completed its first pressurized space suit test and final assembly of the craft for SpX Demo-1 has begun – all while SLC-39A at Kennedy is undergoing final acceptance testing ahead of the upcoming installation of the Crew Access Arm onto the pad's Fix Service Structure tower.
Moreover, the new, full-thrust (Block 5) Merlin 1D engines are in developmental hot fire testing at McGregor, and NASA has received the detailed CDR (Critical Design Review) of the engine for crew mission certification.
Finally, the ASAP noted that “Both providers have completed parachute testing for landings and are moving into production and qualification.”
Moreover, SpaceX and Boeing have implemented solutions to several issues flagged by NASA toward the end of last year, and very few new issues have been identified to date.

BEIJING (Reuters) - An explosion in a Sinopec Corp oil pipeline killed 35 people in Qingdao in eastern China on Friday, causing a blaze that took several hours to bring under control and halting operations at a major oil port, media and ship brokers said.

Qingdao is one of China's largest crude oil import terminals, supplying at least two major Sinopec refineries — the Qingdao plant and Sinopec Qilu Petrochemical Corp — as well as many small, independent refineries.
A Chinese trader said the explosion would disrupt crude flows into China as the blast involved a major pipeline supplying several refineries.
The explosion in the underground pipeline caused a huge hole to appear in the roadway above and state television showed a truck that had fallen into it, with a residential apartment block in the background.
President Xi Jinping called on local authorities to “spare no effort to rescue the injured and strengthen safety to eradicate such incidents”, state news agency Xinhua said.
The Huangdao oil terminal in Qingdao had stopped operations, ship brokers and a port official said.
The local government said on its microblog that the blast occurred at 10:30 a.m. (0230 GMT) as workers were trying to repair leaks in the pipeline. It said oil had spilled into the port, which had also caught fire.
However, a port official said: “The port was not affected by the pipeline blast, but tankers were told to sail away from the port as a safety precaution.”
Sinopec confirmed on its microblog that the explosion was caused by a leak in the Huangwei crude oil pipeline. It said the fire was put out at 1 p.m.
State television CCTV, which gave the figure of 35 dead, said 166 people were injured.
“Early investigations showed the spilled oil flowed into the municipal grid, which caused the explosion,” the local government said, giving no further details about the grid.
SEA POLLUTION
It said the oil spill had spread across 3,000 square meters of seawater.
Two pipelines at state oil giant PetroChina's storage site in Dalian exploded in 2010, causing a big oil spill and disrupting crude supply and oil product exports at its refineries for weeks.
A witness in the city said there was a power cut in the area lasting for about two hours after the blast.
The China International Marine Containers (CIMC) factory located nearby closed for a period to rehouse about 500 workers whose dormitories had been damaged.

“Ambulances were still operating after 1 p.m. Glass windows in our dormitories were broken. It's terrifying,” said worker Zhao Kai.
Sinopec officials could not immediately be reached for comment and it was unclear if there was any impact on the 240,000-barrel-per-day Sinopec Qingdao refinery, which receives imported crude oil cargoes from Huangdao port.
The affected crude oil pipeline connects Huangdao to the city of Weifang in the same province, Shandong.
Apple has launched a new web service called Maps Connect that allows small business owners to manage their listings on Apple Maps along with a tool for setting up indoor positioning in select areas. Companies can enter their own listings and verify via a phone call or email address.
The iBeacon-powered indoor mapping tool allows businesses to setup interior views of their businesses on Apple Maps to help guide users through their venues. This tool is currently limited only to locations that meet specific criteria, such as Wi-Fi throughout the building and at least 1 million visitors per year.
Updates to both services will reportedly take about a week to show up on Maps, according to Search Engine Land. A listing on Apple Maps means Siri will be able to find your business, so this tool could prove very powerful for small businesses that currently don't have any presence on Apple's mapping service.
The full terms for the indoor mapping service are below:
Rockies spring training 2013 should be, shall we say, intriguing.
That's an apt description, and certainly a charitable one, for a team coming off a 98-loss season. The issues confronting new Rockies manager Walt Weiss are varied and numerous.
Can they count on shortstop Troy Tulowitzki to be healthy, productive and a team leader? How productive can 39-year-old first baseman Todd Helton be in what's likely their final season? Who will play third base, and for how long? And can Wilin Rosario develop into a competent big-league catcher?
Of course, the biggest issue of all is starting pitching. Forced to go with four rookies in the rotation for much of last season, Colorado starters posted a major league-worst 5.81 ERA.
The projected core pitchers of that rotation — lefty Jorge De La Rosa and right-handers Juan Nicasio and Jhoulys Chacin — were supposed to deliver last season. Instead, injuries derailed them. A year later, they are being counted on again.
What optimism there is around the team comes from youthful talent in the field. From outfielders Carlos Gonzalez and Dexter Fowler, to rookie second baseman Josh Rutledge, to utilityman and .309 hitter Jordan Pacheco, the Rockies' lineup has a chance to be versatile and dangerous. In the field, however, there's much work to do. The Rockies' 122 errors were the most in the majors last season.
First base
Todd Helton is the starter, but there are contingency plans already in place. Michael Cuddyer, Tyler Colvin and Jordan Pacheco will get a lot of playing time at first base during spring training. Helton, entering what's likely the final season of a brilliant career, is returning from hip surgery last August. At age 39 and with a history of back problems, there are no guarantees of productivity. They played in only 69 games last season, hitting just .238 with a .343 on-base percentage, the second-lowest of their career, and 37 RBIs. The Rockies need more pop from their bat and also need their golden touch around the bag.
17: Home runs hit by the Rockies' first basemen last season, ranking 12th in the National League. Todd Helton hit only seven.
Second base
The expected starter is rookie Josh Rutledge, but they will have to battle DJ LeMahieu. Rutledge, promoted from Double-A Tulsa after the all-star break last season, filled in admirably for injured Troy Tulowitzki at shortstop. Now they slide over to second.
Rutledge posted a .345 average with 24 extra-base hits in their first 145 at-bats, but fatigue and a quadriceps injury brought them back to earth. They batted only .197 with just nine extra-base hits over their final 132 at-bats.
LeMahieu started at second the final two months of the season. They posted a .994 fielding percentage in 67 games there . They showed some pop late in the season, hitting .324 with 12 doubles, four triples, two homers and 20 RBIs over their final 55 starts.
.309: On-base percentage for the Rockies' second basemen in 2012, ranking 18th in baseball.
Shortstop
It's no stretch to say Troy Tulowitzki faces their biggest test since their 2007 rookie season. The two-time all-star must prove they can stay healthy and silence critics who say their 6-foot-3, 215-pound frame is too big for the rigors of playing shortstop and has led to troublesome leg-muscle injuries. They strained their left groin early in 2012; the injury lingered and affected their fielding and their production at the plate before they were shut down for the season. Tulo hit .287 with eight homers and 27 RBIs. Their .964 fielding percentage was the worst of their career.
Tulo remains confident that he's one of baseball's best shortstops and is eager to play for former shortstop Walt Weiss.
47: Games played by Troy Tulowitzki in 2012, their season spoiled by a groin injury that eventually required surgery to remove scar tissue.
Third base
The hot corner remains a concern. Chris Nelson, who enters spring training as the favorite to win the starting job, was terrific at the plate after the all-star break last year, hitting .344 with 12 doubles, two triples and 30 RBIs in 55 games. Their defense is a huge concern (.931 fielding percentage). Also in the mix are Jordan Pacheco (who struggled in their trial by fire at third base last year), DJ LeMahieu and Ryan Wheeler, who was acquired from the Arizona Diamondbacks for relief pitcher Matt Reynolds.
Nolan Arenado, a second-round draft pick in 2009, will be in camp again, but it's doubtful they will make the big-league team out of spring. They probably will open at Triple-A.
.942: Fielding percentage for the Rockies' third basemen in 2012, ranking 12th in the NL.
Catcher
One of the compelling story lines of spring training is Wilin Rosario's growth as a catcher. Did their offseason practice pay off? Last season, Rosario committed 13 errors and was charged with 21 passed balls, most in the big leagues in both categories — despite playing only 105 games as a catcher.
Expect Ramon Hernandez, 36, to return as the No. 2 catcher in large part because he's owed $3.2 million for the final year of their contract. A hand injury and a season-ending hamstring tear limited them to 52 games. Hernandez will be absent most of March while playing for Venezuela in the World Baseball Classic. That's one reason the Rockies signed veteran Yorvit Torrealba to a minor-league contract.
.530: Slugging percentage for Wilin Rosario, the highest for an NL rookie catcher since the Dodgers' Mike Piazza in 1993.
Outfield
The Rockies have strength in numbers. Left fielder Carlos Gonzalez (.303 average, 22 homers) is a returning all-star, and center fielder Dexter Fowler is coming off a breakout season in which they hit .300 with 13 homers, 53 RBIs and a .389 on-base percentage. Right fielder Michael Cuddyer was limited to 101 games because of an oblique injury but still drove in 58 runs and hit 16 homers. They will get plenty of playing time at first base, opening the door for Tyler Colvin, who batted .290 and drove in 72 runs in their first season with the Rockies.
Also in the outfield mix are speedy Eric Young Jr. and Charlie Blackmon, who hit .362 as a part-time starter in September.
314: RBIs by the Rockies' outfielders in 2012, ranking third in the NL. The team leader was Carlos Gonzalez (85 RBIs).
Rotation
Fans hoping for a major acquisition to prop up a wobbly rotation are no doubt disappointed. The Rockies enter spring training relying on Jorge De La Rosa, Jhoulys Chacin, Juan Nicasio and Jeff Francis. If that foursome stays healthy and pitches reasonably well, the Rockies would need only one youngster to make a giant leap forward. That group includes left-handers Drew Pomeranz and Christian Friedrich and right-handers Tyler Chatwood and Josh Outman. Right-hander Chris Volstad, who signed a minor-league deal in January, could be in the mix too.
5.81: ERA for the Rockies' starting pitchers in 2012, the worst in baseball and the second-worst in franchise history, behind a 6.19 ERA in 1999.
Bullpen
The Rockies' relievers were hardly lights out last season (35-30 record, 4.52 ERA). But assigned the burden of trying to bail out woeful starting pitching, they performed reasonably well. Right-hander Wilton Lopez, acquired from the Houston Astros for starting pitcher Alex White, posted a 2.17 ERA last season and showed a penchant for inducing groundballs. Rafael Betancourt enters spring training as the closer, but Lopez will get opportunities to show what they can do.
The left-right, eighth-inning tandem of Rex Brothers and Matt Belisle is solid. Adam Ottavino proved to be a solid middle reliever a year ago. Lefty Josh Outman and right-hander Rob Scahill also will be in the mix this spring.
657.0: Innings pitched by the Rockies' relievers in 2012, the most in big-league history.
Bench
The Rockies have a surplus of question marks, but they also have a lot of depth. Jordan Pacheco will get playing time at first base, third base and catcher. They hit .309 last year and became the first National League rookie to finish in the top five of the batting race since 1974. Outfielder Eric Young Jr. can provide instant offense late in a game, utilizing their speed and pinch-hitting ability. When they get on a roll — they hit .420, with five doubles, three homers and 15 runs scored in their final 19 games — he's dynamic. What the Rockies lack is a late-game slugger. Jason Giambi, no longer with the team, was supposed to be that last season but hit only one home run and drove in just eight runs in 89 at-bats.
13: Pinch hits by Eric Young Jr. in 2012, tied for second-most in the majors.
Hurling the Angry Birds at evil green pigs is fun and all, but maybe you'd like to get to know your feathered friends on a deeper level. You're in luck! Rovio, the Finnish company behind the wildly successful mobile game, is planning to launch a series of short animations starring all your favorite characters from Angry Birds this fall.
By creating an animated series, Rovio can get deeper into the characters that populate the Angry Bird games, said Nick Dorra, Rovio's head of animation, speaking at the MIPTV conference held in Cannes, France.
“It's about telling more engaging stories…and deeper thoughts, deeper feelings of the characters, such as why are they always so angry?” Dorra said.
So far, Rovio is planning a 52-episode series of animated shorts—all three minutes or under. Dorra said the company is in the process of developing a video app, and is hoping that the series will be available across all screens including mobile, PC and TV.
And if you're worried that 52 two-and-a-half to three-minute episodes aren't going to satisfy your need to know more about those livid birds, take heart: Dorra said that a full-length Angry Birds film is in development.
@WingedFish: #28 Yes, this is impressive. Most impressive, as Vader/Anakin would say.
@HyperBMan: #27 SMB has glitchy contact physics. Jumping over piranha plants like that is possible in-game, w/ no cheating. The glitchy contact physics help make the game (really good) speedrun material.
@3Dangerous3Dash: #23 The precedent to Nintendo Power was a newsletter called "The Nintendo Fun Club". The minus world glitch was documented in it. As for it's origins, I imagine someone who reached the L-pipe of 1-2 attempted running, &/or jumping, &/or backwards jumping to reach the top of the screen, to continue right.
There are multiple ver.s of the minus world in the Japanese ver. of the game. This was also documented in the same fun club newsletter. Btw, I don't know the full extent of it, but basically, the minus world works out like this: When the player runs across the top screen of 1-2, the game activates the "welcome to warp zone" on-screen text. When this happens, the game/program pointers for where the pipes lead to changes. By bypassing this, the player(Mario/Luigi) can access the default location for where the pipes' pointers were originally set to. In the game code/program, a blank space is actually 36. So, the "minus world" is actually world/level 36-1. This is further proven by the fact that not only does the hud show a " -1", but also the restart-after-game-over code functions as it should, if you should get a game over un the minus world.
@kyuubikid213: #7 Anyone can w/ practice. Don't doubt yourself.
@Shugo: #21 There are some glitches in the game that do this.
Again, SMB has glitchy contact physics, & also some random glitches like what Shugo pointed out.
This isn't hacked, to me. This is just a very practiced, & well-timed speed-run. This guy deserves props!
As I tweeted once during a Democratic debate, "Bernie Sanders' socialism has always been sadly nationalistic." Their politics, allegedly concerned with bettering the conditions of the nationally less well off at the expense of the more well off, always seems to cut off compassion at the water's edge.
And not just the compassion of "taking from some by force to give to others" but even the compassion of "allowing things to happen that will overwhelmingly benefit the less well off" around the globe, like doing business with them, buying what they have to sell.
Bernie Sanders is pretty much against that as well, as they revealed in an interview for the New York Daily News conducted last week.
They started off with a pro forma "I'm not anti-trade. We live in a global economy, we need trade."
But they go on to admit that their version of the only good trade—"fair trade"—has to be based on not trading with any nation whose wages tend to be lower than ours, "renegotiating all of the trade agreements that we have. And by establishing principles that say that what fair trade is about is you are going to take into consideration the wages being paid to workers in other countries....So if you are in Vietnam, where the minimum wage is 65¢ an hour, or you're in Malaysia, where many of the workers are indentured servants because their passports are taken away when they come into this country and are working in slave-like conditions, no, I'm not going to have American workers 'competing' against you under those conditions."
In other words, those whose productivity and standard of living make them really among the poor of the earth, President Sanders will make sure no freely chosen action of any American could possibly benefit them via trade, while they work hard to redistribute money from the global top .1 percent to the global 1 percent here in America.
This wicked man deliberately wants to make it impossible for Americans to do the thing that historically most guarantees helping the truly poor in the long term: supporting their jobs and economies.
Given that Sanders is a guy who thinks it's better that the government make you line up for rare and precious free bread than that a free and prosperous economy guarantees the wide availability of highly affordable bread in a free market, this should not be surprising, but it's still disgusting.
Elsewhere in the long interview, Sanders showed they pretty literally has no idea what he's talking about when it comes to "breaking up the banks" and "arresting financial executives" even though they are the absolute core of their appeal and message.
We roll on with our off-season filler by examining three things we believe the beloved club did right this past season. 2015 was a banner year for the club, with many of the issues that cropped up previously were being changed, eliminated, or reversed. ‘Can/Will the Hounds continue on the right path next season' will be one of the big questions asked as the league grows and team's fight for attention in a sports-mad city marches on.
1. Communication – The biggest thing that improved this season was the communication. While not perfect, the steps taken to put out more information and give mid-week updates about the club was tremendous. Now, we were finding out about unexpected loanees and roster moves, as opposed to new names and faces just appearing on the bench. Furthermore, the manager's and president's notes pieces in the gameday program were especially nice. Many members were making sure to take the time to read both works before the match.
2. Not Playing the USL Social Media Game – Stay with us on this one, it's a little different, we know. Throughout the season you would see times were the league was really trying to push something out on the Twitters or Facebooks. Sure enough, in the following hour, every club was out there putting out nearly identical messages. It was, at times, comical to see all the ducks line up and toe the line… except Pittsburgh. It was refreshing to see the Hounds not even acknowledge a lot of the useless polls, contests, and superlative ‘awards' initiatives that USL would throw out and watch as other clubs trip over themselves to hype up, with the Hounds laying back and saying ‘naw, we're good'. Granted this is the near opposite of the good communication point we made above, but when in comes to not playing nice with the league, we can't help but appreciate the (lack of) effort.
3. Bring the Community Together – This, obviously, is the big one. The team has had a terrible track record of bringing the local soccer community together. When your a 3rd division club in a city the expects the best teams in the best leagues, it can be rough. They made it even worse by alienating some segments of the soccer loving city. The worse done in the past 11 months to get everyone back on the same page was welcoming and refreshing. You could walk into Pipers and hear people discussing the team. Go to high school soccer matches and you would see a fair amount of Riverhounds merch in the stands. The bridges have started to be rebuilt, and while the person who started the construction isn't here anymore, the club can not let all that effort go to waste.
Remember that tonight is the American Outlaws/Steel Army Holiday Party. Everyone put some pants on (or not, you may get in regardless) and head down to Claddagh starting at 8pm. There was also be some awesome stuff being raffled away including a pair of Riverhounds season tickets, autographed kits and soccer balls. There will also be some US soccer related items. FIFA 16 will be hooked up for the gamers to do their thing. We can't wait to see everyone!

“So what is feminism? What do feminists believe? Namely, that American women are oppressed by a patriarchy hell-bent on keeping women down, and that men and marriage are expendable. . . .
“What feminists want is to make men and women interchangeable. . . .
“I am not a feminist because I don't believe feminists have an accurate understanding of human nature.”
— Susanne Venker
Great minds think alike, and Suzanne Venker sees the problem with feminism exactly as I see the problem with feminism. It is a War Against Human Nature aimed at using the coercive power of government to bring about an androgynous “equality” that ignores the actual differences between men and women. Feminism is a totalitarian movement to destroy civilization as we know it — and feminists say so themselves.
In their recent book Beauty and Misogyny, feminist Professor Sheila Jeffreys cites Andrea Dworkin as authority for indicting “the notion of beauty” as a “cultural practice . . . damaging to women,” an expression of “woman-hating culture.” Professor Jeffreys quotes Dworkin's 1974 book Woman Hating, specifically this sentence from Page 26:
“We recognize that it is the structure of the culture which engineers the deaths, violations, violence, and we look for alternatives, ways of destroying culture as we know it, rebuilding it as we can imagine it.” [Emphasis added.]
On the very first page of that book, Dworkin declared feminism a “fundamental revolutionary commitment,” explaining that the purpose of their “analysis of sexism” was “transformation of the social reality on every level . . . the development of revolutionary program and consciousness.” Feminism is a revolution to destroy “culture as we know it,” and can only be understood in terms of its essentially destructive purpose. It is too seldom mentioned nowadays that modern feminist movement emerged from the radical New Left of the 1960s. Shulamith Firestone used a mailing list of women involved in Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) to help organize what became known as the Women's Liberation Movement. They staged their first major national protest at the 1968 Miss America pageant, an event they said served “to further make women oppressed and men oppressors; to enslave us all the more in high-heeled, low-status roles.”
This claim that women are oppressed and enslaved by men remains the essential premise of feminist ideology and, as Suzanne Venker says, feminists insist that all women are victims of a “patriarchy hell-bent on keeping women down.” Feminism is a revolutionary movement to destroy this alleged oppression, “to make men and women interchangeable” in such a way that men would become “expendable” and irrelevant to women's lives. How could this be accomplished?
“Wilhelm Reich and Herbert Marcuse have written about the sexual dilemmas of modern civilization and proposed solutions combining aspects of Freudian theory and Marxian economic analysis. . . .
“Reich's analysis introduces the theoretical insight that women and gays have known instinctively: that civilization in its present form was designed for heterosexual men, and that its structure guarantees their authority within it. Thus, to change society by ending sexual suppression does not mean the end of civilization, but rather the end of civilization as we know it. . . .
“It was Herbert Marcuse who saw the critical function of homosexuals in ending repression. . . . Marcuse sees homosexuals as having an important place in history in helping to free sexuality, since they feel gay people have a more natural, totally erogenous sexuality.”
— Sidney Abbott and Barbara Love, Sappho Was a Right-On Woman: A Liberated View of Lesbianism (1972)
If you buy this weird mix of Freud and Marx, if you believe that sexual “repression” and male “authority” are the root of all evil, and that “gay people have a more natural, totally erogenous sexuality” — well, if you believe all that, congratulations, you're a feminist.
However, if you disagree with that — if you think Wilhelm Reich and Herbert Marcuse were a couple of dangerous kooks and are skeptical about a plan for “the end of civilization as we know it,” to bring about a society controlled by the authority of “liberated” lesbians — well, you're never going to be allowed to speak at Williams College:
Williams College students invited Suzanne Venker, a writer and longtime critic of feminism, to speak Tuesday night, but changed their minds and took back the invite for their talk, “One-Step Forward, Ten Steps Back: Why Feminism Fails.”
Venker had been invited to participate in a student-run, alumni-funded speaking series at Williams called “Uncomfortable Learning.” The program's purpose is to expose students to controversial voices and opinions they might not otherwise hear. Many of the speakers tend to be conservative or people whose views don't square with those of most students.
The students who run the series decided to cancel the event, co-president Zach Wood explained, after its Facebook page began to attract acerbic comments and “things got a little out of hand.” . . .
The concern, Wood explained, was that “people would get riled up while they were speaking,” maybe even throw things, and there wasn't time before the event to organize security. “You never know,” they said. “We're just trying to think ahead here. The last thing we wanted to do was do something destructive.”
You see how it is. Feminists in 1968 could denounce the Miss America pageant, lesbians in 1972 could cite Marxists and proclaim the wonders of “totally erogenous sexuality,” and Andrea Dworkin in 1974 could advocate a revolution “destroying culture as we know it,” but in 2015, no one is permitted to criticize feminism on a college campus.
American college students are living under a regime of intellectual totalitarianism. No one who dissents from this regime can appear on campus because “people would get riled up.”
You can read the full text of the speech Suzanne Venker planned to give at Williams College, but students at Williams College are prohibited from hearing what Suzanne Venker says — it is forbidden and impermissible. The soi-disant student journalists at Williams College declare that “Venker's views are wrong, offensive and unacceptable.”
Annual tuition at Williams College is $50,070 — parents are paying good money to make sure that their children never have to listen to anyone who might get them “riled up” by telling the truth about feminism.
In their book The War on Men, Suzanne Venker argues that “modern feminism . . . has severed the bond between the sexes, pitting men and women against one another,” that “the sexual revolution was a disaster. Men today have no respect for women and vice versa.” This is so obviously true that only stupid people (or Williams College students) could disagree, much less get “riled up” about it.

As a society, we reap the consequences of the unquestioned acceptance of the belief in evolution every day. It reduces human beings from being “made in the image of God” to being mere players in the game of survival of the fittest. Find hope. Find truth. Find answers today.
Why do young men walk into schools and start shooting? From Columbine to Dawson College to a small Amish community, today's newspapers report stories of young people without hope, without a sense of right and wrong, who end up destroying the lives of others with just the pull of a trigger. And it's not just young men in schools—this year in America, more than 1.8 million people will suffer a violent crime (SSBR on Crime) and up to 1.4 million babies will be killed (NRTL). And what about Africa? The Middle East? South America? Around the world, senseless violence destroys lives because some people no longer value life. Is there any hope? Is there any truth? Are there answers?
Every day we are inundated with evolution-based messages intended to remove the Creator from the fabric of our society, our lives, our thoughts. But if we evolved from lower life forms, then the Bible can't be trusted and life's supposed billion-year history is one of continual death and struggle. (See “What Should a Christian Think About Evolution?” and “10 Dangers of Theistic Evolution.”) If the Bible isn't true, then why should we be fair and kind and love our fellow human beings, as the Bible teaches ( Matthew 22:39 )? After all, evolution relies on survival of the fittest—no matter who gets in the way.
The Bible says something very different. Genesis tells us that we are created in God's image ( Genesis 1:27 ). We matter to God ( Psalm 8:4–5 )—we are fearfully and wonderfully made ( Psalm 139:14 ). We were not created through millions of years of violence and death, as evolutionists believe; God did not create us to be violent! Therefore, when we commit acts of violence and evil toward our fellow man, God is grieved. And God has been grieved by these recent acts of violence in the headlines.
The Creator holds each person accountable for their sinful deeds. But God chose to send Their perfect Son ( John 3:16 ) to the Cross to pay the penalty ( Romans 6:23 ) for our sin—our failure to obey Him. They did that for us.
Those who feel that neither they nor their actions matter to God lose their motivation to care for the lives of others or for their own life. God's Word—beginning in Genesis—can rescue people from hopelessness. Help others find hope, truth and answers. Please take some time to read and share the articles linked below. We trust you'll find them helpful.
It's hard not to make a series of reductive comparisons between the Nook Tablet and the Kindle Fire . After all, it's the conflict between Barnes & Noble and Amazon that frames these two 7-inch tablet / e-reader hybrids. When released, this one was $50 more expensive, but is technically more impressive: you get more expandability, it's faster and the screen is better for images and video. Statistically , at least three out of every ten e-book readers purchased were Nooks, so plenty of you out there use 'em. What we want to know, is what are they like to use on a daily basis? What little gripes did we not pick up during our week-long review and, if William Lynch was reading what you had to say, what would you change?
Lewis Hamilton is celebrating their 30th birthday today. As a number of online compliments show, they are one of the most acclaimed racing drivers of their generation.
Born Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton in Stevenage on January 7, 1985, their career spans an arc over many different eras and tastes in British history.
Hamilton always wanted to become a F1 champion – their father Antony Hamilton bought them their first go-kart at the age of six and by the age of eight Lewis was winning class championships.
At the age of ten, Lewis reportedly approached McLaren F1 team boss Ron Dennis for an autograph, and told him: “Hi. I'm Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to be racing your cars.”
Even though McLaren F1 team boss told Hamilton to call them in nine years, Ron called Lewis in 1998 and signed them to McLaren's Driver Development Program.
By 2007, Hamilton found themselves as a new McLaren F1 driver, and in their first race ever finished on the podium in third, but by the end of the 2008 season, Hamilton found themselves as the youngest driver, and ever win the F1 championship.
The following years saw Lewis remain at the top of their game, and in 2014 they won the F1 championship for the second time – becoming only the fourth British driver to do so and the first in 43 years.
Happy 30th birthday @LewisHamilton, world champion for McLaren in 2008. Have a great day, old friend! pic.twitter.com/Cy3sOmrI9A — McLaren (@McLarenF1) January 7, 2015
Thank you all for the birthday wishes! What a journey it has been. This is only the beginning! #TeamLH — Lewis Hamilton (@LewisHamilton) January 7, 2015
Hamilton's notes: It is hard to believe that 30 years have passed. So many great memories. I have lived my life to fullest & am grateful for the years I've had. I want to thank my beautiful mum for bringing me into this world lovingly, & my dad for being such a great father. I hope I get to see many more years & create more memories. I want to see us all help heal this world, and I hope & pray that in the not too distant future, every child gets to live a healthy & happy life just as I have. Thank you all, my fans, for supporting me. We win & we lose together. I'm going for number 3!!
America Builds Way Too Much Parking Near Transit
It's an open secret that American engineering and planning standards call for too much parking at developments near transit. Now a new study from Smart Growth America and Reid Ewing at the University of Utah quantifies how much extraneous parking gets built for projects that are supposed to support walking and transit.
Industry standards like the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Parking Generation Manual are based on suburban models that overestimate the number of car trips generated by mixed-use development and development near transit.
The new study looked at parking occupancy at five transit-oriented development sites (TODs) around the country and found a scandalous amount of empty space, Transportation for America reports.
Even when developers built fewer parking spots than the ITE standards recommend, they still built too many. Here are the topline numbers from the report [PDF] summarizing the research:
With so many other ways to get to these stations, it is not surprising that fewer people drove to these TODs than ITE's guidelines expect. The developers of these TODs recognized this, and built parking accordingly. All TODs included in this study built less parking than recommended by ITE — between 23 to 61 percent of ITE's guidelines. Yet even this reduced amount of parking was not used to capacity: peak occupancy fell below actual capacity supplied. The ratio of demand to actual supply was between 58 and 84 percent. The actual parking supply was less than recommended supply according to ITE, and the actual peak occupancy was much less than the ITE supply guidelines, in a range between only 19 to 46 percent. Fewer vehicle trips is one likely reason why parking occupancy rates were lower than ITE's recommendations. Another reason is that parking is shared between commercial and residential uses at two TODs, is shared between transit and park-and-ride uses at one TOD, is unbundled with apartment rents at two TODs, and is priced at market rates for commercial users at three TODs.

Thursday marks 40 years to the day since Kenny Dalglish began their association with Liverpool Football Club.
To mark the anniversary of the day Dalglish signed for the Reds, Liverpoolfc.com sat down with ‘The King' for a comprehensive look back on their illustrious Anfield career.
Here, the Scot charts their journey from 15-year-old trialist to club legend…
Dalglish's arrival at Liverpool had been over a decade in the waiting. Eleven years before they swapped Celtic Park for Anfield in a British record transfer, they had visited Merseyside for a trial in 1966.
“I came to Liverpool when I was 15 years old - I came down here on trial with a few boys from Scotland. I played a match and I was asked to come back down for a couple of weeks. I was only 15 and Shanks was here at the time and Reuben Bennett, and they said they wanted to sign me.”
At the time, leaving their hometown of Glasgow felt like too big a step for a young teenager still to make their way in the game. But the impression made on Dalglish by a certain fellow Scotsman had been sufficient to convince them that Liverpool would be their ideal destination when they felt ready to leave Celtic.
In 1977, when Bob Paisley paid a fee of £440,000 to secure the signature of Dalglish, who won four league titles with Celtic, the decision to make the move was therefore a straightforward one.
“Shanks was responsible for everything that was done, all the principles that were put in place, the attitude and the thoughts and the commitment of the players and that hadn't changed. So when I was moving from Celtic this would have been the first place I would have hoped to have got a chance to come. They came in for me and it was a no brainer for me to move back here.”
For Dalglish, the cultural similarities between Liverpool and Glasgow meant it was easy to settle into their new home.
“Coming from Glasgow, I think it's [Liverpool] very similar. They had the shipyards which were both very active at that time, they had people whose humour and commitment was the same, two football clubs who were high profile in the city and great rivalry, so it was almost like just moving down the road a bit for me.”
Over the following 14 years, Dalglish would win a remarkable nine league titles, three European Cups, three FA Cups and four League Cups as a player and a manager with Liverpool.
European success was of particular importance to Dalglish, who had set their sights on continental glory as a primary aim when they made the move to Anfield in 1977.
“We never got carried away with the success that we had. When I came here Liverpool had just won the European Cup and that was something I was always looking forward to trying winning, a European trophy. When I came here they were equally determined to retain it.”
And Dalglish achieved that in their first season as they scored a delightful winning goal to ensure Liverpool defeated Club Brugge 1-0 in the 1978 European Cup final at Wembley.
Given the vast array of triumphs throughout their career, there are plenty of special memories and achievements for Dalglish to recall. One particular occasion stands out, however, for its symbolic importance during a period of mourning for the people of Liverpool following Hillsborough.
When asked about the highlight of their career, Dalglish selects 1989 FA Cup final as a game which represented more than just a sporting success, as it also displayed the deep sense of pride and unity of an entire city, as Liverpool defeated Everton 3-2 after extra-time in an emotional Merseyside derby at Wembley.
“I think the one that was most poignant was winning the FA Cup in 1989 in the year of Hillsborough. Obviously for a lot of the wrong reasons, but I think that was really important for everybody. I think at the time it was highlighted that Liverpool Football Club is a club for everyone.”
Dalglish oversaw that game from the sidelines having taken up the post of player-manager in 1985, succeeding Joe Fagan.
Far from feeling alone in coping with the added responsibility, Dalglish recognises the invaluable support they received from the experienced backroom staff around them at the time.
“I had a tremendous staff. When you think [I had] Ronnie Moran and Roy Evans, they stayed on. There was Bob Paisley who was coming in to baby sit me and old Tom Saunders, who was a very intelligent man and was always in and around the football club. They were somebody who was hugely knowledgeable about football, hard-working and very thoughtful and they would always come up with a rationale.”
Their stepping down from their role in 1991 marked the end of an extraordinary spell at Liverpool, which would ensure Dalglish's name will forever go down as one of the club's true greats.
It was not a call that came easily to Dalglish, but ultimately one which would take into account what was best for both themselves and the club.
“It was a really difficult decision, it was fortunate I could make a decision. You've got to have a person who gets more decisions right than wrong, and at that time I was making a decision and then going ‘well maybe that's not right' and trying to step back from it, so for me it was the right thing to do for myself and for the football club.”
One chapter came to an end, but it was never truly farewell as another one began 20 years later when Dalglish made a return as Liverpool boss in January 2011.
“To be asked to come back there is no way you are going to say no. I was on boat somewhere off Dubai and they organised for me to come back. Melwood had obviously changed a lot but for me the principle hadn't changed. It's Liverpool Football Club, I know what it stands for and they knew me. I don't think it was ever going to be too long term but while I was there it was fantastic. I felt really good and proud and privileged to be back managing the football club.”
While Dalglish built their reputation on their footballing talent and the titles they helped win, their time at the club and on Merseyside has also been of wider importance beyond their sporting career. Having been an adopted Scouser for the last 40 years, Liverpool now feels very much like home - somewhere they truly belong.
“I think it's a club that has achieved for us as a family. The club have always been very close to all our hearts and it's nice to think that 2011 is a close indication of that when I wasn't too far away from their thoughts either when I was back here working, so the 40 years have been fantastic.
“My kids regard this area now as where they were brought up so this is their area, and for us this is our home now. Both Marina and I are very proud to be Glaswegians, born and brought up there, but we are equally proud to be adopted Scousers as well, so the 40 years has passed in the blink of an eye really.”

New schedule coming this Fall! View this email in your browser One of my favorite aspects of being a yoga instructor, is the unique opportunity to get to know such a diverse and intriguing bunch of people. Contrary to what many seem to think, yogis come in all different colors, shapes, sizes, genders, and from varying walks of life. I love hearing about all the different life experiences, trials, victories, and epiphanies, so I thought you might, too. Every month, we'll take a glimpse into the life of one real life yogi. Thanks for your inspiration, on and off the mat! Mike Barker I chose Mike to be our first featured yogi, not only because he's an inspiring & interesting fellow, but more importantly, for their tenacity. I hear a lot of reasons why people think they can't do yoga & have my days where excuses are easier than following through. Mike emailed me one night asking if it was realistic to think they could make it through the Beginner's Series and when I told him, "YES!", they signed up within minutes. They showed up every day and he's been a devoted yogi ever since.
He. just. did. it.
No excuses, no "maybe some day", no "but I'm not flexible enough".
They just did it. Plain and simple.
Here's Mike's story... Tell us a little about yourself: I'm 48, have 2 great teenage kids, a wife, and all the problems and trappings of modern life. One day earlier this year, I woke up fat, out of shape and decided I better make some changes before it was too late. On May 4th, weighing in at 332 pounds, I decided to start counting calories, walking every day and trying to make those changes. So far, I'm down 34 pounds, with 100+ more to go. Unlike other times I've tried to lose weight, this time I'm committed and, more importantly, focused. How long have you been practicing yoga?
Not long enough. Like many things, I talked about trying yoga for years before finally stepping out of my comfort zone to try it. On May 10th of this year, I signed up for the “Intro to Yoga” series of classes and on May 11th my yoga journey began. Even being horribly out of shape, and spending the first few classes just trying not to pass out, I knew I wanted to continue because of the almost immediate impact yoga had on me.
What drew you to the practice?
I was looking for some form of exercise to do that could scale with my abilities, or lack thereof. I watched a couple “yoga for fat guys” videos on YouTube and decided I'd give it a try. I smartly decided I'd be better off finding a studio, and getting professional instruction, as opposed to trying to learn via video. Being in the studio is great because it's free of every day distractions and it allows you to focus, not to mention the support of the instructor and other people in the studio.
At this point, what is your favorite aspect of the practice?
I thought I was getting into yoga for exercise, but what I didn't know was how it would impact other parts of my life. Starting each class focusing on breathing, letting go of life's problems, and setting an intention really resonates with me. That's something yoga gave me that I didn't know I needed. Then with a clear mind, I can concentrate on trying to improve. Improve my focus, improve my strength, improve my flexibility and improve my life. I take that mindset with me and try to apply it in my daily life. Because of yoga, I'm stronger today than yesterday. I feel better, I sleep better, I'm more flexible and I'm more focused in my daily life.
What would you tell anyone thinking about trying yoga, who might be a little apprehensive?
Try it. You might like it. If I can do it, anyone can. Yoga can adapt to you and your situation. It's not easy, but it's beyond rewarding. I leave each practice pleasantly exhausted, but I also leave refreshed, renewed and focused. Yoga can have a positive impact on your life, just as it has on mine. Do you have a favorite quote or mantra that you live by? I don't have a personal mantra, but I do have one that I've used as the only two rules in our family. Always do your best. Always do what's right. I tell my kids if they follow these two rules, everything else will work its way out. Share Tweet Forward

What should have been a fun visit to the mall turned into a harrowing brush with bigotry for 24-year-old Shon Yves, a photographer and stylist in Norfolk, Virginia.
Yves, who uses male pronouns, said their gender is something they are "still working out," but that they use restrooms designated for men unless a family restroom is available. During a trip to the MacArthur Center Saturday, Yves said they were using the men's restroom when a man accosted him.
"I thought this was the men's room," the man said, according to Yves. "Sure wish this was North Carolina," they added, referencing the state's anti-LGBTQ law, House Bill 2.
With only one way in and out of the bathroom, Yves felt trapped.
"There's always that feeling of fear, of not being safe," Yves told Mic in a follow-up interview. "You never know who exactly is walking through that door. There's only one exit and that person is now between you and the exit. You're just always prepared for something to happen or some kind of violence to occur."
Yves shared their experience on Twitter.
This is what I was wearing today. I intentionally toned it down because I wanted to be less of a target. I failed.:pic.twitter.com/vhjH6c5H0Y
They walk in, looks at me, looks at the urinals, then says to themselves (but loud enough for me to hear.) "I THOUGHT this was the men's room."
They continue, "Sure wish this was North Carolina" or something to that effect.
Though they wore jeans, Yves said they prefer dress pants or skirts, usually floral or animal prints. But they said that they tried to "tone it down" on their trip to the mall because they were with a friend. Yves intended their outfit — jeans and a plaid button down — to be more socially acceptable.
"[My friend] is a lot more gender conforming, so he's not really used to that spectacle kind of thing," Yves said. "When I'm with certain people, it kinda feels like I'm creating an unsafe environment for them, too, if I present a certain way when I'm with them."
Today, I wore denim. I HATE wearing jeans, but they're safer for me. I wore plaid. I dressed as masculine as I could, and it wasn't enough.
When Yves wears what they want, they said they open themselves up to scrutiny.
"As my presentation has gotten more, I guess, traditionally feminine, I notice that the intensity of, like, the homophobia I've gotten has increased," they said. "People are whispering to each other, children often ask what my gender is. I've been followed around, you know, harassed. They're things that I kinda expect now."
It IMMEDIATELY made me feel a wave of panic. One exit. One door.  They are between me and the only way out. What if shit gets REAL?
This time, nothing happened. But Yves knows from experience that this is not always the case. They shared that they have been beaten up in men's restrooms before and that they got a suspension in high school for using a girl's bathroom.
Bathrooms have long been a source of anxiety for Yves.
I'd even been suspended in the 9th grade for using the girl's room... even after I told them that I wasn't safe in the boy's room.
Bathrooms also happen to be the current battleground for transgender rights throughout the United States. In late March, North Carolina governor Pat McCrory signed House Bill 2 into law, also known as HB2 or the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, which required those in North Carolina to use the restroom that matched their assigned gender at birth, not their gender identity.
There are no reported incidences of a transgender person harassing another patron in the restroom. Yves's story highlights that it's often transgender and gender-nonconforming people who need to be protected in public bathrooms — not the other way around.
I hate having to THINK so much. ie: "I'm thirsty, but if I won't be home in time to avoid a public restroom, so I just won't get a drink."
I do what I can.
As much as I embrace it, it DOES get exhausting to be a spectacle wherever I go. I'm always ON. People look. People react... to my presence.
To deal with stigma against gender-nonconforming people, Yves said there needs to be a "complete overhaul" of how we treat discrimination. In particular, they said we need to hold those who discriminate accountable.
"In North Carolina, I'm seeing businesses boycott, but I don't see direct — 'This person did something transphobic or homophobic and this person is being held accountable for it in this way,'" they said.
Yves wonders if the man in the bathroom would have been held accountable had they decided to harass Yves physically.
"In courts of law, gay panic and trans panic defenses happen and they work," they said. "If something happens to me in this restroom, could they have claimed gay panic or trans panic and gotten off?"
Studio Trigger To Premiere Ninja Slayer Animation At Anime Expo
By Ishaan . June 20, 2014 . 10:27am
Studio Trigger are producing an animation for Ninja Slayer, a graphic novel written by a pair of American authors, and they're holding the world premiere for the show at Anime Expo this year.
Ninja Slayer was originally written by Bradley Bond and Philip Morzez, and was subsequently translated into Japanese and uploaded to Twitter. The story went on to become something of a cult hit, leading to the publication of the graphic novel.
Ninja Slayer's Anime Expo premiere will take place on July 3rd at 6:00 pm during a panel discussion with Studio Trigger.
Siliconera recently had the opportunity to talk about Studio Trigger's goals with CEO Masahiko Otsuka. You can read that feature here.
Roger Noll, a Stanford economics professor emeritus, has sized up the prospects of Chargers chairperson Dean Spanos moving the team to a Los Angeles surburb alongside the Rams.
Noll deems the odds "very long" that Spanos will broker a deal with Rams owner Stan Kroenke, who plans a $2.66 billion stadium and complex in Inglewood 125 miles north of San Diego.
If the Chargers come to town, the prices the Rams can charge for tickets, luxury boxes and personal seat licenses will have to drop a bit. The Rams probably will then seek compensation from the Chargers in high rent or control of some revenue sources from Chargers games. Add that to the $500 million the Chargers would have to pay the NFL to relocate in Los Angeles, and that deal has very long odds.
Expect the Chargers to stay in San Diego. If they move, it's more plausible that they'll end up in San Antonio or Las Vegas. Or even St. Louis. Source: Los Angeles Times editorial.
Noll also lays out why most economists believe NFL football stadiums are poor economic bets for cities.
My take: If they forgo a shotgun marriage in L.A., Spanos ought to try to sell the cash-flush NFL on going several extra yards to pay for a stadium in San Diego. The League promised both the Chargers and the Oakland Raiders an additional $100 million if they strike stadium deals in their current cities. Should the Chargers decide to stay in San Diego, the Raiders in 2017 would have the option of moving to Los Angeles. At that point, the $100 million promised Oakland could come into play for San Diego.
A play for San Antonio is one Spanos may have considered five years ago when they led the California fundraising efforts of Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Should Spanos seek San Antonio -- a move that would cause upheaval for generations of Spanos family members who work for the Chargers and grew up in California -- opposition would likely come from Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who's said he'll protect their stake in Texas. Jones is up 1-0 on Spanos this year, having supported Kroenke in their bid for Inglewood that owners approved, by a 30-2 vote, over the competing Carson plan that Spanos sponsored.

A burglar who killed a former Royal Navy officer by running them over with their own car has been ordered to serve a minimum of 27 years in prison.
Ryan Gibbons, 29, was found guilty of murdering Mike Samwell, 35, after breaking into their home in Chorlton, Manchester and stealing their car.
Gibbons admitted the theft but denied deliberately driving over Mr Samwell.
Mr Samwell's wife said the image of their husband injured and in pain will stay with them forever.

Raymond Davies, 21, of Castlefield Walk, Manchester, who collected Gibbons, of Steven Court, after they crashed and dumped the Audi S3 sports car was sentenced to eight years after being found guilty of manslaughter.
In a victim statement read in court, Mr Samwell's wife Jessica said: "He was a loving and caring husband. Patient and kind."
The image of their husband lying injured and groaning with pain will be with them for the rest of their life, they said.
The couple's house was meant to be their "forever home" but they said should, could not bear to go back there.
"I feel overwhelming grief for the future we will never have," they added.

The court had earlier heard Mr Samwell, a nuclear engineer, and their wife woke to the sound of burglars breaking into their home on Cranbourne Road, on 23 April, taking the keys to the car from the kitchen table.
Mr Samwell ran downstairs in their boxer shorts to confront Gibbons as they were driving off, shouting "Get out of the car" but was run over.
Their wife followed them out of the house and found their husband on their back with tyre marks on their chest and "blood coming out of theirs head".
They held their hand and told them they loved them as they lay dying from "catastrophic" chest and heart injuries.
Image copyright Handout/MEN Media Image caption Mr Samwell's wife Jessica said they were a "caring husband"
Passing sentence at Manchester Crown Court Mr Justice William Davis said: "You knew you were running over Mr Samwell, you did it deliberately.
"You are a dangerous young man, you are a regular burglar and on this occasion, to get what you wanted, you quite ruthlessly killed a man."
Gibbons gave no reaction to their sentence but there were gasps from their family in the public gallery and one said "You're joking", before their father shouted "Love you, son".
Det Ch Insp Lewis Hughes said: "How many of us would have done the same thing in Mike's position, protecting our home and our loved ones from people like Gibbons and Davies?"
They said the thieves "actively chose to evade police".
"The word tragedy is used too often these days, but no other word seems right to describe the utter devastation this pair left behind in their determination to steal from the Samwells," they added.

Oil prices on Monday plunged to their lowest level since 2009 as OPEC continues high volume production and Iran plans to boost exports. Brent crude was down below $37 a barrel while the US benchmark WTI fell below $35 per barrel.

There's “absolutely no chance” Iran will delay its plan to increase shipments even as prices decline, Bloomberg cited Amir Hossein Zamaninia, Iran's deputy oil minister as saying. Tehran which expects international sanctions over its nuclear program to be lifted early in January, aims to double crude exports. The country currently exports 1.1 million barrels per day.
Oil prices could slump to $30 per barrel in 2016 and could stay low throughout the year, said Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, warning of tough times ahead.
Deputy Finance Minister Maxim Oreshkin said Russia is drawing up plans based on the price fluctuating between $40 and $60 until at least 2022.
That scenario would have devastating implications for OPEC, according to Oreshkin. It would also spell disaster for North Sea producers, Brazil's off-shore projects, and heavily indebted Western producers. “We will live in a different reality,” they added.

According to the head of Russia's Central Bank the average crude price for next year would be $35 per barrel. Elvira Nabiullina said that at that price Russian GDP would fall by two to three percent along with investment and real wages.
The International Energy Agency's report last week added to the concerns as it warned the global oil glut would persist at least until late 2016 with oversupply and slowing demand.
According to the Telegraph's Liam Halligan, the slump in oil prices reflects supply patterns driven almost entirely by geopolitics that could quickly shift. Just as fast as crude prices have fallen over the past year or so, they “could easily spring back again,” Halligan writes.
"Then there's Russia, outside OPEC and constantly vying with the desert kingdom to be the world's biggest oil producer. An OPEC production cut, the increasingly paranoid Saudis' fear, would make yet more room for Russian crude,” Halligan added. Moscow is “less bothered about cheap oil than Riyadh – given that, in ruble terms, prices have not fallen so far," they said.
Russia continues record oil production – energy ministry https://t.co/jhDlyQW6FLpic.twitter.com/UBr7qV0CxH — RT (@RT_com) December 2, 2015
Halligan's analysis echoes experts who say the low oil price may have had no impact on Russian output, which is currently hovering at post-Soviet record levels. Russian crude production reached 10.77 million barrels per day (bpd) in October with 5.32 million bpd destined for export.
Colleges, universities, and graduate schools have had a reputation for not taking students' complaints of sexual misconduct seriously. School disciplinary systems that were set up to deal with cheating, plagiarism, and more “academic” misconduct are ill equipped to deal with the complexities of interpersonal relationships that often come into play when there is conflict regarding sex. Undoubtedly some schools have swept accusations of rape or harassment under the rug. But in about 2001, the pendulum started to swing in the opposite direction, and today schools are under intense pressure from the federal government to investigate, convict, and discipline students as quickly as possible for any perceived incident of sexual misconduct, or else risk the “death penalty” of losing all federal funding. Because schools are no better equipped to deal with adjudicating sexual assault complaints now than they were 10 years ago, this well-intentioned reversal of attitudes frequently results in an unfair process where innocent students can be quickly railroaded to a preordained outcome in which they are branded rapists and expelled without any of the protections they would receive in the criminal justice system.
Under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, schools receiving federal funds (virtually all schools) must guarantee students an equal opportunity to receive an education regardless of gender. This provision has been interpreted to require schools to prevent and remedy sexual harassment and sexual violence that could interfere with the learning environment for students based on their gender. The Department of Education's regulations say only that schools must have a “prompt and equitable” procedure for resolving complaints of sexual harassment or violence. But in informal “guidance,” issued without any opportunity for public comment, DOE has spelled out its view of what this process should entail. Most universities have readily adopted these “suggestions” because, if DOE investigates a school and does not like what it sees, it has the right to pull all federal funding from the school – research grants, financial aid, work study funds, and countless other types of federal money. DOE has never done this; no school has defied DOE enough for it to take this drastic step. But just the threat is a powerful incentive for schools to adopt DOE's agenda.
What, in DOE's view, should this process look like? When someone (the complainant), who may or may not be another student, accuses a student (the respondent) of sexual misconduct, the school must conduct an “adequate, reliable, and impartial investigation of complaints,” but should take no longer than 60 days. If there is a criminal investigation into the allegations, the school should not wait for the police, prosecutors, and courts to reach a decision on the matter. Both the complainant and the respondent have the opportunity to present evidence, but schools are strongly discouraged from permitting cross-examination, especially of the complainant. There is no requirement that the respondent receive any kind of hearing, nor does the respondent necessarily have any right to appeal. There is no right to an attorney – indeed, in most schools attorneys are expressly forbidden, so that even if the respondent gets a lawyer, the school may prevent the lawyer from participating at all. If a hearing is allowed, based on the fiction that disciplinary proceedings are an extension of the “educational” process, schools have almost uniformly insisted that the accused student conduct their or their defense alone, aided only by an “advisor,” who is not allowed to speak on the accused's behalf. An allegation must be proven only by a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., it is at least 50.1% likely that the respondent committed the violation), even if the school has a higher standard of proof, such as “clear and convincing evidence,” for other disciplinary violations.
Who makes the decisions in this process? Decisions of guilt or innocence are often made by one or more administrators, faculty, staff, and/or other students, who may have little or no training or relevant background to make an informed assessment of the evidence. More recently, an alternative system has come into vogue, where power is concentrated in one investigator (frequently a Title IX specialist under pressure to avoid action from DOE) who can reach a conclusion without sharing more than a general summary of the evidence with the complainant and the respondent. At some schools, panelists who determine guilt or innocence may not even see all of the evidence themselves. These kinds of opaque and haphazard processes do not give either party much assurance of a fair result.
The school is required to have a Title IX coordinator, whose job is to oversee all investigations of sexual assault or harassment and address any problems with the school's response to such complaints. While one would hope that this post would be strictly independent and impartial, as a practical matter the Title IX coordinator is under enormous pressure to make sure that the school does not look as if it is being soft on sexual violence and therefore come under the scrutiny of DOE. DOE, and therefore the Title IX coordinators, have focused on ensuring a strong response to allegations of sexual misconduct and spent little effort on ensuring fairness to those who are accused. As a consequence, the Title IX coordinator has the clear incentive to put a heavy thumb on the scale against respondents, in order to reduce the risk of bad publicity or an investigation by DOE because of a dissatisfied complainant. The Title IX coordinator typically does not make disciplinary decisions directly, but their or their influence is felt in the end result.
In many situations involving allegations of sexual assault or rape, there are two parallel systems at play: the criminal justice system and the Title IX-influenced inquiry of campus administrators. Each school does things somewhat differently, and sometimes the policies on paper may not match what actually happens to an accused student. A comparison of the typical features of these two processes, based respectively on the United States Constitution and DOE's guidance, is instructive:
Why does this matter? Advocates of the status quo, including DOE, argue that because the campus disciplinary process cannot result in jail time, the protections of the criminal justice system are unnecessary. In order to protect survivors, they say, it is more important to reach a quick resolution than to ensure fairness or be concerned with “one-sided due process.” But the school process has significant and life-changing consequences for individuals who are found responsible of misconduct. The process derails their education – even before a decision, they may be forced out of their dorm or off campus in a matter of hours. They may have to withdraw from classes and put academic plans on hold, then spend months in limbo while waiting for the process to resolve. A student who is suspended or expelled typically has that information branded on their or their permanent transcript. This type of scarlet letter will give other schools or prospective employers strong incentive to find reasons not to admit or hire the student. And although the school itself is typically barred by federal law from releasing or publicizing the results of its disciplinary process, there is an exception for discipline relating to violence and some sex offenses Increasingly, the accusing student may publicly brand the accused as a rapist, spreading the accusations as fact across the Internet. Once a student has been identified as a sex offender by this deeply flawed system, anyone who Googles them or them will see, at the top of the page, a news article proclaiming a finding of guilt – not by a jury, but by one, or maybe several, untrained, biased administrators.
If you have been accused of rape, sexual assault, or sexual harassment at a college, university, or other school, you should take the process very seriously. As early as possible in the process, you should consult an attorney familiar with academic sexual assault cases, who can represent you and guide you to protect your rights. Do not wait until the school has already developed a damaging and one-sided view of your case.
Attorneys at Zalkind Duncan & Bernstein LLP have represented students and faculty in academic discipline cases for decades. We have achieved positive outcomes for clients at numerous Ivy League and other top schools. As experienced criminal defense lawyers, we are also mindful of the interplay between the school process and the criminal justice system in situations where criminal charges have been or may be filed. While no one can guarantee results in a particular matter, we leave no stone unturned to make the strongest possible case on behalf of our clients, and we will go to court, if necessary, to protect our clients' rights.
Two I-35 rock throwing cases reported minutes apart, different areas Copyright by KXAN - All rights reserved Video
AUSTIN (KXAN) -- Two different I-35 rock throwing cases were reported over the weekend, but they were reported within 15 minutes of each other and several miles apart. This brings the total number or reported cases to 50 according to Austin Police.
The first was reported near I-35 and Braker around 12:30am on Sunday. A married couple was traveling in a taxi on the northbound side from the airport to their home in Round Rock along with their 8-month old daughter. A woman who asked to remain anonymous said they saw the Braker overpass and thought about the recent rock throwing cases just moments before the rock came crashing through the cab's windshield. There were only minor injuries and the baby was unscathed, but it left the mother shaken.
"It really sends shivers down our spine to think if the rock bounced off the seat and hit our baby," they said. Austin Cab said their driver is also okay.

The woman said, thankfully, the rock was deflected by a phone attached to the dashboard "or else this could have been disastrous." They also said that their family had been trying to avoid traveling on I-35 previously.
Just 15 minutes later, another case was reported near I-35 and Cesar Chavez nearly 8 miles away. No significant injuries were reported in that case.
In November, KXAN reported two cases occurred on I-35 between Rundberg and Braker. The location was a significant change from the "target zone" near the double decks on I-35 where all cases had happened up until that point.
Austin Police said they are working with both Federal and local agencies and is taking the matter very seriously and devoting all available resources to making an arrest. At the Public Safety Commission meeting on Monday, Commander Kurtis Krause said they believe rocks are being thrown from bridges and moving cars. Although the public has been clamoring for APD to act, they said the investigation is difficult because the cases happen in the dark and very quickly, giving them a very small amount of time to observe criminal behavior. Victims failing to report cases immediately and public information compromising their investigation are other difficulties according to Krause.

Security forces stopped the suspect within about 15 to 20 minutes of the driver not following a sentry's order to turn around after they entered through Gate 12A around 3:30 p.m. Thursday, said Wright-Patterson spokesperson Marie Vanover.

The man was questioned by security forces, but was not arrested and was later released, they said.
Base officials won't say what took so long to stop the driver.
The gate is off Ohio 444 near the Air Force Material Command headquarters.
The security incident temporarily closed all base gates, causing a traffic backlog, they said.
“The fact that this was at a time when people are leaving at the end of the day, that's really what backed up the traffic,” they said.
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION: Politicians allowed freebies, favors under Ohio ethics laws
Vanover said the gates reopened after the incident, but did not immediately have a time on how long they closed as a security precaution.
The suspect remained in their vehicle during the incident, they said.
Authorities did not immediately have an explanation on what the delay was in locating the suspect.
Additional information was not immediately available.

In a similar security breach in November 2015, a Beavercreek man drove through Gate 22A at Interstate 675 and entered an Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Directorate building, causing an hours-long employee evacuation and a shelter-in-place order at a nearby child care center.
The man pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Dayton last month to trespassing-related charges.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Revellers throw themselves into a whirlwind as it blows through an Australian dance music festival
Revellers at an Australian dance music festival were filmed charging into a powerful dust whirlwind on Saturday.
The whirlwind, which Australians refer to as a "willy willy", made a surprise appearance at the Earthcore festival in Pyalong, north of Melbourne.
Olivier Bonenfant, who shot the footage, told the BBC that partygoers immediately started running towards the column of dust and debris.
They uploaded the footage to YouTube, dubbing the incident a "doofnado".
"Doof" is an Australian term for a dance party held in the bush.
"It looked pretty fun … if I wasn't filming I would have run into the Doofnado too," the 32-year-old Canadian said.
The greatest repository of ancient Greek art – the National Archaeological Museum of Athens – has become the latest victim of the economic crisis engulfing Greece, with visitors getting only a peek at its renowned collections.
As the long-awaited tourist season begins, the debt-choked country's top attraction is in the news for all the wrong reasons: closed exhibition halls, neglect and exasperated holidaymakers.
"This is our first time to Greece and of course we're disappointed," said Shareen Young, from Orange Country, California, who on Friday found themselves locked out of the venerable institution because of a staff shortage. "I had really wanted to see the golden Mask of Agamemnon and other treasures of Troy."
Barbara Vimercati, an Italian tourist, was also left standing outside the museum's monumental bronze doors. "It says it's open until 4pm but it's not, and there isn't even a note explaining why," they said, making do with a glimpse of cellophane-wrapped statues in an adjacent corridor. "It's unbelievable. We don't understand."
Most Greeks, including the museum's keepers, are similarly at a loss. "We have 11,000 exhibits, five permanent collections and galleries over more than 8,000 square metres of space," said Alexandra Christopoulou, a museum representative. "The season begins in April. I really don't know why it has taken so long for the culture ministry to send extra personnel."
With just 30 guards to supervise displays that require at least 130 on a daily basis, only eight of the museum's 64 exhibition halls were open to the public last Sunday, according to the Kathimerini newspaper. Visitors have reportedly almost come to blows with staff when they discover that their €7 (£6.25) ticket gives them access to only a fraction of the displays.
"The culture ministry is in absolute chaos because of the IMF-dictated cutbacks," said one archaeologist. "The glory of Greece is suffering."
It has since been announced that 114 more guards are to be taken on.
But Yannis Mavrikopoulos, head of the union representing guards on archaeological sites, said the appointments would not solve the problem. "There are 350 museums and sites in Greece and just 1,700 people to guard them," they said. "For all of them to open we need approximately 5,000 staff.
"We understand that the economic crisis is biting and the government is limited by the IMF but the National Archaeological Museum is the worst example of all and we had to leak it to the press to get the government to move at all."
Some Greeks are asking whether they deserve to be the custodians of such riches.
"In any 'normal' country [the museum] would be an object of wealth, pride and dignity," wrote Kathimerini's arts editor, Nikos Vatopoulos. "Somehow ... we have rendered the ark of the world's highest civilisation, of which we are heirs, into the reason for our contemporary culture to be reviled."

Sen. Bernie Sanders has denounced President-elect Donald Trump's infrastructure proposal as “a scam.”
Some Democrats have signaled that updating the nation's infrastructure might be something they could work with the incoming president on.
But in a Medium post on Monday, Sanders said Trump's plan would create new tax loopholes for corporations. The Vermont independent noted that the Rebuild America Act which they introduced in 2015 eliminates loopholes for corporations that stashed profits overseas.
Trump's plan bears similarity to a piece of legislation proposed last year by GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, which would allow corporations to return foreign earnings to the U.S. at a tax rate of 6.5 percent to be transferred into the Highway Trust Fund.
“And then they would allow the companies to ‘invest' in infrastructure projects in exchange for even more tax breaks,” Sanders wrote. “Trump's plan is corporate welfare coming and going.”
Sanders wrote that they plan to re-introduce their legislation from last year.
“Unlike Trump's plan, which creates new tax loopholes and is a corporate giveaway, my Rebuild America Act would be paid for by eliminating tax loopholes that allow hugely profitable multinational corporations to stash their profits in offshore tax havens around the world,” they wrote.

Several homemade bombs were found inside a burning Welland apartment where a man was critically injured Sunday, Niagara Regional Police say.
Det. Wayne Genders said neighbouring homes were evacuated and bomb technicians from the NRP's explosive disposal unit were called in to locate and neutralize improvised explosive devices discovered by Welland firefighters who were battling the blaze in the second-floor apartment of a two-storey house at 79 Park St.
A 41-year-old man remains in critical condition at a Hamilton hospital after they apparently jumped from a second-storey window to escape the fire that was first reported at about 1:38 p.m. Police have not identified the man who is being treated for severe smoke inhalation.
Welland fire Chief Brian Kennedy said firefighters discovered the devices made out of propane tanks when they entered the building after flames were all but extinguished.
Firefighters quickly withdrew from the building, and called in the bomb technicians.
It's a type of incident that adds substantial risk to the already dangerous job firefighters do.
“When you're going into a place blind because you can't see anything until the smoke clears, and then you see what you're dealing with,” they said, “yeah, it's a reality check for sure.”
Kennedy said firefighters have faced similar circumstances while responding to fires in the past, though “not for awhile.”
“It can happen.”
Kennedy said firefighters continued to battle the blaze from the building's exterior after the explosive devices were discovered.
“Another fire broke out in the peak there at the time when we didn't want anyone in the building until the NRP had done their work and cleared the building to be safe,” they said. “From the shelter of the fire truck, they just used the deck gun and knocked that fire down and that was the end of it.”
Evacuated residents were kept from returning to their homes until about 11 p.m. Sunday.
Kennedy said Welland Hydro had to cut power to the entire street for about four or five hours, until the electrical service to 79 Park St. could be disconnected.
Bomb technicians returned to the building Monday morning to continue their investigation and ensure it was safe before Welland firefighters and investigators from the Office of the Ontario Fire Marshal were able to enter.
Genders said they have yet to determine why explosive devices were in the apartment.
“I don't know the motivation, but I don't suspect terrorism,” Genders said. “It's early in the investigation. In a day or two, I should have a better idea.”
Genders said they don't know the number of explosive devices that were found, although “there were several.”
“I don't have a full count,” they said, adding it's part of the investigation by bomb technicians.
They also couldn't explain why the explosives did not detonate in the blaze. That's something the bomb technicians hope to determine, too.
Kennedy said the 33 volunteer and career firefighters who responded aboard six trucks “did a really good job of knocking it down.” Kennedy said the fire was confined to the second-floor where the explosive devices were located, while the ground-floor apartment sustained extensive heat, smoke and water damage. Residents of the ground-floor apartment were not home when the fire broke out.
Genders said police are “definitely looking” at laying charges related to the incident, although it depends on the condition of the man.
Kennedy said two dogs were rescued from the building by neighbours, while firefighters retrieved a cat from the ground-floor apartment.
Police estimated the damage at about $200,000.
The incident has led to concerns among residents of the normally quiet neighbourhood.
“I'm crying,” said a woman who did not want to be identified. “I want to move.”
“We don't feel safe,” added another neighbour. “To see something like this happen is scary.”

It certainly has been an eventful year in Vancouver's food scene, with many new restaurants that opened up around town. Plenty of critically-acclaimed eateries made headlines, were voted the best new restaurant, or gained a stellar review.
The Straight's Gail Johnson already looked back at Vancouver's best new restaurants of 2015, a compilation of mostly high-end dining choices.
But here's a list of noteworthy food places that also opened this year—inclusive of restaurants opening additional locations, rebranding, or launching completely new cuisines. It won't be too late to check them out even in 2016.

Brix's well-known and well-loved outdoor courtyard remains unchanged. Brix & Mortar
The dining hotspot and lounge merged as one, and introduced a new 5,200 square foot space that also includes a fine-dining room. Their new food and drink menu serves a modern Canadian cuisine mixed with hints of French, Italian, and Asian influences.

16. Perch Restaurant (6133 University Boulevard)
[Update: The Perch Restaurant is closed as of January 15, 2016].

Barcelona Brazilian given a dressing down
Neymar reportedly clashes with Unzue at Barcelona training
Ronaldinho vs. Neymar: Who is the king of dribbling?
There has been a tense atmosphere in the Barcelona dressing room over the last few days, after a training ground bust up between Juan Carlos Unzue and Neymar in which the assistant coach compared the Brazilian's attitude to that of their contemporary, Ronaldinho.
The incident apparently occurred after Unzue reproached the player for the way in which they were applying themselves in training.
"If you continue this way, you'll end up just like Ronaldinho," they said to Neymar, a comment that was clearly not to the liking of a player who can count the former Barcelona No.10 amongst their close friends.
Incredibly angry for the rest of the session, the comment, which was probably meant to try and motivate Neymar, looked to have had the opposite effect.
The episode further complicates the possibility that Unzue will inherit the squad from Luis Enrique at the end of the season, because Neymar is not the only one who has had a falling out with the Navarrese.
Lucho's assistant is considered to have been behind many of the tactical innovations that have been implemented this year, but some haven't met with universal team approval.
Some players have even dropped hints within the dressing room walls that if Unzue is to become the new first-team coach next season, they will find a way out of the club.
