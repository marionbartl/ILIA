WHEN the current British government took office, chancellor George Osborne said in his first Budget that he aimed to "have debt falling and a balanced structual budget deficit by the end of this Parliament". With eight months to go before the election, the ONS announced yesterday that public sector borrowing in the first six months of the current financial year was £45.4 billion ($74.2 billion); higher than the deficit for the same period in the previous year. This seems particularly surprising, given the recovery in the economy*. And it raises some questions about whether there may be structural reasons why the deficit is much harder to close than before.
The weakness, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, is in part down to income tax receipts which are 0.8% lower year-on-year. Two factors may be at work; at the start of the 2013-14 tax year, the top rate of tax was cut from 50% to 45%. That undoubtedly caused some high-earners to shift their income from 2012-13 to the 2013-14 tax year. That boosted income tax receipts in the early month of last year, and has slowed the annual change now. Secondly, a lot of the new jobs being created are part-time or low-paid. Those who earn less than £10,000 do not pay income tax at all.

So what about the cuts? Clearly, there have been big squeezes in certain areas, such as funding to local councils. The problem for the government is that it has to run fast to stand still. Here are the figures from the ONS for the first half of the year. Even with ultra-low interest rates, the interest cost in the first half of 2014 was £24 billion, compared with £14 billion in the first half of 2009, the year before the goverment took office. Social benefits have risen from £79 billion to £95 billion over the same period.
Take those numbers out of the totals for current expenditure and "other spending" has risen from £186 billion to £210 billion over the same period, a 12.9% nominal increase. Inflation has risen 15.1% over the last five years, so that it is a cut in real terms. But it is tough going. Total current expenditure in the first half of the year was £330 billion, compared with £279 billion in H12009. For a full year comparison, 2013 current expenditure was £637 billion, compared with £562 billion in 2009.
The big cut, of course, has been in net investment which was £32 billion in the first half of 2009 and was only £18 billion in the first half of this year. The full year numbers were £55 billion in 2009-10 and £31 billion in 2013-14 (just £26 billion in 2011-2012). In Keynesian terms, this is the wrong thing to cut since capital spending is the most likely to have a multiplier effect on the economy.
Total tax receipts in the first half of the year were £302 billion, compared with £308 billion in H12013, £284 billion in H1 2012, £276 billion in H1 2011, £263 billion in H12010, and £246 billion in H12009. So on the first half figures alone, taxes are up £56 billion and current expenditure is up £51 billion over the last five years. Running to stand still, as I say.
So perhaps there is a fundamental problem. On the tax side, our more unequal society has resulted in a large proportion of revenues coming from a small number of taxayers, both individual and corporate. The top 1% of taxpayers paid 28% of all income tax in 2013-14. The return on bank equity has fallen and this has kept the lid on bonuses; a good thing, most people may think, but bad for the taxman. Push the rate up too high and many of these people may go elsewhere; the banks they work for are largely foreign. The rest of the workforce is barely seeing any real wage growth. The net effect is that, while employment is up 5% over the last four years, income tax receipts have fallen 4% in real terms. Meanwhile the government is slashing corporate tax rates to try to attract business to the country.
On the spending side, there is a limit to how much the goverment can squeeze. A commitment to preserve NHS spending in real terms has done little to protect the goverment from attacks on this issue by Labour, whose leader pledged to add £2.5 billion to health spending in his conference speech; pensioners have also been ring-fenced with their incomes being linked to inflation.
It is easy to imagine that the deficit will not close by the end of the next Parliament either. No doubt the Chancellor is very happy that the Bank of England owns £375 billion of gilts and currently hands back the interest to the government. Imagine what the finances would like without this help.
* There is a methodological change to do with the treatment of the banks, but that probably doesn't affect the numbers on taxes and spending.
I'm going to try to keep this fairly short and to the point, simply because I don't feel much needs to be said beyond "buy this game," nor could any amount of words conveys the experience that is Life is Strange.
If you have any interest at all in a game's plot, you need to play this game. This is not for fans of twitch-shooters or multiplayer diehards; this is a game for those who want their games to leave an impression. I've played most of the big-name games renowned for their stories...everything from Bioshock to Mass Effect to The Last of Us to God of War, Uncharted, and tons more. There were some very strong narratives told on those discs, but this game is on another level entirely. To me, there is a line that writers strive to reach, one that separates a "good game with a great story" and a "work of art." Many games come close, such as the ones I've mentioned above, but Life is Strange is one of the very few that manage to cross that line.
In the past 20 years of gaming I've only considered 2 other games to be so highly regarded; Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill Shattered Memories. I can wholeheartedly say Life is Strange sits comfortably among those 2 games as my all-time favorites, and I can't stress enough how much of a compliment that is. Games like these only come along once every 7-8 years, but they remind me why I love this hobby as much as I do.
Please, I ask that if you're going to play this game, let it guide you. Don't sit there and pick apart every little graphical detail, don't focus on what some might call "occasionally corny" dialogue, don't let yourself get taken out of the moment just because some of the lip movements don't perfectly sync up with the words...that's not what this game is about. This game is an experience that is meant to be felt, and if you're willing to open your mind and let a game take you on a journey, this is one of the best purchases you could ever make.
TransCanada Corp., hit by low oil prices and regulatory delays stemming from environmental opposition to some of its projects, says it will cut a fifth of its senior leadership positions, and in the months ahead lay off some rank-and-file employees.
The move from one of Canada's largest pipeline players, the company behind projects such as Keystone XL and Energy East, begins what is expected to be a grim period of layoffs in the energy sector this fall. Oil has lost more than half its value from its peak price last year, and virtually no one expects a quick recovery. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers says at least 35,000 oil patch jobs have already been lost in 2015.
Most of the job cuts have been at the companies that mine or drill for oil, while the pipeline companies have been less affected by $45-a-barrel oil.

Among TransCanada's recent troubles is uncertainty over some projects, including its $8-billion Keystone XL project, which is waiting for approval from the U.S. government. Many wonder whether the pipeline will ever be built. Keystone XL, first imagined seven years ago, has become a symbol in the fight against climate change and oil sands expansion, and the decision has been delayed many times. Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, stated this week she opposes Keystone XL because it has become "a distraction from the important work we have to do to combat climate change."
James Millar, a spokesman for TransCanada, said on Thursday that the company must shed jobs to remain competitive.
"You have a combination of delays in building energy infrastructure coupled with lower oil prices," he said.
"You know the delays we've experienced with Keystone and some of the pushback we're experiencing with Energy East, and I would say that in North America in general, companies are facing pushback primarily from activists – not exclusive to but primarily from – activists that want to see fossil fuels kept in the ground."
TransCanada has 6,000 employees – about 4,000 in Canada. Its first phase of staff cuts came in June, when the company laid off 185 people from its major-projects division.
Employees heard on Monday that the cuts to senior staff positions will be made through layoffs and retirements – although it will not be clear for several weeks how many jobs will be affected. Mr. Millar said this round will include about 20 per cent of vice-president and senior vice-president positions. The cuts will even include a member of the executive leadership team, Jim Baggs, executive vice-president for operations and engineering, who will retire in the coming months.
After the cuts to senior leadership positions, the company will take a hard look at which rank-and-file positions can be trimmed. The entire process should be completed by the end of November.

The moves, he said, will ensure that TransCanada's three business units – natural gas pipelines, liquids pipelines and energy – remain competitive. He added that TransCanada has an ambitious growth plan that includes $46-billion in projects slated for completion by the end of the decade.
Mr. Millar said the job cuts are not related to any one project. But he said low oil prices mean TransCanada's customers – including oil and gas producers – are demanding that projects are completed more cheaply, since they often end up paying a portion of the capital cost.
Last year, TransCanada said delays in receiving U.S. approval for Keystone XL have increased costs by almost 50 per cent, to $8-billion, meaning customers who have signed up to use the pipeline would have to pay higher tolls. The proposed pipeline would carry 830,000 barrels a day from Alberta's oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries set up to process heavy oil. TransCanada chief executive officer Russ Girling has said delays could drive the cost to $10-billion.
And in July, the company said the $12-billion price tag attached to its Energy East project is expected to grow due to adjusting the pipeline's route in response to feedback from communities, governments and indigenous peoples, as well as higher construction costs. The project would ship 1.1 million barrels of crude a day from Alberta and Saskatchewan to refineries and port terminals in Eastern Canada.
In Calgary on Thursday, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley stuck to her decision not to advocate for Keystone XL, which she said would export upgrading and refining jobs as well as bitumen. But she added that she is committed to improving the access to world markets for the landlocked province's energy producers, "which means essentially getting at least one new pipeline built to tidewater."
While not naming Energy East or any other pipeline project, she said "your government is working on this matter through drama-free, ongoing discussions with our key provincial partners in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec."
Another wave of grant money has recently washed onto campus, resulting in limited availabilities for students.
Students can make anywhere from $10 to $22 an hour for internship work and receive $1,000 to $2,000 in tuition remission for completing it.
Getting real-world work experience while in college is a good opportunity. Getting paid heftily is even better. When those doors open for Youngstown State University students, it's amazing.
But problems arise when only some YSU students benefit.
The state is playing favorites by limiting these internships and co-ops to only five fields: the ones that pay.
They don't need any more help. Internships in those fields are already among the highest paid.
Unless you're qualified for fields in advanced manufacturing, aerospace and aviation, bio-health, information technology or the financial sector, you're on your own.
The latter is of particular interest, as our economic woes of late are the direct result of erratic, unregulated behavior by irresponsible and unethical bankers.
John Kasich, the current governor of Ohio and the former managing director of Lehman Brothers, and JobsOhio, his brainchild, formulated these limitations placed on student opportunity that will ultimately eradicate jobs.
By simultaneously investing in IT and advanced manufacturing, and with the rate in which artificial intelligence is progressing, machines ultimately benefit.
Students aspiring to enter a profession in education, law or health (among other fields) are overlooked in the JobsOhio plan.
Granted, there will be a growing need for skilled workers in some of those five fields, but they won't be the only professions seeking workers.
The fact is, if you're outside of the Williamson College of Business Administration or the College of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, find your own internship. And best of luck finding a well-paying one.
Have you ever tried to look for a journalism internship that paid? There aren't many.
Meanwhile, the STEM and WCBA students will fuel Kasich's jobs agenda, moving toward the ultimate goal: a wealthy, ruling elite profiting from lightly staffed, fully automated advanced manufacturing facilities.
We'll always need journalists, lawyers, educators and doctors, regardless of what JobsOhio thinks.
As for financiers, enjoy it while you can. It's only a matter of time before someone creates an algorithm that will calculate and assess market performance and release software that will invest on behalf of the customer while mitigating risk.
We're happy for our STEM and business classmates. But we're feeling a little forgotten in the governor's plan.
If Ohio's educational priorities really are to become one that nurtures business and STEM at the cost of all other fields, we're on the wrong track.
Instead, there should be initiatives to create and fund a diverse and multifaceted workforce, one that offers more than just science and business.
As it was rumoured earlier, Reliance Jio officially announced that it's acquiring the wireless infrastructure of Reliance Communications (RCom). The subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) today announced the signing of a definitive agreement for the acquisition of specified assets of RCom and its affiliates. The monetisation process of assets will be mandated by SBI Capital Markets Limited.
“An asset monetisation process for RCOM assets was mandated by the lenders of RCOM, who appointed SBI Capital Markets Limited to run the process. The process is supervised by an independent group of distinguished industry experts. RJIL emerged as the successful bidder in the two-stage bidding process,” said Jio in a media statement.
As a result of the agreement, Reliance Jio or its nominees will acquire assets of RCom and its nominees under four categories- Towers, Optic Fiber Cable Network (OFC), Spectrum and Media Convergence Nodes (MCN).
“These assets are strategic in nature and are expected to contribute significantly to the large-scale roll-out of wireless and Fiber to Home and Enterprise services by Reliance Jio,” said the company.
The Mukesh Ambani-led telco also confirmed that the “acquisition is subject to receipt of requisite approvals from Governmental and regulatory authorities, consents from all lenders, the release of all encumbrances on the said assets and other conditions precedent. The consideration is payable at completion and is subject to adjustments as specified in the agreement.”
Both the parties are bound by confidentiality obligations and will make further disclosure at the appropriate time. Reliance Jio is being advised by Goldman Sachs, Citigroup Global Markets, JM Financial Private Limited, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, Khaitan & Co and Ernst & Young on this transaction.
In a recent report, it was stated that Reliance Jio emerged as the front-runner to acquire the assets of RCom in the 850 MHz and 2100 MHz band. It was also said that other leading telecom operators Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India, and Idea Cellular also shown interest in RCom's spectrum in the 900 MHz band.
Jio, in the press statement, did not reveal the valuation of the deal. However, the recent report said that the deal is valued at about Rs 19,000 crore for the remainder of the licence period. Having said that, RCom has 850 MHz spectrum in all 22 circles, 2100 MHz spectrum in 13 circles and 900 MHz in 2 circles.
Gangnam District head Shin Yeon-hee Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon
District office wants independence amid feud with Seoul City
By Chung Ah-young
The Gangnam District Office in southern Seoul has demanded that Seoul Metropolitan Government (SMG) grant it autonomy in a protest against the latter's development plan.
Shin Yeon-hee, head of the Gangnam district office, released an open statement Tuesday, calling for Mayor Park Won-soon to respond to two major issues: Why the city excludes the district in talks to develop a property purchased by Hyundai Motor Group in its district; and, concerning this, separating the district from the city by proposing the local government designate Gangnam a special self-governing district.
Shin's strong action comes amid the year-long feud between the SMG and the district office over the development project in Gangnam.
In September last year, Hyundai Motor Group purchased a 79,342-square-meter tract of land from Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO) for 10.55 trillion won ($9.05 billion) to construct a 105-story headquarters building and other facilities.
The conglomerate offered to pay 1.7 trillion won to the city as a public contribution fee if the city eases regulations for the land use. Such a fee is usually spent for public facilities for the region.
The district office claims it deserves to use the fee solely for its residents because they will have to go through the inconvenience of construction and also because the site is located inside the district.
However, the SMG plans to spend the fee on developing areas near the land and around Jamsil Sports Complex which is located in Songpa, a neighboring district.
In the statement, Shin strongly denounced the city for its "high-handed decision."
"Although the SMG has the authority to approve the construction permit, it cannot exclude the district office and its residents in discussions on this high-profile development project crucial for the district and the city alike, and ignoring the autonomy of the district, which is guaranteed by the Constitution," she said.
However, the SMG said that the district maliciously distributed distorted press releases against the city's policy and filed a suit against innocent SMG officials. In April, Shin and 25 Gangnam residents abruptly visited City Hall without prior notice to protest.
"We cannot negotiate with the district if it doesn't change its attitude," an SMG official said.
Besides the Hyundai site, the two sides clashed over how to develop Guryong Village in Gangnam, the last remaining urban slum in Seoul.
A development plan was initiated by former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon but Park attempted to revise it. He then reverted to the original plan after facing fierce protests from the district office.
The two are in another dispute over SMG's plan to build a second Citizens' Hall inside the Seoul Trade Exhibition and Convention Center (SETEC) located in Gangnam. The district office has opposed the plan, saying the area should be developed into a global cultural complex where performances, exhibitions and seminars can be held.
PRIME Minister Julia Gillard has attacked the former Howard government for squandering the rivers of gold flowing before the financial crisis, saying there should be no false nostalgia.
In a speech in Sydney, Ms Gillard said the upcoming September 14 election would not be a contest about some ''lost golden age'' and nor was it time for ''cosy bed-time stories''.
''There should be no false nostalgia for the days that preceded the global financial crisis: the days when our household savings ratio hit zero, when easy credit and rapidly rising terms of trade created a sugar hit that could never be sustained,'' she said today.
''Even then, with rivers of gold flowing into federal coffers, a priceless opportunity was squandered.''
Ms Gillard said if the Howard Coalition government had collected the same amount of revenue as a unit of gross domestic product (GDP) as her government now does, it would have spent its last seven years in office in deficit.
''But rather than invest in the future, this (Coalition government) revenue was spent on quick fixes, at the same time bequeathing a legacy of declining productivity, rising inflation and skills shortages,'' she told the Foreign Correspondents Association function.
Ms Gillard also turned her attention to the Coalition and its criticism of Labor's strategy in dealing with the fallout of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis (GFC) and the resulting rise in government net debt.
''Anyone who pretends this debt should not exist is effectively denying the GFC happened,'' she said.
''Anyone who pretends the GFC didn't happen should be treated as the same kind of amusing curiosity as those who believe the earth is flat.''
The Prime Minister also talked up the need for Australia to prepare for the Asian Century, saying that by 2030 there would be more than three billion middle class consumers in the region.
Australia was already ''pushing on an open door''.
''But once we enter, everything that follows depends on our skill and ingenuity,'' she said.
''Nothing is guaranteed to us - success is not pre-ordained.''
Ms Gillard said the federal election would be a test of which side of politics had a blueprint for Australia's future in Asia.
''And it is only Labor that has that plan.''
The Labor strategy for Asia rested on five pillars, Ms Gillard said - skills and education, high speed broadband, clean energy and innovation, competition and deregulation, and tax reform.
''These are the five pillars this government has identified as key to increasing jobs, prosperity and productivity,'' she said.
Ahead of her trip to China on Friday, Ms Gillard said she would be promoting trade and economic interests and sharing views on global and regional security challenges.
''The timing of this visit so soon after the new leadership has entered into office is deliberate,'' she said.
Ms Gillard cited Australia's rapidly evolving relationship with China and the government's high-level political oversight of that relationship.
''And more broadly, it reflects the centrality of Asia in the story of our nation for the 21st century,'' she said.
Ms Gillard was asked if Australia's influence was waning as China stepped up its presence in places like Fiji.
The Prime Minister recognised China's growing power.
''As China's weight and power continues to rise then of course it will have a stronger and more diverse relationships around the world, including in the Pacific,'' she said.
Ms Gillard said Australia wanted to see more countries working in aid and development in the Pacific, but believed there needed to be more accountability.
''We believe that aid and development money needs to be the subject of proper accountabilities and transparencies so people can see the work that is being done,''she said.
On Fiji, Ms Gillard said Australia continued to look forward to ''free and fair'' elections being held in the island republic which has been run by Commodore Frank Bainimarama since a 2006 military coup.
Asked by a BBC reporter if she took responsibility for the ''ugly'' debate about asylum seekers in Australia, the PM denied the issue was an Australian phenomenon, saying a similar debate was occurring in European countries.
''If you walked out on the streets of London and asked people what they thought about the various waves of asylum seekers coming through into the UK...you would get a variety of views expressed, some of them quite harsh views,'' she said.
The PM defended her government's tough policies on irregular boat arrivals, which includes sending people to Nauru and Papua New Guinea for processing.
''What I have always done in this area is not focused on or seek to demonise the people who are looking for asylum but to deal with the policy principles,'' she said.
These principles were based on compassion and aimed at deterring people from taking dangerous boat journeys to Australia, she added.
Earlier, Ms Gillard told the function Australia managed its immigration intake according to its needs.
''We will continue in the years to come...to be a nation that welcomes migrants, and particularly welcomes skilled migrants,'' she said.
Meanwhile, the Asian century implementation plan will be released by Trade Minister Craig Emerson today.
Dr Emerson will name Leighton chief executive Hamish Tyrwhitt as chair of a strategic advisory board, together with Kraft Foods regional chief Rebecca Dee-Bradbury and RMIT vice-chancellor Margaret Gardner, News Ltd reports.
Former treasury secretary Ken Henry, Telstra chair Catherine Livingstone, The Australian National University's Peter Drysdale, and Corrs Chambers Westgarth chief executive John Denton will also sit on the group.
Under the implementation plan, universities will be encouraged to boost their Asian programs, while there will also be a push to put Chinese language on the curriculum for Year 10 students.
News Ltd says other details of the plan include work to improve trade relations with 16 nations in the region, and the so-called "significant investor visa" to attract migrants willing to invest at least $5 million.
The implementation plan comes after the release of the Asian Century white paper in October last year.
"The implementation plan charts a course for the further release of practical policies in the coming months, giving effect to the white paper's aspirations," Dr Emerson told News Ltd.
It has been expected for weeks, and today Notre Dame quarterback Jimmy Clausen said that it's official: He's entering the NFL draft.
Clausen, who will make a formal announcement today, said ex-Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis, who knows something about NFL offenses, told him he's ready to play at the next level.
“After the season, in talking to my parents and obviously Coach Weis, I just feel it's the right time,” Clausen told ESPN.com. “Coach Weis told me whether he was going to be here or not be here, it was time for me to go. He thought I've improved so much since I came to Notre Dame. So, I'm taking his advice, and I'm going to head out.”
Clausen is viewed as one of the top two or three quarterbacks in this year's draft, with Washington's Jake Locker and Oklahoma's Sam Bradford (if there are no concerns about the long-term health of his shoulder) being the other quarterbacks with first-round grades in the 2010 draft. Clausen said he thinks he's as ready for the NFL as a college quarterback can be.
“The scrutiny of being the quarterback at Notre Dame and the head coach at Notre Dame is tough,” Clausen said. “And I think it'll prepare me really well for the next level.”
After discovering a number of files for the upcoming Far Harbor DLC for Fallout 4, a gamer uncovers a number of details on what the expansion may contain.
The first of Fallout 4‘s three expansions, Automatron, was released last week to good reviews, but it appears that the upcoming Far Harbor DLC pack is the one that gamers are most excited about. However, beyond revealing that Far Harbor is larger than the sizable The Shivering Isles expansion for The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, and that it will take place on a mysterious new island, not much is known about the upcoming Fallout 4 DLC pack. Thanks to the efforts of one Reddit user, though, some light has been shed on what to expect in Far Harbor.
Using the Bethesda Archive Extractor program, Reddit user WilliamWallace2K14 recently stumbled across some Far Harbor files in a folder titled “DLC03” and decided to do some good old-fashioned data mining. One of the first things WilliamWallace came across was a new variant of Yao Guai, called the Ghoul Yao Guai. While a new Yao Guai variant is quite welcome, this discovery pales in comparison to what he found next.
After some more digging around, WilliamWallace found some textures for what appears to be a Giant Squid. If this Giant Squid were to be included in Far Harbor, it would add an interesting new dimension to proceedings, especially for those gamers who were scouring every Fallout 4 ocean for secrets. For those who are curious about what this Giant Squid may look like, check out some of WilliamWallace's screenshots of the Squid's supposed textures.
Aside from a couple of interesting new enemies, WilliamWallace also found some files relating to that secret Harpoon Gun that gamers found a few months ago. It remains to be seen whether this Harpoon Gun will see the light of day, but its addition will definitely provide something new to Fallout 4‘s gun combat.
Based on the details that have been gleaned from the Far Harbor files, some of this discovered content was among the list of cool things cut from Fallout 4. This suggests that rather than cutting out content that wasn't needed, Bethesda was actually saving some of the best stuff as part of Fallout 4‘s post-launch plans. With the prospect of new enemies, underwater combat, and new underwater quests to go through, Far Harbor is definitely shaping up as the most intriguing Fallout 4 DLC yet.
While the Far Harbor expansion is expected to launch in May, Fallout 4 is now available for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

“We made significant investments to strengthen our control framework and compliance programs,” they said. “We self-detected this matter and reported it to the U.S. Department of Justice and other authorities. Our actions demonstrate our determination to pursue a policy of zero tolerance for misconduct and a desire to promote the right culture in our industry.”
UBS was among a group of the world's largest banks that paid a combined $4.25 billion in November to settle with British and Swiss regulators and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of the United States for their role in manipulating foreign currency markets.
As part of its latest agreement with the American authorities, UBS will pay a penalty of $342 million to the Federal Reserve related to the foreign currency investigation, but will receive conditional immunity from prosecution by the Justice Department's antitrust division. UBS said this reflected its role as the firm that first reported potential misconduct to the Justice Department.

This year the 4th Annual New Jersey Ant Together will be held at Jakes Branch County Park. Website Map and depending on how things go, Turkey Swamp Park sometime after lunch.8:00am meet and greet, ~8:15 or 8:30 we'll start anting.We'll meet up at the Nature Center (the main building with the green roof) It's the one with the red star on their map While this is free for the public to attend, however this is basically an all day hiking trip, and might not be appropriate for children and the elderly. Ideally people attending should be a legal adult age, old enough to drive, or accompanied by a parent or guardian. This isn't a baby sitting service, and mother nature generally isn't handicap assessable. Several people, myself included, will likely be taking video and pictures on the day and children make that difficult.I chose this location for a few reasons. Along with having a family friendly park and viewing deck it has 400 acres of natural lands and trails to explore. A study done on Trachymyrmex lists the nearby town of Island Heights as a spot T. septentrionalis can be found, however it's since become overly urbanized and probably wouldn't make for good anting. Thankfully this location is down the road from Jakes Branch County Park so we'll hopefully find a population of them there.We'll likely find a dinner somewhere. I'm open to ideas.Turkey Swamp Park is home to the Allegheny Mound Ant, Formica exsectoides, which are always fun to visit. There are a few trails here that we've never explored. It's not too far from Jakes Branch but still a bit of a drive.A BackpackSunscreen and or Bug RepellentA Small Garden Spade or some sort of Picking Tool for probing into logs and flipping rocks. NJ has at least two species of venomous snakes, and there are plenty of other critters that will bite or sting you for putting your hand in their home.Bottled Water (I'll be bringing a cooler of Water and whatever energy drink is on sale.)Something to snack on if you desire, remember to clean up your trash of course.A Cooling Towel. These things actually work, I might buy a few extra for the day if it's going to be a hot one.An Aspirator if you own one, or your ant collecting tool of choice.Collecting tubes for live specimens.Collecting tubes for dead specimens. (I'll be collecting some everything in a vial of Alcohol for later study.)Anything else you can think of. A moderate sized container perhaps for an easy to catch colony we chance upon. Remember we're not here to dig up colonies but should you happen upon a queen ant or colony that would be an easy catch, we're not going to stop you unless it's destructive to the environment. Digging through a patch of rare plants, taking logs of ants home with you, ripping the bark off of every tree you come across, etc..., are huge red flags. We're not there to destroy the place.Camera and or small note pad for recording observations. I'll likely be recording an episode of Ant Chat as I usually do. If you'd like to not be recorded by me or anyone else, please tell us on the day of.Dress as if you expect to be covered in ticks and chiggers by the end of the day. Tuck in your shirt and socks is recommended but we understand it's not always practical on warm days. No one is making you do this but it's something to think about. We've yet to come across a population of deer ticks, which makes us pretty lucky because they carry Lyme disease. Rest assured they're out there though. After the trip, and periodically during the trip, you should give yourself a thorough search. Avoid walking in tall or knee high grass, and stay away from leaf litter if possible, especially in wet areas where Ticks tend to populate more heavily than dry. It takes roughly 24 hours for ticks to begin feeding on your blood even after they've burrowed into your skin.I'll be PMing everyone who's going my personal cell phone number.

Dec. 18, 2011 by 411eli I may not know your Reddit name, but you have my Reddit heart
So I was running outside in the frigid evening and I stumbled over a small box. HOLY SHIT!! It was from my SS! It was small and heavy so I thought it was books, but I was running out so I didn't have time to open it.
I came back as fast as I could and saw the "fragile" stamp on it. "What could this be?" I thought to myself.
I opened it and I see a heart with what appears to be a knitted item with the words "Made with love, Julia K." I took it out and BAM, it's a sweater. But there's still all this bags and paper. So I slowly unwrap this mysterious item, and BAM, it's coffee. Five bottles of kickass coffee!!! (FYI it's beer.) With a warm, handknit scarf. Thanks so much, Ms. Julia! You're awesome.
Happy and hearty holidays!
Conservatives and right-leaning voters are often the subject of ridicule concerning the peddling of conspiracy theories. The deluge of fake news stories has been a subject of discussion after Hillary Clinton's shocking loss to Donald Trump. President Trump has used the phrase to go after news organizations that have gone off the reservation. Stories about the MLK Jr. bust being removed from the Oval Office, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin tossing an old lady out of her home over 27¢, and Trump renaming black history month all have something in common. They're fake news stories.
But as Democrats lick their wounds, ready more dumpsters to set on fire, and whine incessantly about their candidate getting beat, they too have clung to conspiracy theories for comfort. The Democratic Party is out of power in Washington, 69/99 state legislatures are under GOP control, and two-thirds of the governorships are Republicans as well. In the last eight years, over 1,000 Democratic congressional, state legislature and governor seats have been lost to Republicans. I would need crazy stuff to help me cope too I guess—and for these insufferable politically correct snowflakes, it seems conspiratorial drivel is their source of solace. Republicans aren't immune to it. The New York Times reported on a study, which says, shocker—the losing side of an election tends to drift more to the insane when it comes to news consumption.
The main entrée for the Left is that Russia hacked the election. The Kremlin did deploy a prolonged and sustained propaganda campaign, which saw state-funded media outlets and trolls flood social media with insane stories, but it didn't play a pivotal role in the election. Moreover, the Clinton campaign accepted the result; the Obama White House viewed the results as a reflection of the will of the people, and the Department of Homeland Security said that no spikes in malicious cyber activity were seen on election night. Still, a majority of Democrats polled last month said that Russia hacked the election results. A social media propaganda deluge and messing with vote tallies are different things, with the former certainly not being a hack. So, to be clear again—Russia did not hack the election (which is also virtually impossible). Brendan Nyhan had more (via NYT) [emphasis mine]:
…since the election, there has been a noticeable increase in the flow of dubious and unsupported claims among liberals. One widely circulated post on Medium portrayed the Trump administration's fumbling rollout of a travel ban in late January as an elaborate “trial balloon for a coup d'état.” Brooke Binkowski, managing editor at the rumor-tracking site Snopes, recently told The Atlantic that she has been seeing more false reports aimed at liberals or from liberal sources — “a lot of dubious news, a lot of wishful-thinking-type stuff.” Even some prominent liberals like Robert Reich, the former Secretary of Labor under Bill Clinton, seem open to conspiracy theories of the sort typically espoused by figures like Alex Jones and Glenn Beck. (After the recent violent demonstration at the University of California at Berkeley, Mr. Reich raised the possibility that the far right “was in cahoots” with the agitators, writing a blog post titled “A Yiannopoulos, Bannon, Trump Plot to Control American Universities?”) A simple explanation for this shift is that misperceptions often focus on the president and are most commonly held by members of the other party. Just as Republicans disproportionately endorsed prominent misperceptions during the Obama years (like the birther and death panel myths), Democrats are now the opposition partisans especially likely to fall victim to dubious claims about the Trump administration. [...] To evaluate this conjecture, the political scientists Christina Farhart, Joanne Miller and Kyle Saunders, who study conspiracy theory belief, compared how Democrats and Republicans changed in their responses to a conspiracy predispositions scale created by Mr. Uscinski and his co-authors. […] In total, the percentage of Democrats who agreed on average with the conspiracy claims in the scale increased from 27 percent before the election to 32 percent afterward. By contrast, Republicans' willingness to endorse conspiratorial claims declined after the election over all and for three of the four statements, pushing down the percentage of Republicans who agreed on average with the statements from 28 percent to 19 percent. In other words, losing the presidential election made Democrats more likely to blame secret conspiracies for the state of the world, while making Republicans less willing to indulge these sorts of claims. If you don't believe me, just compare your social media news feeds with what you saw during the campaign — or ask yourself who you think is behind the news you are seeing.
Nyhan added that the predispositions that respondents were asked to evaluate in the study were:
Much of our lives are being controlled by plots hatched in secret places. Even though we live in a democracy, a few people will always run things anyway. The people who really “run” the country are not known to the voters. Big events like wars, economic recessions and the outcomes of elections are controlled by small groups of people who are working in secret against the rest of us.
So, Trump Derangement Syndrome actually is a thing. Additionally, it also shows the Left's appalling inability to accept the two facts: 1) Trump is president; 2) Hillary Clinton was a terrible, dishonest, inauthentic, and untrustworthy candidate who fostered her own demise through her reckless decisions, namely an unapproved and unsecure email server, from which she conducted all of her official business as secretary of state. The discovery and serial lies told by her campaign to explain this trip up only rehashed old criticisms about her from the 1990s, killed her numbers on character issues, which—coupled with the allegations unethical quid-pro-quo dealings at the Clinton Foundation—led to her defeat. Oh, and ignoring tens of millions of white working class voters, who flocked to Trump, also wasn't the best decision. It wasn't the Russians who defeated Clinton, fellow liberals. It was Lady Macbeth herself.
This isn't a slavery issue, or an immigration issue per se. What's remarkable is that most of the migrant child farmworkers are American citizens trying to help their families. This is a poverty issue and it gets to the heart of what we, as consumers, see as the "right price" to pay for food.
Edward R. Murrow's brilliant documentary about the exploitation of farmworkers, Harvest of Shame, was a revelation to TV viewers in 1960. Unfortunately, in 2012, little has changed in the fields. There are no minimum-wage requirements, overtime payments, or guaranteed days off. Farm wages are stagnant. As a result, many farmworkers can't afford to eat the food they pick. (In his book Tomatoland, Barry Estabrook reported that the food pantry is busy every night in Immokalee, Florida, the winter tomato-picking epicenter.)
Children earn about $1,000 per year for working an average of 30 hours a week, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. When you consider that the average annual pay for a migrant family of four is $12,500-$14,500, it's apparent why some families feel they have no choice but to bring their children into the fields with them. Half of these kids will not graduate from high school because they're always moving around, perpetuating the cycle of poverty that caused them to be day laborers in the first place.
And despite an idyllic "back to the land" reputation, crop fields are not the safest work environments for anyone. They're stiflingly hot at times and are often sprayed with toxic pesticides that cause skin irritations, nausea, and breathing difficulties. Because of their size and stage of development, children are up to three times more vulnerable (PDF) to pesticide exposure than adults.
I first met Romano at TEDxFruitvale, the 2011 conference that Bon Appétit sponsored, which examined farm-labor problems; we talked again two weeks ago. He's a tireless advocate for children's rights and argues for enactment of the Federal Children's Act for Responsible Employment (CARE) Act, which would require that children be a minimum of 14 years old to work in the fields (exempting family farms). It would also increase penalties for child labor violations and strengthen provisions for pesticide exposure.
In 1938, Federal law extended protections to working children -- but it intentionally excluded agriculture. Romano points out the irony that a 13-year-old child is permitted to work in 100-degree heat in a strawberry field but not in an air-conditioned office. This exclusion may have had real validity when most food came from family farms. Today, when family farms produce less than 1.5 percent of the food we eat, it demands reconsideration.
As important as legal rights are, protective legislation may not be the best approach. Migrant families will lose their children's wages and would be unable to move with available work.
The Kansas City Chiefs are 6-2 heading in to week nine of the NFL season. The Chiefs are in very good shape in the AFC West, holding a three game lead over every other team thanks in part to a 29-19 victory over the Denver Broncos in week eight. This week, Andy Reid and the Chiefs head to Texas to take on the Dallas Cowboys in what many are calling the game of the week. Here are the week nine Kansas City Chiefs keys to victory.
Week Nine Kansas City Chiefs Keys to Victory
Stop the Run
Sounds so easy right? We say it almost every single week – the Chiefs have to stop the run better or there may be trouble on the horizon come playoff time. In week eight, the Broncos racked up 177 yards on the ground, averaging 5.7 yards a carry – and that was against the 10th ranked rushing offense in the league. This weekend, the Chiefs face the second best rushing attack in the NFL.
The Chiefs are likely catching a break as it looks like Ezekiel Elliott's suspension will finally keep him off of the field for their week nine matchups. There is always a chance that a court ruling could allow the Pro Bowl running back to play, but as of this write-up, Alfred Morris will be starting for the Cowboys. While this will help the Chiefs, don't think that the Cowboys will just give up on running the ball. Their offense is predicated on a ground and play action offense and they will still attempt to grind it out with Morris and a stable of backup running backs. The Cowboys offensive line is good enough to open up holes on any defense in the league. Expect a heavy dose of the ground game aimed at Kansas City's sub-packages.
Do Not Settle for Field Goals
Rookie kicker Harrison Butker set an NFL record by kicking 18 field goals as a rookie in a single calendar month. While this is a great personal achievement for Butker, this stat is an indictment on the offense.
Far too often, the Chiefs sputter in the red zone. Against the Denver Broncos, the Chiefs did not score a single touchdown in the red zone despite making three trips inside Denver's 20-yard line. Over the past three weeks, the Chiefs are only scoring touchdowns on 14% of their red zone drives, by far the worst in the league.
Fortunately against the Broncos, a strong defensive – or poor Broncos offensive – performance helped clinch a Kansas City victory. The Chiefs will be facing a much more dynamic and explosive offense this week and cannot settle for field goals every time they touch the ball.
Play Up Tempo Offense
While the Chiefs offense does have its issues in the red zone, there is no denying that this is still an big play offense. It looks as if the Chiefs will be getting Laurent Duvernay-Tardif back this week, so the offensive line should be at full strength for the first time since week two. That is a good sign as the Chiefs prepare to play a strong and fast defensive line.
The weakness of this Cowboy's defense is definitely its secondary. The Cowboys have a hard time passing off crossing routes and covering tight ends – something the Chiefs are very good at doing when they possess the ball. Expect a heavy dose of tight end Travis Kelce on Sunday with a lot of shorts to intermediate routes to the Chiefs speedy receivers. There will be opportunities for Alex Smith to throw it deep on this defense, especially when the Cowboys line up a linebacker across from Kelce – which will happen.
The Chiefs need to start the offense up with a high tempo and maintain the tempo throughout the game. Keep the Cowboys defense on its heels and score touchdowns when you have the chance. If the Chiefs offense can move the ball, they should position themselves well for a 7-2 record as they head in to their bye week next weekend before hitting the home stretch and fighting for home field advantage in the playoffs.

More than 500 male staff and pupils face genetic testing at Catholic school in La Rochelle after 16-year-old girl raped
A private Catholic school in France is to test the DNA of all male pupils and staff in an attempt to identify the rapist of a 16-year old girl who was assaulted in the school toilets.
In the first time this mass screening has been carried out in a French school, 527 pupils and staff will be genetically tested from Monday at the Fénelon Notre-Dame school in La Rochelle.
The victim said she was unable to identify the rapist, who attacked her from behind in darkness after the light on an automatic time switch went off, according to the prosecutor Isabelle Pagenelle. But traces of DNA were found on her clothing.
Those to be tested include 475 pupils, 31 staff and 21 other employees who were in the school in western France at the time of the attack on t30 September last year.
The DNA is to be collected in saliva swabs over three days by 18 police officers who will be at the school from Monday. Pagenelle told a news conference that the DNA from the girl's clothes had tested negatively against the victim's family and friends.
But the genetic testing of teenagers has proved controversial, particularly as the authorities say that anyone who refuses to take part will be considered a suspect.
"I understand the argument that those who have done nothing wrong have no reason to refuse. But why should refusal be considered an admission of guilt?" said Pierre Tartakowsky, president of the French human rights league. He told Sunday's edition of Le Parisien newspaper that the testing was "disproportionate, threatening and traumatising".
"The issue is to know whether the sole fact of being a pupil at this establishment is a plausible enough reason to become a suspect," said Françoise Martres, the head of the French magistrates' union.
Pagenelle said there was a significant probability that the attacker was from the school. Police had a list of all those on the premises at the time of the rape, she said. The school, in the centre of La Rochelle, has 1,300 pupils.
The headteacher, Chantal Devaux, who informed pupils and their parents on Friday about the testing, said: "We have followed every lead before going down this route. We don't have any other choice." Testing of minors at the school will require parental approval.
The genetic-testing results will be known within a month. Pagenelle said all results unconnected to the rape would be destroyed.
Americans are more concerned about the changing planet when the words "global warming" are used than when they hear "climate change," new research finds.
The two terms are often used synonymously, but new surveys reveal that they carry different connotations for many people, particularly African Americans, Hispanic Americans, liberals and people between the ages of 31 and 48. Republicans see the two terms as more or less equivalent, but Democrats, political independents, liberals and moderates are more likely to express concern about "global warming" than "climate change."
"The studies found that the two terms are often not synonymous — they mean different things to different people — and activate different sets of beliefs, feelings and behaviors, as well as different degrees of urgency about the need to respond," the researchers wrote in a report released today (May 27). [8 Ways Global Warming Is Already Changing the World]
A history of two terms
The term "climate change" is about 20 years older than the term "global warming." Wallace Broecker, a geoscientist at Columbia University known as the "Grandfather of Climate Science," coined the latter term in 1975. Even for scientists, the two terms have different definitions.
"Global warming refers to the increase in the Earth's average surface temperature since the Industrial Revolution, primarily due to the emission of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change," Yale University researcher Anthony Leiserowitz and colleagues wrote in the new report, "whereas climate change refers to the long-term change of the Earth's climate, including changes in temperature, precipitation and wind patterns over a period of several decades or longer."
Many media outlets use the terms interchangeably, and both terms have become politicized. In 2002, Republican strategist Frank Luntz suggested that the George W. Bush administration use the words "climate change" rather than "global warming," because climate change seemed less emotional, and more controllable. Now, however, conservatives tend to use the words "global warming" more, while liberals prefer "climate change," according to a 2011 analysis published in the journal Public Opinion Quarterly.
Google Trends reveals that, historically, Internet users have searched more for "global warming" than "climate change," but the gap has closed in the past couple of years.
Warming or change?
Leiserowitz, who heads the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, and his colleagues commissioned two national surveys to find out how Americans respond to each term today. One of the surveys, conducted in January, was based on a nationally representative sample of 1,021 adults. The other, conducted in November and December 2013, was based on a nationally representative sample of 1,657 adults.
In the January survey, the researchers asked participants about their experiences with the terms "global warming" and "climate change." They found that Americans reported equal familiarity with both terms but were more likely to use and hear the words "global warming." Forty-five percent reported hearing "global warming" more often, compared with 12 percent who said they heard "climate change" more. (Meanwhile, 37 percent said they heard both terms equally.) And 35 percent of Americans said they used "global warming" more themselves, compared with 16 percent who said they used "climate change" more.
In the November/December survey, the researchers asked participants about their concerns and feelings about climate change. For half of the participants, the questions referred to "climate change." For the other half, the researchers asked the same questions, but with the words "global warming" instead of "climate change."
Overall, the results were striking: Americans were generally more concerned, threatened and moved to act when they were responding to the term "global warming" versus "climate change." For example, respondents were 13 percentage points more likely to say "global warming" is bad than they were to say "climate change" is bad — 76 percent compared to 63 percent.
When participants were asked to free-associate with both terms, "global warming" resulted in more associations with melting ice, flooding and the ozone hole (a different problem). "Climate change" was more closely linked with weather phenomena such as storms. However, "global warming" was more likely to bring up thoughts of severe weather than "climate change."
Fifteen percent of Americans reported feeling "very worried" about global warming, versus 9 percent about climate change, and 38 percent reported feeling that global warming would harm them, compared with 30 percent who felt personally threatened by climate change. Twenty-nine percent would take action against "global warming," compared with 23 percent who would fight "climate change."
Boosting believability
Sixty-two percent of Americans responded that "global warming" is happening, and 63 percent said that "climate change" is happening. But people feel more certainty about "global warming," the survey found: 27 percent of Americans feel "extremely sure" that "global warming" is happening. When the term "climate change" was used, only 20 percent said they felt that level of certainty. [The Reality of Climate Change: 10 Myths Busted]
Some of these differences are even more extreme when subgroups are considered. For example, men are 12 percent more likely to believe that "global warming" is happening versus "climate change." People between the ages of 31 and 48 are 21 percent more likely to believe in global warming over climate change. And self-described political liberals are 19 percent more likely to feel that extreme certainty when the term "global warming" is used compared with "climate change."
Equal numbers of Americans blame human activities for the changes, no matter which term is used. They're also equally likely to say that scientists agree the world is warming, whether the changes are dubbed "global warming" or "climate change," though liberals and political independents see more scientific consensus when the term "global warming" is used.
The findings suggest that, politically, scientists will gain little by using the term "climate change," as Republicans are equally skeptical of both terms, the researchers conclude. But using "climate change" appears to reduce concern and interest among people on the rest of the political spectrum.
The connotations of the terms could change over time, the researchers warned, but advocates for reducing the problem should know what reactions their language is likely to trigger.
"Scientists often prefer the term 'climate change' for technical reasons, but should be aware that the two terms generate different interpretations among the general public and specific subgroups," the researchers wrote.

Mr Singh gave chase before being stabbed to death Police investigating the murder of a man stabbed to death after chasing handbag snatchers in east London have arrested three men. Sukhwinder Singh, 31, was attacked on Friday as he pursued two men who had mugged a 28-year-old woman in Barking. Mr Singh died at the Royal London Hospital. A post-mortem test showed he died from a stab wound to the heart. At 1400 GMT three men were arrested by police acting on intelligence. They are being held in custody in east London. Additional suspects Police described Mr Singh as a "hero" for his actions. The woman was walking home from Barking Station at about 1840 GMT when she was attacked from behind by two men who grabbed her handbag. The bag has not been recovered. Following the robbery Mr Singh chased the suspects for about 60 yards along Victoria Road into Uphall Road, where it is believed that an altercation took place and he was stabbed. The handbag has not been recovered A Metropolitan Police spokesman said they now believed more than two suspects were involved in the killing. Det Ch Insp Stephen Clayman said: "We need to hear from anybody who witnessed the initial robbery, the actual stabbing and anyone who may have seen suspects running away from the Uphall Road area. "I wish to encourage members of the public to come forward and speak to police - no matter how insignificant they may feel their information is." He added: "If they have fears regarding speaking to police, I assure them that we can allay those fears." Mr Singh was an Indian national who had lived in the UK for about 10 years. According to the Met, he had cousins in Barking but his family lived in India. Earlier on Wednesday police released a CCTV image of the handbag believed to have been stolen.

(JTA) — Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France appealed to his country's Jews to stay in the wake of a call by his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu for European Jews to move to Israel.
“My message to French Jews is the following: France is wounded with you and France does not want you to leave,” Valls said Monday following a weekend that saw two deadly shootings in Copenhagen that mirrored two attacks in Paris last month, the French news agency AFP reported.
In the wake of the Copenhagen attacks, including one outside a synagogue that left a Jewish volunteer security guard dead, Netanyahu said Sunday in a statement, “To the Jews of Europe and to the Jews of the world, I say that Israel is waiting for you with open arms.”
Also Sunday, Netanyahu at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting said that a 180 million shekel (about $45 million) plan will be submitted to the Cabinet encouraging the absorption of immigrants from France, Belgium and Ukraine.
On Monday, Valls said, “The place for French Jews is France. I regret Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks. Being in the middle of an election campaign doesn't mean you authorize yourself to make just any type of statement.”
Israeli national elections are scheduled for March 17.
Valls also said that the threat of terror attacks remains high in France and that security measures would remain stringent for as long as necessary. France deployed 10,000 troops to protect Jewish buildings and other public sites in the wake of the two Paris attacks by Islamists last month that left 17 dead, including four Jewish men at a kosher supermarket.
On Sunday, it was reported that several hundred graves were vandalized at a Jewish cemetery in northeastern France. Valls on Twitter called the vandalism “a vile, anti-Semitic act, an insult to the memory” of the dead and vowed to find those responsible.
Justice League hasn't hit theaters yet but according to J.K. Simmons, who plays Commissioner Gordon, Warner Bros. is already working on a script for a sequel.

“But this is the first Justice League movie — we hope — of a few,” Simmons said in the December issue of Total Film magazine. “They're working on scripts for The Batman and for the next Justice League movie. It introduces my incarnation of Commissioner Gordon. I don't have a lot to do. I feel like I just dipped my toe in the water of who is a Commissioner Gordon will be.”
We knew that The Batman director Matt Reeves was starting from scratch on a new Batman script, but this is the first we've heard about a Justice League 2 script being developed. No word on who's writing the script, but I doubt it's Justice League writer Chris Terrio. He just landed the next Star Wars movie.

A THANKSGIVING service blessing asparagus at Worcester Cathedral has come under fire after being labelled an “absurd pantomime” that “brought the Church of England into disrepute.”
But Canon Precentor at Worcester Cathedral, Michael Brierley, has defended the service, pointing out it is part of English tradition.
The service, held on Sunday, helped mark the beginning of the popular British Asparagus Festival, which annually celebrates the much-loved vegetables through various events, including an asparagus run.
However the service, beginning two months of activities, has received criticism nationally, including from influential Church of England blog Archbishop Cranmer, run by theologian Adrian Hilton.
In the blog he slammed the service as “a farce” with strong criticism of having characters, such as Asparagus Man, involved.
He compared them to Teletubbies adding they had “no place at all in a worshipful act of reverence”.
The blog said: “Did the Dean of Worcester Cathedral not pause to think for just one second how utterly, utterly absurd this would look? Really, words fail.
“A sacred procession down the Cathedral nave becomes an infantile pantomime as a block of asparagus is elevated and adored like the Blessed Host, and two men dressed up like Monty Python pay some sort of vacuous obsequious homage.
“This is church, for God's sake.
“England might be a major producer of asparagus, and the Vale of Evesham might be hosting the world famous Asparagus Festival, but where exactly does this stop?
“Would the Church of England permit a man dressed up as a baked bean to process behind a Heinz tin of the things.
“Surely Worcester Cathedral could have found a way of thanking God for asparagus without bringing the Church of England into disrepute.”
The controversy came as a group from the festival travelled to the European Parliament on Tuesday, when asparagus was granted protected geographical status under EU Law.
Canon Precentor at Worcester Cathedral, Michael Brierley, said: “Asparagus-growing is a vital part of life in Worcestershire.
“Recently, Vale of Evesham asparagus has been awarded EU protected name status, and when the festival organisers asked if a round of the vegetable could be blessed in a service at the cathedral on St George's day, the first day of their farming season, the cathedral was very happy to include a thanksgiving for asparagus at its evening service, as a sign of the abundant provision and generosity of God.
“Offering to God the first-fruits of the harvest is deeply embedded in both biblical and English tradition.”
“Indeed, offering the first-fruits of the wheat harvest has been recognised by the Church of England with formal liturgy since 2006.”
One of the festival organisers, Angela Tidmarsh said: “The Cathedral have been incredible supportive.
“It was a wonderful occasion - it was a thanksgiving service for asparagus and its growers in Worcestershire.”
Chairman of the Asparagus Festival Community Interest Company, Nigel Smith, added that the appearance of St George and Gus the Asparagus man had "in no way detracted" from the dignity of the service or occassion.
"St George is the patron saint and was appropriate on St George's Day, and Gus represents the growers of asparagus in the Vale of Evesham," he said.
What kind of people is Pope Francis surrounding himself with? The fact that this Pope decided to choose German professor John Schellnhuber as his chief climate change advisor is raising a lot of eyebrows. Schellnhuber doesn't believe in God, but as you will see below, he does appear to believe in ‘Gaia'. Schellnhuber has also advocated for the establishment of an “Earth Constitution”, a “Global Council” directly elected by the citizens of the world, and a “Planetary Court” that would serve as the pinnacle of a planetary legal system. In addition, he believes that the “carrying capacity” of our planet is less than one billion people. This is the man that the Pope has chosen to advise him on the issue that Pope Francis has made the centerpiece of his papacy. (Read More...)
O "ousado" Felipe Melo, como o próprio volante se define nas redes sociais, teve uma apresentação no Palmeiras digna do apelido que ele criou. Rebateu críticas sobre as expulsões na carreira, questionou a imprensa e disse que não é um jogador "só de porrada". Mas também não descartou dar tapa em adversário se considerar necessário. Sobrou até para o Flamengo.
– Nos últimos quatro, cinco anos, eu recebi apenas quatro cartões vermelhos. Para um meio-campista que está acostumado a fazer trabalho sujo, é muito pouco. Tem muita gente que me critica, mas gostaria de ter o Felipe Melo no time – foi a primeira dura resposta do jogador de 33 anos, que ainda foi além.

– Essa história de que o Felipe Melo é maldoso foi criada pela imprensa. Se não me engano, a minha média de cartões é menor do que a do Gabriel Jesus, menor do que a do Fernandinho, que está na Seleção. As imagens que mostravam de mim era de expulsões, de faltas. Felipe Melo não é só porrada é técnica também. Não fiquei 13 anos à toa na Europa. Se tiver que dar tapa em uruguaio, eu vou dar, se tiver que dar porrada, eu vou dar porrada – disse, em seguida.
+ Felipe Melo diz ter recebido proposta do São Paulo
+ Volante muda apresentação e tira foto com a família
A primeira entrevista coletiva como palmeirense, no entanto, não se limitou a rebater críticas. Felipe Melo também falou da expectativa de ser campeão em seu retorno ao futebol brasileiro.
– Quando o Mattos me ligou ele disse que o time estava sendo montado para ganhar todas as competições, não só a Libertadores. Queremos ganhar tudo. Vamos fazer um grande trabalho. Nós sonhamos em ganhar tudo e fazer história aqui dentro. Ganhei o Brasileiro pelo Cruzeiro e sei o quanto é gostoso. Quero repetir. O time a ser batido é o Palmeiras. Eu joguei a Libertadores quando era jovem, era coadjuvante. Agora, eu sou ator principal.
Veja abaixo mais da entrevista de Felipe Melo e divirta-se:
FIM DE CARREIRA NO PALMEIRAS?
– É complicado falar de futuro. Espero estar vivo quando chegar aos 37 anos. Espero estar correndo, bem. Sou um jogado que se cuida bastante, poucas vezes fiquei fora por lesão. Vai depender do meu psicológico.
SUCESSO NAS REDES SOCIAIS
– É uma forma importante de eu estar perto do torcedor. Uso Twitter, Instagram, fiz agora um site. É uma forma de receber carinho do torcedor. É o mínimo que a gente tem que fazer, já que o torcedor vai nos estádios, vibra.

POSICIONAMENTO EM CAMPO
– Eu falei com quatro jogadores e falaram que o essencial para o Palmeiras ser campeão foi o grupo. Independentemente da posição, de jogar um pouco mais à frente ou atrás... Eu não vi o Palmeiras como melhor elenco, eu vi como o melhor grupo. Muitos companheiros falaram comigo e acho que devemos manter essa união. Se tivermos isso, vamos estar concentrados.
EDUARDO BAPTISTA
– É um treinador que me surpreendeu muito por ter as ideias claras. Ele sabe o que fazer. É um grupo que sonha bastante e a gente quer ganhar.
O RETORNO
– Estou voltando para a minha pátria amada Palmeiras. Essa é a minha casa hoje. A gente fala Porco, a gente veste verde. Vai chegar momento adverso, mas vamos trabalhar para estarmos sólidos.
CLASSE DESUNIDA
– É uma classe muito desunida. Vocês jornalistas são muito unidos. Se um jogador de futebol fala mal de qualquer um de vocês, vocês se unem e vão contra. Nós jogadores de futebol somos bobos. Não estou generalizando, mas muitos de vocês ganham dinheiro para falar mal dos outros. A classe futebolística é muito desunida.
REENCONTRO COM ZÉ ROBERTO E MICHEL BASTOS
– Para mim é uma honra poder jogar com o Zé Roberto. O Michel é um cara que eu pude jogar no Grêmio junto, jogamos Copa do Mundo. Ele é um cara super profissional. O Zé Roberto é um cara que precisa ser estudado. Eu me espelho muito nele e procuro a cada ano que passa estar como ele. Espero vencer, da mesma maneira que vencemos na Seleção.
AUSÊNCIA DA SELEÇÃO
– Eu acho que fui injustiçado, tinha sido o melhor meio-campista da Itália. Acho que faltou um treinador de culhão para me levar à Seleção. Acho que o Brasil agora está muito representado de treinador e de auxiliar, que é o Sylvinho, com quem trabalhei no Inter. Mas a minha seleção agora é o Palmeiras.
FELLIPE BASTOS?
– Eu recebi o vídeo e achei engraçado (veja aqui diretor do Corinthians confundindo o nome do reforço com o de Felipe Melo). A televisão só fala de Felipe Melo e ele se confundiu. Vai ser bacana o nosso rival trazer bons jogadores. O Fellipe Bastos, não conheço, mas sei que é um bom jogador. Mas o Pitbull de verdade está aqui.
ARREPENDIMENTO
– Não me arrependo de nada na minha vida. Ah, me arrependo de ter casado aos 18 anos com uma mulher que nunca amei.
Bill Clinton More Popular Than George W. Bush
Doug Mataconis · · 12 comments
A new Rasmussen poll of the public's attitude toward President Obama's two most immediate successors shows much more fondness for the Clinton era than the Bush years:
Democrats see Bill Clinton as a key factor in embattled Senator Blanche Lincoln's Arkansas primary win last week and a new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey shows that 51% of voters have a favorable opinion of the former president. Forty-six percent (46%) regard him unfavorably. Those numbers are a bit better than the comparable ratings for George W. Bush. Forty-five percent (45%) offer a favorable opinion of him while 53% say the opposite. Twenty-two percent (22%) now say Clinton was one of America's best presidents ever, while 15% now say he was one of the worst. Sixty-two percent (62%) put him somewhere in between the two.
This isn't really all that surprising. After all, President Clinton's time in office was one of relatively strong economic growth and Clinton himself left office with an approval rating above 60%.
Bush, on the other hand, presided over recessions at the beginning and end of his Presidency as well as two controversial wars so that, when he left office, he had a disapproval rating nearing 60%. To the extent that President, largely unfairly, get credit or blame for the economic climate they preside over, it's pretty easy to see why people would have a nostalgia for the 1990s rather than the 200s.
There is some good news for Bush, though:
The latest numbers, for Bush, bleak as they are, mark a turnaround of sorts for the former president. Just before he left office in January 2009, Bush was rated one of the five worst presidents in U.S. history by 57% of Americans.
And at least he's managed to redeem himself a little in the eyes of the public, unlike his Vice-President:
President Obama's immediate predecessor in the White House is more popular than the man who served as his vice president for eight years. Thirty-four percent (34%) have a favorable view of Cheney but 61% view Cheney unfavorably. That latter figure is up eight points from a year ago.
Perhaps that's because Bush has remained relatively quiet, while Cheney has chosen to take on an even more public role than he had when he was Vice-President.
Overview
Tracheostomy Tracheostomy
Tracheostomy (tray-key-OS-tuh-me) is a surgically created hole through the front of your neck and into your windpipe (trachea). The term for the surgical procedure to create this opening is tracheotomy.
A tracheostomy provides an air passage to help you breathe when the usual route for breathing is somehow obstructed or impaired. A tracheostomy is often needed when health problems require long-term use of a machine (ventilator) to help you breathe. In rare cases, an emergency tracheotomy is performed when your airway is suddenly blocked, such as after a traumatic injury to your face or neck.
When a tracheostomy is no longer needed, it's allowed to heal shut or is surgically closed. For some people, a tracheostomy is permanent.
Mayo Clinic's approach
Why it's done
Situations that may call for a tracheostomy include:
Medical conditions that require the use of a breathing machine (ventilator) for an extended period, usually more than one or two weeks
Medical conditions that block or narrow your airway, such as vocal cord paralysis or throat cancer
Paralysis, neurological problems or other conditions that make it difficult to cough up secretions from your throat and require direct suctioning of the windpipe (trachea) to clear your airway
Preparation for major head or neck surgery to assist breathing during recovery
Severe trauma to the head or neck that obstructs breathing
Other emergency situations when breathing is obstructed and emergency personnel can't put a breathing tube through your mouth and into your trachea
Emergency care
Most tracheotomies are performed in a hospital setting. However, in the case of an emergency, it may be necessary to create a hole in a person's throat when outside of a hospital, such as at the scene of an accident.
Emergency tracheotomies are difficult to perform and have an increased risk of complications. A related and somewhat less risky procedure used in emergency care is a cricothyrotomy. This procedure creates a hole directly into the voice box (larynx) at a site immediately below the Adam's apple (thyroid cartilage).
Once a person is transferred to a hospital and stabilized, a cricothyrotomy is replaced by a tracheostomy if there's a need for long-term breathing assistance.
Risks
Tracheostomies are generally safe, but they do have risks. Some complications are particularly likely during or shortly after surgery. The risk of such problems greatly increases when the tracheotomy is performed as an emergency procedure. Immediate complications include:
Bleeding
Damage to the trachea
Air trapped in tissue under the skin of the neck (subcutaneous emphysema), which can cause breathing problems and damage to the trachea or food pipe (esophagus)
Buildup of air between the chest wall and lungs (pneumothorax), which causes pain, breathing problems or lung collapse
A collection of blood (hematoma) may form in the neck and compress the trachea, which causes breathing problems
Misplacement or displacement of the tracheostomy tube
Long-term complications are more likely the longer a tracheostomy is in place. These problems include:
Displacement of the tracheostomy tube from the trachea
Narrowing of the trachea
Abnormal tissue formation in the trachea
Obstruction of the tracheostomy tube
Development of an abnormal passage between the trachea and esophagus (fistula), which can increase the risk of fluids or food entering the lungs
Development of a passage between the trachea and the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate fistula), which can generate life-threatening bleeding
Infection
Bacterial colonization, which may cause illness, such as pneumonia
If you still need a tracheostomy after you've left the hospital, you'll need to keep regularly scheduled appointments for monitoring possible complications. You'll also receive instructions about when you should call your doctor about problems, such as:
Bleeding at the tracheostomy site or from the trachea
Difficulty breathing through the tube
Pain or a change in comfort level
Redness
Swelling
A change in the position of your tracheostomy tube
How you prepare
How you prepare for a tracheostomy depends on the type of procedure you'll undergo. If you'll be receiving general anesthesia, your doctor may ask that you avoid eating and drinking for several hours before your procedure. You may also be asked to stop certain medications.
Plan for your hospital stay
After the tracheostomy procedure, you'll likely stay in the hospital for several days as your body heals. If possible, plan ahead for your hospital stay by bringing:
Comfortable clothing, such as pajamas, a robe and slippers
Personal care items, such as your toothbrush and shaving supplies
Entertainment to help you pass the time, such as books, magazines or games
Writing supplies, such as a pencil and a pad of paper to help you communicate since you'll be unable to talk at first
What you can expect
During the procedure
A tracheotomy is most commonly performed in an operating room with general anesthesia, which makes you unaware of the surgical procedure. A local anesthetic to numb the neck and throat is used if the surgeon is worried about the airway being compromised from general anesthesia or if the procedure is being done in a hospital room rather than an operating room.
The type of procedure you undergo depends on why you need a tracheostomy and whether the procedure was planned. There are essentially two options:
Surgical tracheotomy can be performed in an operating room or in a hospital room. During a surgical tracheotomy, the surgeon usually makes a horizontal incision through the skin at the lower part of the front of your neck. The surgeon carefully pulls back the surrounding muscles and cuts through a small portion of the thyroid gland, exposing the windpipe (trachea). At a specific spot on your windpipe near the base of your neck, the surgeon creates a hole and inserts a tracheostomy tube into the hole. A neck strap attached to the face plate of the tube keeps it from slipping out of the hole, and temporary sutures also can be used to secure the faceplate to the skin of your neck.

A neck strap attached to the face plate of the tube keeps it from slipping out of the hole, and temporary sutures also can be used to secure the faceplate to the skin of your neck. Minimally invasive tracheotomy is typically performed in a hospital room. The doctor makes a small incision near the base of the front of the neck. A special lens is fed through the mouth so that the surgeon can view the inside of the throat. Using this view of the throat, the surgeon guides a needle into the windpipe to create the tracheostomy hole. The hole is then expanded to accommodate the tracheostomy tube. A neck strap attached to the faceplate of the tube keeps it from falling out of the windpipe.
After the procedure
You'll likely spend several days in the hospital as your body heals. During that time, you'll learn skills necessary for maintaining and coping with your tracheostomy:
Caring for your tracheostomy tube. A nurse will teach you how to clean and change your tracheostomy tube to help prevent infection. You'll continue to do this as long as you have a tracheostomy.
A nurse will teach you how to clean and change your tracheostomy tube to help prevent infection. You'll continue to do this as long as you have a tracheostomy. Speaking. In general, a tracheostomy prevents you from speaking because exhaled air goes out the tracheostomy opening rather than up through your voice box. However, there are devices and techniques for redirecting airflow enough to produce speech. Depending on the tube size and design, the diameter of your trachea, and the condition of your voice box, you may be able to use your voice with the tube in place. If necessary, you'll meet with a speech therapist or a nurse trained in tracheostomy care, who can suggest options for communicating and help you learn to use your voice again.

While you're healing, you'll receive nutrients through an intravenous (IV) line inserted into a vein in your body, a feeding tube that passes through your mouth or nose, or a tube inserted directly into your stomach. When you're ready to eat again, you may need to work with a speech therapist, who can help you regain the muscle strength and coordination needed for swallowing.

When you're ready to eat again, you may need to work with a speech therapist, who can help you regain the muscle strength and coordination needed for swallowing. Coping with dry air. The air you breathe will be much drier since it no longer passes through your moist nose and throat before reaching your lungs. This can cause irritation, coughing and excess mucus coming out of the tracheostomy. Directly instilling small amounts of saline into the tracheostomy tube may help loosen secretions and add moisture. A saline nebulizer treatment can be delivered to a mist collar via a tube attached to a nebulizer machine. You may use a device called a heat and moisture exchanger, which captures moisture from the air you exhale and humidifies the air you inhale.

Results
In most cases, a tracheostomy is temporary, providing an alternative breathing route until other medical issues are resolved. If a person needs to remain connected to a ventilator indefinitely, the tracheostomy is often the best permanent solution.
Your health care team will help you determine when it's appropriate to remove the tracheostomy tube. The hole may heal shut on its own, or it can be closed surgically.

Zapping (Wand of polymorph)
If you travel via mass transit, especially within a busy city, you know the routine: most people hop on their train/bus, stare at the floor, and internalize their struggle or whatever is going on in their lives. Sometimes, people may dance or play music in the hopes of getting a few spare dollars, but usually people are just trying to stay in their own zone until their stop comes up. In the above video, it looks like someone transformed the dynamic on the train, and one man's Luke Cage-inspired story is catching fire on these internets.
The video, which was captured by a Brooklyn man named Crispin Booker, starts with one man walking through the crowded train car asking for people to share their stories, mentioning that "we all have something we can celebrate." Soon enough, a tall, bearded man in a navy blue hoodie dropped some intriguing darts on the people surrounding him.
"Just about a month ago," he starts, "I'd be considered a scary guy with a hoodie; black, beard. But just a month ago on Netflix, Luke Cage made it cool!" Luke Cage showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker told Complex that the idea of Cage rocking a hoodie was, in a sense, a way to take the power of the hoodie back, stating that while the perception of a hoodie-wearing individual might be one thing, "You can even be a hero."
POST CONTINUES BELOW
The man went on to say that he works in Manhattan, works for a hedge fund, and was donating computers to the island of Grenada, saying that he's "that new face of the black, tall, dark fellow in a hoodie." With a beard.
That man wasn't the only one to share; a guy by the name of James shared the good news about a job he had. One can only imagine what was shared before the camera started rolling, but once the train hit 59th Street, it felt like the people riding in that packed train felt a bit better about their night, or at least their commute.
The shutdown of a Canadian billionaire's online gambling Web site shows the U.S. government is willing to assert its legal authority over Internet properties outside American boundaries – even those based in Canada, a Toronto domain name registrar warns.
Saskatchewan-born Calvin Ayre, 50, and three of his associates werecharged Tuesday with allegedly operating an online gambling site, apractice outlawed in the U.S. in 2006. The charges were filed in afederal court in Maryland.
The case raises questions about Internet sovereignty because U.S.officials were able to take the site, Bodog.com, off the Net eventhough it'sowned by a Canadian and operated out of various offices overseas.
“You could be (based) outside the U.S. and you could be minding yourown business and suddenly, some attorney-general in some U.S. statecould say I don't like what's happening here and issue a takedownorder,” said Mark Jeftovic, founderand CEO of EasyDNS Technologies Inc., aToronto firm that providesdomain hosting and registry services.
Calvin Ayre: billionaire accusedof running an illegal gambling site.
The Bodog case means Canadian-owned Web sites with a.com, .net or .orgsuffix could be subject to U.S. laws simply because the registry forthose domains (in the case of .com and.net, Verisign) is based onAmerican soil, Jetkovic said.
“This is a concern for every non-American who relies on a domain run bya U.S.-based registry operator,” he said.
Although it appears that Bodog.com went through a Vancouver companycalled Domainclip to register its domain, all .com sites in the worldare ultimately overseen by Reston, Va.-based Verisign, Jeftovic said.
But the Bodog case isn't anything new, it's just a high-profile exampleof the U.S. state enforcing international Internet laws that alreadyexist, said Byron Holland, president and CEO of the Canadian InternetRegistration Authority in Ottawa.
Not new, just more noteworthy
“This type of thing has certainly happened before,” Holland said. “Theprimary implication is that people need to be educated about wheretheir digital content is being housed, created or registered.”
American laws also apply to Canadian-owned sites and Web content if thedomain is hosted or has its data stored by a company based in the U.S.,Holland added: “It's not just where the server resides but any of thosetouch points along the way.”
By the same principle, a U.S.-owned site is subject to Canadian laws ifits domain is registered or hosted here, Holland said.
To illustrate that Bodog isn't the first foreign site to run afoul ofU.S. laws, Holland cited the case of RojaDirecta.com. Even though thelive sports streaming Web site is based in Spain, the U.S. Immigrationand Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency successfully seized its domainaddress last year because it had a .com domain, thus subject to U.S.law. The site was taken down over allegations it was streamingcopyrighted SuperBowl content over theInternet.
The Bodog shutdown made big news out of old, existing legislativeparameters just because Ayre lives a flashy existence, Hollandsuggested.
“Any time you mix sex, money and gambling into it, it will highlightthe story.”
Ayre, the son of pig farmers, graced the cover of Forbes magazine'sannual billionaires issue in 2006 and is known for a jet-settinglifestyle that includes partying with the likes of heiress ParisHilton.

We call for a straightforward approach to the redesign of a culture, in which the age-old inadequacies of war, poverty, hunger, debt, environmental degradation and unnecessary human suffering are viewed not only as avoidable, but totally unacceptable.
The Venus Project is a veritable blueprint for the genesis of a new world civilization, one that is based on human concern and environmental reclamation. One fundamental premise is that we work towards having all of the Earth's resources as the common heritage of all the world's people. Anything less will simply result in a continuation of the same catalog of problems inherent in the present system.
Experience tells us that human behavior can be directed, either toward constructive or destructive activity. This is what The Venus Project is all about – directing our technology and resources toward the positive, for the maximum benefit of people and planet, and seeking out new ways of thinking and living that emphasize and celebrate the vast potential of the human spirit. We have the tools at hand to design and build a future that is worthy of the human potential.
The Venus Project presents a bold, new direction for humanity that entails nothing less than the total redesign of our culture. Our proposition is not an attempt to predict what will be done, only what could be done. The responsibility for our future is in our hands, and depends on the decisions that we make today. The greatest resource that is available today is our own ingenuity.

CLOSE FBI Director James Comey says there was no additional evidence that would change its conclusion that no charges will be filed against Democrat Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton. The Mexican peso and U.S. Dollar are also higher. Video provided by TheStreet Newslook

On the eve of the U.S. presidential election, the Dow closed up 371 points Monday after FBI director James Comey said the agency is not recommending criminal charges against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over her emails.
The broad market broke a nine-day losing streak, Wall Street's longest in 36 years, as investors again started to price in their base case of a Clinton win and split Congress.
In a letter to lawmakers Sunday, Comey said the FBI is standing by its original findings, made in July, that Clinton should not be prosecuted for her handling of classified information over email as secretary of State. Comey, of course, had roiled the financial markets back on Friday, Oct. 28, when he sent a letter to Congress saying he was reviewing more emails tied to Clinton found in an unrelated case.
The S&P 500 closed up 46.34 points, or 2.2%, to 2131.52, snapping a nine-session losing streak, its longest skid since December 1980. The losing streak was caused in part by a tightening in the polls, as Wall Street had been pricing in a Clinton win before Trump's surge in the polls. The broad index has wiped out two-thirds of its losses it suffered in nine-session swoon.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 371.32 points, or 2.1%, to 18,259.60. The Nasdaq composite finished 119.80 points, or 2.4%, higher at 5166.17.
Investors around the globe responded bullishly to news that the FBI investigation related to Clinton's emails was over, as they interpreted the news as boosting Clinton's chance to win the tight election race with Republican challenger Donald Trump as well as clearing a legal hurdle for Clinton in the event that she does prevail tomorrow on Election Day.
Clinton is viewed as a more status quo candidate and, therefore, more palatable to Wall Street. Trump, who is more unpredictable, is viewed less market-friendly by investors as it is hard to get a good handle on what a Trump administration might look like and how his views on trade would impact asset prices around the world.
So-called safe haven assets, which had been rallying in recent days as Trump briefly narrowed the gap in the polls, were selling off as investors moved back into stocks and other assets that will benefit from a Clinton win. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of price, ticked up to 1.825%, from 1.807% Friday. Similarly, gold, often viewed as a haven in tough market environments, plunged $22.30 per ounce, or 1.7%, to 1,282.30 an ounce. The Japanese yen, which often enjoys inflows during turbulent times, also fell, with the yen declining 1.4% vs. the U.S. dollar.
But not all investors were giving up their Trump-focused positions just yet. The reason: the polls may be wrong and Trump may still engineer a surprise win. And cause market's to hemorrhage and provide a big rally for so-called Trump-friendly assets like gold and biotech and drug stocks.
“No one should conclude that this campaign is over or that Hillary is going to win," says Luke Hickmore, senior fixed income manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. "Financial markets are edging towards Clinton largely because of polling, and we saw in the U.K.'s Brexit referendum how wrong that can be. The memory of that referendum should loom large in investors' memories because so much of the polling was wrong then."
The rally was broad-based with all 30 Dow stocks rising and the financial sector making the biggest gains. Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS) closed up 3.2%, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rose 3.1% and American Express (AXP) gained 2.3%.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged 1.6% to finish at 17,177.21, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.7% to 22,801.40. The Shanghai composite index added 0.3% to close at 3,133.33.
Germany's DAX index and France's CAC 40 were up 1.9% and Britain's FTSE 100 was up 1.7%.
“This (the latest FBI news) will surely boost the chance of Clinton's victory. Barring another unexpected scandal on her side, it looks likely that she will win the race," said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo, according to Reuters.
“Given that the market had been slipping for nine days, there will be short-covering," Fujito added.

If American leaders remain blind to this new reality and continue to expect conformity to Western values, they will not only misunderstand emerging powers, but also alienate the many countries tired of being herded toward Western standards of governance.
This transition won't be easy. Since the founding era, the American elite and the public have believed in the universality of their model. The end of the cold war only deepened this conviction; after the collapse of the Soviet Union, democratic capitalism seemed the only game in town. But the supposed “end of history” didn't last. Many developing nations have recently acquired the economic and political wherewithal to consolidate brands of modernity that present durable alternatives.
The last 30 years of Chinese development, for example, look nothing like the path followed by Europe and North America. The West's ascent was led by its middle class, which overturned absolute monarchy, insisted on a separation of church and state and unleashed the entrepreneurial and technological potential vital to the Industrial Revolution. In contrast, the authoritarian Chinese state has won over its middle class, and with reason: its economy outperforms those of Western competitors, enriching its bourgeoisie and lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty.
And in today's fast and fluid global economy, the control afforded by state capitalism has its distinct advantages, which is precisely why Russia, Vietnam and others are following China's lead.
The Middle East is similarly set to confound American expectations. Participatory politics may be arriving in the region, but most of the Muslim world recognizes no distinction between the realms of the sacred and the secular; mosque and state are inseparable, ensuring that political Islam is returning as coercive regimes fall. A poll last year revealed that nearly two-thirds of Egyptians want civil law to adhere strictly to the Koran, one of the main reasons Islamists recently prevailed in the country's parliamentary elections.
And Egypt is the rule, not the exception. If nothing else, the Arab Spring has shown that democratization does not equal Westernization, and that it is past time for Washington to rethink its longstanding alignment with the region's secular parties.

True, rising powers like India and Brazil are stable, secular democracies that appear to be hewing closely to the Western model. But these countries have democratized while their populations consist mainly of the urban and rural poor, not the middle class. As a result, both nations have embraced a left-wing populism wary of free markets and of representative institutions that seem to deliver benefits only to a privileged elite.
Rising democracies are also following their own paths on foreign policy, foiling America's effort to turn India into a strategic partner. New Delhi is at odds with Washington on issues ranging from Afghanistan to climate change, and it is deepening commercial ties with Iran just as America is tightening sanctions. Standing up to America still holds cachet in India and Brazil, one reason New Delhi and Brasília line up with Washington less than 25 percent of the time at the United Nations.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Washington has long presumed that the world's democracies will as a matter of course ally themselves with the United States; common values supposedly mean common interests. But if India and Brazil are any indication, even rising powers that are stable democracies will chart their own courses, expediting the arrival of a world that no longer plays by Western rules.
The 21st century will not be the first time the world's major powers embraced quite different models of governance and commerce: during the 17th century, the Holy Roman Empire, Ottoman Empire, Mughal Empire, Qing Dynasty and Tokugawa Shogunate each ran its affairs according to its own distinct rules and culture.
But these powers were largely self-contained; they interacted little and thus had no need to agree on a set of common rules to guide their relations.
This century, in contrast, will be the first time in history in which multiple versions of order and modernity coexist in an interconnected world; no longer will the West anchor globalization. Multiple power centers, and the competing models they represent, will vie on a more level playing field. Effective global governance will require forging common ground amid an equalizing distribution of power and rising ideological diversity.
With that in mind, Washington should acknowledge that America's brand of capitalism and secular democracy must now compete in the marketplace of ideas.
To be sure, even as it adopts a more pluralistic approach, the United States should defend not just its interests, but also its values. It should continue to promote democracy, stand resolute in the defense of human rights and do what it can to stop indiscriminate violence of the sort unleashed by Syria's government.
But American leaders do their country no service when they trumpet a new American century or topple governments in the name of spreading Western values. Doing so will drive away the very nations the United States needs on its side to confront dangerous pariahs and manage a world in which power is broadly shared.
Standing by its own values while also recognizing that there are alternative forms of responsible and responsive governance would ultimately elevate the nation's moral authority, making it more likely that other countries would be as respectful of America's preferences as America should be of theirs.
I started playing a Megaman game for the first time. Before you start making sarcastic comments about how I should try Pong next, you have to note that the NES and SNES were never really popular in Europe, and unless it came out on Game Boy, I hadn't heard of many popular Nintendo games until I was already an adult. I hold up my hands an admin that the old Nintendo library is a gaping hole in my gaming knowledge.
The Megaman series is of course well known for its balls hard approach to level design. Each level is created with alarming meticulousness, where perfect timing see you finishing a level fully stocked on health with operatic ballet style precise jumps and shots. However, mostly you will be watching Megaman succumbing to dramatic leaps into never ending pits, or death at the hand of giant robotic snails. Of course, back in the 80s and 90s there was a desperate need for this kind of difficult gameplay.
NES cartridges couldn't hold a lot of data, and so developers had to find other ways of stretching out games to make them worth their $60 price tags. This often meant requiring absolute precision from players and that dreaded lives system. In Megaman you begin each level with 3 lives. There are 2 checkpoints, one halfway through each level and one just before each boss, but if you lose all three lives on the boss you have to go back to the beginning again. This is absolutely punishing for those who have mastered the level to have to go all the way back through the damn thing just to get a second crack at the boss.
This was the moment I started contemplating emulation. With the PC's save states, “lives” become exactly what they are in modern day gaming; redundant. Live systems have long been thought of as outdated so why can't we all use save states, we would have still completed the game right? To counter this people often talk about the nostalgic idea of completing the game as the developer originally intended, warts and all, but if I will gladly look at a walkthrough to figure out the best order in which to complete levels then why do I shy away from the modern day save state?
I didn't have the internet as a child, and the list of games which I left unfinished because I couldn't figure out where to go next is almost as big as my backlog. Nowadays, I take walkthroughs and forums for granted. These days the idea of not completing a game because I can't figure out which way to turn seems ludicrously wasteful, just like throwing my famicom out the window because I've had to face the same mid-stage boss 50 times.
And then there was the moment when I first completed a level in Megaman 4 and I jumped off the sofa in triumph throwing the little bone shaped controller in the air. I celebrated by taking a terrible photo of the TV screen to prove to my boyfriend that I had completed a single Megaman level, something which he had never accomplished himself. In that moment it didn't matter how blistered my thumbs had become. Screw your emulation, I wouldn't give up this feeling for all the save states in the world.
What do you think of save states and emulation? Are you not getting the real experience?

A software licence that was modified to become 'perpetual' did not necessarily last forever and could be terminated, the High Court has ruled.
The term 'perpetual' referred not to the fact that it was incapable of being brought to an end, but to the fact that it had an unlimited term so long as neither party chose to terminate it, the Court said.
Mr Justice Sales was presiding over a dispute between an animal feed maker and the publisher of a piece of software that it used to operate the milling of its feed.
BMS made MillMaster software and J Bibby, which later became AB Agri, was a customer. They agreed a contract for the use of the software in 1994, which gave AB Agri use of the software and tied it to a support agreement.
In 2000 they revised the software licence and support contract with a variation agreement. It contained this clause: "The Program Licence will be extended to be a UK-wide perpetual licence."
AB Agri gave the 12 months notice required in the contract to exit the agreement because it was developing its own milling software. It wanted to be able to use the MillMaster software for archive purposes without continuing to pay for the ongoing technical support of the product.
AB Agri argued that this variation agreement replaced the clause in the previous contract which forced it to take BMS's support services for as long as it used its software. It said that this was not possible with a 'perpetual' licence, ie one that could not be broken.
Therefore, it said, the new agreement supplanted that part of the old contract and it would have a continuing licence to use the software.
BMS disagreed and asked the High Court for a summary judgment on the meaning of the contract terms. Mr Justice Sales allowed a summary judgment, ruling that the factual background and context to the contract, which would need a full hearing, were irrelevant.
"That evidence is inadmissible or irrelevant to the question of contractual construction before the court," he said. He had to decide, he said, which meaning of 'perpetual' applied in this case.
"The word 'perpetual' can carry different shades of meaning. It can, for example, mean 'never ending' (in the sense of incapable of being brought to an end) or it can mean 'operating without limit of time'," he said.
He said that the latter interpretation in this context would mean that the software licence went on without time limit until either party exercised its rights set out in the previous contract to terminate the agreement.
"I consider that this latter interpretation of the word 'perpetual' in the context of … the Variation Agreement is the correct one. On that interpretation … there is no incompatibility between … [it and the] Licence Agreement," he said. "Therefore, when the Defendant terminated the Support Agreement it also terminated the licence for it to use the MillMaster software."
The judge said that the term 'perpetual' in the new agreement was meant to refer to the licence from the old agreement, not to create a new one. This meant, he said, that "the parties intended the licence referred to in ... the Variation Agreement to be subject to the same termination provisions as in the Licence Agreement.
"In light of these modifications to the licence terms, the best sense that can be given to ... the Variation Agreement is that the termination provisions governing the licence as set out in the Licence Agreement continue to operate," he said.
He also said that if the variation agreement was meant to create a new licence, then it would have to have had its own termination clauses, otherwise the new contract would not have made commercial sense.
"The termination provisions in both those agreements were very important terms of those agreements," said Mr Justice Sales. "They dealt with important commercial matters such as termination for breach of the agreement or in circumstances of insolvency of the other party."
"It is reasonable to think that any parties to licence and support agreements of this kind would wish such important commercial matters to be dealt with by such terms. Accordingly, if the parties in this case had indeed intended that those provisions should be deleted, it is natural to suppose that they would have referred to them in terms to make that intention clear rather than leaving it to be inferred from the use of a term ('perpetual') of uncertain meaning in the particular context in which it was used and a vague, unspecific provision like Clause 11 of the Variation Agreement," he said.

Alice McBrearty has been jailed for 16 months
A ‘gifted' young teacher sobbed in the dock as she was jailed for having a four-month relationship with a teenage boy.
Alice McBrearty, 23, used social media to contact the 15-year-old boy and the pair went out for meals together. She also bought him gifts, a court was told.
The teacher kissed him in a classroom, took him to a hotel for sex, and performed sex acts on him in her car and – as a ‘birthday treat' – in a garage. She also took the teenager to her parents' home in Manor Park, East London, where they had sex.
At Snaresbrook Crown Court, she was jailed for 16 months after pleading guilty to seven counts of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust.
Sentencing, Judge Sheelagh Canavan said: ‘You engaged in a full-blown sexual relationship with a 15-year-old child. I accept he was consenting – what 15-year-old schoolboy would turn down such an attractive offer?
‘I accept you truly believed this was a great romance, you were in love with him and vice versa, and that age didn't matter. But it did.
‘You were supposed to keep him safe, to help him make the right decisions. Instead, you helped him make all the wrong ones. You knew better and you did it anyway. He was precisely at the age when he was at the mercy of his hormones.
‘You breached the trust between student and teacher to satisfy your physical and emotional needs. This was the grossest breach of trust over a period of months.'
The judge described McBrearty as a ‘bright, intelligent and gifted young woman, who knew right from wrong', but said she had committed the ‘grossest breach of trust'.
McBrearty, 23, kissed and had sex with the boy at her parents' home, in her car, in the classroom and in an IBIS hotel
Judge Canavan called her conviction a ‘spectacular fall from grace'.
McBrearty, who appeared in court dressed in black with her hair tied in a ponytail, admitted to having a sexual relationship with the pupil between February and May this year. The court heard that the relationship began when McBrearty sent the boy, who cannot be identified, a friend request on social media.
McBrearty and the teenager 'kissed passionately' in the classroom
Prosecutor Lisa Matthews said: ‘He woke up one morning to see a friend request from Alice McBrearty on Facebook. He felt special and accepted it.
‘She messaged him asking for his number. They unfollowed each other but then she messaged him again and they started following each other on Instagram.'
Dates began, with the pair acting as a couple, going for strolls and out for meals. Miss Matthews said: ‘He appeared to be besotted with her.'
Several members of staff raised concerns that McBrearty was getting too close to the pupil, but the affair continued.
The court heard the pair had seven sexual encounters, starting when the petite blonde took the youngster to her family home during the February half-term break.
On other occasions, she booked a room at an Ibis hotel in London's Docklands for sex, and performed sex acts in a garage and in her car. She also kissed the pupil in a classroom at the school.
The relationship unravelled when the boy's father went to the police after obtaining his son's telephone records. The pupil was interviewed by police and social workers, and admitted the affair.
His father said the family had been ‘terrified' about the impact of the case, not only on his son but on the family's ‘honour', the court heard.
Emma Shafton, defending, said: ‘This is a young lady who has had a spectacular fall from grace – university educated, comes from a respectable family – she has been utterly disgraced by this.'
She told the judge her client ‘is not sexually attracted to children', but added: ‘She will of course be branded a paedophile for the rest of her life. She is a sex offender.'
The court heard the relationship began in January, when McBrearty followed the boy on social media and asked for his phone number.
As a 'birthday treat' McBrearty picked the boy up and took him to a nearby garage for oral sex
The teacher was jailed for 16 months at Snaresbrook Crown Court after having an affair with a pupil
The barrister said McBrearty had been ‘thrown in at the deep end' after joining the profession through the Teach First fast-track training scheme and soon ‘detested' her job.
She added: ‘She was low at the time. She was asked to teach subjects she had no experience in. That is why instead of socialising with her colleagues she socialised with students in the classroom.
McBrearty has resigned from the teaching profession. Miss Shafton added that while on bail, McBrearty ‘has not been able to get a decent job that matches her qualifications' and has instead been delivering parcels for Amazon on a zero-hours contract.
McBrearty pleaded guilty to the offences at an earlier hearing.

The Mexican Grand Prix staged perhaps the most dramatic finale in the history of the Formula One World Championship. Championship points could only be scored by the first six place finishers (9-6-4-3-2-1). Arriving to the race, three drivers had a chance of winning the title: Graham Hill (BRM) with 39 points, John Surtees (Ferrari) with 34 points and Jim Clark (Lotus-Climax) with 30 points. In order to win the title Clark had to win the race and hope that John Surtees would finish not higher than third and Graham Hill not higher than fourth. Surtees could only win the title by finishing first, in each case, or second, unless Hill finished as high as third. Surtees finished second, to win the World Championship by one point over Hill (40 to 39) behind Dan Gurney. The race began with Clark leading from pole position with Dan Gurney running second in the Brabham-Climax (Gurney had only ten points going into this race having won the French Grand Prix and scored a sixth place at the Belgian Grand Prix). Hill and Lorenzo Bandini, Surtees' teammate at Ferrari, were duelling for third place with Surtees running a distant fifth, seemingly with no chance at winning the title. Then Bandini ran into the back of Hill's car causing him to spin and lose a few places. Thereafter Hill's car ran with a crimped exhaust pipe causing him to lose power. The championship was now firmly in Clark's grasp. If the positions remained the same, he would be champion with four victories to Hill's two victories, although they would be tied on points at 39. But on the penultimate lap, Clark's engine seized and the positions were now Gurney-Bandini-Surtees. The title was back in Hill's grasp. Realizing that Surtees could win the title by finishing second, the Ferrari team manager frantically signalled Bandini to slow down as he passed the pits to enter the last lap so as to let Surtees through. Bandini dutifully did so and Surtees finished second, thus winning the World Championship by one point over Hill (40 to 39).
2012 may go down in history as the year of the tablets. Not only has tablet popularity skyrocketed—today more than 30% of internet users in the US occupy one for browsing—but more and more tech companies came out with their own version of tablets this year. Smartphones also saw great success in 2012, and almost 50% of cellphone users in the US have a smartphone and they are only getting more popular.

In the most crucial swing states of this general election, third-party candidates and their voters effectively thwarted the will of the majority of Americans. Their cumulative votes denied Hillary Clinton the victory and landed an inexperienced and precariously unprepared real estate guy in the Oval Office.
That's according to data compiled by David Wasserman with the Cook Political Report in its National Popular Vote Tracker. The numbers from that report show that in Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, had votes cast for third-party candidates been diverted to Clinton, she would have won the states, their electoral votes, and now be assembling her White House Cabinet.
Here's the breakdown of votes.

Caveats apply. This is a numbers-only analysis that doesn't take into consideration any other factor – and there are many. A recount is in the works for Wisconsin, likely to be followed in Michigan and Pennsylvania. And, there's the whole knit of Russian intervention, media collusion, redistricting, fake news, secret servers, crazy tweets, outright lies, shade, suspicion, cyberwar, hacked voting machines, lost ballots, padded votes, voter suppression ad nauseum that irrevocably damaged the electoral process.
However, all accusations and conspiracy theories aside, what needs attention from all pundits of every persuasion is the increasing preference among voters for a third-party candidate. This post-election analysis by NBC News cites a five to six percentage point draws by these voters in the swing states. Back in July, a Wall Street Journal article correctly hypothesized that votes for alternate parties could cost Clinton the election, particularly in Florida and other swing states. While the numbers of third-party votes have remained low, they are not negligible. The 8 November results prove that they are a disruptive force, as far as major party candidates are concerned.
Third-party voters cross the spectrum of political ideology – ranging from far right to far left. The idea of them merging under a single banner is improbable. It's more likely these diverse voices will continue to affect election outcomes.
In this year's presidential contest, those voices effectively silenced the preference of the majority of American voters. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over two million ballots. And yet, a tiny percentage thwarted the choice of 64,680,345 Americans.
Hey everyone, long time no seeOver the past months, the code of Soldat underwent a major refactoring so it became possible to compile Soldat client using the FPC compiler which is much more modern compiler than previously used Delphi7. Thanks to these changes the work on the code is now much easier.This has allowed us to port the game client to other operating systems - Linux and macOS! Soon you will not need to use WINE/Vms to play Soldat natively on those systems!The next big change is the implementation of SDL2 library that gives us cross-platform way to manage Window and Input events. We are now also using OpenAL for a sound library.These changes are purely technical but they are among the most important changes over the last few years because of better maintainability.New devlogs coming soon!
You don't want to damage the dendrites. Purestock/ Getty Images
Just one observation of a drunken person is enough to convince you that alcohol directly affects the brain. People who drink enough to get drunk often end up with slurred speech and impaired motor skills and judgment, among other side effects. Many of them suffer from headaches, nausea and other unpleasant side effects afterward -- in other words, a hangover. But are a few drinks on the weekend, or even the occasional long drinking session, enough to kill brain cells? What about binge drinking or the frequent, sustained drinking of alcoholics?
Not so much. Even in alcoholics, alcohol use doesn't actually result in the death of brain cells. It can, however, damage the ends of neurons, which are called dendrites. This results in problems conveying messages between the neurons. The cell itself isn't damaged, but the way that it communicates with others is altered. According to researchers such as Roberta J. Pentney, professor of anatomy and cell biology at the University at Buffalo, this damage is mostly reversible.
Alcoholics can develop a neurological disorder called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which can result in a loss of neurons in some parts of the brain. This syndrome also causes memory problems, confusion, paralysis of the eyes, lack of muscle coordination and amnesia. It can lead to death. However, the disorder isn't caused by the alcohol itself. It's the result of a deficiency of thiamine, an essential B vitamin. Not only are severe alcoholics often malnourished, extreme alcohol consumption can interfere with the body's absorption of thiamine.
So while alcohol doesn't actually kill brain cells, it can still damage your brain if you drink in mass quantities.

Description: Don't watch if you care about spoiling The Flash.
Sir, Zoom is still at large.
The team has been making efforts to track his movements.
He has been spotted here and here.
But he is so fast they have been unable to make any headway.
They simply do not have the manpower to stop him.
What about Jay? He can help us right?
Maybe with some Velocity-6...
Mein Fuhrer...
Jay...
I'm afraid it was revealed that Jay is Zoom.
And maybe the mask guy too...
Anyone who is Jay Garick, Hunter Zolomon, or Zoom, leave now.
How can they all be Jay!?
It doesn't make sense!
First it was time travel, then multiple earths!
I don't know who's who anymore!
First Jay was The Flash, then some stupid addict
Then he was dead for fuck's sake!
He can't be Zoom while holding his own dead body!
It must be some fucking mistake!
Mein Fuhrer you saw the episode yourself on Thursd-
I've been watching but it stopped making sense when the second dimension started
Mein Fuhrer, the multiverse is an essential part of DC lore!
You think I give a shit about DC lore?
Jay died!
What's the point of watching a TV show if nothing is permanent?
Why should I care if Jay dies if he's just going to come back 20 times over!?
As if my emotional investment meant nothing!
Now this Jay Garrick thing has become a popular punchline
CW is toying with it's audience for cheap ratings!
A good show must have some integrity
You people would eat up any plot twist if it was shocking enough
I speculated about Zoom's identity for months!
I checked r/FlashTV every day!
Waiting for some discovery that would solve the mystery.
First it was Earth 1 Jay's name...
Then the picture with the neck mole!
I wanted it to be Eddie Thawne
or even Harrison Wells
I would have prefered if it was that stupid girl Patty
Who had no reason to be on the show at all!
It's okay. Barry loved you.
Maybe it will make sense later.
We must wait until March 22nd.
But
now the community has devolved
into a collection of mindless Jay Garrick jokes
with no thought of serious discussion.
This is but a taste of the off-season...
More than twenty-five years ago, alleged rapists' names were scrawled in bathroom stalls at Brown University. These signs of outrage accompanied campus activists' demands to improve sexual-offense policies and training for male students. Change was slow, but five years ago the Obama Administration began to take an active role in combatting campus sexual violence. The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights announced that Title IX's ban on sex discrimination in education means that schools that receive federal funding (practically all colleges, universities, and school districts) must have effective policies and procedures for resolving sexual-violence complaints. In 2014, O.C.R. posted a list of higher-education institutions that were under federal investigation for possible violations of Title IX in their handling of sexual violence and sexual harassment. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, that list (which included Harvard Law School, where I teach) has grown in the past two years, from fifty-five schools to almost two hundred and thirty, public and private, large and small, from all regions of the country.
The government set out some requirements for schools, the most specific being that they must use “preponderance of the evidence,” instead of a higher standard of proof, to determine an accused student's responsibility for sexual misconduct. But, for the most part, schools developed new policies themselves; under the threat of losing federal funds, many did even more than what was required. Some schools chose not to give accused students the complaint against them, notice of the factual basis of charges, the evidence gathered, or the identities of witnesses. Some barred counsel from attending hearings or disallowed counsel from speaking at hearings. Some prohibited the accused from asking questions of the accuser or witnesses, even through intermediaries; often the accuser participated in hearings behind a partition so that she would not see or be seen by the accused. Even when found responsible for sexual misconduct, the accused was sometimes not allowed to have a copy of the investigative report. As the first rounds of students have been disciplined for sexual misconduct under the new procedures, scores of them have gone to court to protest their schools' decisions. The suits, against schools such as Yale, Cornell, and the University of California, San Diego, have alleged that, under intense pressure to be tough on sexual assault, the schools violated basic fairness to accused students. Most remarkably, many of the suits have claimed that the new procedures, which were developed to protect the Title IX rights of sexual-assault victims, in practice violate the Title IX rights of the accused.
In April, 2015, Columbia University's motion to dismiss one such lawsuit was granted by a federal district court in New York, which seemed to spell doom for these kinds of claims. But, last week, a unanimous Second Circuit appeals panel reversed that decision and held that the accused student could go forward with his claim that the university subjected him to sex discrimination in violation of Title IX. The case will go back to the lower court for trial proceedings, unless Columbia settles with the student, who is seeking damages and wants his disciplinary record scrubbed. Across the country, state and federal courts have recently decided for other accused students who claimed that their schools' procedures were unfair. Last August, in a case against Washington and Lee University, a federal court in Virginia found that the plaintiff had “plausibly established a causal link between his expulsion and gender bias,” and that his claim could go forward. (The school settled with the student.) In February, another Virginia federal court ruled that George Mason University, a state school, had violated constitutional due process by reversing a decision, which was originally in a student's favor, without explanation or notice of some of the factual allegations for which he was expelled.
The Columbia case is not much different from the others, but it is the first federal appellate decision of the crop. According to his court complaint, the accused, a freshman varsity athlete, was studying in a residence hall in May, 2013, when he was approached by a female student who was in his circle of friends. The two took a walk, returned to the residence hall, discussed hooking up, and then went to the bathroom of her dormitory's suite instead of to his suite, at her suggestion, because his roommate was her ex-boyfriend. He waited in the bathroom while she went to get a condom, and they had sex. Afterward, she expressed concern about what their friends would think about their encounter, according to the male student. (The female student's account of the incident is not public.) Four months later, she filed a complaint with the university; nine months after the incident, he was found responsible for non-consensual sexual intercourse, with the non-consent later attributed to his “unreasonable pressure” in the weeks before the sexual encounter. He was suspended for two and a half semesters, which the accusing student herself appealed as too severe.
While Columbia was investigating the female student's claim, it was also facing public criticism from students, who argued that the university had been overly sympathetic to male defendants in sexual-misconduct cases. In December, 2013, the New York Post wrote that, according to female students, a Columbia athlete who had raped several women was “still walking around like a big man on campus because the school dropped the ball on investigating him.” In 2014, the same year that Columbia adjudicated the complaint against the freshman athlete, twenty-three students filed complaints with O.C.R. alleging that Columbia mishandled sexual-misconduct cases. That May, it was widely reported that Columbia students were, as at Brown decades before, writing the names of alleged rapists on bathroom walls. Starting that September, the Columbia student Emma Sulkowicz's performance-art piece “Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight),” which protested the university's failure to find her alleged rapist responsible for sexual misconduct, galvanized Title IX activism on campus and around the country.
The freshman athlete's lawsuit claims that Columbia's decision to discipline him was motivated by anti-male bias, which came partly out of its desire to appear more responsive to female students' claims. He alleges that the Columbia investigator and decision panel did not seek to interview the witnesses he identified as favorable to him, did not follow the university's own procedures, and reached conclusions contrary to the weight of the evidence. The appeals court, in turn, found it “entirely plausible that the University's decision-makers and its investigator were motivated to favor the accusing female over the accused male, so as to protect themselves and the University from accusations that they had failed to protect female students from sexual assault.” Significantly, the appeals court rejected the idea that the university's actions, if motivated by fear of Title IX liability or negative publicity, would be lawful and distinguishable from unlawful sex discrimination against accused students. A university that is trying to avoid one form of sex discrimination may still be committing another.
In addition to the Title IX cases, other accused students have claimed that schools' denial of basic fairness in the discipline process breached their contractual relationship with students. Earlier this year, a federal district court in Boston denied Brandeis University's motion to dismiss such a contract claim by a student who had been disciplined for sexual misconduct. Many other courts in the past year have allowed similar claims to survive schools' motions to dismiss. And, this month, a federal district court in Rhode Island has been hearing a trial in a breach-of-contract case in which a student suspended for two years for sexual assault alleges that Brown University applied an affirmative-consent policy to an incident that occurred before the policy was enacted. Brown concluded that the male student obtained a female student's consent through “manipulation,” pointing to text exchanges before the sexual encounter that included her saying he was trying to manipulate her, and his response, “I'm trying to manipulate you a lot.”
The schools in these cases must feel themselves to be in an impossible position. On the one hand, they must take sexual assault seriously and remedy their previously neglectful handling of claims. Not doing enough means risking a federal Title IX investigation, with the threat of losing federal funding. (Because of the threat of defunding, schools could even be said to have a financial stake in the outcomes of the cases they decide—a possible conflict of interest.) But, when schools do too much, they face potential lawsuits from accused students for violating, among other things, Title IX. When it comes to sexual-assault cases, campus administrators could be forgiven for feeling on a knife's edge. (Suzanne Goldberg, Columbia's executive vice-president for university life, wrote in an e-mail, “Although litigation is an ongoing part of the landscape for any college or university, the focus of many higher-education institutions, including Columbia, remains on handling each incident carefully and fairly as well as on preventing incidents in the first place.” She declined to comment on any individual cases.)
Last month, the Republican Party platform, in a section devoted to Title IX, stated that “sexual assault is a terrible crime” that must be “prosecuted in a courtroom, not a faculty lounge.” The platform went on to object to the Obama Administration's approach, saying that its “distortion of Title IX to micromanage the way colleges and universities deal with allegations of abuse” must be stopped before it further “prevents the proper authorities from investigating and prosecuting sexual assault effectively with due process.” While tempting, the “due process, not campuses” position represents a false choice. There are major procedural-fairness problems in schools' handling of sexual-assault complaints, but due process is possible outside the court system. The Democratic Party platform, which included a pledge to fight sexual assault on campuses, made a point of promising “fair process for all in campus disciplinary proceedings,” which seemed to acknowledge that the treatment of all parties must be brought into balance.
Schools that receive federal funding must conduct their own investigations of sexual-assault allegations, regardless of whether police are investigating. Even if a future Presidential Administration has a different reading of Title IX, there is little chance that schools will get out of this business: it is impractical not to be able to discipline community members for violating schools' own codes of conduct, whether or not the violations are also crimes to be pursued by law enforcement. Amid growing awareness and support for campus sexual-assault victims, we have now also embarked on a course correction on procedures for hearing cases, with our courts providing a check on pressures to trample fairness for the accused. Will this eventually lead schools to an equilibrium of fair procedures? I hope so. The court cases against Columbia, Brandeis, Brown, and other schools are part of a long-term story in which we will likely reform the current procedural disasters on college campuses, which have received legitimate criticisms by both accusers and accused students.
With Mass Effect 3: Citadel releasing next week, we've been reading your questions and the Dev team has provided some answers for the more commonly asked ones.
With Mass Effect 3: Citadel releasing next week, we've been reading your questions and the Dev team has provided some answers for the more commonly asked ones.
PLEASE NOTE: This FAQ Includes Spoilers for the Mass Effect 3 Main Game Experience
When Can I Play the Citadel DLC?
You can play the Citadel DLC any time after stopping the Cerberus coup attempt on the Citadel and before beginning your attack on Cronos Station.
Will (CHARACTER NAME) be present in the DLC?
We would prefer not to spoil which characters will be present, or in what context, beyond what we've said: the DLC offers a chance to adventure with your ME3 squad, along with Urdnot Wrex, and to connect with old friends, including romances.
Will (CHARACTER NAME) be present only after a certain mission?
After completing the adventure portion of the Citadel DLC, you will have the chance to reconnect with old friends. Your friends will only appear once you have completed their content from the main game. For example, you will only be able to meet up with Jack after both completing Grissom Academy and talking to Jack in the bar at Purgatory.
Should I Have Everything Else in the Game Done Before Playing Citadel?
There is no right or wrong time to play the Citadel DLC, once it's unlocked. If you play the Citadel DLC with everything else unlocked (just before attacking Cronos Station), the new DLC content will all be unlocked. If you play the Citadel DLC right after stopping the Cerberus coup attempt, the DLC content will unlock naturally over the course of the main game.
Does the Citadel DLC Affect the Ending?
No, not beyond the possibility of adding new war assets to increase your Galactic Readiness score. You may of course continue on to play the endgame after completing the Citadel DLC, but there is also a natural “stopping point” that should make it clear where the DLC content ends and your return to the main game begins.
Why is the Xbox 360 version being split into separate downloads?
For Xbox 360 users, the Citadel DLC pack will come as 2 downloads on Xbox Live. ME3 Citadel is larger than our previous DLC packs, so it had to be split into 2 downloads. The first pack is priced at $14.99 and the second pack is tagged as free. Players need to purchase and download pack 1, then download pack 2 at no additional cost.
You can download pack 2 without purchasing pack one, but the DLC will not work. You will get an error message in game asking you to download pack 1. It will say “This DLC will only work in conjunction with Part 1 of Mass Effect™ 3: Citadel, which is split across 2 downloadable packages. Please purchase Part 1 prior to downloading Part 2 at no additional cost.” This will not hurt your saved game but you will not be able to launch Citadel until you have both packs.
This only affects Xbox 360 users. Citadel for the PC and PS3 is in one pack.

Christian man butchered like an animal for trying to prevent drug dealers corrupting Christian youth
Rasheed Bibi wife of slain Christian man Nazeer Masih and her son Patris Maish have been left haunted by the brutal and shocking attack.
A Pakistani Christian man was brutally slaughtered by Muslim men named Nadir and Haider in the district of Sheikhupura near Lahore.
Nazeer Masih (RIP), 55 years, lived in a small village called Wandala Dayal Shah and worked for a local estate agent. He was left with only one arm a few years ago after an accident at a factory where he was previously employed. His now bereaved wife Rasheeda Bibi told the BPCA that he lived a simple life and had no enemies, however, on the evening of April 6, 2016, Nazeer Masih was cutting grass in some fields with his Muslim friend Nawaz (40 years) when two known persons armed with a chopping knife and iron rod attacked him cutting straight through his face and slicing open his throat. Apparently an argument had erupted after Nazeer had told them to leave the young Christians in his community alone. The men also attacked his friend Nawaz who was a witness to the attack and, despite a wounded head, he escaped and ran towards other villagers and told them what happened. Nawaz was not the primary target of the men as he is a Muslim.
Some villagers put Nawaz in a rickshaw and got him to the local hospital while others ran to Nazeer Masih, but sadly by the time they reached him he had died.
Nazeer Masih's son, Patris Masih (35 years), was one of the men who ran to the location of his father. He told the BPCA that when he reached him he was utterly horrified by the brutality of the savage attack his father had endured. The attackers had sliced Nazeer Masih's face several times and the gory scene has left Patris haunted. He broke down and cried beside his father's dead body and is still very heartbroken and traumatised.
Local villagers called police naming two Muslim men as the murderers, Nadir and Haider from a nearby village. However police officials refused to register a First Incident Report (FIR) for the crime and no action was taken by them.
During the morning of April 7, 2016, a group of Christians disgusted by the lack of police activity over a clear murder case took the dead body of Nazeer Masih to the nearby G T Road and staged a protest rally. After a couple of hour's demonstration and protracted negotiation with senior police officials, the group agreed to bury the body on the assurance that an FIR would be lodged and the complaint investigated.
Pastor Alfred Azam said:
"This is not the first incident of persecution of Christians in our village, local Muslims are always creating problems for our Christian community. Before and after our church services Muslim drug dealers swarm around our church trying to sell drugs to our vulnerable youth. Some drug pushers move around in Christian residential areas and beat young Christians forcing them to take drugs in an attempt to get them addicted. When our older men tell these criminals to leave our young people alone they get killed."
In September 2014, Mohammad Waqas, a drug dealer shot dead a young Christian man Asif Masih in broad daylight. Asif Masih worked as labourer and also ran a small food stall. He leaves five children to survive without him, his only fault being that he stopped drug dealers from selling drugs in Christians' streets. Only after campaigning by Christians did police register FIR #964/14 against against the killer who was sent to prison under Pakistani Penal Code 302 and 324
Shamim Masih, BPCA lead officer, said:
"When I visited the local police station (PS Ferozwala), the Senior House Officer (SHO) was not present, however, more junior officials told me that there is a pending investigation of this alleged murder. As soon as police are able to find any clue for the murder an FIR will be registered against the culprits."
So far a complaint has been registered and police are searching for the killers Nadir and Haider who were named by eye witness Mohammad Nawaz. Some Christians are hopeful for success with this case as a Muslim key witness was also injured and as a result the police have been relatively cooperative following their initial traditional insouciance towards an attack on Christians. However, too date no arrests have been made and other Christians believe senior police officials have been bribed to remain dormant in addition to the normal Christian-centric-victim apprehension, especially considering there is an eye witness.
Wilson Chowdhry, Chairman of the BPCA, said:
"Often Pakistani Christian asylum applications to the UK are denied on the basis that Christians are offered a police service and have a judicial system set up too protect them. Yet in this case, once again we have evidence of a corrupt and poorly administered rule of law that is biased against the deprived Christian community. Britain has to review it's current home office policy towards Pak-Christians, their risk profile for such asylum seekers is based on the false premise that a developed law and order mechanism operates in Pakistan. This simply is not true."
He added:
The problem of drug addiction in Christian communities is a rising concern. The coercing of vulnerable Christians and other minority youth into drug addiction, often by force, has developed wealthy Muslim drug lords who continue to target such vulnerable communities. Their success and accumulated wealth has given them great power, often with authority over police forces who turn a blind eye to their crimes on the offer of rishwat (bribes). This influence to murder without impunity is devastating for Christians and must be met with the full force of the law for the sake of justice. It is high time the government of Pakistan set up a specialist task force to crack down on the drug cartels that have destroyed so many lives."
To help Christians in Pakistan we challenge people of good conscience to sign our petition calling for nations in the west and the UN review of their current risk profile for Pakistani Christians. The on-line petition also calls for for better protection of minorities in Pakistan and can be found by clicking (here).
We have set up a disaster recovery appeal to help and assist the family of Nazeer Masih. Our donations will help pay for a solicitor to challenge for justice for the family (£400), will pay for funeral costs for Nazeer Masih (£200) and will provide trauma counselling for the family (£200). If you would like to support our appeal financially please contribute by using this link

When you really look at it, the NHL is its own little weird universe. The playoffs have enough customs and traditions to make up a whole new cultural experience in North America. In what other sport do you make a vow to discontinue grooming your facial hair in the name of the team? Then there's the tradition of not touching the spooky Eastern/Western conference trophies because “it isn't the trophy we came here for”. These are all the quirks of a humble game, but no playoff hockey tradition is more challenging than the post-series handshake.
The handshake itself dates back to the 5th century BC and is believed to have been popularized as a gesture of peace, signifying that you had no weapons. It's no wonder then that the handshake ritual is one that hockey came by naturally, not by any league-wide implementation.
The role the handshake plays today in hockey is probably much the same as when the tradition started, a gesture to reinforce the idea that “it's just a game”. That's something we need to constantly remind ourselves when yelling at TVs and crying into your team's themed pillows. But try telling a guy who's missing his front row of teeth after diving face first in front of a slapshot that it's just a game. It won't go well.
After learning to hate a team with such passion over a two-week battle, the last thing you want to do at the end of it all is shake hands and wish them well, but it's part of the job. Somehow in all the years of this tradition there have only been a few infractions.
The Dishonor Roll
Notes:
These players are all under 10-years-old
Their actions are incited by massive applause from their parents
Notes:
It's too bad Avery wasn't there for the handshake between the Rangers and Devils this year
This snub was instigated
“Well, everyone talks about how classy or un-classy I am, and fatso (Brodeur) there just forgot to shake my hand I guess. . . We outplayed him. I outplayed him. We're going to the second round.” -Sean Avery
Dishonorable Mention
Chris Chelios famously skated right off the ice after losing the Western Conference final to Anaheim in 2007. “It's all part of the game,” said Chelios. “I guess it shows good sportsmanship. As hard as you battle against your opponent and sometimes as tough as it is to shake some of their hands, at the end of the day the majority of guys in this league are really good guys.” Chelios cited his reason for the snub was that he needed privacy after being overcome with emotion. But even after denying the tradition Chelios honored the handshake, saying “it's something that kids should learn, it's a very good tradition. I don't know when it started but I think it's one of the greatest traditions in all sports.”
The handshake is not for everyone, including former Red Wings center Dino Ciccarelli. Ciccarelli said of Claude Lemieux after the traditional shaking of the hands, “I can't believe I shook the guy's freaking hand. That just pisses me right off.”
Goalies Billy Smith and Gerry Cheevers were also known for refusing to honor the handshake tradition. In fact, after Sidney Crosby snubbed the Red Wings' handshake line after their Cup win in '09, Cheevers came to the defense of Crosby.
“What a crock. He was celebrating the Cup. Does Sidney Crosby look like someone who would be (disrespectful) of the game? There's no rule that says you have to shake. I know it's about sportsmanship, but not right after a tough series. I might buy the guy on the other team a beer a couple of days later.”
-Gerry Cheevers
The argument that's often made is that today's players dont have the class the players of yesteryear had. It's a Don Cherry-esque argument that these multi-millionaires nowadays don't have the noble purity that young men once had. The truth is these unsportsmanlike handshake fouls are as rife in the past as they are today. The 1954 Montreal Canadiens skipped the handshake all together.
How To Shake Hands
Use a firm grip. Don't shake too much.
How to Shake Hands in the 2012 Playoffs
The Philadelphia Flyers/Pittsburgh Penguins series of the first round was a bloodbath and beyond. These guys hated each other. Just ask Penguins' captain Sidney Crosby, whose now famous quote “I don't like them. I don't like any guy on their team” will appear engraved below a statue of Crosby somewhere in Pittsburgh. Just to drive the point home that this was not a loving series, there were 168 penalty minutes in Game 3 alone and even the coaches almost threw down. Nonetheless, when the Flyers won it in Game 6 the formalities were cordial.
How Not To Shake Hands in the 2012 Playoffs
The Phoenix Coyotes were eliminated at home in overtime. That's rough. The goal was scored directly after a hit on Yotes defenseman Michal Roszival, a hit that could have put them on the powerplay to win the game, but wasn't called. It's a tough pill to swallow, but this is how they did it.
“If Raffi Torres gets 25 games for his hit during the play, this guy should be done forever. They called us for three offsides in the first period and none of them were offside. [A Kings player] flipped it over the glass — how do all four refs not see that? It's not just this game, it's all season long. They did everything they could not to let us get to this position.”
– Coyotes' goaltender Mike Smith
“I don't know how you miss it. I really don't know. But I'm sure they'll have a great explanation for it. I know they try to do their best, and they're going to make mistakes. It's just tough when you're on the short end of it so many times. You watch the last three games, and you tell me where I got my penalties.”
-Coyotes' captain Shane Doan
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoxnrVbU1E8
The NHL is now leading an investigation into the Phoenix Coyotes' post-game actions and comments that may call for fines and suspensions. The Coyotes aren't the first and surely won't be the last to take their sour grapes and gripes into the time-honored tradition of the handshake.
My Uber ride starts the same way as they always do. I pull out my phone and fire up the app. I confirm my location, punch in my destination, and request a ride.
Then the robot shows up.
It's a white Ford Fusion, wearing an elaborate headdress of spinning lasers and enough cameras to document the Super Bowl. And it's the centerpiece of Uber's latest attempt to disrupt transportation. Starting this morning, pre-selected Uber users in a 12-square-mile chunk of downtown Pittsburgh will have the option to ride in a self-driving car—with a human engineer at the wheel who can take over if things get dicey.
Uber has a straightforward goal: become even more efficient and profitable by jettisoning the human drivers who take home the majority of their customers' money. Or, as one Uber engineer puts it to me: getting rid of the overhead. (Putting a dent in the annual global rate of 1.2 million road deaths every year would be nice, too.)
"That pilot really pushes the ball forward for us," says Raffi Krikorian, who runs Uber's Advanced Technologies Center, in Pittsburgh.
Sliding into the tan leather seats of the second row, I see the car's not so different from any other. A big red button has replaced the driver's cup holder (it's the autonomous mode kill switch). And there's a guy sitting shotgun, reading indecipherable (to me, at least) streams of data off a laptop. Otherwise, the only significant difference from a standard car is the iPad-sized tablet mounted between the front seats, facing me.
"Welcome, Alex," it reads. "Let's ride."
Starting this morning, pre-selected Uber users in a 12-square-mile chunk of downtown Pittsburgh will have the option to ride in a self-driving car—with a human engineer at the wheel who can take over if things get dicey. Uber's using autonomous Ford Fusions, it will intro Volvo XC90s to the fleet early next year. An array of cameras watches the for slowing vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and other obstacles. "Wing-mounted" LIDAR unites look for nearby obstacles and watch the car's blind spots. In the backseat, a specially designed tablet keeps customers informed about their ride. Minus the special autonomy controls, the car's interior isn't so different from any other. The cars are now roaming downtown Pittsburgh, and their territory should soon expand. Uber won't say when, exactly, it expects to remove the bags of meat from the driver's seat. But it's clear the ridesharing giant is racing into an autonomous future.
Unlike most of the companies chasing fully autonomous cars, Uber wants to bring its customers into the experience. Beyond the obvious publicity benefits of launching first, even with human backups, Uber engineers say they want to know how non-engineers feel about their product.
That backseat tablet is there to suit the regular folk. The tablet interface includes an FAQ section addressing concerns like vehicle speed (25-30 mph, and yes, it'll break the speed limit) and what all the sensors on the roof are for. "We're working towards developing a transparent experience that provides riders with enough information about the trip and the vehicle system to feel safe and confident," says Emily Bartel, an Uber product manager.
The screen tells you when the car's driving itself, your speed, and your route. The lower two-thirds of the screen depict the car and its surroundings as understood by the spinning LIDAR unit on the roof. The idea is to give riders an idea of what the car sees, so they don't wonder if the robot has noticed that truck up ahead.
My ride starts with a tour of Pittsburgh's warehouse-filled Polish Hill, before we use one of the city's many bridges to cross the Allegheny River. As the car navigates four-way stops and traffic light-controlled intersections, the ride is mostly smooth, with scattered moments of aggressive acceleration or braking. The engineer at the wheel takes over control every few minutes. Once, he's not happy with how long the car is waiting before slowing for a pedestrian. Another time, he manually steers around a double parked truck, knowing the system will just stop and wait for it to move.
All along the route, passers-by gawk and take photos—Uber has been working in Pittsburgh for 18 months, but autonomous cars still aren't as common here as they are in Silicon Valley. The San Francisco-born company chose Pittsburgh for a few reasons. The City of Bridges is home to Carnegie Mellon University, with which Uber partnered on autonomous tech, and from which Uber poached dozens of researchers. And the city offers challenging test conditions, from rain and snow to a tangled grid of narrow streets. Maybe best of all, it's enthusiastically pro-tech.
"Startups will choose places based upon the ability to be innovative and there's never a time where regulation comes before innovation," says Mayor Bill Peduto. "If you stop the clock all you're doing is assuring that that tech and those jobs will be in another city."
While states like California, Michigan, and Nevada encourage and regulate autonomous tech, Pennsylvania's been all cheerleader. The state has no real rules about who can operate these things, or where. Which is extra cool, because it means that after half an hour in the back seat, an Uber rep asks if I'm interested in taking the wheel—or, you know, sitting in front of it.
Still, after hitting the nickel-sized silver button that makes the car drive itself, I can't demand a trip back to San Francisco. Like just about everyone working on full autonomy, Uber runs its car only in areas mapped in extreme detail. Those maps provide key context for the cars and let them focus on temporary obstacles like other cars and people.
Building those maps requires sending a human-driven, sensor-laden car down a stretch of road seven or eight times; using software to extract the important stuff like traffic light locations, crosswalks, and speed limits; having a human vet all that; and getting it onto the car. Uber will soon expand the cars' territory to include the main road connecting downtown to the airport, and Pittsburgh's bar- and student-filled South Side. But figuring out how to streamline that mapping process is key to the company's dreams of replacing a planet's worth of Uber drivers with software.
Uber won't say when, exactly, it expects to remove the bags of meat from the driver's seat. Its competitors are promising fully autonomous, market-ready cars in the next three to five years, and the ridesharing behemoth is likely on a similar timeline. But Uber has already managed to translate its experience to the autonomous age, complete with a "driver" rating. And no small talk required.
AMHERST -- Following a meeting in Boston last month, union leaders and University of Massachusetts officials are meeting Monday to continue to talk about ways to strengthen the Labor Center.
Mass. AFL-CIO President Steven Tolman, Chancellor Kumble Subbaswamy and Frank Callahan, president of the Mass. Building Trades Council, are hosting the meeting, according to an email from Workers' Rights, "to consider ways that the UMass administration, labor, and key stakeholders can partner to strengthen the Labor Center so that it continues to play a leading role in advancing the cause of organized labor and Massachusetts workers for many years to come."
Former Labor Center Director Eve Weinbaum sent an email to alumni and center supporters this summer raising concerns about budget cuts and the university commitment to the program.
A petition calling on the administration to "Save the Labor Center" has 4,741 signatures.
"We are united in reaffirming our commitment to support the vital work of the UMass Amherst Labor Center," the university state in a statement issued after the Boston meeting. "For more than half a century, the center has been at the vanguard of preparing labor leaders in Massachusetts and throughout the country.
"We are resolved to work together to revitalize the Labor Center so that it maintains its status as one of the nation's best in its field.
"A number of recent reports concerning the status of the Labor Center, both in print and online, have called into question the university's commitment to Labor Studies and to the labor movement more generally. We want to jointly emphasize that the UMass administration continues to be deeply committed to the center's important work. We are all committed to restoring the program's vitality," the university stated.
In a statement about Monday's meeting, UMass spokesman Edward Blaguszewski wrote, "The university will reaffirm its commitment to the Labor Center and will work with stakeholders to chart a path forward that will ensure the long term viability of the center so that it will continue to play a leading role in educating the labor leaders of tomorrow."
Weinbaum, in an email, wrote, "Our alumni and labor movement leaders across the state and nationally have weighed in with strong support for the Labor Center and I think it has made a big difference and raised a lot of awareness about the issues."
She said she will attend the meeting. "I believe that the chancellor is committed to the Labor Studies program, and I am hopeful that the stakeholders will work toward a plan to strengthen our programs going forward," she wrote.
Prior to the meeting, Western Mass. Jobs with Justice and the UMass Graduate Employee Organization plans a rally at 1 p.m. on the Student Union steps.
The countries with the best quality of life in the world have a good work-life balance, access to quality healthcare, education, and infrastructure, as well as cost of living and career opportunities. Great weather also helps.
In a new survey by InterNations, the world's largest network for people who live and work abroad, the company asked 14,300 expats, representing 174 nationalities and living in 191 countries or territories, to rate 43 different aspects of life abroad on a scale of 1-7.
From this, InterNations calculated the scores to get an overall average.
The Quality of Life index took into account factors such as:
Leisure Options
Personal Happiness
Travel & Transport
Health & Well-Being
Safety & Security
We took a look at the top 21 countries:
21. Denmark
The country has the shortest working week out of all those surveyed at 39 hours. However, it fell down the list for quality of life during to scoring low on childcare options and availability.
Den Gamle
20. Hungary
The country has rapidly climbed the ranking thanks to its relatively low cost of living, but abundant career opportunities.

19. Finland
"Seventy-four percent of expat parents in Finland are in complete agreement that the education options are easy to afford," said InterNations.
It also scored highly in the Health & Well-Being sub-category.

18. Ecuador
The country made the list mainly because of the expats who class themselves as travellers.
The language barrier can be an issue for those who want to stay longer than a few months or a year.

17. Luxembourg
The country dropped down the list due to the continual higher cost of living, leaving less cash in people's pockets each month.
However, it still makes the rankings due to employment opportunities, beautiful surroundings, and high-quality healthcare and education.

16. Australia
The country is considered one of the best places in the world to raise a family, while also coming second in the sub-rankings for both the availability of education and education options in general.

15. France
The country has on average only 41 hour working weeks and ranks highly for the quality and affordability of a good education.
TripAdvisor
14. Portugal
This country is considered one of the "dream destinations" for expats, and 91 percent of respondents who live there say they are generally satisfied with their lives.
13. New Zealand
"Most people tend to mentally lump Australia and New Zealand together - but there are some surprising differences concerning expat life in these destinations," said InterNations.
For example, New Zealand scores more points when it comes to healthcare, due to greater affordability.

12. Canada
The environment, feeling welcome, and short working weeks boosted the country in the ranking this year.

10. Switzerland
While healthcare, education, and the ability to find a job helps Switzerland hit the top 10, the rising cost of living keeps the country from the top spot.
9. Germany
The country is popular with expats due to it being one of the top rated places to find a job, while also hitting near the top of the sub-ranking for general living standards.

8. Singapore
The city-state dropped from first to eighth place this year due to rising cost of living and mainly the affordability of healthcare.
7. Czech Republic
The country was a hit with expats with children as the availability and costs of childcare and education there are rated well.
Seventy-four percent said that education is easy to afford.

5. Costa Rica
Warm weather and improvements in the language category helped boost the country. Seventy-nine percent also said they feel "at home" in the local culture.

4. Spain
The country, famed for its good weather, rises in the rankings because expats voted it highly for in the Ease of Settling In Index.
They say that friendliness and, more specifically, the attitude of locals towards foreigners makes it a great place to live.

3. Japan
The country rose from seventh to third place this year, mainly due to gaining poll position in transport infrastructure.
Expats also highly rated the island nation's peacefulness and quality of medical care.

2. Austria
The country rocketed to the top of the charts, thanks to its clean water and clear air, which made it secure first in the Health & Well-Being sub-index.
Seventy-two percent of respondents also rated the transport infrastructure as very good.
1. Taiwan
The country rose right to the top of the ranking for its quality of medical care and its affordability.
It also polled first place for quality of life among female respondents and second for men.

The department says dam levels have decreased which means people are starting to relax and are not using water wisely as the department has been advising.
JOHANNESBURG – The Water and Sanitation Department says residents are not heeding the call to save water, and that the aim to save water of at least 15 percent a week in each municipality, is not being reached.
The department says some areas are sitting at between 10 and 12 percent of water saved this week.
It says dam levels have decreased which means people are starting to relax and are not using water wisely as the department has been advising.
The department's Mlimandlela Ndamase says tropical storm Dineo and flash floods are not necessarily assisting with dam levels.
“The water restrictions remain the same but water usage has increased so we are no longer reaching the goal of 15 percent and are sitting at 12 percent and 10 percent in some areas.”
When Did Killing Trees Become So Efficient?
Technology has allowed us to become more efficient at Killing Trees!
More than once I have mentioned my love for technology and innovation, for I believe many of the products we own today aid us in becoming more efficient (with a few bugs and frustration). There are even ones that aim to provide productivity but without hurting the environment on its path.
The video below is a great presentation that makes it difficult to be technologically pro and green at the same time. It shows an extremely efficient machine cutting down trees at a fast rate and with great skill.
When I first saw it, I was amazed how one man could sit behind a machine and get so much work done so efficiently. After a moment I realized the peril that it involved as well. It may be faster, stronger, and more efficient than several workers, but it is killing trees at a great speed. This means that this machine in fact increases efficiency at hurting our environment.
Is that a little disturbing?
Palestinian journalist Wisam Hashlamoun has spoken to Yeni Şafak about the powerful photo he took of a blindfolded Palestinian boy, who was arrested by 22 Israeli soldiers, which became a symbol of the Palestinian people's third intifada that erupted following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Symbol of resistance
Journalists are working under tough conditions amid the escalating clashes in order to try to tell the world the latest developments in the occupied Palestinian territories. Among the stream of photos and news stories that demonstrate the Palestinian people's resistance, the photo taken by Palestinian journalist Wisam Hashlamoun became the most iconic symbol of the third intifada.
Intifada meaning to “shake off,” refers to the Palestinian attempt to shake off Israeli occupation and gain independence.
The photo, which shows a blindfolded Palestinian 14-year-old boy, who was arrested by the Israeli army in the West Bank's Hebron by 22 soldiers, demonstrated to the world how much Israel fears the Palestinian people.
00:26 dk 11 Aralık 2017 Yeni Şafak Footage emerges of 22 Israeli soldiers arresting 14-year-old Palestinian boy It took 22 Israeli soldiers to arrest Fawzi Al - Junaidi, a 14-year -old Palestinian teenager. Footage shows the cowardly Israeli soldiers detaining the Palestinian boy with his eyes blindfolded following clashes after against Trump's decision to declare Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
‘They don't care if you're a journalist'
Speaking exclusively to Yeni Şafak, Hashlamoun recounted the story behind the iconic photo taken in the city of al-Khalil by saying that he had no idea it was such a powerful frame.
“Close to 50 Israeli soldiers were viciously attacking Palestinian youths during the clashes. It doesn't matter to them if you're a journalist. They attack everyone viciously. During the clashes I came closer to the soldiers. That boy fell to the ground and wounded his head. They pulled him to his feet and encircled him. At that moment I was trying to escape their attacks,” Hashlamoun said.
‘I wanted to expose Israeli violence'
After being on the ground to cover the events in the West Bank since their eruption, Hashlamoun is glad he took such a powerful photo, saying, “It definitely didn't occur to me that this photo would become a symbol. All I was thinking about was exposing Israel's violence against Palestinians that doesn't discriminate between child, woman or the elderly. With God's help, this photo garnered a great deal of attention.”
The boy in the photo, identified as 14-year-old Muhammad Fawzi al-Juneidi, is still under arrest.

He went out to get medicine!
Speaking to the press, al-Juneidi's uncle said his family had no information about his well-being or whereabouts, noting that that the family was immensely pained.
“An unarmed 14-year-old boy was arrested like a criminal. We learned he was injured from those who saw him being detained. They're not letting us see him. His parents are very ill. His father has undergone five surgeries. He was the sole breadwinner for his family. He went out to get medicine and food for his family,” Al-Juneidi's uncle said, vowing to continue the fight against the occupation.
“We're the children of Palestine. We will never accept this decision. We instilled the fact that Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine in the minds and hearts of our children. They will never be able to erase it,” he concluded.

For a team that really needs center backs, the New York Red Bulls seem awfully casual about letting the ones they have go walkabout.
Qatar✈️ — Matt Miazga (@MattMiazga3) January 26, 2015
Matt Miazga, one of just two specialist central defenders on the team's official roster as of January 25 (the day before preseason kicks off, in case you were wondering why the sense of urgency about the continuing CB deficit), looks to be on the move.
Just a tweet. No biggie. Maybe he's playing a game involving emoticons and geography.
Except...there's that report from a Leipzig website suggesting Miazga is in Doha right now. We called that a rumor, and it seemed a bit of stretch - the man was playing soccer in Jamaica last night, and it takes a while to get from the Caribbean to Qatar, even if Papa Red Bull is breaking out the private jet.
But now we have a report, allegedly due to be published in German magazine Kicker tomorrow (January 26), and excerpted on Transfermarkt.com:
Bis dahin soll auch der Leipziger Kader komplett und die letzte noch vakante Stelle besetzt sein. Sportdirektor Ralf Rangnick hat sich auf seiner bemerkenswert langen Suche nach einem neuen Innenverteidiger für eine konzerninterne Lösung entschieden. US-Talent Matthew "Matt" Miazga (19) vom MLS-Club New York Red Bulls machte sich am Sonntag auf den Weg nach Katar, soll an diesem Montag in Doha eintreffen. Parallel dazu hatte sich Rangnick in Katar mit den New Yorker Entscheidungsträgern, Sportdirektor Ali Curtis und Chefcoach Jesse Marsch, auf den Transfer des Abwehrspielers verständigt. Der wird allerdings nur auch tatsächlich realisiert, wenn Miazga die Vorschusslorbeeren in den nächsten Trainingstagen bestätigt. "Er kommt nur, wenn er uns auf Anhieb weiterhelfen kann", sagt Rangnick.
Yes, that's in German. [Because you, dear reader, may have a better grasp of the language of Goethe than us, and we would not deny you the chance to offer a better translation. Indeed, we kinda hope you will.]
Here's a translation from "Sifrit" on Big Soccer's boards:
Miazga is supposed to arrive in Doha on Monday. RB Leipzig's sporting director Rangnick and Red Bull New York's sporting director Curtis as well as head coach Marsch have agreed on a transfer. However, the transfer will only be realised if Miazga shows well in the next few days. They quote Rangnick: "He will only join us if he can immediately help the team."
To recap: Matt Miazga is reportedly on his way to Qatar (source: himself) for a trial with RB Leipzig which will result in his transfer to the German club if he proves himself capable of making an immediate contribution to the team (source: Kicker).
And RBNY will start its preseason on January 26, blizzard allowing (the team is supposed to travel to Florida; characteristic of its recent luck and judgment, its travel plans coincide with what may be one of the most severe snowstorms in the history of the tri-state area) , with just one specialist center back under contract and in camp.
EDIT: Good news!
Kristian Dyer is reporting Miazga's trip to the Middle East is ONLY A TRAINING STINT. No trial, certainly no transfer. He'll back with the team, guaranteed (says Dyer's source; Dyer is the most reliable reporter the RBNY beat has in its ranks, but that is not the same as speaking for the team).
This is encouraging. Though one would note that any training stint is almost always effectively a trial, whether it's called that or not, and whether the evaluation is for immediate or future transfer consideration.
Miazga has just finished an international tournament, in which he played five games between January 9 and 24. He is certainly match fit. One wonders why exactly he needs to be shuttled out to Qatar in something close to peak condition to participate in the tail-end of RB Leipzig's mid-season break (the team is expected to return to Germany on January 29).
Oh, and if Miazga is just flying out, he will arrive in Qatar on January 26, which is about eight hours ahead of EST, so - unless he's already there - he's either getting off the plane and stumbling to a training session, or he won't start working with the team until January 27.
Long way to go for a a couple of days of training with a team you're not going to play for while your club starts preseason under a new head coach.
It's a relief to be told Miazga will be back (though the source at RBNY may want to send RB Leipzig sporting director Ralf Rangnick an apology for implying he's a liar), but perhaps Jesse Marsch or Ali Curtis would care to explain what value young Matt and his team will derive from this 48-hour training session in Qatar that is absolutely-not-at -all related to any future transfer?
Multimillionaire poker star's machismo-fueled exploits of cash, cars, girls and guns... but high-stakes have given him THREE heart conditions
Los Angeles-based poker player Dan Bilzerian, 32, describes himself as an 'actor/astronaut/a**hole' to his 100,000 Instagram followers
His fans regularly beg to switch his lavish life for theirs
He recently posted photos of a seal and a topless blonde in a pool, two luxury sports cars with the plates 'SUCK IT' and 'MR GOAT' and a table full of semi-automatic weapons
However, his wild lifestyle have had serious repercussions, including a double heart attack aged 25 and a pulmonary embolism two years ago
Bilzerian has won multiple poker tournaments, his most successful being the 2009 World Series of Poker
He is also co-founder of online poker room, Victory Poker bringing his net worth to around $100 million
A multimillionaire poker star has been dubbed Instagram's playboy king after chronicling blow-by-blow his extravagant, machismo-fueled life of near-naked women, sportscars and guns.
Los Angeles-based Dan Bilzerian describes himself as an 'actor/astronaut/a**hole' to his more than 100,000 Instagram followers who appear to live vicariously through the beefy, bearded 32-year-old, regularly begging in comments to trade his lavish life for theirs.
Bilzerian is reportedly worth $100 million, making the bulk of his cash as a high-stakes gambler having developed his skills as a student at the University of South Florida. However, his risky lifestyle has resulted in some serious repercussions, including a double heart attack and a pulmonary embolism, according to the Daily Dot .

Rich: The 32-year-old multimillionaire poker star said in the caption to this picture: 'When I was a kid I never wanted to be classy, I just wanted to be rich
Seal: Bilzerian wrote that his buddy brought this seal to his house to surprise him... and he had a bare-chested woman pose with it
Cash: The playboy regularly posts pictures, like this, of piles of money
Cars: His expensive vehicles, pictured, are adorned with personalized plates that read 'SUCK IT' and 'MR GOAT' - his other moniker
Bilzerian's Instagram feed includes a recent picture of a seal and a topless blonde woman in a swimming pool, with the caption: 'My buddy actually had a seal brought to the house and put in the pool haha.'
Another photo shows two luxury cars in the garage of his LA mansion with the comment: 'While I'm more of a t*t guy, I do appreciate a nice a**...' The vehicles are adorned with personalized plates that read 'SUCK IT' and 'MR GOAT' - his other favored moniker.
Another picture of more than a dozen semi-automatic weapons on a table has the caption: 'My greatest fear is that someone will break in & I won't be able to decide what #gun to shoot them with.'
The Tamba Bay native who does some acting on the side said his life has always been high-risk.
His father, Paul Bilzerian, a former corporate takeover artist, was sentenced to four years in jail and given a $1.5 million fine in 1989.
Topless: The poker player's thousands of followers seem to live vicariously through his exploits
Military life: Bilzerian, right, was training to be a Navy SEAL before he was kicked out for swearing at an officer
Not cool: He describes not being 'super-cool' in high school but seems to have made up for it now
Guns: This picture of more than a dozen semi-automatic weapons on a table, has the caption: 'My greatest fear is that someone will break in & I won't be able to decide what #gun to shoot them with'
Unicorn: In this picture, his friend 'the Unicorn' is seen in a spa with naked or near-naked women and a pair of $15,000 Louis Vuitton boots
'I didn't get to enjoy much of it,' Bilzerian said of his childhood.
He said he wasn't 'super-cool' in high school and went to both a military boarding school and to Utah to live with Mormons for a year.
In senior year, he ended up in jail for having a machine gun in the trunk of his car. But he managed to get his GED.
The gun-rights advocate then joined the military and made it 99 per cent through Navy SEAL training, he said. But two days before graduation he was thrown out for calling an officer a 'p****.'
'When he did my peer eval, (the officer) said I was only out for myself,' he said.
Bilzerian said he loved his time at the University of South Florida, which is where he started playing poker.
'I went broke after sophomore year, gambled away all my money, sold some guns, turned $750 into $10,000, flew to Vegas, turned 10 thou into $187,000, went back to school, played better,' he explained to The Daily Dot.
High-stakes: Bilzerian, pictured, made his millions as a high-stakes gambler, and he says betting on everything in life as his essential condition
Parties: The poker player posted a picture of a party at his mansion stating that it is 'starting to get interesting'
Crash: He crashed this Ferrari he said while he was on a date
Girls: Belzerian is almost always surrounded by girls in his posts
He said the turning point was losing everything.
'I respected the money. You have to go broke to respect the money.'
He has since won multiple tournaments, his most successful being the 2009 World Series of Poker. He is also co-founder of online poker room, Victory Poker.
Bilzerian described betting on everything in life as his essential condition but he hasn't always won. His health, in particular has suffered as a result of his high-flying lifestyle.
When he was 25, Bilzerian went on a 'four-day, very active snowboarding trip - traveling, not sleeping, hanging with friends, doing all kinds of ...' his PR representative Steve Honig told the website, trailing off. It ended in a double heart attack.
'If you're familiar with his lifestyle, he's a bit of a daredevil. His body was absolutely overloaded after four days, and the heart condition happened.'
In August 2011, Bilzerian flew between Maui and Las Vegas twice in a three-day period to play around-the-clock poker and his heart gave out again. It turned out to be a pulmonary embolism not a heart attack, however.
Autograph: The playboy is seen signing the rear end of a woman
July Fourth: This post from July 4th was littered with comments like 'That's a good lifestyle bro'
Private planes: The multimillionaire is regularly seen outside his private jet
Gun enthusiast: He wrote: 'Bought these sexy twins for the duck hunt in December #onesnotenough'
Now, Honig said Bilzerian is in perfect health while seemingly continuing to make the mega-bucks and enjoy spending them. Though he said the tournaments are harder to win these days, because amateur players put in a lot more hours and are performed better than they used to.
But Bilzerian said he wants to tidy up his badboy image, and is attempting to rebrand himself as 'the gentleman of poker.'
His efforts have involved giving away $100,000 of the money he's won in what he's calling the Robin Hood Project. So far he's helped Typhoon Haiyan victims, a couple who adopted four sick, underprivileged kids and a third woman who lost all her limbs.
But the Instagram pictures and the over-the-top lifestyle they represent continue, pleasing the fans who genuinely think of the money man as a king.
Since the last time Glenn Beck attacked net neutrality as Marxist plot to take over the Internet, he's had ample time to research and discover that the issue is in fact about keeping the internet as an open platform for individuals and businesses (an initiative supported by major corporations like Google, Amazon.com and Facebook). Beck would even have learned that conservative groups like the Christian Coaltion as well as Gun Owners of America and the Parents Television Council support net neutrality.
True to the pattern we've seen from Beck over the years, he has not learned.
On his Monday Fox News show Beck explained to his audience that net neutrality was all about silencing Glenn Beck and others opposed to the Obama administration. To call this missing the point would be generous and a disservice to anyone who has ever legitmately missed a point.
Glenn Beck says that net neutrality is about squelching freedom of speech, the exact opposite of what net neutrality is about. From The Free Press' statement on net neutrality (Free Press is a major organizer of the Save The Internet campaign for net neutrality):
We need to keep the Internet free, open and neutral. Network Neutrality is vital to ensuring that everyone can connect and share content freely, that we can access the information, visit the Web sites and say what we want online, free from discrimination or interference. The phone and cable companies that control access to the Internet for most Americans want to get rid of Net Neutrality, the rule that prevents them from discriminating against online content. They want to become the Internet's gatekeepers, deciding which sites go fast or slow and which won't load at all -- based on who pays them the most. We can't allow the information superhighway to become the phone and cable companies' private toll road. If they get their way, the Internet as we know it -- as a democratic platform for free speech and innovation -- will disappear.
Somehow, Beck turned Free Press' net neutrality advocacy into a Marxist plot "to limit America's free press and freedom of speech."
After decrying a campaign by Free Press to have individuals comment to the FCC supporting net neutrality rules as a power grab by "special interests," Beck directed his audience to go to nointernettakeover.com to oppose net neutrality. Somehow, he neglected to point out that nointernettakeover.com is run by the right-wing organization Americans for Prosperity, which receives tons of corporate "special interest" money.
Do you know who would benefit from net neutrality? Glenn Beck. People like Beck would continue to have open access to a platform to share their conspiracy theories no matter how ill-informed they might be. So far, there are few signs that Beck will ever get this.
A friend of mine used to date someone who is now going through transition (small world, right?), and she made a comment about her ex becoming “the wrong kind of woman”. Of course I asked her to explain. She had been on the phone with V that morning and listened to a long rambling complaint about getting a flat tire and how having to change it made her feel unfeminine. My friend, a very empowered woman who thinks nothing of bicycling across the state and camping out by herself in haunted fields, seemed just a little bit annoyed by this.
For the record, I used to think like V. There were male things and female things, and they remained mutually exclusive. My upbringing in a house with a stay at home mom who did most of the cooking and cleaning and a dad who mowed the lawn and created a cacophony of power tool noises in the basement was highly conducive to this. When the first transsexual I ever met, the one who outed me to myself before I was ready, told me she had changed the springs in her car that morning, I was pretty baffled. She was a woman now, a wig girl like me to boot, and I could not imagine having to do something that involved lots of grunting, mallets, and thick black grease. Ugh, gross! In my mind she should have been sitting daintily in the repair shop, applying hoochie red lipstick and flipping through the latest Vogue, while a wrench-head took care of this indelicate task for her. Fortunately, I have since come to my senses.
In my friend's mind, the “wrong kind of woman” is one who bows out of a task she is clearly capable of doing, simply on account of her gender. I tend to agree. Well, except for the ‘wrong kind of woman' part. I don't think there is a wrong kind of woman any more than there is a wrong kind of ice cream. … Except rum raisin. Don't be ridiculous. Yes, I might not feel particularly feminine taking out the garbage, cleaning the gutters, or doing the annual spring dog shit clean up in the yard. I am, however, perfectly capable of doing these things, and performing these tasks doesn't make me any less of a woman. It's true, I'm probably not going to put on a pair of sassy strappy heels and a sequined gown to hump a ladder around the side of the house, but being a woman isn't about always looking the idealized part.
I believe much of the problem is the confusion between nicety and ability. There are certain niceties of being female. I thoroughly enjoy being the victim of well meaning chivalry and not being asked to help move sleeper sofas, respectively based on appearance and diminished upper body strength. At the same time, I still dutifully kill spiders because my changes didn't suddenly make me afraid of them when I never have been before. It's great to enjoy the benefits, but dishonest to suddenly pretend it's “not me” to repair the stuck flapper thing in the back of the toilet.
Loss of male privilege does not mean loss of male know how. Having the appearance of young men, many or most of us were taught a number of handy skills a man is expected to possess. Frankly, these things are good to know and continue to make our lives easier for ourselves and loved ones. Given the assumption that we have female brains, it's safe to say that there is no reason in the world why little girls can't be taught the very same skill set. I think it's almost criminal that they are not as the denial is based purely on gender and not ability. True, many probably don't want to learn these things, but I didn't either. My family still likes to joke about me sitting in the basement crying because I was stuck sanding down my damnable Pinewood Derby car. I got over it, and glad I learned to do these things, and more glad that I still know how.
On Oct. 24, 2004, the Tennessee Titans shut down Minnesota's Randy Moss.
He wasn't targeted a single time in the Vikings' 20-3 win at the Metrodome. (NFC North guru Kevin Seifert recalls Moss had a torn hamstring and didn't play a lot of snaps.)
On Thursday night, the Titans did it to Moss again.
Randy Moss has just five catches for 62 yards in five games with the Titans. Aaron M. Sprecher/Icon SMI
Playing for Tennessee (and I use that term loosely), Moss was not targeted in a game for just the second time in his career, according to Michael Landrigan of ESPN Stats & Information.
The Titans may think he's done, but if so the waiver claim should not be on the roster. If they think he's done, his continued presence is strictly a posturing move by Tennessee head coach Jeff Fisher as he tries to maintain control.
But I believe even a done Randy Moss is more dangerous than Justin Gage. I believe when you're working hard to get two scores at the end of a game, you would have a reasonable chance of Moss jumping over people to collect a pass or of drawing a pass interference penalty.
And I believe this is the biggest example of Fisher's stubbornness I've seen in some time, perhaps ever. I think it hurts Fisher's case to remain the team's coach more than the Vince Young situation.
If you get Moss, you have to use Moss. And if using Moss takes you out of the framework of what you do, then you have to get out of it.
Yes, Moss and Kenny Britt both play the same position. But a smart staff finds a way to get them both on the field and falls out of love with Gage and Nate Washington.
“Well, [Britt and Moss] are playing the same position and so we try our best to rotate them both, but Kenny was feeling good and he made some plays for us,” Fisher said. “... It's just that Kenny was a starter here and he came back [from a hamstring injury]. He fought back. I'm pleased with everything Randy has done. He's been great with the guys and great in the locker room and he'll continue to play.”
Said Titans quarterback Kerry Collins: “They both play the same position, so it's hard. But we'll continue to try to find ways. It was a short week with Kenny coming back and we didn't know how he was going to do. I think it would definitely behoove us to try to get them out there at the same time.”
I'm sure Indianapolis was grateful for the way Tennessee deployed its receivers.
As he steered clear of a question about it, Colts coach Jim Caldwell said something that may be telling.
"They choose to do what they do according to how they feel," Caldwell said. "They've got all the information in that regard."
Here's what they chose:
Moss was on the field for only 15 of the Titans' 64 offensive plays -- 23.4 percent.
His first play from scrimmage came at the 4:46 mark of the second quarter.
Of the 15 plays Moss was on the field for, only eight were pass plays.
With less than a minute left in the game, Moss took off his gloves and unwrapped his wrist tape.
He might as well have never put them on.
Rescuers plunge into the water to save a woman, whose car went into the water at Northcote Point on February 17, 2015 in Auckland, New Zealand.

Coincidentally on assignment near Northcote Point in Auckland, New Zealand, when a woman in a BMW drove off the wharf and started sinking, newspaper reporter Simon Maude not only photographed the woman's dramatic rescue but assisted in it as well.
“I was sort of battling my reporter instincts versus just being a human being and helping out,” Maude told Yahoo News. “When I got down there and saw what was happening, there were already four people in the water, so me getting in the water wasn't going to help.”
Two police officers and two civilians jumped into the water to rescue the woman, who had managed to climb to an air pocket in the back seat of the quickly flooding car. But the doors would not open, and, as Constable Simon Russell later reported, the police officer's baton was not enough to break through the car window.
“I saw the policemen having difficulty breaking the windows, so I put down my camera and asked them what they needed,” Maude, who works at Auckland's North Shore Times, recalled over the phone from New Zealand. “They needed a rock, so I gave them one, and they went back to work and I went back to work.”
With that rock, the officers were able to successfully smash open the car's back window and pull the woman safely to shore.
“It was pretty close, probably 30 or 40 seconds after we managed to get the female out of the car, the car was already slipping further into the water,” Constable Paul Watts told reporters later. “I'd say she probably only had maximum probably another minute, minute-and-a-half if she hadn't gotten out.”
The woman, who has not been identified by name, was reportedly not injured, and New Zealand's top law enforcement brass have praised the rescue by Watts, Russell and the two civilians. Maude's photos, meanwhile, have been shared worldwide.
“It could've been anyone else, it was just plain chance that I was in the area,” Maude said. “In this day and age, everybody's got a camera. It just happened to be me."

High quality videos of DriveClub
Today is a good day! After quite a few days of discussion we finally had the green light to put online some incredibly high quality videos of the Gamescom build of DriveClub. The videos are already up on youtube, but the quality difference makes it look like an almost completely different game! Two videos are already online, with 2 more to come later tonight.
Rushy of Evolution Studios mentioned on NeoGAF that the latest builds of the game are using an anti-aliasing solution, contrary to the Gamescom build shown in these videos where there is no anti-aliasing at all. So the jaggies seen here should be a thing of the past when you get to play this game at launch!
Update 2: As promised, the last video is now online. Enjoy!
FAMILIES of British embassy staff have been flown out of Venezuela as the country erupts in violence.
The Foreign Office has also instructed other Britons to considering leaving.
The unrest follows a vote on Sunday — boycotted by opposition parties — that gave president Nicolás Maduro's ruling socialists nearly unlimited powers.
Two opposition leaders have been arrested in an apparent crackdown.
The vote, for a new constitutional assembly, came after four months of protests against Mr Maduro's government that have seen 120 people killed.
Plunging oil prices and corruption have resulted in food and medicine shortages.
Opponents urged people to take to the streets today to prevent the new assembly being sworn-in. Opposition leader Freddy Guevara said: ‘Now is the time for action, not words.'
The Foreign Office said: ‘All dependants of British Embassy staff have been withdrawn. You should consider leaving the country by normal commercial means. If the political situation worsens, the British embassy may be limited in the assistance that it can provide.'
The US has imposed financial sanctions on Mr Maduro. But the Venezuelan president went on TV to insist the sanctions ‘don't intimidate me'.
Meanwhile, a tech company that provided voting machines for Sunday's poll said turnout was overstated by ‘at least 1million votes'.
Smartmatic's chief executive Antonio Mugica said he could not ‘endorse' the outcome as officials ignored his company's results. An exit poll said turnout was less than half that reported by the regime.
Oil workers loyal to Mr Maduro took to the streets yesterday to show support.
Tom Hardy has set up a JustGiving page for victims of the Manchester terror attack (Picture: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic)
JustGiving has confirmed Tom Hardy has set up a fundraising page for victims of the Manchester terror attack.
His page – Tom Hardy's Manchester Emergency Fund – was confirmed as being genuine today and, at the time of writing, has raised over £18,000 for those affected by the attack.
The 39-year-old actor is raising money for the British Red Cross and has set himself a target of £15,000.
He wrote on the JustGiving page: ‘I am hoping to raise money for The British Red Cross Society because the families and children will need support.'
‘What happened at the AG [Ariana Grande] concert in Manchester was a tragedy; families and children attacked and murdered; in a place where they should be safe and enjoying a concert – it is an inconceivable atrocity.
‘There is no bringing back those who have been lost, pointlessly, in such a cowardly and brutal fashion. I am truly saddened by what I have witnessed and there is no doubt that Terrorism is an evil thing.

‘I hope that between us we can raise some funds as a gesture of goodwill and love to help in some small way towards repairing some if any of the damage done…
‘There will be much to do and for many the beginning of a new life without those that they love and also a new life damaged irrevocably by the actions of a crime which has no reason, no heartfelt purpose but was simply a cruel cowardly and barbaric, meaningless act of violence.
‘Terrorism is abhorrent, the killing of innocent families and children unacceptable. And it is with those, the innocent victims and the witnesses of this atrocity that my heartfelt concern and deepest sympathy lies. Please help however you can. Thankyou.'
Tom's post concluded: ‘Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure. Your details are safe with JustGiving – they'll never sell them on or send unwanted emails. Once you donate, they'll send your money directly to the charity. So it's the most efficient way to donate – saving time and cutting costs for the charity.'
Hardy's post was created on Tuesday May 23 at 8pm.
Funds raised for the families on donation site JustGiving have so far exceeded the £2million mark from all 150 JustGiving pages.

3. Blaster
The Blaster Worm (also known as Lovsan or Lovesan) was a computer worm that spread on computers running the Microsoft operating systems, Windows XP and Windows 2000. The worm was first noticed and started spreading on August 11, 2003. The rate that it spread increased until the number of infections peaked on August 13, 2003. Filtering by ISPs and widespread publicity about the worm curbed the spread of Blaster.
The worm was programmed to start a SYN flood on August 15, 2003 against port 80 of windowsupdate.com, thereby creating a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) against the site. The damage to Microsoft was minimal as the site targeted was windowsupdate.com instead of windowsupdate.microsoft.com to which it was redirected. Microsoft temporarily shut down the targeted site to minimize potential effects from the worm. Although the worm can only spread on systems running Windows 2000 or Windows XP (32 bit) it can cause instability in the RPC service on systems running Windows NT, Windows XP (64 bit), and Windows Server 2003. If the worm detects a connection to the Internet (regardless of dial-up or broadband), this can even lead to the system becoming so unstable that it displays the following message and then restarts (usually after 60 seconds).
The worm contains two messages hidden in strings. The first:
I just want to say LOVE YOU SAN!!
This is why the worm is sometimes called the Lovesan worm. The second:
billy gates why do you make this possible ? Stop making money
and fix your software!!
It is a message to Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder.

I have heard a lot of ex-Mormons talk about their experience as children inside the "cult" of Mormonism. They talk about the way that authority figures were seen as godlike, infallible. They talk about youth trips taken where food was withheld or there was serious social pressure to voice testimony.
There are those who complain about the dress code of Mormonism, the modesty "contest" that makes women and young women in particular strive to always make sure there could never be a hint of skin showing.
And then I hear about missionaries, who spend weeks in the Missionary Training Center (MTC) being allowed outside only for a few minutes a day, "brainwashed" into preaching a gospel to others, remaining with companions 24/7 and having only twice a year contact with their parents and families.
Questions about living in a cult are among the first that I often get when I am asked to speak to book clubs or at conferences. How can I, a highly educated woman who has spent many years living outside of Utah, who has worked most of her children's growing up years as nationally published author, defend such a cult? Why do I remain an active member of such an organization? How can I encourage my own children to serve missions for the Mormon church or to pay tithing or serve in leadership positions, let alone attend meetings?
Well, because I don't believe Mormonism is a cult. Or rather, I believe it is no more of a cult than its members make it, and no more of a cult than many, many other organizations I see around me. I think that many humans have an impulse to cultism because it is this same tribalism that has for many thousands of years kept humans safe as a species.
A couple of years ago, I joined a group fitness club for about six months. The other people there were very loyal. All over the walls, there were painted various inspirational quotes about athleticism and the group's code of eating, which focused on a kind of paleo diet which I personally do not adhere to, as a vegetarian.
We were encouraged to share our private struggles with other group members and to come to the same time each week, so we could further cement our bonds. Sometimes, we were set challenges to make us compete with each other. We talked about how we were better than other fitness groups because we did things the "right way" and how when we had tried to do other fitness routines, they hadn't worked for us. And then there were the national competitions that we often heard about, incredible feats of strength and endurance from those who seemed too far above us to be real. Does any of this sound familiar?
I eventually stopped going because I once went to a workout and brought some sports drink with me and got yelled at for it, because we weren't supposed to be consuming any sugar. It made me uncomfortable and I stopped going because I didn't ultimately believe that this group was the only true way to get in shape and it seemed impossible to keep going without believing that. I've moved on to other challenges and have had my own individual successes as an All-American triathlete.
But--here's the truth--I miss it sometimes. I miss the other people I got to know, miss the sense of camaraderie in the workouts. I miss the sense of purpose and focus that I got there. I miss talking about people who did amazing things that I was trying to work at myself, and I miss the group sense of certainty. As I have talked to others about the experience, I've realized how similar my complaints about this organization are to complaints about Mormonism as a cult. And it led me to wonder--is it the organization itself that is set up to be this way or do people naturally make many things into cults because we crave certain aspects of cultism?
1. A sense of "us" and "them" that divides the world into black and white
2. An assurance that we are superior
3. The satisfaction of demonstrating an extreme level of loyalty
4. Hero worship that means we see people as more than human and create a storybook history for them with challenges but no real weaknesses.
5. A clear way into the future without having to make complex moral decisions constantly.
I remember many years ago, when talking about an atheist friend of mine, I said aloud to my husband that I couldn't understand how anyone could make moral decisions without some kind of guiding principles of right and wrong, without a religious framework, in fact. Now, I look back on that question with some irony, since I feel I have stopped letting others tell me what is right and wrong and have committed to the difficulty of choosing right and wrong in complex situations, though I am not an atheist.
Without trying to condemn anyone else's religious practice, I look back on myself and think I was doing a lot of painting by numbers. That is, I was allowing other people to tell me what was right and wrong without investigating it myself.
In a very real sense, I was creating a cult out of Mormonism by giving up my own power and by seeing my religious leaders as more than human. I now refuse to see the world in black and white, and try to understand those who are different from me, in religion and in other areas. I have shed much of the sense of superiority and certainty that my cultish religious fanaticism once gave me.
And yes, I sometimes still miss the old way I had of practicing my religion. I miss being better than everyone else, being "special" or "anointed" in some way. I miss feeling a sense of security that I and my loved ones would be protected because of our strict adherence to a set of rules that I think we mostly made up. My parents, for instance, wanted us to wear Sunday clothes all day, not just to church, to show our extreme devotion. Instead of paying the standard ten percent of tithing, I've heard Mormons say they pay "extra" for more blessings.
I hear Mormons who refuse to drink any caffeinated drinks because it's against their own personal interpretation of the Word of Wisdom. We are asked to go to the temple once a month, but some Mormons try to go every week, or twice a week, because it will bring more blessings. And so on, with prayers constantly, fasting food for longer than a single day or for more often than once a month, or other more strict rules. Is this the fault of Mormonism? I don't think it is.
Vulkan is a C API and as such inherits all common pitfalls of using a general C programming library. The motivation of a low-level Vulkan C++ API is to avoid these common pitfalls by applying commonly known C++ features while keeping the overall structure of a Vulkan program and preserving the full freedom it provides as low-level graphics API. An additional guideline we followed was not to introduce additional runtime overhead by providing a header-only library with inline functions.
Have a look at the following piece of code which creates a VkImage:
VkImageCreateInfo ci; ci.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_IMAGE_CREATE_INFO; ci.pNext = nullptr; ci.flags = … some flags...; ci.imageType = VK_IMAGE_TYPET_2D; ci.format = VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM; ci.extent = VkExtent3D { width, height, 1 }; ci.mipLevels = 1; ci.arrayLayers = 1; ci.samples = VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT; ci.tiling = VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL; ci.usage = VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT; ci.sharingMode = VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE; ci.queueFamilyIndexCount = 0; ci.pQueueFamilyIndices = 0; ci.initialLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED; vkCreateImage(device, &ci, allocator, &image));
There may be some issues than can happen when filling the structure which cannot be caught at compile time:
initialization of ci.sType using wrong enum values
uninitialized data fields (e.g. missing initialization of ci.mipLevels)
use of invalid bits for ci.flags (no type-safety for bits)
use of incorrect enums for fields (no type-safety for enums)
These initializations will most likely show up as random runtime errors, which usually are nasty and time-consuming to debug. Our auto-generated, C++ 11-conform layer uses commonly known C++ features like implicit initialization through constructors to avoid incorrect or missing initializations and introduces type-safety with scoped enums to turn explicit initialization errors into compile errors.
Following is a list of features and conventions introduced by our Vulkan C++ layer:
Works along the official C version of the API
Defines all symbols within the ‘vk' namespace and to avoid redundancy the vk/Vk/VK_ prefixes have been removed from all symbols, i.e. vk::commandBindPipeline for vkCommandBindPipeline.
Camel case syntax with an ‘e' prefix has been introduced for all enums, i.e. vk::ImageType::e2D (the prefix was a compromise, more about that later)
Removes the ‘BIT' suffix from all flag related enums, i.e. vk::ImageUsage::eColorAttachment.
Introduces constructors for all structs, which by default set the appropriate sType and all other values to zero.
Encapsulates member variables of the structs with getter and setter functions, i.e. ci.imageType() to get a value and ci.imageType(vk::ImageType::e2D) to set a value.
With those changes applied, the updated code snippet looks like this:
vk::ImageCreateInfo ci; ci.flags(...some flags…); ci.imageType(vk::ImageType::e2D); ci.format(vk::Format::eR8G8B8A8Unorm); ci.extent(vk::Extent3D { width, height, 1 }); ci.mipLevels(1); ci.arrayLayers(1); ci.samples(1); ci.tiling(vk::ImageTiling::eOptimal); ci.usage(vk::ImageUsage::eColorAttachment); ci.sharingMode(vk::SharingMode::eExclusive); // ci.queueFamilyIndexCount(0) // no need to set, already initialized // ci.pQueueFamilyIndices(0) // no need to set, already initialized ci.initialLayout(vk::ImageLayout::eUndefined); vk::createImage(device, &ci, allocator, &image));
Which is a total of 13 lines of code, versus 17 lines for the C version. In addition, this code is more robust as described above.
Type-safe Enums
Splitting up the C enums into a namespace and scoped enums resulted in two compilation issues. First some enums started with a digit like vk::ImageType::1D which resulted in a compilation error. Second, there's the risk that upper symbols like
vk::CompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR::OPAQUE do clash with preprocessor defines. In the given example OPAQUE has been defined in win32gdi.h resulting a compilation error.
To overcome those two issues the symbols have been converted to camel case and the prefix ‘e' has been added so that each enum starts with a letter.
Improvements to Bit Flags
After those changes the code might look more familiar to C++ developers, but there is still no gain with regards to safety. With C++ features available we replaced all Vulkan enums with scoped enums to achieve type safety which already uncovered a few small issues in our code. The good thing with scoped enums is that there is no implicit casts to integer types anymore. The downside is that OR'ing the bits for the flags does not work anymore without an explicit cast. As a solution to this problem we have introduced a new vk::Flags template which is used for all flags. This class supports the standard operations one usually needs on bitmasks like &=, |=, & and |. Except for the initialization with 0, which is being replaced by the default constructor, the vk::Flags class works exactly like a normal bitmask with the improvement that it is impossible to set bits not specified by the corresponding enum. To generate a bit mask with two bits set write:
ci.usage = vk::ImageUsage::eColorAttachment | vk::ImageUsage::eStorage;
By adding the scoped enums and vk::Flags the C++ API provides type safety for all enums and flags which is a big improvement. This leaves the remaining issue that the compiler might not detect uninitialized fields in structs. As a solution we've added constructors to all structs which accept all values defined by the corresponding struct.
vk::ImageCreateInfo ci( some flags, vk::ImageType::e2D, vk::Format::eR8G8B8A8Unorm, vk::Extent3D { width, height, 1 }, 1, 1, vk::SampleCount::e1, vk::ImageTiling::eOptimal, vk::ImageUsage::eColorAttachment, vk::SharingMode::eExclusive, 0, 0, vk::ImageLayout::eUndefined);
Alternative Initialization of Structs
Another nice feature of those constructors is that sType is being initialized internally and thus is always correct.
Finally, we've added a default constructor to each struct which initializes all values to 0 to allow setting the values with the named parameter idiom which is similar to the designated initializer list of C99.
vk::ImageCreateInfo ci = vk::ImageCreateInfo() .flags(...some flags…) .imageType(vk::ImageType::e2D) .format(vk::Format::eR8G8B8A8Unorm) .extent(vk::Extent3D { width, height, 1 }) .mipLevels(1) .arrayLayers(1) .samples(1) .tiling(vk::ImageTiling::eOptimal) .usage(vk::ImageUsage::eColorAttachment) .sharingMode(vk::SharingMode::eExclusive) // .queueFamilyIndexCount(0) // no need to set, already initialized // .pQueueFamilyIndices(0) // no need to set, already initialized .initialLayout(vk::ImageLayout::eUndefined); vk::createImage(device, &ci, allocator, &image));
Enhancements beyond the API
While mapping the Vulkan API to C++ without adding new functions is already a big help, one can do even more by adding new functionality. For example several C++ developers tend to use std::string and std::vector in their code, therefore we have added some more optional convenience features:
Use std::string instead of const char * for strings
Use std::vector instead of (count, ptr) for sized arrays
Throw exceptions (Work in Progress)
Return handles/vectors where applicable, i.e. for the create* functions
As example let's examine the device extension property enumeration in Vulkan:
uint32_t count; VK_VERIFY(vk::enumerateDeviceExtensionProperties(physicalDevice, layerName.c_str(), &count, nullptr)); std::vector <vk::ExtensionProperties> properties(count); VK_VERIFY(vk::enumerateDeviceExtensionProperties(physicalDevice, layerName.c_str(), &count, properties.data()));
Luckily the official Khronos-provided vk.xml has enough information to figure out which pair of values represents a sized array or strings, so that it is possible to generate a function which allows you to write the following line of code instead:
std::vector<ExtensionProperties> properties = vk::enumerateDeviceExtensionProperties(physicalDevice, layerName);

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — Former White House communications director and senior adviser Anthony Scaramucci fielded questions from the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia on Thursday.
In a wide-ranging question-and-answer session with council members, Scaramucci batted away suggestions that Donald Trump may be a one-term president.
“If you tell me that we're going into the 2020 election and we're in a steep recession, the stock market is crashing, then I'll say to you he's got a chance of getting dislodged. But without that, my guess is that people will vote for him,” he said.
Scaramucci also took partial responsibility for the infamous recorded phone call with a reporter that got him fired over the summer. A profanity-laced tirade against White House leakers and Chief of Staff Reince Preibus.
At the same time, Scaramucci said he sees himself as a victim of what he calls “Scandals Incorporated.”
“And it doesn't matter which side has power, we're gonna scandalize these people. The second thing we're gonna do is the politics of personality destruction. We have to find out something about these people so that we can destroy them in an ad hominem way so that once we've disfigured them to the American people, their voices no longer matter,” said Scaramucci.
The Wall Street financier described himself as a moderate, socially inclusive, and fiscally responsible, who missed what he calls America's transition from the aspirational working class family to the desperational working class family.
Scaramucci also has doubts that Congress will pass true tax reform because it is simply “too hard a slog.” He predicts tax cuts will be the more likely outcome.
He said he believes the political system has failed the American people.
“We've racked up $20 trillion of debt. We're prosecuting wars that we're not winning, lots of lives and treasure have been spoiled on those battlefronts that could've been deployed in schools or infrastructure,” he said.
A US federal judge said Facebook Inc must face a nationwide class-action lawsuit seeking to force the social media company to provide refunds when children spend their parents' money on its website without permission.
US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman in San Jose, California on Tuesday said a class of plaintiffs estimated in the hundreds of thousands may press their claim that Facebook should change how it handles online transactions by minors.
The judge also said the plaintiffs could not pursue refunds as a group under US Supreme Court precedent, because any refunds would vary from case to case, but could still seek individual refunds. She set an 19 October trial date.
Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The April 2012 lawsuit said Facebook let children use their parents' credit and debit cards to buy the virtual currency Facebook Credits, and violated California law by refusing refunds under its “all sales are final” policy when the parents complained.
In opposing class certification, Facebook said the plaintiffs' claims were too disparate and the proposed injunction would not address them.
But Freeman said state law protects parents and their children when those children “occasionally use their lack of judgment” and buy things they should not.
“Though some minors undoubtedly may wish to continue making purchases through credit or debit cards they do not have permission to use, such a desire cannot prevent the named plaintiffs from bringing suit to demand that Facebook's policies comply with the law,” she added.
Facebook Credits were discontinued in 2013 and replaced with Facebook Payments.
The lawsuit was brought by two children and their parents.
One child said his mother let him spend $20 on her credit card toward the game “Ninja Saga,” but was later charged several hundred dollars for purchases he thought he made with “virtual, in-game currency.” The other said he took a debit card from his parents without permission and spent $1,059.
People who sign up for Facebook must be at least 13 years old, the Menlo Park, California-based company says on its website.
“We're very pleased with the decision,” J R Parker, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a phone interview. “The difference between Facebook and other businesses is that the company is on actual notice of a user's age, but treats children the same as adult users when it comes to taking their money.“
The case is I.B. et al v. Facebook Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 12-01894.
Supreme Court Hears 'Pay To Delay' Pharmaceutical Case
Enlarge this image toggle caption iStockphoto.com iStockphoto.com
The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments Monday in a case worth billions of dollars to pharmaceutical companies and American consumers. The issue is whether brand-name drug manufacturers may pay generic drug manufacturers to keep generics off the market. These payments — a form of settlement in patent litigation — began to blossom about a decade ago when the courts, for the first time, appeared to bless them.
Consumer advocates, health care organizations and retail outlets call these payments "pay to delay." The drugmakers hate that term and have a different name. They call the payments "reverse settlements."
But the bottom line is that in these cases, the people who usually sue each other — the patent-holding drugmakers and the alleged patent violators (the generic drugmakers) — are on the same side, supporting the payments.
Challenging the payments is the Federal Trade Commission, which sees these monetary arrangements as collusion, a way to stop competition in the marketplace and a violation of the nation's antitrust laws.
The drugmakers, in contrast, see the settlements as a routine way of settling a legal dispute, with each side getting something it wants.
The Patent Dispute
The case before the Supreme Court is fairly typical. It involves a patent on AndroGel, a prescription testosterone gel -- a new version of an old drug. In short, the brand-name drugmaker Solvay had a new patent with a slightly different formula.
Generic competitors challenged Solvay's patent, contending that the patent on the synthesized testosterone used in AndroGel had expired decades ago and that whatever innovative changes were made in the formula were not enough to justify a new patent that would bar generics from making similar products.
The litigation pressed on for two years with both sides gathering evidence. But as the lawsuit progressed into its third year, one generic won FDA approval for its competitive product, and was preparing to market it at prices that were six times cheaper than the brand named AndroGel. That would have put AndroGel's $400 million annual sales into the tank
At that point, Solvay and the generics reached a settlement under which the generics would not market their competitive drugs for another nine years. And in exchange, Solvay would pay the generics a total of up to $42 million annually.
Defenders of settlements like this contend that each side is getting something it wants. The generic gets the payment, plus the certainty of going to market prior to the patent expiration but not as soon as it initially wanted.
Settling 'Somewhere In The Middle'
As lawyer Kannon Shanmugam puts it, "Settlement is one of the rights that is virtually enshrined in our Constitution. And when you have one party who says that the patent is invalid and another party that says that the patent has another 15 years of patent life, it seems reasonable that the parties should have a variety of tools to settle somewhere in the middle."
Opponents of such settlements, including retailers, hospitals and health insurance groups, contend that these "pay to delay" settlements should be presumptively illegal.
"These deals are unheard of in any other area of the law for a really simple reason," says lawyer Tom Goldstein. "Nobody believes that if you're the only company in the market and a competitor comes along, you can say to them, 'I'll pay you 10, 20, 50, or 100 million dollars to just stay out of the market. That's the opposite of competition." These payments extend monopolies, and "it hurts customers who would benefit from lower drug prices."
The Federal Trade Commission is leading the charge against the payments in Monday's Supreme Court case. It appealed to the high court after a federal appeals court upheld the Solvay payments. The agency is telling the justices that once a generic enters the market and competes with the brand-name drug, prices drop 85 percent.
The payments are not settlements but "old-fashioned, naked" agreements not to compete, said U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli at Georgetown Law School earlier this month.
The FTC says that when generics actually take their patent challenges to trial, they win 73 percent of the time, but that generics settle because they often make more money by settling with the brand-name drugmakers than they would otherwise.
In response, lawyers for the drugmakers note that a patent is — in essence — a license given by the federal government to have a monopoly for a limited period of time. And they argue that if Congress wants to bar these reverse settlement payments, it can do just that through legislation.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 19-year-old surviving Boston Marathon bombing suspect, has told FBI interrogators that he and his brother had considered suicide attacks for the Fourth of July, the United States' Independence Day, before settling on April 15.
The younger Tsarnaev brother told investigators on April 21, only two days after being captured by police, that the pair's plans were accelerated after they finished building explosive devices at their Cambridge, Massachusetts, apartment faster than they anticipated.
Law enforcement officials questioned Tsarnaev immediately after he woke up in recovery after suffering gunshot wounds during his capture, according to The New York Times. Investigators then invoked a "public safety exception" to the Miranda Rule, which allowed them to interrogate him without notifying the suspect of his right to remain silent. He was later notified of his Miranda rights by a judge.
According to Dzhokhar's account of his plans to investigators, he and his brother chose the finish line of the Boston Marathon as the attack site after looking around Boston for other possible locations.
The younger Tsarnaev also told investigators that he had watched videos by American jihadist Anwar al-Awlaki with his brother. However, there was no evidence that the Tsarnaevs ever communicated with al-Awlaki, who was killed in September 2011 in a drone strike in Yemen, according to The New York Times.
The news coincides with the long-awaited release of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's body to his family. The body was released by Massachusetts Office of the Chief Medical Examiner on Thursday, where it lay since the fatal April 19 shootout with the police, following the events of the attack in Boston.
A spokesman for the office said the body was claimed by a funeral services company that had been hired by Tsarnaev's relatives.
Earlier, three new suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing case were taken into custody.
Nineteen-year-old University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth college students Azamat Tazhayakov, Dias Kadyrbayev and Robel Phillipos have been accused of interfering with a federal probe into the April 15, 2013, terrorist attack at the Boston Marathon.
Investigators say the three students were classmates of suspected bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and attempted to hinder an investigation by destroying evidence they uncovered from his UMass-Dartmouth dormitory room three days after the marathon bombing.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his brother Dzhokhar allegedly detonated two homemade bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, killing three and injuring more than 260 people. Tamerlan was killed in a police shootout that followed accompanied by a massive manhunt that put the whole city on lockdown. Dzhokhar was later discovered hiding in boat parked in the backyard of a Franklin Street home.
Dzhokhar has been formally charged with using a weapon of mass destruction and has been transferred to Federal Medical Center, Devens outside of Boston, Massachusetts.
Television evangelist Pat Robertson has made inflammatory remarks in recent years that offend gays, Muslims and others, but a recent comment he made on his Christian Broadcasting Network was more notable for whom it pleased: people who want to see marijuana legalized.
"We're locking up people that take a couple of puffs of marijuana, and the next thing you know they've got 10 years," the controversial pastor said on "The 700 Club" on Dec. 16, in a clip unearthed by bloggers this week. "I'm not exactly for the use of drugs - don't get me wrong - but I just believe that criminalizing marijuana, criminalizing the possession of a few ounces of pot and that kind of thing, I mean, it's just, it's costing us a fortune and it's ruining young people."
It was a surprising admission from a Christian conservative and favorite target of liberals, who have pounced on his assertions that the earthquake that devastated Haiti's capital city in January resulted from a pact with the Devil, for example, or that Hurricane Katrina was punishment for abortion and the country's general moral decay.
His views on marijuana lit up the Internet on Thursday because they seemingly aligned him with liberal groups that have long complained of the punitive nature of the nation's drug laws. The comments have been seized on by pro-marijuana groups that cite them as evidence that their message is gaining traction not only in the mainstream but within the religious right.
"His voice is respected by hundreds of thousands or millions of people who might not otherwise think about this issue seriously. His comments were a very important step forward," said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a group that supports legalizing and taxing marijuana. "The only way that this country's going to end up with more sensible and sane drug laws is if people call for it from across the political spectrum."
On Thursday, a CBN spokesman said in an e-mail that Robertson is "unequivocally" against illegal drug use and that he does not support legalizing marijuana.
The nation's attitude toward marijuana has changed dramatically over the past two decades. In an October Washington Post poll, 43 percent of respondents said they would be in favor of legalizing the possession of a small amount of marijuana for personal use - up from 22 percent in 1997.
Fifteen states and the District allow marijuana to be used for medicinal purposes, and there are signs that public consternation is growing over the sometimes severe punishments doled out for minor drug offenses. In Montana last week, a group of potential jurors objected en masse upon learning that a man was arrested on marijuana possession. The uprising led the prosecution to seek a plea deal.
Self-described conservatives remain the most opposed to legalizing marijuana, with 69 percent against such a change in the laws in the Post poll. But there have been recent efforts to convince conservatives that it is in line with their small-government philosophy to consider alternatives to imprisonment for minor drug offenses.
Gary Johnson, a libertarian and former Republican governor of New Mexico, took his pro-legalization message to tea party rallies this summer. Gov. Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. (R-Ind.) this month embraced a proposal to reduce sentences for nonviolent offenders, including some drug criminals, and to increase access to drug treatment programs - in the name of government efficiency.
"Conservatives for a long time have supported a one-size-fits-all solution, which is: Lock them up and throw away the key. There's a growing realization that it hasn't worked very well and it's been very expensive," said David Guenthner, spokesman for Right on Crime, a Texas-based group that advocates for criminal justice reforms from a conservative perspective. The group does not support decriminalizing marijuana, however.
Guenthner would not comment on Robertson's remarks, which came after "The 700 Club" aired a segment on Right on Crime and faith-based programs in prisons.
"Those men and women want to know the Lord, but there's something else we've got to recognize. . . . These judges, they say, they throw their hands up and say, there's nothing we can do because of these mandatory sentences," Robertson said.
He continued: "We've got to take a look at what we're considering crimes, and that's one of them. . . . Young people go into prison . . . as youths and they come out as hardened criminals, and it's not a good thing."
Polling director Jon Cohen contributed to this report.
BRANDON, Man. — The person expected to represent the Liberals in an upcoming federal byelection says he is not misleading voters through his online biography, where he lists experience as a senior executive at Facebook.
Rolf Dinsdale, the only candidate so far for the Liberal nomination in Brandon-Souris, was never an employee of Facebook. He worked for a Toronto company called Segal Communications, which handled sales for Facebook advertising in Canada between 2007 and 2009.
“Well, maybe I better change a couple of sentences here, but I don't think I'm being misleading at all,” Dinsdale said Wednesday.
“I'll be very clear. I never worked directly for Facebook. I was a third-party agent. But this is very typical when companies expand into Canada, in the media business, that they'll hire Canadian companies to represent them here.”
Segal and Facebook formed a “partnership,” Dinsdale said, and he reported to a vice-president at Facebook.
Dinsdale recently moved back from Toronto to Brandon, where his family history runs deep. His father, Walter Dinsdale, was the area's Progressive Conservative member of Parliament for 32 years. His grandfather, George Dinsdale, was a Brandon mayor and legislature member.
The 47-year-old has experience in publishing and media sales. His campaign website says Dinsdale “became a senior executive at the leading social media network Facebook, and guided its Canadian business operations until 2009.”
If I'm guilty of anything, it's of having a sense of humour and enjoying playing loud rock 'n' roll with my friends
Unlike his father, Dinsdale has leaned Liberal. Until recently, he was a member of the punk rock band S–t From Hell, along with longtime Liberal strategist Warren Kinsella. The band's songs include “Horny Single Mom” and “Jesus Got Wood.” The video for the latter features a writhing woman and the lyrics, “Baby you're going to get impaled.”
Dinsdale says the songs show his sense of humour and he considers his material pro-Christian.
“If I'm guilty of anything, it's of having a sense of humour and enjoying playing loud rock 'n' roll with my friends.”
“Jesus Got Wood” is a Christian anthem, Dinsdale said.
“Personally, I felt there needed to be a song like this that spoke to people who maybe don't get exposed to Christian rock … and it is funny in one sense.”
Dinsdale may be in for an uphill battle in Brandon-Souris, a long-time Tory stronghold. In 2011, the Liberal candidate finished fourth, slightly behind the Green Party candidate.
A date has not yet been set for the byelection, which must be held to replace Conservative Merv Tweed, who resigned last month. The Liberals have yet to set a date for their nomination meeting.
Dinsdale originally faced a competitor, Frank Godon, but he dropped out of the race last week.
The full bio from rolfdinsdale.ca “Rolf earned degrees from the University of Western Ontario (majoring in political science and French) and Carleton University (majoring in communications). He built a successful career in print and digital media based in Ottawa and Toronto, but has always maintained strong roots in Manitoba. From 2004-2007 he served as a publisher of the award-winning Canadian magazine The Walrus. He then became a senior executive at the leading social media network Facebook, and guided its Canadian business operations until 2009. Recently, Rolf was part of the executive team that launched broadcast company Blue Ant Media. Rolf has built a record of professional success by launching innovative media products, creating jobs in the emerging tech economy, demonstrating strong business acumen, and utilizing his boundless creative energy.” (Emphasis added) The text has now been edited to read: “He then became the senior executive responsible for Facebook's business development in Canada at their agency partner Segal Communications, and led the Facebook Canada team until 2009.”
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -- Marvin Austin, Robert Quinn and Greg Little were supposed to lead North Carolina Tar Heels resurgence under Butch Davis this season. Instead, they never even stepped on the field.
And the trouble for the football program is still not over.
The school kicked Austin off the team Monday while the NCAA declared Quinn and Little "permanently ineligible" amid an ongoing investigation into whether players received improper benefits from agents.
Monday was the latest step in what has been a painstaking process that has inched along for weeks. The Tar Heels, who are also being investigated for possible academic violations, began the season with 13 players sidelined. The status of six players remains in question.
The investigations have damaged the reputation of the program and university. They also have raised the possibility of sanctions or vacated wins, even questions about a lack of institutional control for the program.
The NCAA said Quinn and Little received travel accommodations and jewelry, then lied about it to investigators in three separate interviews. Meanwhile, the school decided it wouldn't wait any longer to cut ties with Austin -- a star defensive tackle at the center of the investigation since it began during the summer -- after the NCAA provided preliminary information that Austin had received double the benefits furnished to Quinn and Little.
Athletic director Dick Baddour said the school wouldn't appeal the NCAA ruling.
"I'm also very sad and disappointed that these individuals made these extraordinarily poor choices," Davis said during a news conference. "Not only did they jeopardize themselves in their lives, they certainly have jeopardized this team, the university and I know that they're very remorseful about that. But it doesn't diminish the fact that these actions were poor choices in these kids' lives."
Baddour said Davis continues to have "my complete support" in resolving the issues, including better monitoring of players' activities, offseason travel and associations. He also said the school could hear rulings on more players later this week.
"I feel very strong about our compliance staff, about our compliance program," Baddour said. "I feel very strong about this football program, as I do the other programs that we have. I think we're in good stead. I'm going to fight the institutional control issues because of what we had in place and because of the way we're handling it."
Murakami Leads Nobel Prize for Literature Odds
Published August 29, 2012 by OCR Editor
Ladbrokes installs Japanese novelist as favorite for world's greatest literature prize
Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami leads the early sports betting odds for the Nobel Prize for Literature, but he will have to beat a strong field if he is to be awarded the coveted prize.
Ladbrokes has installed Murakami, the author of acclaimed titles like Norwegian Wood and 1Q84, as the 10/1 favorite to win the Nobel. Following him are Chinese author Mo Yan and Dutch author Cees Noteboom at 12/1, and a host of other great writers like Philip Roth and even singer Bob Dylan.
Last year's winner, Swedish potet Tomas Transtromer, was Ladbrokes' second favourite to win the award, with his 9/2 odds trailing only the 4/1 on offer for Syrian poet Adonis. This year Adonis is a 14/1 shot to win, sharing odds with another poet, Korean Ko Un, and Albanian author Ismail Kadare.
And now, anyone who registers to Ladbrokes and uses promo code FB50 will receive the right to a free bet of up to £50. Place a single bet of £5 (or more) on the Nobel Prize in Literature at Ladbrokes, and enjoy a free bet for the same amount.
Free bets can be used on other Awards - BBC Sports Personality and the Turner Prize among them.
The Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded 104 times to 108 Nobel Laureates going back to 1901. Considered the most prestigious prize in international literature, it rewards what the Swedish Academy considers to be the most outstanding author.
Literature is one of the five categories in which a Nobel Prize is awarded. The others prizes are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, the Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and the Nobel Peace Prize. Online sportsbooks should have odds on those prizes soon.
Q: How can I see what databases/collections is available?
Launch the Mongo DB shell by running mongo (for localhost, or specify some custom host/port along with -u USERNAME -p etc). Once inside the shell, run:
show dbs use some_database show collections
You can also launch mongo HOST:PORT/DB -u USERNAME -p to directly open the DB database.
Q: How can I find documents?
// The 'use' command works even if the database doesn't exist yet use my_database // Use Javascript regex syntax to find documents where the name contains "Ma", // so that it finds for example documents with names "Martin", "Maxwell" and "iMac". db . persons . find ({ name : /Ma/ }) // Find documents where the name starts with "Ma" db . persons . find ({ name : /^Ma/ }) // Find documents where nicknames are an array that contains the element "foo" db . persons . find ({ nicknames : "foo" }) // Find persons who have exactly 14 nicknames db . persons . find ({ nicknames : { $size : 14 }}) // Find persons whose name is not "Susan" db . persons . find ({ name : { $ne : "Susan" }}) // Find persons whose name is not "Susan" nor "Whitney" db . persons . find ({ name : { $nin : [ "Susan" , "Whitney" ] }}) // Find persons that is either born 1953 or named "Cait" db . persons . find ({ $or : [{ birthYear : 1953 }, { fullname : "Cait" }]}) // Find persons aged 30 to 35 dbs . persons . find ({ age : { $gt : 30 , $lt : 35 }}) // Find persons named "Earl" whose age is <= 30 db . persons . find ({ $and : [{ name : "Earl" }, { age : { $lte : 30 }}]}) // Find persons named "Earl" whose age is <= 30 (using $where and JS expression) // NOTE: Slow because A) JS is evaluated once per doc, and B) index is not used. db . persons . find ({ $where : 'this.name == "Earl" && this.age <= 30' }) // Find persons where the age is not set (returns persons with "age: null" though) db . persons . find ({ age : { $exists : false }}) // Find persons where the age is a number db . persons . find ({ age : { $type : "double" }}) // Find persons where the age is a string db . persons . find ({ age : { $type : "string" }}) // Find persons born 2010 or later, given that "born" is ISODate field db . persons . find ({ born : { $gte : ISODate ( "2010-01-01" ) }}) // Find persons born 2010 or later, given that "born" is NumberLong(unix_millis) db . persons . aggregate ([ { $match : { born : { $gte : ISODate ( "2005-01-01" ). getTime () }}}, { $project : { born : { $add : [ new Date ( 0 ), "$born" ] } }} ])
Q: How can I limit/sort my .find() results?
// Find the 5 most awesome things among "items" db . items . find ({}). sort ({ awesomeness : - 1 }). limit ( 5 ) // Find the 5 most awesome things among "items" (sort/limit order doesn't matter!) db . items . find ({}). limit ( 5 ). sort ({ awesomeness : - 1 })
NOTE: At first glance it might feel a little bit counter-intuitive that the order of sort/limit doesn't matter, but this is indeed the case and so you should think of this chain of calls as “building an iterator with certain properties”. If you really want to limit first, you can use an aggregation pipeline instead, i.e. db.items.aggregate([{ $limit: 5 }, { $sort: { awesomeness: -1 }}]) .
Q: How can I find documents where an embedded array of subdocuments contain at least one matching some criteria?
Use $elemMatch , like this:
// Assuming you have the following books collection: db . books . insert ({ title : "first" , reviews : [ { stars : 5 , comment : "good!!" }, { stars : 1 , comment : "omg, not good" } ] }) db . books . insert ({ title : "second" , reviews : [ { stars : 2 , comment : "mostly crap" } ] }) db . books . insert ({ title : "third" , reviews : [ { stars : 5 , comment : "love it" } ] }) db . books . insert ({ title : "fourth" , reviews : [ { stars : 5 , comment : "jk lol" } ] }) // Find books with at least 1 five-star review and with a comment other than "jk lol" db . books . find ({ reviews : { $elemMatch : { stars : 5 , comment : { $ne : "jk lol" }}}})
Q: How can I insert documents into a Mongo DB collection?
use my_database // Insert one document db . persons . insert ({ name : "John Doe" }) // Insert multiple documents db . persons . insertMany ( [{ name : "James" }, { name : "Ben" }] )
use my_database // Find the first document with a specified name and set born/gender fields on its db . ppl . updateOne ({ name : "Jake Weary" }, { $set : { born : 1990 , gender : "male" }}) // Find a document and set gender, and create the document if it doesn't exist db . ppl . updateOne ({ name : "Cait" }, { $set : { gender : "female" }}, { upsert : true }) // Find a document and append "actor" to the array field "occupations" db . ppl . updateOne ({ name : "Jake Weary" }, { $push : { occupations : "actor" }}) // Append 42 to array "nums" on all documents in "ppl" (create array if needed) db . ppl . updateMany ({}, { $push : { nums : 42 }}) // Remove last element from "nums" on all documents (do nothing on empty arrays) db . persons . updateMany ({}, { $pop : { nums : 1 }}) // Remove all instances of 42 from array "nums" on all documents in "ppl" db . ppl . updateMany ({}, { $pull : { nums : 42 }}) // Remove field "age" for all documents db . ppl . updateMany ({}, { $unset : { age : 1 }}) // Increase the foo_count and bar_count of all people db . ppl . updateMany ({}, { $inc : { foo_count : 1 , bar_count : 1 }}) // Rename a field from "name" to "fullname" in all "ppl" documents db . ppl . updateMany ({}, { $rename : { name : "fullname" }}) // Find first document with name: "Eva" and replace it with the specified document // NOTE: All fields except _id are dropped unless present in the replacement doc db . ppl . replaceOne ({ name : "Eva" }, { name : "Eva" , occupations : [ "dentist" ] })
NOTE: For some use cases .findAndModify() is a better fit.
Q: How can I delete documents in a Mongo DB collection?
// Delete the first document that matches the specified criteria db . items . deleteOne ({ _id : 123 }) // Delete all documents that match the specified criteria db . items . deleteMany ({ color : "green" })
NOTE: For some use cases .findAndDelete() is a better fit.
Q: How can I see all distinct values that are currently used for a particular field across a particular set of documents?
> use my_database // Show all distinct values used for "category" field across all "items" db . items . distinct ( "category" , {}) // Show all distinct values used for "nuance" across documents with "color": "green" db . items . distinct ( "nuance" , { color : "green" })
Q: How can I evaluate aggregate functions over a Mongo DB collection?
// Assuming documents like these: db . staff . insert ({ name : "Adam" , team : "sales" , age : 42 , type : "fulltime" }); db . staff . insert ({ name : "Ben" , team : "sales" , age : 33 , type : "fulltime" }); db . staff . insert ({ name : "Craig" , team : "engineering" , age : 29 , type : "fulltime" }); db . staff . insert ({ name : "David" , team : "hr" , age : 47 , type : "fulltime" }); db . staff . insert ({ name : "Eric" , team : "engineering" , age : 19 , type : "contractor" }); // Compute the number of non-full time employees in each team db . staff . aggregate ([ { $match : { type : { $ne : "fulltime" }}}, { $group : { _id : "$team" , teamCount : { $sum : 1 }}} ]) // Compute the average age of full time employees for each team (the oldest first) db . staff . aggregate ([ { $match : { type : "fulltime" }}, { $group : { _id : "$team" , averageAge : { $avg : "$age" }}}, { $sort : { averageAge : - 1 }} ]) // Compute the max and min age for each team db . staff . aggregate ([{ $group : { _id : "$team" , minAge : { $min : "$age" }, maxAge : { $max : "$age" } } }]) // Compute the max and min age for the company db . staff . aggregate ([{ $group : { _id : null , minAge : { $min : "$age" }, maxAge : { $max : "$age" } } }])
// Assuming a collection "events" with randomly timestamped documents, e.g: [... Array ( 20 )]. forEach ( _ => db . events . insert ({ when : new Date ( Date . now () * Math . random ()) }) ) // Compute how many "events" there were for each year db . events . aggregate ([ { $group : { _id :{ $year : "$when" }, count : { $sum : 1 } }}, { $sort : { _id : - 1 }} ]) // Assuming timestamps are "unix_millis" (Number) rather than ISODate(), e.g: [... Array ( 20 ). keys ()]. forEach ( i => db . log_items . insert ({ whenNum : Math . floor ( Date . now () * Math . random ()) }) ) // Compute how many "log_items" there were for each year, given that // whenNum is a field of type Number that stores millis since the Unix epoch db . log_items . aggregate ([ { $project : { whenDate : { $add : [ new Date ( 0 ), "$whenNum" ] }}}, { $group : { _id : { $year : "$whenDate" }, count :{ $sum : 1 }}}, { $sort : { _id : - 1 }} ]) // Finally, here is how to group by day instead, i.e. YYYY-MM-DD db . log_items . aggregate ([ { $project : { when : { $add : [ new Date ( 0 ), "$whenNum" ] }}}, { $group : { _id : { year : { $year : "$when" }, month : { $month : "$when" }, day : { $dayOfMonth : "$when" } }, firstWhen : { $first : "$when" }, count : { $sum : 1 } }}, { $sort : { "_id.year" : - 1 , "_id.month" : - 1 , "_id.day" : - 1 }}, { $project : { _id : 0 , date : { $dateToString : { format : "%Y-%m-%d" , date : "$firstWhen" }}, total : "$count" }} ])
You can also use $limit if you just need the first N results, or $skip if you don't care about the first N results.
Q: How can I “join” two collections in a query?
// Show "persons along with their favorite Pokémon" for persons that have one db . persons . aggregate ([ { $lookup : { from : "Pokémon" , localField : "favorite_Pokémon" , foreignField : "_id" , as : "favorite_Pokémon_doc" }}, { $unwind : "$favorite_Pokémon_doc" } ]). pretty ()
Since $lookup can run any query on the foreign collection, it can return more than one document and therefore the result field specified in the as: parameter ( favorite_Pokémon_doc in this case) will be an array of matched documents.
However, when you're doing $lookup with foreignField: "_id" you actually know that the resulting array will always have length 1 or 0. That is, if there was a favorite_Pokémon set, the favorite_Pokémon_doc field will be arrayed of 1 element that contains the corresponding Pokémon document. For this case, to unwind aggregation stage will convert the favorite_Pokémon_doc field from an array of 1 element to just a non-array field with that element as the value.
Further, if there was no favorite_Pokémon set (or it was set to null), favorite_Pokémon_doc will be an empty array. For that case, the $unwind aggregation stage will omit that person document completely (similar to how inner joins work in SQL).
If you prefer to leave such a document in the aggregation output, just pass the preserveNullAndEmptyArrays option to the $unwind stage, like this:
// Show persons (along with the favorite Pokémon IF they have one) db . persons . aggregate ([ { $lookup : { from : "Pokémon" , localField : "favorite_Pokémon" , foreignField : "_id" , as : "favorite_Pokémon_doc" }}, { $unwind : { path : "$favorite_Pokémon_doc" , preserveNullAndEmptyArrays : true }} ]). pretty ()
Q: How can I measure how much time a query took?
Enable the database profiler for all queries in the current database using db.setProfilingLevel(2) (you can also set this to 1 to have it log only queries above a certain millisecond threshold; useful for production tuning).
When profiling is enabled, each query is logged together with how long it took and various other metadata into a 1MB capped collection called system.profile . This collection can be queried using regular find() and aggregate() calls.
// Show execution time and other metadata for the last query or operation db . system . profile . find ({}). sort ({ ts : - 1 }). limit ( 1 ) // Show execution time etc for the last query, but include only some basic info db . system . profile . find ({}, { op : 1 , ns : 1 , query : 1 , docsExamined : 1 , nreturned : 1 , responseLength : 1 , millis : 1 , planSummary : 1 , ts : 1 , client : 1 , appName : 1 , user : 1 }). sort ({ ts : - 1 }). limit ( 1 )
Q: How can I create an index for a particular field?
// First create a collection with some documents db . nums . insertMany ([... Array ( 10000 ). keys ()]. map ( i => ({ indexed : i , unindexed : i }))) // Create index for the field called "indexed" db . nums . createIndex ({ indexed : 1 }) // Fast db . nums . find ({ indexed : 42 }) // Slow db . nums . find ({ unindexed : 42 })
Q: How can I see the existing indexes in a collection?
// List indexes along with index names db . nums . getIndexes () // List size in bytes of all indexes in "nums" collection db . nums . stats (). indexSizes
Q: Should I use “camelCase” or “snake_case” for Mongo DB collection and field names?
Since Mongo DB collection names are case sensitive, it's a good idea to keep the names lower case only (and then “snake_case” makes more sense). It also makes sense to use plural names for collections. Don't use a hyphen in collection names because you'll be forced to type db["foo-bar"].find() in mongo shell instead of the usual db.foobar.find() .

The abbreviated run of the track-oriented Ford Mustang Boss 302 was by design, says Ford Motor Co. COO Mark Fields.
Speaking April 6 at the Barrett-Jackson auction in Palm Beach, Fla., Fields told Speed TV the two-year availability helps protect the Mustang's value for collectors.
“We really want to preserve the value of those vehicles,” Fields said on Speed.
The Boss 302 was revealed at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca in 2010 ahead of the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance as a street-legal race car that saluted the original 1969 version.
“It's a race car you can put a license plate on,” the legendary Parnelli Jones said at the unveiling in 2010. He raced the original to victory in the 1970 Trans-Am season opener at Laguna Seca.
The Boss Mustang was available for the 2012 and 2013 model years. It ran a 5.0-liter V8 pumping out 444 hp and 380 lb-ft of torque. Like the 2014 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 revealed last month at the New York auto show, the Boss placed an emphasis on track-readiness and agility, rather than pure power. Neither the Boss nor the Z/28 is the highest-powered pony car offered by their brands—rather, each features intensive chassis refinements and weight-saving elements.
The Mustang employed lightweight 19-inch alloy racing wheels, manually adjustable shocks and struts, and firmer coil springs and suspension bushings at the corners. It was slotted between the Mustang GT and Shelby GT 500 in Ford's stable.
Fields, who was promoted from Ford's president of the Americas to chief operating officer on Dec. 1, 2012, is widely believed to be a strong candidate to succeed CEO Alan Mulally. Fields also told Speed that racing will continue to be a strong element of Ford's business plan.
“Motorsports is in our blood,” he said.
The Blue Oval exec also told the television network that Lincoln remains a priority, though being competitive could take five to 10 years.
“This is a journey,” he said.
Fields left the broadcast booth right before a rare 1953 Mercury Monterey four-door Woody station wagon was sold for $55,000, including buyer's fees.

Chan is a founding partner in the BAXI DC Racing team that dominated the LMP3 class of the Asian Le Mans Series in the 2015/16 season.
Drivers Ho-Pin Tung, team co-owner David Cheng and France's Thomas Laurent drove a Ligier JS P3 to four wins out of four to easily claim the class title.
On Friday, Sparkle Roll Group-Jackie Chan DC Racing, which has entered the FIA World Endurance Championship, was also announced in the 60-car entrylist for this year's 24 Hours of Le Mans.
The team will campaign an Alpine A460-Nissan in LMP2, again with Cheng and Tung as two of the drivers in the lineup.
Thus Chan joins the likes of Steve McQueen, Paul Newman and more recently, Patrick Dempsey, as a film and TV star to become a participant in the French around-the-clock classic.
Said Chan: “Following a great performance by our team in the Asian Le Mans Series, I am happy that we will have the privilege to race in the WEC, and of course the 84th edition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.”
The 61-year-old Chan, who starred in the Rush Hour franchise alongside Chris Tucker and the 2010 remake of The Karate Kid with Jaden Smith, is a known motorhead and racing fanatic.
But his film roles stretch as far back as being a martial arts expert and stuntman in early '70s Bruce Lee classics such as Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon. Chan has even starred in a racing movie – 1995's Thunderbolt.
“I will support Chinese motorsport and driver development,” said Chan, “so I created the team together with David Cheng.
“[Now] I look forward to personally attending this year's Le Mans 24 hour race to support my team and my compatriot drivers David Cheng and Ho-Pin Tung.
“See you there!”
Another year, another serving of Call of Duty zombies to eviscerate. Following last year's Zombies in Spaceland update for Infinite Warfare, this instalment takes you to a rave in the woods. Except instead of ravers, there are zombie ravers, and instead of dancing, they are trying to eat you, and instead of trying to eat them back, you're shooting them, or hacking them with melee weapons.
As the below trailer demonstrates, the Rave in the Redwoods DLC is sending up the 1990s, and boy does it have an awkward time doing it. Still, this kind of tongue-in-cheek nostalgia is pretty common nowadays (I see you, Far Cry: Blood Dragon), and what does it matter anyway when there are zombies to kill?
The update is coming out for PS4 later this month. As for the rest of us, who knows? When the bosses at Sony say so, I suppose.
Full Control's turn based strategy game Space Hulk launches today on PS Vita and also PS3 in North and South America digitally via the PlayStation Network.
In Space Hulk you play as a small squad of fearless Space Marine Terminators who attempt to reclaim their honor by mounting an assault on a derelict space hulk infested by hordes of vicious tyranid Genestealers.
We have captured new screenshots and the first gameplay videos with the intro and the missions “Beachhead”, “Cut Off” and “Ambush” from the “Boarding The Sin Of Damnation” Mission.

The University of Iowa's student newspaper has announced the discovery of a special privilege which intelligent people acquire as an accident of birth. This new privilege — called “cognitive privilege” — functions in essentially the same way as white privilege.
The Daily Iowan revealed the discovery of this new privilege earlier this week.
Garden-variety white privilege “is an important topic that deserves a public discussion,” the op-ed on “cognitive privilege” explains, but it is also “prudent to at least mention the wider concept contained therein: that of privilege itself.”
Privilege in general is “the receipt of certain benefits wholly through accident of birth and it is “undeniable that privilege itself is a reality,” the student newspaper explains.
As with skin color and much else, Daily Iowan author Dan Williams argues, people have no control over how smart they are. Life is a huge cosmic lottery full of winners and losers.
Cognitive privilege is one of “many kinds of privilege besides white privilege.”

Ed Miliband is to blame for Johann Lamont quitting as leader of the Scottish Labour Party, Alex Salmond has claimed.
Scotland's First Minister said "Labour's meltdown in Scotland has been created by Labour in London."
Ms Lamont resigned on Friday with a stinging attack on her colleagues at Westminster who she said had made her position "untenable".
Scottish Labour is due to set out plans for electing a new leader later.
The party's executive committee will meet to decide the timetable. It has stressed the decision will be taken in Scotland not London.
In her resignation letter, Ms Lamont said she was standing down to enable the party to have a "real discussion" about its future.
She said senior members of the party had "questioned" her place and she was taking herself "out of the equation" so it could decide the best way forward.
In an earlier interview with the Daily Record, Ms Lamont had accused the UK party of treating Scotland like a "branch office" and branded some of her Westminster colleagues as "dinosaurs".
Mr Salmond, who announced after the No vote in the Scottish independence referendum that he will stand down next month, has called on the UK Labour leader to respond to Ms Lamont's claims.
Image copyright PA Image caption Mr Salmond said Mr Miliband was responsible for the meltdown of Labour in Scotland
He said: "We have the extraordinary situation that an outgoing leader has admitted that Scottish Labour is just a 'branch office' controlled by London - in other words the Scottish Labour Party is a fiction.
"The person responsible for that, and for making Johann Lamont's position 'untenable', as she herself put it, is Ed Miliband.
"Mr Miliband should be answering questions about why Labour in Scotland is run as an extension of his Westminster office, and why he has effectively forced the resignation of a Labour leader in Scotland."
He added: "He should be making a statement about his responsibility for the meltdown of Labour in Scotland."
Leadership contenders
Responding to Ms Lamont's resignation, Mr Miliband said she had "led the Scottish Labour Party with determination" and deserved "significant credit" for the successful "No" vote in the Scottish referendum campaign in September.
He added: "She campaigned the length and breadth of Scotland making the case for social justice within the United Kingdom."
The timetable for choosing a new leader will be set out soon.
In the meantime, deputy leader Anas Sarwar is in charge and an MSP will be chosen to stand in for Ms Lamont at Holyrood.
Mr Sarwar is among those already being linked to the leadership role. Former prime minister Gordon Brown and fellow MP Jim Murphy have also been suggested as contenders for the job.
We are delighted to confirm that midfielder Luke Murphy has signed a new four-year deal with the club.
Murphy, whose contract was due to expire next summer, has shown a significant commitment to the club by taking a considerable wage reduction to sign until 2019.
The midfielder recently picked up a knee injury which looks set to rule him out for pre-season, but the club believes he has already proved his worth on the pitch and he will undergo the necessary treatment to ensure a speedy recovery.
The 25-year-old, a nominee for last season's Player of the Year award, joined from Crewe Alexandra in 2013 and since has established himself as a key figure at Elland Road with 72 United appearances to his name.
2014/15 saw him play a starring role in the side's resurgence during the second half of the campaign, with crucial goals against Birmingham, Bournemouth and Reading only underling his value to the team.
Murphy said: “There wasn't really much to think about – I'm really happy here.
“I've obviously had ups and downs but towards the end of last season I really started to feel at home. The atmosphere in pre-season is really positive.
“I started to feel as though I was playing my best football here and hopefully that can continue.
“I want to repay the faith shown in me by performing on the pitch.
“Hopefully I'll be able to do that in the next four seasons and get this club back to where it belongs in the Premier League.
“The signings that have come in already this summer have shown real intent of what we're about and what we're hoping to achieve in the near future.”
Head coach Uwe Rosler added: “I'm a big admirer of Luke, I've said that a few times. He finished the season very strong and we have high hopes for him this season.
“A lot of people don't see this side but Mr Cellino has stuck by a player who is basically injured and going into the last year of his contract. That is a big statement from the owner.
“He proved his worth to the club before and we've offered him a new contract. That's the way football should work.
“I'm very happy that he's signed and I'm looking forward to working with him very much.
“It's a real statement by the player and the club, and that augurs well for a positive future for both parties.”
Pokémon life lesson: You can change; you're never stuck as who you are today.This lesson is true for any Pokémon who evolves, or even levels up really, but it's especially true for Feebas to Milotic. * JocelynCD makes the case here that the transformation from these two Pokémon is especially similar to the transformation for a transgendered person (h/t :devfeare909).I wanted to add my own take on it: these Pokémon were introduced in Gen3, as was Deoxys, the DNA Pokémon ('Deoxy"riboNucleic Acid). There is such a thing as the Mitotic phase in cell replication where the cell splits into two identical copies, possibly a reference to the two 'selves' that are both real and achievable by a trans person.There are more posters!Pokémon copyright Nintendo/Gamefreak/The Pokémon Company International, apparently.
Starting Friday, Joyce Lewis and her family will lose $44 from their monthly food stamp benefits.
The food stamps buy a lot of economical rice-based meals for the family -- four adults and a grandson who live with Lewis in Spring Hill, Florida.
Occasionally, when her grocery store is running a deal, Lewis indulges the family with spare ribs or chicken.
The benefit -- totaling $800 for four adults -- never lasts Lewis and her family a full month.
"When I get to the end, we always run out. I try to go to all the food pantries," Lewis said.
Food stamp benefits will be trimmed by $5 billion starting Friday, when a temporary bump-up enacted during the recession expires. Millions of families will be affected.
Related: Cut to food stamps coming Friday
Lewis, 55, is worried because the cuts are coming at a bad time. Among other things, a second grandchild is due in January.
She is also fighting the bank from foreclosing on her home.
And even though she doesn't smoke, Lewis suffers from emphysema, which prevents her from working.
Lewis attributes the emphysema to a lifetime of bartending in smoke-filled nonprofit social clubs, such as Elks and Moose lodges.
Her adult daughters who live with her aren't in a position to work -- one is a new mom, and another is due to give birth soon.
The low point came this summer, when she didn't have enough to pay the full electricity bill. Lewis needs power to run her breathing machine to treat her illness. So she pawned her wedding ring for $325.
A few weeks ago, she started getting disability payments for her disease. She promptly used it to get back her ring for $487 before it was sold.
"That was $162 I paid in interest to keep the lights on and put food on the table," Lewis said.

Enrollment in food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, has soared.
Some 47.6 million people, or nearly 15% of the population, get them, according to September federal data. That compares to 26.3 million, or 8.7% of the population, in 2007. The average benefit per person is $133.19 a month.
For families who rely on food stamps, it means a lot of planning and tough choices.
Hugh Sewell, 54, has been on food stamps for two years. He gets the maximum allowed for his family of three -- $526 a month. The benefits will likely be cut by $29 to $497, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
That would be tough, Sewell says. The first time the family got food stamps, after he lost his job in 2010, they blew through the allotment halfway through the month.
After that, the Sewells started making detailed budgets, meal plans and shopping lists.
"We buy a lot of beans, rice and potatoes," said Sewell, who lives in Philadelphia. "Towards the end of the month, you're eating all the box stuff, and a lot more pasta with sauce."

Last month, Sewell landed a job as an audio technician.
The job paid $12 an hour, a lot less than the $25 he used to make before he was laid off.
Sewell asked his employer to lower his wages to $9 an hour instead.
Why? He did the math and found that $12 an hour was just enough to cause a reduction in his government benefits, and could cost him and his family its Medicaid coverage for health care.
At the same time, the income from $12 an hour would not be enough to pay his bills, including the $900 a month he would have to pay for health insurance for his family.
Sewell is hoping to find a job that pays enough to allow his family to get off government assistance.
Porsche has announced that its Mission E concept vehicle could be ready for production as early as 2019, challenging the likes of the Tesla Model S in the EV market.
The Mission E concept will have a starting price tag between $80,000 to $90,000. The all-electric four-dour sports sedan with dual electric motors will be able to reach a top speed of 155 mph and boasts a 0-60 time in under 3.5 seconds.
Similarly, Tesla's Model S 100D is also all-wheel drive and can reach a top speed of 155 mph, with starting price of roughly $80,000.
The Verge reported that Porsche is joining the likes of several other outspoken vehicle groups. BMW Group, among many others, recently said that it had committed to a fully electrified lineup.
While others have made extensive commitments to electric vehicle development, Porsche's Mission E seems to be among the vehicles that could threaten the Model S the most.
As a premier luxury EV, the Mission E is comparable in price to Tesla's Model S 100D but with better acceleration. Model S 100D is capable of 0-60 in 4.1 seconds. Vehicle range for the Mission E has been reported to be close to 310 miles per single charge, also comparable to Model S 100D's 335-mile range.
The Mission E's potential to rival the Model S is significant, but the concept development is a departure from parent company Volkswagen's recent statements about diesel vehicles.
CEO Matthias Mueller said the company did not consider Tesla a threat and would continue to forge ahead with clean diesel technology.
“The diesels we are offering today are clean. They comply with the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure requirements and they meet the requirements and needs of our customers,” he said.
The Mission E may one day challenge the Tesla Model S, but for now, Elon Musk's electric car company reins as a leader in the luxury EV market.
The co-founder of the Toronto Black Lives Matter chapter not only believes white people are genetically inferior to black peoples, but that blacks could “literally wipe out the white race” if they only “had the power to” do it.
Yusra Khogali's racist rant, posted on Facebook in late 2015 and since deleted, recently gained renewed attention after she called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau a “white supremacist terrorist,” as reported by Mediaite.
Black Lives Matter co-founder appears to label white people ‘defects' | News | Toronto Sun https://t.co/1iSeoqBQM7 — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 13, 2017
The original Facebook rant read, in part:
“Whiteness is not humxness (gender-neutral alternative spelling). In fact, white skin is sub-humxn. All phenotypes exist within the black family and white [people] are a genetic defect of blackness.” “White [people] are recessive genetic defects. This is factual.”
The Toronto Sun posted a screenshot of the complete post, which also reads:
“white ppl need white supremacy as a mechanism to protect their survival as a people because all they can do is produce themselves. black ppl simply through their dominant genes can literally wipe out the white race if we had the power to.”
In Khogali's mind, it's all about the amount of melanin in the skin.
“Melanin enables black skin to capture light and hold it in its memory mode which reveals that blackness converts light into knowledge. Melanin directly communicates with cosmic energy.”
During a Toronto protest in February, she ranted against Trudeau, the Province of Quebec, and President Trump, calling him a “white supremacist coward.”
Incidentally, in early 2016, according to the Toronto Sun, Khogali tweeted: “Plz Allah give me strength to not cuss/kill these men and white folks out here today. Plz plz plz.”
So far, unlike her Facebook posts, it appears that Khogali's race-related diatribes are not going away.
Mary C. Willingham, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill instructor whose data about the poor reading skills of some college athletes became a new flashpoint in a long-running academic-fraud scandal at the university, is resigning at the end of the semester, two North Carolina newspapers reported.
Ms. Willingham confirmed her resignation in an email to the News & Observer, in Raleigh, but said she could not provide details until after she had posted grades for her students and had talked with her lawyers and human-resources officials at Chapel Hill.
She told The Herald-Sun, in Durham, that she had made her decision after an hourlong meeting with Chapel Hill's chancellor had convinced her that she and the university had “irreconcilable differences.” She said her work environment was “unpleasant, the UNC fanatics are hostile, and I can see that it will not get better any time soon.”
An associate of Ms. Willingham's told the News & Observer that the researcher had characterized her meeting with the chancellor, Carol L. Folt, as largely “a tongue lashing” in which she was berated for her comments about the scandal. Ms. Folt could not be reached for comment, but Joel Curran, the university's vice chancellor for communications and public affairs, said the meeting had not been antagonistic. He said Ms. Folt had not sought Ms. Willingham's resignation or threatened to fire her.
In recent weeks, administrators at Chapel Hill have harshly criticized Ms. Willingham's research methods and disagreed with her findings. They also suspended her work and restricted the conditions under which she could resume it, steps that some scholars said looked vindictive and were likely to have a “chilling effect” on any scholarly work that could make the university look bad.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new and virulent strain of adenovirus, which frequently causes the common cold, has spread in parts of the United States, killing 10 people and putting dozens into hospitals, U.S. health officials said on Thursday.

REUTERS/Handout
A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report detailed cases of people ill since May 2006 with a strain of the virus called adenovirus 14 in New York, Oregon, Washington state and Texas.
“Whether you're a healthy young adult, an infant or an elderly person, this virus can cause severe respiratory disease at any age,” said John Su, who investigates infectious diseases for the CDC and contributed to the report.
Two of the 10 people who have died from the new strain were infants, Su said. The CDC report said about 140 people have been sickened by the virus and more than 50 hospitalized, including 24 admitted to intensive care units.
Adenoviruses frequently cause acute upper respiratory tract infections like the common cold, but also can cause other illnesses including inflammation of the stomach and intestines, pink eye, bladder infection and rashes.
Colds caused by adenoviruses can be very severe in the very young and the very old as well as in certain other people, like those with compromised immune systems.
“For most everybody else, it causes a mild illness, you get over it, life goes on,” Su said in a telephone interview.
“What makes this particular adenovirus a little different is that it has the capability of making healthy young adults severely ill. And that's unusual for an adenovirus, and that's why it's got our attention,” Su added.
It is possible people outside these four states have been sickened by the new strain of the virus, Su said.
DIMENSION OF THE PROBLEM
Dr. William Schaffner, a spokesman for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said an important next step is for public health officials to determine the dimension of the problem.
“I think this is a big alert to those of us in infectious diseases and public health to gather the appropriate specimens and see how widely distributed this virus is,” said Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee.
The first case described in the report was that of an infant girl in New York City who died in May 2006.
The report also described illnesses from the virus at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.
A 19-year-old female recruit at the base died from the virus. Seven other people died in Oregon, including an infant. And a patient with AIDS died in Washington state.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said adenoviruses are notorious for spreading illness particularly among military recruits placed in close quarters.
“The cases described in this report are unusual because they suggest the emergence of a new and virulent Ad14 (adenovirus 14) variant that has spread within the United States,” according to the CDC report.
There are 51 types of adenoviruses, the CDC report said.
While the pictures aren't great, they are good enough to tell me that I should be out there looking at this car instead of writing it up. Circumstances don't allow that; hoping one of you readers picks this one up in a hurry! Located in Henderson, North Carolina, this original-appearing Triumph is advertised here on craigslist. The price is a low $2,500 or best offer, and the car is said to have a good engine, transmission and tires. I own two TR6's already; a third would be truly redundant! Places to check on the car if you are interested are the rear trailing arm mounts on the frame, the differential mounts, and of course floors and sills. The car happens to be in the same town as one of the best Triumph specialty repair shops around, so if it needs any of those things, you could just drop it off after purchase if you don't want to do the work yourself. Let us know if you pick up this diamond in the rough!

Name: Chris Kelly
Original Hometown: Montreal
Job: Kelly is a television writer who has done everything from late talks shows like Late Night With David Letterman to sitcoms like Grounded for Life. Most recently, he writes for Real Time with Bill Maher.
How did you get into television writing?
My father is a comedy writer. He was an editor at the National Lampoon and then he wrote children's television. So that's what I wanted to do.
Since Bill Maher and David Letterman are obviously very different from sitcoms, what's the most challenging part about going between different styles?
10 or 20 years ago, if you worked in late night, everyone wrote spec scripts to get into sitcoms. What your agent wanted you to do was get out of late night and get into this other job. It wasn't anything anyone questioned back then: You wanted to be in LA and you wanted to write sitcoms. I'm not sure that's true anymore. But that was the pattern I followed.
Which one is more rewarding, late night or sitcoms?
I go back and forth. When you're writing late night you're really only writing one voice — your host's voice. When you're writing sitcoms, you're working with a bunch of different voices. When I'm not doing it, I miss it, and when I'm doing if it's exhausting.
Since Bill Maher has a particularly distinctive voice, do you find it challenging to write in?
Bill will confess that his monologue is like Johnny Carson's. Bill did The Tonight Show I think more than 30 times. When Bill was a young man, he used to watch the Tonight Show with a tape recorder and then write the monologue out by hand to get a feeling for the rhythm of it. I was also watching Late Night and I know other people who've done the same thing. You really do follow a voice like that until you internalize it.
We're a tiny staff, so we all do everything. I really enjoy the monologue, just because I've been doing it for so long now that it's like an exercise. It's funny to get up and go, “Okay I have two hours, I'm going to write 25 jokes.”
Where do you find news for the monologues? Do you have preferred sources?
Back at Letterman, everyone's office had the assistants going around at the beginning of the day and by the time you got in, there was a New York Times, a Daily News, and the New York Post at your door, and you would go through those. But that's changed so much now.
Our show is different, because we do have to follow politics, but there are a bunch of sites where you just read the story and say, “oh good that's the monologue tonight. Someone got arrested in a fast food restaurant, having sex with a quarter pounder.” You try to work around those stories, but you see it in the same way. I'm not sure what others use, but I go the The Week for short monologue premises, and Slate. The Daily Beast is good for quickly going, “those are the ten stories.”
When there's a guest who you know is going to tangle with him, how do you handle that?
You don't want Bill to be surprised. The producers are proud of it not being like putting bugs in a jar, but you do want to have two different sides. We bend over backwards to try to get conservative guests. Two years ago, Ben Affleck wanted to come on because he wanted to challenge Bill about generalizations about muslims. So we knew something was going to happen.
So what's a typical writing cycle like? How long do you spend on a script?
We're in the office every day. It's a weekly show, which is much easier than when it was a nightly show. We work on editorial in the beginning of the week, our middle of the show desk piece in the middle of the week, and we concentrate on new things and the monologue at the end of the week. All that time, Bill is editing it, assembling it, and calling on more things.
What's the most challenging part of your job?
With a daily show, it's the grind of it. With a weekly show, you want it to be really good. It's the difference between a monologue and weekend update. That's changed, too — there are so many late night shows and political shows that you look at Weekend Update now and you go, “you've had all week, every single one of your jokes should be good.” Whereas if you watch a nightly show and the monologue has two great jokes in it, you think that's a successful monologue.
Was working at Letterman very different from Bill Maher?
The Letterman room was different from any other show on TV. There really wasn't a room, everyone was in their own offices. You were given your assignments and you turned them in. In the general, there was very little collaboration.

I like both things. In a sitcom room, you might write a script a year — two if you're lucky — and the rest of it is sitting in a room. It can be really fun and exhausting.
What advice would you give a young writer?
Right now, it's a terrific time to be starting out because if you want to write topical jokes, just tweet them. It used to be difficult. One of the most frustrating things is getting in if you didn't happen to be smart enough to be related to someone. You would have to write submissions and drop them off, and it was legally tricky for people to read them. Now if you write humor, you can tweet it and it will get seen. The nature of Twitter too, is you can show very clearly not only that you can write jokes, but that you can write a lot of jokes.
Are you working on anything besides Bill Maher at the moment?
I just finished up on this sitcom called The Soul Man that I enjoyed a lot. I was working with some guys who I've worked with for decades, and we had a terrifically talented cast. There are times when you write a joke for an actor and you watch them perform it and you go, ‘I guess I'm some sort of god!' I guess there are people who see that and they want to be super gods and they also want to have everyone do everything they say. There's this actress on The Soul Man named Niecey Nash. Did you ever see Getting On on HBO?
I saw her in Scream Queens, she was hilarious.
She's extraordinary! So is the idea that you're writing things that Niecy Nash might say. And there are all these other good things about the project. I wrote on a sitcom called Cavemen and people didn't like it very much.
When you're part of a show that's not received well, how do you keep that from getting to you?
The stages of grief when your show is dying are the same everywhere. The first stage is you tell yourself that your ratings are really good in certain categories. Someone will come in the room and will come in and tell everyone else it doesn't matter, we're killing with men 18-25, as opposed to the show that was in the tie slot last year.
Then your next stage of grief is the network doesn't have anything else. So it doesn't matter how badly you're doing, they're going to stay with you. Then the next stage is there's an executive at the network who loves you, so it doesn't matter that the ratings are bad, they still love you. Then the fourth stage is that you believe some other network is going to pick you up.
Has your style changed at all over the course of your career?
I do get lost in the house style. I think everyone does wherever they're working. Especially when they're in a late night show writing for one person, you'll run into Letterman writers and they'll all say certain things alike. I think that's true in any show, especially where you're writing for one host.
Is there a particular joke that you wrote recently that it's one of your favorites? Or do you write so many that they're not fresh in your mind?
They really aren't. My problem right now is looking at them and going, “I like this one so much — did I write it before?”
It must be hard with topics you return to so regularly.
You write them until they're exhausted. We do a lot of Trump these days, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio —an election year is always the most fun and the easiest. It's between those when you can find yourself taking in the wind a little bit and you can open up a day of jokes you wrote five years ago and read them and think “I sort of think I can remember what we were mad about.”
What are you watching right now?
Right now my favorite show would have to be Crazy Ex Girlfriend, but you know, Game of Thrones isn't on right now. Getting On was great and Veep. Consumer Reports right now says that when you go out and buy a car now, they're all pretty good. It's the same thing. You're going to be more surprised turning on the TV and seeing something really shitty. I don't think that was true even 10 years ago.
Has it surprised you? Or did you see it happening?
It was gradually and then it was all of a sudden. I remember the first time I was working on a lot and someone brought over a tape of another show that some guys I knew were working on and it was called Freaks and Geeks. We watched that show and went, “Wow. That's pretty good.” The description made it sound like any other show, but when you saw it the levels and subtlety and darkness and doing that in 21 minutes. Whenever someone does something like that and it's even a little bit successful, it's a challenge for everyone else.

If I answer this question, please don't tell my wife! You see, on board the International Space Station (ISS) we were scheduled to "clean" our home every Saturday morning. Since I was the only U.S. Astronaut living on ISS at that time (June-November 2007), I was responsible for cleaning the entire US segment. If she finds out I actuallycleaning, it could spell "doom" for me here in Houston!While the ISS Systems keep things reasonably clean automatically by sucking up all type of nastiness into awaiting HEPA filters, Astronauts clean the ISS for between 2 and 4 hours (per the schedule) every Saturday morning. I have to be brutally honest here and tell you that I did it intime than that... mostly because I didn't do all of the myriad of tasks the ground requested.For example, every Saturday we were to wipe down all handrails (HR) and ATUs (communication panels, known as audio-telecommunication units) on ISS, and a bunch of other stuff. I wiped them down, but not every Saturday. I only did it right before or right after a visiting crew was coming or had been aboard. My reasons were --at least in my mind-- quite valid. You see, disinfectant wipes are a consumable, i.e., you can use them up. Consumables cost money and the more you consume, the more frequently they must be replenished through a cargo ship delivery to space. With cargo mass being quite precious (not to mention expensive), I figured I was helping the program save money by reducing the consumption of consumables like disinfectant wipes and thus increasing the ability to send, say..., more food, or toilet wipes, for example (no, they are not the same... we used "Huggies" in the toilet).Also, it made no sense to me to disinfect those things when 10 minutes later, Oleg or Fyodor or myself would sail through the ISS like always, grabbing HRs and ATUs, putting our grubby little hands all over everything. So I treated it much like I might here on earth. Before and after visitors, I gave the place a thorough cleaning. But most Saturdays, it was a less focused effort. I'm sure after providing this answer, the folks in Mission Control will be pretty pissed, but no one died or got sick because of it!Vacuuming of filters and vents, I took more seriously. These places actually accumulated much "gunk" leading to the possibility of reduced airflow in our very important ventilation system. Plus, it was easy to see progress as the powerful suction of the ISS vacuum cleaner provided "instant gratification" to my efforts. It was quite satisfying for me to see lint, dust and 12-15" strands of Suni William's, Barb Morgan's, and Tracy Caldwell-Dyson's hair disappear into the vacuum's bag (also a consumable!). I would vacuum up their hair every Saturday for the entire 5 months I lived aboard the ISS!The key to living and working (and surviving) in outer space is to "take care of your stuff." If you and your crew mates are diligent, and form good habits about taking care of the things that are your responsibility, all will be well. I remember arriving back at ISS with the crew of STS-131 and observing the state of cleanliness and organization of the ISS Expedition 22/23 crews. I told T. J. Creamer that if he'd give me about an hour, I could have the place looking "shipshape!" I don't think he appreciated that too much!Keep lookin' up... keep takin' care of your stuff and keep orderin' my new book, The Ordinary Spaceman! Do it here easily at. And do it early and often!
Last week, opposition groups in Syria claimed that between 300 and 1,700 people were killed in a chemical weapons attack outside Damascus, crossing what US President Barack Obama has dubbed his ‘red line'. The use of chemical weapons has not yet been confirmed by UN inspectors (bringing back uncomfortable memories of the 2003 intervention in Iraq), though it now seems likely there will be some form of Western military response. The civil war in Syria has been raging for over two years now, with more than 100,000 killed and millions displaced from their homes, yet the UN Security Council is locked in a stalemate between the US, UK and France, who support intervention, and China and Russia, who oppose it and are likely to block any proposed resolution.
Last year, when we discussed the situation in Syria, Elia sent in the following comment:
If a state fails to protect its citizens, either because it is unwilling or unable… it loses its right to sovereignty. How many Srebrenicas do we need to have? Unilateral military action would undermine the international order, but can political stalemate prevent us from intervening in beyond-the-pale situations like this? We need more decisive action. The least we can do is to help the opposition to defend themselves.
Earlier this year, when we interviewed Ria Oomen-Ruijten, a Dutch MEP with the Centre-Right, we asked her if she agreed with Elia about intervention. At that time, the discussion was focused on the possibility of Western governments supplying weapons to the rebels, so what did she think?
I totally agree with Elia. Because, seeing that in Syria millions of people have been displaced and more than 70'000 citizens have already been killed in this war, we can't any longer only watch [and promise them weapons] but we really have to do something. At the same time, everybody has to know that if the regime falls then we really need democratic forces which will install the rule of law and guarantee all the individual and collective rights of the citizens of Syria. And, if I look at some parts of the opposition, not everybody has the same aim. So, simply saying: ‘Now we are going to give everyone arms to get rid of the regime' is too simple an answer. Yet, we can't neglect what is happening any longer. I, personally, cannot watch this anymore. I was in a refugee camp and a Syrian man asked me when will Europeans, and also the international community, stop this killing machine. And I couldn't give him an answer…
We also spoke to María Muñiz de Urquiza a Spanish MEP from the Social Democrats, to get her response to Elia's comment:
I think that the European Union can help the opposition, but not necessarily by delivering arms. I think that there are other ways, for example, by helping the population of the liberated territories through aid programmes. But [sending weapons] to a dispersed opposition in such a violent conflict is very dangerous. In any case, we need a resolution or an authorisation by the UN Security Council before making any military intervention.
Finally, following the Egyptian coup last month we had a comment sent in from David, who cautioned that European countries should “stay neutral” in this sort of conflicts and “only involve ourselves if there is a threat of genocide”. We took this comment to Ivo Vajgl, an MEP with the Liberal Democrats and former Slovenian Foreign Minister, to see how he would respond:

Jim Wilson, the peripatetic, profane, pipe-smoking volunteer for Mitt Romney whose pickup truck was destroyed in a fire last week, has a new set of wheels, donated by the campaign to which he has devoted a year of his life.
Mr. Romney himself presented Mr. Wilson, a 70-year-old Virginian, with a replacement vehicle during an event in Sterling, Va., on Wednesday, ensuring that Mr. Wilson can keep popping up at campaign stops in a truck festooned with dozens of giant “Romney for President” posters and stickers.
The campaign covered the $13,900 cost of the truck, a 2003 Chevy Silverado that is such a vast improvement over Mr. Wilson's previous vehicle, he said in an interview, “that I feel guilty smoking in it. It's so clean I felt I had to take my shoes off before getting in.”
Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
Mr. Wilson, an anti-Obama Republican and former life insurance salesman, had devoted himself with the single-mindedness of a college-age groupie to following Mr. Romney around the country in a beat-up 1998 GMC, logging 40,000 miles, visiting 15 states and attending 150 campaign events.
In the process, Mr. Wilson has brought a humanizing (and humorous) dimension to a candidacy that has sometimes struggled to connect with ordinary voters. He has a penchant for Viagra jokes, carries a three-inch fishing knife and hugs every woman he meets.
Then, last week, his rolling Romney billboard caught fire on a Pennsylvania highway. The cause remains unknown, but the truck was destroyed.
As Mr. Wilson began hunting for a replacement, he received a call from an aide to Mr. Romney. The campaign wanted to pay for the new truck. Ryan Williams, a spokesman for Mr. Romney, said the campaign “wanted to help him fulfill his commitment to return to the trail as soon as possible.”
When Mr. Romney officially presented Mr. Wilson with the truck Tuesday evening, he also handed over a fire extinguisher. “Look what I got for you, Wilson,” Mr. Romney said. “Just in case!”
Mr. Wilson, hoisting the extinguisher over his head, declared: “That's the trophy! We're safe at last.”

MEXICO CITY — Nearly every day in El Salvador, police have what they call “enfrentamientos” — or confrontations — with the powerful street gangs that blanket the country. Another word for this is “shootout.”
[In El Salvador, security forces are carrying out a growing number of the killings in the gang war]
So the announcement last week by the director of the National Civil Police, Howard Cotto, that police have done this 459 times so far this year points to the severity of the conflict between the gangs and the state. In those confrontations, 424 alleged gang members were killed, Cotto said at a news conference.
The website Insight Crime, which tracks security issues in Latin America, pointed out that this means El Salvador's authorities are clashing with criminal groups more often than in Mexico, which is still engulfed in a drug war, and Colombia, whose half-century-long civil war is ending — despite those countries having far larger populations.
One notable thing about the “enfrentamientos” statistic is that many people in El Salvador view this term with deep suspicion. From human rights officials to average citizens, many people doubt whether an exchange of fire took place — and wonder whether police officers simply killed their enemy.
Last year, on the San Blas farm south of the capital, eight “gang members” died in a what police described as a shootout. Investigative reporting by the news site El Faro cast doubt on those statements, and the attorney general's office subsequently brought charges against several police officers for extrajudicial execution.
The government of President Salvador Sánchez Céren has pursued a fierce crackdown on gangs over the past two years, imposing emergency measures and calling up soldiers and police into the fight. Although those measures are often popular in gang-weary El Salvador — gangs are responsible for killings, kidnapping and vast amounts of extortion. Human rights workers have repeatedly raised warnings about abuses by authorities as they carry out their operations and target gang members.
The homicide rate has fallen from its height in 2015. Still, there have been more than 4,400 murders so far this year, down by about 1,000 from last year's total at this time.

With all the recent hoopla about California's record-low unemployment rate and the heady prospect of its becoming No. 5 in global economic rankings, it is easy to lose sight of another salient fact: It is the nation's most poverty-stricken state.
Related Articles Walters: California, wealthy districts like Anna Eshoo's are in crosshairs of federal tax reform

Walters: Democrats need California voters to … vote
Walters: Kevin Faulconer's ‘No' will hurt the state's GOP So says the U.S. Census Bureau in its “supplemental measure” of poverty that is a far more accurate than the traditional measure because it takes into account not only income, but living costs.
By the measure, just over 20 percent of Californians are living in poverty. The Public Policy Institute of California has devised its own measure, similar to the Census Bureau's, that not only validates the 20 percent figure, but tells us that another 20 percent of Californians are in “near-poverty,” which means they struggle to pay for food, shelter and other necessities of life.
Another indicator of California's impoverishment is that more than a third of its 39 million residents are enrolled in Medi-Cal, the state-federal program of medical care for the poor. And that doesn't count a few million more who cannot legally obtain Medi-Cal coverage because they are undocumented immigrants.
Finally, 60 percent of California's 6 million K-12 students are either “English-learners” or come from poor families, thus qualifying their schools for additional state support aimed at improving their academic achievements.
Two new reports not only underscore California's economic stratification, but point to its underlying factors.
Like our Facebook page for more conversation and news coverage from the Bay Area and beyond.
One comes from the Tax Foundation and delves into the sharp differences in cost-of-living by comparing what $100 buys in each state.
It would have $115 in relative purchasing power in Mississippi, which has the nation's lowest overall living costs, but just $84 in Hawaii, which has the highest. California, unfortunately, is much closer to Hawaii than to Mississippi at $88, the 47th highest.
Our soaring housing costs are one factor. It's not unusual for a low-income family to pay more than 50 percent of its income for housing, if it can find it. California has very high automotive fuel prices and utility rates, which weigh heavily on the state's poor, particularly the so-called “working poor” who don't qualify for many public benefits.
The second new report comes from Wallet Hub, a personal economics website, which tapped a variety of data, such as high school graduation rates and college degree holders, to determine the education levels of the nation's 150 largest metropolitan areas.
Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, is No. 1 and university communities are generally bunched near the top, but the San Jose area, the seat of California's high-tech industry, is No. 3 and the San Francisco-Oakland region is No. 8.
Check out our editorial cartoons
on Flipboard.
Other California metropolitan areas string out below, but the most startling revelation is that the bottom 10 – the nation's least educated communities – include five from California, Salinas (144), Fresno (145), Modesto (146), Bakersfield (147) and Visalia-Porterville (148).
If one takes the Wallet Hub rankings for California and places them next to a chart of personal incomes in the state's 58 counties, there is a strong correlation. The higher their education rankings, the higher their incomes, and vise versa.
Direct efforts to relieve poverty via raising minimum wages, providing an earned income tax credit and expanding other public benefits certainly have marginal effects. But the latest reports indicate that in the long run, holding down costs for housing and other living costs, making education more available and effective, and encouraging private investment in more and better jobs are vital if California is to escape the ignominy of having the nation's highest level of poverty.
Four Colorado Republicans who voted against a $50 billion federal relief bill to assist victims of Hurricane Sandy have asked the president for emergency aid to help clean up their state after devastating floods.
President Barack Obama signed an emergency declaration Sunday to help Colorado recover from the floods that continue to ravage many parts of the state.
Republican Reps. Mike Coffman, Cory Gardner, Doug Lamborn and Scott Tipton joined the rest of their state's delegation in asking Obama to send emergency funds to Colorado, reported Think Progress.
Those same four Republicans voted against the Sandy relief package in January, and Lamborn voted against a smaller a billion relief package less than two weeks later.
All three of Colorado's Democratic representatives voted for each of the Sandy relief packages.

Dear Mr. Kim:
I write to congratulate you on the occasion of your late grandfather's 105th birthday. I heard about the difficulties you had with the missile this weekend, but be assured that the launch was cheered by thousands of Muslims in Jersey City.
Please forgive the impersonal nature of this correspondence, but a matter of this urgency cannot be left to the North Korean postal system. The world is the closest it has been to nuclear war in 55 years, and I wanted to caution you that the man with whom you are now eyeball to eyeball could be as mad as a March hare.
Jong (if I may, or do you prefer Little Un?), you yourself are known to be a bit nutty, or, as John McCain calls you, a “crazy fat kid.” That's why we were so quick to believe that you fed your uncle to dogs a few years ago. For years, American presidents left you and your father in power because they didn't want the bother of a war. But that was then.
(Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)
President Trump has been practicing the “madman theory,” which your family has used well: If people think you are insane, they'll give you a wide berth. But Trump does such a convincing job portraying a madman that he might actually be a madman. It may surprise you to hear me say that, but here in America we can criticize our leader without fear that our coffee will be poisoned and we will keel over onto our 8jmkiuh9tr5f44444444444444444444444444444444u
Kidding! The point is we don't know if he's bluffing or if he's crazy. And neither do you. Surely it didn't escape your notice that he arranged his response to one of your recent missile tests while dining in public at his Florida country club. He was also at Mar-a-Lago, eating “the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake” with Chinese President Xi Jinping, when he approved the missile attack on Syria, which he mistakenly called Iraq.
Little Un, if you think this American president is stable like his predecessors, I refer you to his Twitter account. He has sent 13,321 tweets with exclamation points, 864 tweets with two exclamation points, 432 with three, 146 with four and 57 with five (the last one, in August: “#WheresHillary? Sleeping!!!!!”). Trump's single greatest exclamation in recent years — 15 points — was in 2014: “This cannot be the the [sic] Academy Awards #Oscars AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”
Now he's turning his punctuation on you. Until the past couple of years, the extent of his public commentary on your country was to say he wouldn't go. “Dennis Rodman was either drunk or on drugs (delusional) when he said I wanted to go to North Korea with him. Glad I fired him on Apprentice!” he tweeted in 2014.
But this time Trump is in a position to fire missiles, not the former Chicago Bulls forward. And he has been treating the crisis with the gravity we've come to expect from him. At the White House Easter Egg Roll, where he was joined by the Easter Bunny, Trump said North Korea “gotta behave” and, if not, “you'll see.” There is still a chance that his advisers will talk him down. The most sensible one is Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. His nickname: “Mad Dog.”
Americans, though concerned about the nuclear standoff, have been paying more attention to an election in Georgia for one of 435 seats in Congress, and to a lawsuit filed by a white nationalist claiming Trump's language incited him to violence. And this gives me an idea.
Jong, if you really want to go after Trump, do it the American way: File a lawsuit. True, he has been sued hundreds of times, but yours would be special, because you could claim that his words and actions incited you to build and test missiles and weapons capable of unspeakable violence. You would be following in the footsteps of a revered American, Paula Jones, whose lawsuit against President Bill Clinton won a substantial payout and helped pave the way for his impeachment.
You would, I'm afraid, have to give up your nuclear arsenal to pursue this course, but Trump could afford to settle with you for significantly more than Clinton paid Jones. Also, I know from Seth Rogen and James Franco that you admire Katy Perry and margaritas. I can't promise, but it's possible that if you renounced your nuclear weapons and sued Trump instead, Perry might perform for you. And I would share my secret margarita recipe.
Please consider this peaceful alternative. Should you stay your current course, nobody knows what Trump might do. Not even Trump.

This weekend, thousands of moviegoers will get their first glimpse of the theory that the playwright and poet named William Shakespeare wasn't a balding guy named William Shakespeare. "Anonymous," starring Vanessa Redgrave, suggests a grand conspiracy obscured the true identity of the Bard of Avon. (Well, make that the Bard of Not-Avon.)
The Will-wasn't-Will idea isn't ancient, but it's not entirely new either. Ever since the 19th century, skeptics have been questioning whether an upper-middle class man with a rather ordinary background could have become one of the most influential humans of all time.
Recent books have debunked the doubters, including 2010's "Contested Will," by Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro (you can read my review here) and 2005's "The Case for Shakespeare: The End of the Authorship Question," by Scott McCrea, a drama professor at Purchase College, State University of New York.
This week, I asked McCrea about the history of Shakespeare conspiracy theories and why he thinks they're, to borrow a phrase, "the stuff that dreams are made on."
Q: When did people start wondering if Shakespeare was actually Shakespeare?
A: In the mid-19th century, when there was a guy who wrote a book and claimed that Shakespeare lacked erudition and could not have been very well educated, so it must have been [famed writer] Ben Jonson must have been the real writer of the plays. He writes these plays about dukes and earls, yet he was a commoner, a son of a glover. How could he have written these plays? Then people thought it must have been Francis Bacon. He was the most learned man of his time, and Shakespeare was the most learned man of his time, so they must have been the same guy.
Q: Why was his real identity so important to people?
A: Shakespeare had become almost a god of sorts. He became great, he became idolized, and he became a superhuman because of his impact on the culture.
We do this: There's a psychological need for people to displace in some way people who seem to be superhuman.
Q: For it to have been worthwhile to create a fake Shakespeare, it seems like he would have had to be incredibly appreciated in his own time. Was that the case?
A: There's this assumption that people knew during his own time that he was this writer for all time. In fact, he was regarded as a very good playwright, but by the time he died, he was considered a bit passé.
He's one of the few playwrights who had his name on plays during his lifetime, but he was not a household name. If you didn't go to the theater, you would never have heard of William Shakespeare.
It was really only after the publications of his work after his death that people started reading him, looking at how wonderful these plays were.
Q: What do you think is the best argument that Shakespeare wasn't actually Shakespeare?
A: In 1599, Shakespeare writes a poem. He's 34, but he refers to himself as old compared to his mistress. That's the only real discrepancy. But it was a poetic device, and it was different to be 34 in 1599, when life expectancy was shorter.
Q: Or he just may have had a much younger mistress and felt old for that reason. I know I would have if that happened to me at 34. But moving on! Why do you think smart people believe these outlandish conspiracy theories?
A: Part of it is an unawareness of that time. They don't read other writers of the Elizabethan period, and they don't understand that we don't know a lot about any of the writers of the time.
They don't understand that Shakespeare used sources. The plots of his plays don't come from personal experience, even though he seems to be able to get inside the heads of dukes, earls and kings.
It's a failure of imagination and a failure of knowledge.
Q: A lack of imagination about his imagination?
A: That is really at the root of the authorship question and all of the conspiracy theories.
Q: This is all very interesting, but why does this matter who Shakespeare was?
A: It's reductive when you read the plays, and you think they're merely disguised political history, works of allegory rather than works of art. It alters what the plays are actually about.
Q. What do you think is really going on in the minds of the skeptics?
A: It's a bit of envy. I think of Pericles' funeral oration: "For men can endure to hear others praised only so long as they can severally persuade themselves of their own ability to equal the actions recounted: when this point is passed, envy comes in and with it incredulity."
Men can endure others to be praised as long as they can persuade themselves of their own ability. Then envy comes in and incredulity: if this ordinary guy can do it, I should be able to do it. But if I can't do it, then he must not have been able to do it.

SAN JOSE — Legal action against Google by four UC Berkeley students has ballooned into two lawsuits by 890 U.S. college students and alumni alleging the firm harvested their data for commercial gain without their consent.
But the students” claims may be derailed by a dispute over whether they should file their cases individually, rather than as a group.
Hundreds of U.S. college students and alumni in 21 states joined the original lawsuit filed in January by the four Berkeley students. On April 29, another 180 filed a separate lawsuit making the same claim: that Google”s Apps for Education, which provided them with official university email accounts to use for school and personal communication, allowed Google until April 2014 to scan their emails without their consent for advertising purposes.
Google did not respond to requests for comment.
However, the suits by the students, including 68 from Berkeley and 243 from UC Santa Cruz, have been thrown into uncertainty by a federal judge”s suggestion that each student in the largest claim should file separately so the court can collect 710 individual $400 filing fees.
“Our clerk”s office is really unhappy you are circumventing our filing fees by adding 710 cases under one case number,” U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh told the students” lawyer, Ray Gallo, according to a court transcript.
Gallo, who is representing the students in both cases, said he expected Google to file a request to separate the 710 claims individually.
“This is a mass case and the question is, ”Can these people who all have essentially the same claim bring it together so that a lawyer like me will agree to do it?” he said. “If these cases have to be filed individually, no lawyer would take it.”
The students will seek a maximum of $10,000 each, Gallo said.
Google said in an April 2014 blog post that it had “permanently removed all ads scanning in Gmail for Apps for Education, which means Google cannot collect or use student data in Apps for Education services for advertising purposes.”
But the students allege that Google had been scooping their data at least as far back as November 2010. “Each Plaintiff received disclosures from his or her Educational Institution that indicated his or her (Apps for Education) emails were private,” according to court documents. “None of these disclosures notified him or her of Google”s interception or content scanning for Commercial Purposes. Many Plaintiffs received disclosures that assured them there would be no such scanning.”
At UC Berkeley, when Google came offering apps, officials asked about data capture, said Chris Hoofnagle, an internet-law professor who was involved in talks with Google over the apps. “They always responded, ”There is no advertising.” Their response was kind of a red herring,” Hoofnagle said. “We were asking whether Google was deriving knowledge from our communications.”
But the university had just spent a lot of money to transfer to Gmail as a temporary service after a four-day email outage and was reluctant to change again, Hoofnagle said.
Under federal law, he said, intercepting emails requires clear, direct disclosure to affected parties that their communications will be monitored, and the parties must give clear consent.
The suit by 710 students alleged that until April 2015, Google denied it was scanning students” emails for advertising purposes and misled schools into believing the emails were private. “Google”s lies,” according to the lawsuit, included a statement on a privacy page for Apps for Education, which was on the web from at least June 2011 to September 2012, and said the apps were “completely ad-free — which means your school”s content is not processed by Google”s advertising systems.”
Baird analyst Colin Sebastian was skeptical that Google deliberately targeted students” personal information. “I doubt that Google would intentionally try to acquire or use data that they”re not entitled to,” Sebastian said. “They are obviously a data company, trying to aggregate as much information as possible. In that broad net they may have been capturing data they weren”t supposed to.”

Function over form. The Samsung Galaxy S5 ($660, or $27.50/month) is America's best-performing smartphone, bringing excellent voice quality, a terrific camera, speedy performance, and the best screen we've seen on a handheld yet. It's better than last year's Galaxy S4 in a bunch of ways, most notably in actually exercising restraint for the first time in a while. Mainstream smartphone fans, people who like to surf the Web, and shutterbugs will thrill to this model, making it one of our two Editors' Choices for T-Mobile smartphones.
But that's the thing—the Galaxy S5 doesn't stand alone, and why it doesn't stand alone is telling. Samsung simply can't figure out premium design, at least from an American perspective. I spoke to the designers behind the S5, and they declared its plastic form to be "modern glam" with a "warmth and softness" (as well as a removable battery) that isn't available on glass-and-metal phones. But hold the S5 next to our other Editors' Choice on T-Mobile, the HTC One (M8), and the S5 doesn't feel like the expensive one.
Physical Features
The Galaxy S5 still has an uncomfortable relationship with its own materials. At 5.85 by 2.85 by .31 inches (HWD) and 5.1 ounces, it's a big phone, but that's par for the course nowadays. It's all plastic. The back is a stippled, textured faux-leather, borrowed from the Galaxy Note series, which is a major step up from the slick, fingerprint-collecting casing on the Galaxy S4. The back comes in black, blue, gold, or white. The design is almost ruined, in my mind, by a cheap bezel. You'll learn to live with it, but I didn't learn to love it. Near the top, a useful colored LED blinks blue when you have a new message. On the bottom, a large micro USB 3.0 port promises fast charging and fast data transfer in exchange for needing to be covered by a silver plastic door. A physical Home button with dedicated, light-up back and multitasking buttons are a little more convenient than the purely virtual buttons on the HTC One.

The S5 is waterproof and just a bit rugged; it's about as tough as last year's Galaxy S4 Active. That means it's sealed against liquids and made from flexible materials, so you don't have to worry about getting it wet or dropping it on its edge. You can still crack the screen, though, so a screen protector would be useful.
Dr. Ray Soneira of DisplayMate Labs put it best: The Galaxy S5 has the best screen we've seen yet on a smartphone. It's brilliant, vibrant, and highly customizable, appearing brighter and punchier than competing displays in almost every circumstance. The trick isn't just the 5.1-inch, 1080p Super AMOLED panel, although the panel itself has better color representation and a more even subpixel layout than the S4's. It's software. Samsung's Professional Photo and Cinema Modes give picky viewers true while Adapt Mode constantly alters the display color for maximum readability, and Super Dimming Mode makes the phone viewable in the dark without blowing out your eyes. Adapt Mode also deals very well with outdoor viewing conditions; I had no problem reading anything on my S5's screen through a week outside in Seoul.
The screen has a few other neat tricks, too: It works pretty well with , including using the tip of a graphite pencil on the screen as a stylus. While there was still a tiny bit of lag, the GS5 showed much better precision when tapping with a small stylus than other Android phones I've tried, except for the Galaxy Note line.
Call Quality and Battery
The Galaxy S series have always been excellent voice phones and this model is no exception. The earpiece here gets really loud. If you need volume, you'll be happy. The earpiece tone can also be tuned to your specific hearing profile, just like on the Galaxy S4. Do that if calls sound a little muddy, which they might on the default setting. Transmissions in normal call settings come through clearly. The phone street and car noise very well, although some background chatter from a Starbucks came through under my voice.
The single, small, back-ported speakerphone performs perfectly adequately, but it's nowhere near as clear and powerful as the HTC One's front-ported BoomSound speakers. Transmissions through the speakerphone mic, on the other hand, are excellent thanks to Samsung's top-notch noise cancellation. I also had no problems with Bluetooth headsets.
Battery life looks very good. Because of SIM provisioning issues, I couldn't complete our standard single-long-call test, but the 2,800mAh battery was still at 41 percent after 11 hours, 15 minutes of calling. In a week's worth of use, it lasted out the day every time.
The new Ultra Power Saving mode delivers peace of mind: Kick it in when your battery is around 15 percent to limit the phone to calling, texting, Facebook,and Web browsing, and watch the phone report that it magically has more than a day's worth of standby time remaining. With the battery down to 2 percent, I managed to squeeze out several hours of standby, a few text messages, and even a brief phone call. That was magical.
Wi-Fi and LTE
The Galaxy S5 takes networking to a new level. Its Wi-Fi performance outdoes the HTC One significantly when 25-50 feet away from an 802.11n router. At a 30-foot distance from a router with a 30-Mbps-up-and-down connection in a tough environment, the HTC dropped to 7-10Mbps but the Galaxy S5 maintained 15-20Mbps. I saw a similar difference up to about 75 when they both dropped off. That will make a serious difference when Web browsing.
Lousy Starbucks wireless connections could be further enhanced by Download Booster, a Samsung feature which combines Wi-Fi and LTE throughput when you're downloading files larger than 30MB. I'm worried about this one, though, because it was disabled on my phone. Samsung insisted to me that it would be enabled with a firmware update at launch, but this is just the kind of thing a carrier could kill.
Otherwise, the S5 comes in four different LTE versions. We tested the T-Mobile model, which features the carrier's Wi-Fi calling. Radio-wise, the handsets all support various carriers' highest-speed networks but won't switch between U.S. carriers well. The non-T-Mobile models lack T-Mobile's main 3G band; the AT&T and Verizon models lack each other's 700MHz LTE, and the Sprint model won't work on anyone else's LTE network. So you need to buy the right model for your and stick with it, like with the HTC One but unlike with the iPhone 5s.
Annoyingly, both the AT&T and T-Mobile models lack LTE Band 12, which T-Mobile and some regional carriers are implementing at the end of this year to improve rural coverage, but no other phone has that yet, either.
The phone comes with 16GB of memory, with 11.5GB available (slightly more than on the HTC One). There's a microSD card slot under the back cover which took my 64GB card without complaint.
SPECIAL REPORT: The Brazilian looked set to leave Camp Nou after rejecting the Catalans' first offer but he is now ready to commit himself to the club for another two seasons
By Pilar Suarez Dani Alves has agreed a new two-year contract with Barcelona and will sign on the dotted line inside the next few weeks.The Brazil international had looked set to leave Camp Nou on a free transfer at the end of the season after rejecting the club's previous offer of a one-year extension, with the option of two more if he were to play at least 60 per cent of the Blaugrana's games each season.Alves' agent, Dinorah Santa Ana, called a press conference on April 9 during which she claimed there would be no further contract talks and that the right-back was saddened by both Barça's stance and the prospect of his imminent exit.The defender's representative, who is also his ex-wife, also claimed another club had offered her client a three-year deal "with a higher wage".However, Alves was not entirely won over by the proposal, while expected interest from Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain never materialised.Furthermore, the 32-year-old always wanted to remain in Barcelona. Firstly, his family is settled in the city. Secondly, Alves intends to open a Brazilian restaurant in the Catalan capital.Consequently, when Barça president Josep Maria Bartomeu returned with a fresh contract offer of two further seasons, Alves was more than happy to accept.The club's change of heart was in part motivated by Alves' excellent form over the past month, with the attacking full-back having played a key role in Barça's charge towards the Liga title, as well as their Champions League wins over PSG and Bayern Munich.Indeed, the feeling now is that Alves, even at 32, still has plenty to offer at the highest level, while there is also the acknowledgement that Barça would struggle to find an adequate replacement given their transfer ban runs until January.Consequently, a compromise has been reached and will now be made official before the end of the month.
November 2nd 2017 was a day of incredibly mixed fortunes for midfielder Jack Wilshere. Gareth Southgate announced he was to leave the 25-year-old out of his England squad for upcoming matches against Germany and Brazil, however, a commanding performance against Red Star Belgrade in the Europa League just hours later re-affirmed his significant ability and gave manager Arsene Wenger plenty to ponder.
Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate explained Wilshire's omission to the media, blaming his lack of regular game time in the Premier League. Many Arsenal fans were quick to argue that Danny Rose has spent the majority of the campaign on the sidelines at Spurs but has still somehow been selected.
Wilshere has played just 13 minutes of football in the top flight this season and has spent the majority of the campaign warming the bench but with the lack of quality options in the middle for England, there have been many calls for Wilshere to feature on the International stage.
It has sparked a war of words between Southgate and Wenger with the Frenchman questioning the England boss' decision to leave him out.
The Arsenal chief claimed about Jack Wilshere saying :
but Southgate was quick to defend himself.
Despite having rarely featured in the Premier League, Wilshere has been busy competing in the EFL Cup and Europa League whilst also turning out for the Under 23s in the Premier League 2.
His performance against Red Star Belgrade was impressive despite Arsenal labouring to a goalless draw at the Emirates. A point was enough to help the Gunners secure their passage to the next round which is bound to result in more game time for Wilshere as well as a number of other fringe players.
Santi Cazorla is working his way back to fitness but the likes of Granit Xhaka and Mohamed Elneny haven't been able to win over the fans and Wilshere remains a popular figure in the red half of North London.
Perhaps he should be given the chance against lower-ranked opposition with upcoming home matches against Huddersfield and Newcastle appearing the perfect opportunities to ease him back in.
Wenger's side have been incredibly inconsistent so far this campaign and they must improve their away form if they are to challenge for a top-four position. The Gunners are 6/4 in the premier league betting markets to return to the Champions League spots after missing out last year and fans will be hoping they can also finish above near-neighbours Spurs.
Wilshere was at the heart of all of the home side's best moments and helped drive his side forward throughout his time on the pitch. During his rare outings, he has shown he still has enough skill, tenacity and leadership qualities to stake a claim for a place in the first team but many wonders whether he will be given the opportunity.
Wilshere must continue to go about his business quietly but effectively and wait for an opportunity in the Premier League. Wenger has an array of options in the centre of the park but few of them have shone so far and the 25-year-old surely deserves another chance to show his ability to dictate games in the top flight.
Do you think Jack deserves a chance to start for Arsenal in the League ??
Till the next thought.

The New Jersey Devils finished with their highest win total (38) in four seasons and remained in the hunt for a spot in the Stanley Cup Playoffs well into the fourth quarter of the 2015-16 season, but injuries and a lack of scoring depth prevented them from qualifying for the postseason for the first time since their run to the Stanley Cup Final in 2012.
The Devils' 182 goals were 30th in the NHL, and general manager Ray Shero and coach John Hynes realize the importance of scoring more this season if they have any hope of making the playoffs.
Adam Henrique and Kyle Palmieri each scored 30 goals for the first time in his NHL career. If not for an inflamed tendon in his right hand, Michael Cammalleri might also have reached 30 goals last season (he had 14 goals in 42 games). New Jersey's most valuable player was all-star goaltender Cory Schneider, who was 27-25-6 with a 2.15 goals-against average, a .924 save percentage and four shutouts in 58 games.
Shero was busy upgrading his roster this offseason, acquiring forward Taylor Hall in a trade with the Edmonton Oilers, adding significant pieces in free agency, and re-signing restricted free agent defenseman Jon Merrill and forwards Palmieri, Jacob Josefson, Sergey Kalinin, and Devante Smith-Pelly.
Here is what the Devils look like today:
Video: Chatting with Taylor Hall
KEY ARRIVALS: Taylor Hall, F: Shero acquired Hall for defenseman Adam Larsson on June 29. Hall, who had 26 goals and 65 points in 82 games last season, teamed with Henrique in Windsor of the Ontario Hockey League and won back-to-back Memorial Cup titles in 2009 and '10. Hall and Henrique combined for 78 goals and 183 points in the 2009-10 regular season in Windsor, and 37 goals and 60 points in 19 OHL playoff games. … Ben Lovejoy, D: The loss of Larsson left a huge void on defense, so the addition of the right-handed veteran in free agency was important. Lovejoy, 32, who signed a three-year contract, had four goals, 10 points, 154 hits and 104 blocked shots while averaging 18:52 in 66 games for the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2015-16. Hynes was an assistant coach when Lovejoy was with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League in 2009-10. … Vernon Fiddler, F: The 5-foot-11, 205-pound center, who signed a one-year contract, will help alleviate some pressure off Travis Zajac on defensive-zone faceoffs. Fiddler ranked third on the Dallas Stars with 897 faceoffs taken last season, winning 455 (50.7 percent). He had 12 goals and 22 points in 82 games. … Beau Bennett, F: Shero acquired Bennett from the Penguins for a third-round pick in the 2016 NHL Draft and signed him to a one-year contract on July 1. Bennett, who has good instincts and playmaking ability, can play either right or left wing. He has 16 goals and 45 points in 129 NHL games over four seasons.

KEY DEPARTURES: Adam Larsson, D: The No. 4 selection in the 2011 draft, he really came into his own playing alongside captain Andy Greene last season, leading the Devils in hits (163) and ranking second in ice time (22:30) and blocked shots (148). … David Schlemko, D: The veteran was a good depth defenseman capable of playing big minutes and in any situation. He signed a four-year contract with the San Jose Sharks. … Jordin Tootoo, F: The right wing was a fan favorite; he was always there to defend teammates and provided energy in a bottom-six role. Tootoo, 33, spent the past two seasons with the Devils before signing a one-year contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. He had 24 points and 174 penalty minutes in 134 games in New Jersey.
ON THE CUSP: Steven Santini, D: A strong training camp could land the right-handed defenseman a prominent role in the lineup. Santini (6-2, 207), a second-round pick (No. 42) in the 2013 draft, signed a three-year, entry-level contract in April after he was named the best defensive defenseman in Hockey East at Boston College last season. He appears ready for the next stage of his career following three seasons at BC. … Pavel Zacha, F: The 6-3, 210-pound forward has speed and skill, and could be ready out of training camp. A 2015 first-round draft pick (No. 6), he had 28 goals, 64 points in 51 games for Sarnia in the OHL last season. … John Quenneville, F: A first-round selection (No. 30) at the 2014 draft, Quenneville can play left wing or center. He had 31 goals and 73 points in 57 games last season, his fourth with Brandon of the Western Hockey League. … Joshua Jacobs, D: The right-handed defenseman signed his entry-level contract in April and is expected to begin the season in Albany of the American Hockey League. Jacobs, 20, had four goals, 24 points in 67 games for Sarnia of the OHL last season. … Nick Lappin, F: The 23-year-old right wing led Brown University in goals (17) and points (33) last season, and was named to the All-Ivy League First Team. Signed to a two-year contract in March, he had three goals and seven points in 12 games for Albany. … Miles Wood, F: The 6-2, 195-pound left wing, chosen in the fourth round (No. 100) of the 2013 draft, had 10 goals and 35 points in 37 games as a freshman at BC last season.
WHAT THEY STILL NEED: Zacha could provide the secondary scoring they need. The Devils could re-sign unrestricted free agent forward Patrik Elias, who could serve as a mentor to fellow Czech Republic native Zacha. Elias, 40, is New Jersey's all-time leader in goals (408), assists (617) and points (1,025). Shero also might need to acquire an offensive defenseman to help alleviate some of the burden from Greene. Though Keith Kinkaid is Schneider's projected backup, Scott Wedgewood could also make a claim to that position in training camp. Wedgewood had a 1.24 GAA, a .957 save percentage and a shutout in four games for the Devils last season.

PETE JENSEN'S FANTASY FOCUS: The knock on Schneider's fantasy stock his first three seasons with the Devils has been their lack of offense, but the acquisition of Hall changes things drastically. Schneider missed time because of injury and played behind the 30th-ranked offense in the League last season but still had 27 wins in 58 games with elite peripherals. If the Devils' top four forwards stay healthy and Schneider keeps his goals-against average under 2.30 and his save percentage above .920, he'll start more than 65 games and clear the 30-win hurdle for the first time in his NHL career. That likely would equate to a top-five finish among fantasy goalies. He's fair game to draft once the top 30 players are off the board.

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- New coach Doug Marrone and the Buffalo Bills are moving on without Ryan Fitzpatrick, releasing the quarterback after two-plus inconsistent seasons as starter.
The team announced the move Tuesday, shortly after the NFL's free agency period opened, and a day before Fitzpatrick was due a $3 million bonus.
"We kept every possible option open right down to the wire, when we had to make a decision on whether to keep Ryan," general manager Buddy Nix said. "In the end, we had to do what we feel is best for our football team. And it was a difficult decision."
Fitzpatrick's up-and-down performance and his expensive contract were factors in his release. He went 20-33 as a starter over four seasons in Buffalo. And he was in the midst of a six-year, $59 million contract extension signed in October 2011.
That was regarded as too expensive for a player who wasn't guaranteed to return as a starter this season. The Bills had held out hope that Fitzpatrick would be open to restructuring his contract, and free up space under the salary cap to allow the team to pursue free agents, and re-sign its own players.
A change in coaches didn't help Fitzpatrick, either. Marrone took over in January after Chan Gailey was fired after three straight losing seasons. Gailey was regarded as Fitzpatrick's biggest supporter.
Fitzpatrick wasn't available for comment. He had spent the past two months with his family in their offseason home in Arizona.
The move leaves Buffalo with one experienced quarterback on its roster -- Tarvaris Jackson, who re-signed to a one-year contract last month. Nix already has expressed an intention to select a quarterback in the draft next month. The Bills also had been linked to Alex Smith, before the former 49ers starter was traded to Kansas City two weeks ago.
"Our focus remains on adding another quarterback to our roster, and we will continue to explore every option available to us," Nix said.
The Bills had sent mixed signals regarding Fitzpatrick's future over the past month.
His status appeared to be secure in mid-February, when Marrone announced he informed Fitzpatrick and Jackson that he intended to have both compete for the starting job this offseason. The Bills' message was less definitive a little over a week later at the NFL combine in Indianapolis. That's where both Nix and team president Russ Brandon were evasive when discussing Fitzpatrick.
Jeff De La Fuente, a 31-year-old resident of Hayward, succumbed to his injuries after he was pinned between a BART car and the platform on Wednesday night at the 24th Street station, according to the Office of the Medical Examiner.
De La Fuente died at 7:50 p.m. on Wednesday, January 4, the office said, a little over an hour after he was trapped at the BART station near 6:30 p.m.
His family have set up a GoFundMe in his honor, soliciting donations for a funeral and the transportation of his body back to the Philippines.
“He leaves behind his mom Alice and beloved girlfriend Dorothy. His girlfriend is asking for donations to help Jeff's mom with the funeral expenses and arranging for him to be brought back to the Philippines for burial,” the fundraising account states.
De La Fuente was trapped in an inches-long space between a BART car and the platform on Wednesday, according to Jonathan Baxter, a Fire Department spokesperson. Roughly a quarter of his body was above the platform, he said, when firefighters worked to rescue him by using airbags and wood to shift the train sideways.
He was semi-conscious during the rescue effort, Baxter said, and transported to San Francisco General Hospital some 15 minutes into the operation. He died there shortly after.
“When you visually see that gap, and figure a human body was in between that and the train, you can figure out all the trauma the human body endured,” Baxter said.
A BART spokesperson, Jim Allison, described the situation as a “tragic occurrence” but said he had no specific details as to how De La Fuente became trapped. He said it was a reminder for passengers to heed the yellow warning tiles on the edge of the platform.
“This was an accident, and obviously a tragic accident, so on behalf of BART I'd like to express our condolences to his family and friends,” he said.
Guinness today announced that the beer company would drop its sponsorship of the New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade due to the parade's discriminatory rule that prohibits LGBT families and organizations from participating.
In a statement released today, Guinness said:
Guinness has a strong history of supporting diversity and being an advocate for equality for all. We were hopeful that the policy of exclusion would be reversed for this year's parade. As this has not come to pass, Guinness has withdrawn its participation. We will continue to work with community leaders to ensure that future parades have an inclusionary policy.
"Today, Guinness sent a strong message to its customers and employees: discrimination should never be celebrated," said GLAAD CEO & President Sarah Kate Ellis. "As a gay mom who has fond memories of the New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade, it saddens me that I can't give those same memories to my own kids because my family isn't welcome. Hopefully, as parade organizers realize that anti-LGBT discrimination is not supported by sponsors, or many Irish New Yorkers, they'll see that families like mine should be part of the celebration."
Stonewall Inn, which had planned to stop selling Guinness because of the sponsorship, confirmed today that it looks forward to serving Guinness on St. Patrick's Day and beyond. A previously scheduled event at Stonewall was canceled in light of the news.
On Friday, after GLAAD reached out to sponsors of the parade as part of our work to push for equality for LGBT people in all parts of our culture, Heineken dropped its sponsorship, saying that the company is "passionate about equality for all people." Also on Friday, following outreach from MassEquality, Sam Adams announced that it, too, would drop its sponsorship of the South Boston St. Patrick's Day Parade, which also bans LGBT people from taking part.
Ford Motors remains the last major American corporation to continue its support of the discriminatory parade. In a statement to CNBC last week, Ford said:
Ford Motor Company is involved in a wide range of events and organizations in communities across the country and around the world, including long-standing participation in this parade. No one person, group or event reflects Ford's views on every issue. What we can tell you is that Ford is proud of its inclusive policies. Every member of the Ford team is valued, and we provide employee benefits regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation.
New York City-based organization Irish Queers, a group that has been leading the work to end the ban on LGBT participation in the parade for many years, has also expressed dismay at the NYPD's participation in the parade, noting that "City agencies don't have 'free speech right' to bypass anti-bias rules." New York City has strict anti-discrimination policies in place that protect LGBT New Yorkers from discrimination by government agencies like the NYPD.
“The homophobic bigotry of this parade is reaffirmed each year by the organizers," said JF Mulligan of Irish Queers. "The NYPD's insistence on sending huge uniformed contingents every year makes it clear that the rights of our communities don't concern them. Commissioner Bratton hasn't even acknowledged the community's outrage. If the NYPD and the City refuses to uphold their own anti-bias rules, how can we trust police officers with our safety?”
Irish Queers will be holding a press conference during this year's parade on Monday, March 17 at 10:30am ET (30 minutes before parade), between 56th & 57th Streets on the west side of Fifth Ave.

Former San Diego mayor Bob Filner was sentenced to three years of probation on Monday, on three counts of mistreating women, one of which was a felony. The 71-year-old politician, who served in Congress for two decades, avoided jail time under a plea agreement with prosecutors.
At the hearing, Filner apologized to his family, staff, former constituents, and to the women he harassed. "Certainly the behaviors before this court today will never be repeated," he said in a very brief statement, citing the treatment regiment he entered into shortly before his resignation from office.
Under the plea deal, Filner will spend three months in home confinement, starting at the beginning of 2014. He will lose his pension credit since the time of the first offense in March. As part of the agreement, Filner will be unable to seek public office again. None of the women involved in the charges against Filner wanted to give an impact statement during the sentencing hearing. Instead, a statement was read on their behalf.
Before his resignation on August 30, Filner had been accused of misconduct and inappropriate behavior by at least 18 women. He was later charged with a felony false imprisonment for forcefully restraining a woman at a fundraiser earlier this year. The two misdemeanor charges related to accusations of kissing a woman without her consent, and groping a woman's backside during a photo op. Filner pleaded guilty to those charges on October 15th.
Meanwhile, 81 percent told pollsters in the latest ARD Deutschlandtrend survey that Russia was “not to be trusted”, Die Zeit reported on Friday.
Asked specifically about the Minsk ceasefire agreement for Ukraine, hammered out with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by Chancellor Angela Merkel and the leaders of France and Ukraine, only 13 percent of people thought it would lead to peace.
Reuters reported on Thursday that Russia will conduct large-scale military exercises expected to last over a month in disputed border territories, including the Crimean peninsula – a part of Ukraine annexed by Moscow last year.
Russia to dominate EU meeting
The news came as Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier jets to Latvian capital Riga for a meeting of European foreign ministers starting on Friday.
Representatives of the 28 EU members will discuss reform plans for the Ukrainian government, which are a precondition for European financial aid.
But Europe's wider relationship with Russia, widely believed to be supporting east Ukrainian rebels with weapons, equipment and even disguised troops, will be lurking in the background.
On Saturday, the ministers will discuss EU partnership agreements – the same issue which touched off Russian anger over Ukraine – with Georgia and Moldova, two countries Putin sees as part of his own sphere of influence.
Some of the troops involved in Russia's current exercises are based in Georgia's Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions, the focus of a brief war between the two countries in 2008.

Today, BusinessWeek's Michael Serrill and Jonathan Neumann have released a blockbuster report based on a FOIA response by the Treasury, which proves that in America rules are only for little people, that this country has been a banana republic for years, that Animal Farm was spot on, and gives excruciating detail of how Hank Paulson tipped off a select group of Goldman diaspora hedge fund managers about the eventual failure of Fannie and Freddie 7 weeks ahead of this information becoming public knowledge. The report basically is a summary of a meeting that took place at the offices of Eton Mindich's Eton Park headquarters on July 21, 2008, 7 days after his famous '“If you have a bazooka, and people know you have it, you're not likely to take it out," speech and 7 weeks before both GSEs effectively filed for bankruptcy and were put into conservatorship. Now if it only ended there it would have been fine - a case of potential criminal collusion between the government (although nothing specific against Paulson as he didn't actually trade: he just made sure his former Goldman colleagues made money), and the 0.00001% in the face of a few multi-billionaires who most certainly did trade on material non-public information sourced by Hank. Where it however gets worse is when one considers the actual role of one Eric Mindich in the hierarchy of the Asset Managers' committee of the President's Working Group on Capital Markets, better known of course as the PPT: a topic we discussed first back in September 2009 when we asked "What Is Goldman Alum Eric Mindich's Role As Chair Of The Asset Managers' Committee Of The President's Working Group?" Back then we did not get an answer. Luckily, courtesy of a few answered FOIA requests, some real investigative journalism, and not reporting for the sake of brown-nosing just so one can get soundbites for their next name dropping "blockbuster" and straight to HBO movie, we are starting to get the full picture of just how high in US government the Goldman Sachs controlled "crony capitalist" adminsitration truly runs.
Before we get into the details of Mr Mindich's curious relationship with the government, here is the gist of the BusinessWeek piece, which as noted focuses on Paulson who "said he had erred by not punishing Bear Stearns shareholders more severely. The secretary, then 62, went on to describe a possible scenario for placing Fannie and Freddie into “conservatorship” -- a government seizure designed to allow the firms to continue operations despite heavy losses in the mortgage markets."
The gathering comprised some of Wall Street's most storied investors. Mindich, a former chief strategy officer of New York- based Goldman Sachs, started Eton Park in 2004 with $3.5 billion, at the time one of the biggest hedge-fund launches ever. [Dinakar] Singh, a former head of Goldman's proprietary-trading desk, also began his fund in 2004, in partnership with private- equity firm Texas Pacific Group Ltd. Lone Pine's [Stephen] Mandel worked as a retail analyst at Goldman before joining Julian Robertson's Tiger Management LLC, one of the most successful hedge funds of the 1980s and 1990s. He started his own firm in 1997. [Daniel] Och was co-head of U.S. equity trading at Goldman before founding Och-Ziff in 1994. The publicly listed firm managed $28.9 billion in November. One other Goldman Sachs alumnus was at the meeting: Frank Brosens, founder and principal of Taconic Capital Advisors LP, who worked at Goldman as an arbitrageur and who was a protege of Robert Rubin, who went on to become Treasury secretary.
In other words the point of the meeting was nothing short of the former Goldman CEO telling all his former Goldman colleagues just what he was planning on doing in his capacity as Treasury Secretary.
Others also benefited:
Non-Goldman Sachs alumni who attended included short seller James Chanos of Kynikos Associates Ltd., who helped uncover the Enron Corp. accounting fraud; GSO Capital Partners LP co-founder Bennett Goodman, who sold his firm to Blackstone Group LP in early 2008; Roger Altman, chairman and founder of New York investment bank Evercore Partners Inc.; and Steven Rattner, a co-founder of private-equity firm Quadrangle Group LLC, who went on to serve as head of the U.S. government's Automotive Task Force. Another person in attendance: Michele Davis, then-assistant secretary for public affairs at the Treasury Department, who now represents Paulson as a managing partner at public relations firm Brunswick Group Inc. In an e-mail response to Bloomberg Markets, she referred all questions to Paulson's book on the financial crisis, “On the Brink” (Business Plus, 2010), which makes no mention of the Eton Park meeting.
No mention? What a shocker. Perhaps it may have to do with this:
The fund manager who described the meeting left after coffee and called his lawyer. The attorney's quick conclusion: Paulson's talk was material nonpublic information, and his client should immediately stop trading the shares of Washington- based Fannie and McLean, Virginia-based Freddie. The manager who described the Eton Park meeting says he also discussed it with an investigator from the FCIC. The discussion was confirmed by a former FCIC employee.
Of course, it only means that one would not have to cover shorts on "existing positions." The market's shift from a NYSE to OTC Pink Sheets listed stock would do it for them.
That manager says he ended up profiting from his Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac positions because he was already short the stocks. On his lawyer's advice, he stopped covering his short positions and rode Fannie and Freddie shares all the way to the bottom.
Naturally, the one defense of this criminal disclosure comes from a former Fed president:
“It seems to me, you've got to cut the guy some slack, even if he tipped his hand,” says William Poole, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “How do you prepare the market for the fact that policy has changed without triggering the very crisis that you're trying to avoid? What is he supposed to say without misleading these people?”
So going back to Eric Mindich. Why is he so special? Presenting Exhibit A, the members of the Asset Managers' Committee of the President's Working Group on Capital Markets, aka the PPT:
Just what is this curious committee consisting of all key hedge fund managers?
The Asset Managers' Committee and the Investors' Committee are private sector committees established by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets (“PWG”). The first task of the Committees was to develop and publicly release best practices so that market participants may enhance investor protection and systemic risk safeguards consistent with PWG principles and guidelines. The final reports are available through the homepage of the respective Committee.
In other words, these are the hegde funders who comprise the Plunge Protection Team.
But this will be nothing new to our readers. Here we refer to our article from back in September 2009:
On September 25, 2007, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, better known as the Plunge Protection Team, announced the formation of two private sector committees, one comprising of Asset Managers and the other, of Investors. It is the first one that is more interesting, as the committee is chaired by one Eric Mindich, best known for his Goldman Sachs wunderkind status, who at 27, was the youngest Goldmanite ever to be promoted to partner. In 2004, Eric split off from Goldman, nonetheless maintaining a favorable relationship with the mothership through its "Fund of Funds" division (we jest), and its various Prime Brokerage client platforms, by starting Eton Park, which with its starting capital of $3 billion, is still likely a record of the highest AUM at a fund's inception.
So what was the justification for the creation of this specific committee. From its Mission Statement:
PRESIDENT'S WORKING GROUP ON FINANCIAL MARKETS
ASSET MANAGERS' COMMITTEE Mission Statement The Asset Managers' Committee is comprised of representatives from a broad array of asset managers. Its purpose is to facilitate an exchange of information between the alternative asset management community and the agencies comprising the President's Working Group on Financial Markets (“PWG”). It will be a standing committee, and its members serve at the behest of the committee's chairperson for three-year terms. Members may be reappointed for additional terms. It is expected that the committee will develop best practice guidelines, as described below, and also subsequently review and reassess, and if necessary revise, those guidelines. The first task of the committee is to develop detailed guidelines that would define “bestpractices” for the alternative asset management industry, including practices regarding information, valuation, and risk management systems. They would foster efforts to enhance market discipline, mitigate systemic risk, augment regulatory safeguards regarding investor protection, and complement regulatory efforts to enhance market integrity. These guidelines would review and build on existing industry work and the principles and guidelines released in February 2007 by the PWG, particularly Principle 9, where possible. The initial focus will be on practices for hedge fund managers.
Yet less than a year later, the economy and capital markets collapsed, forcing Hank Paulson to launch an unprecedented sequence of events to prevent the full meltdown of the Western World. Indeed, the same Hank Paulson who one year prior to Lehman's collapse had this to say regarding the Asset Managers' committee:
"These groups are drawn from among the industry's finest in their respective areas," said Treasury Secretary and PWG Chairman Henry M. Paulson, Jr. "The market will benefit if experienced participants develop and implement best practices."
It is safe to say that whatever the committee's true mission was, its stated one was an unmitigated failure. For reference purposes, the full committee consists of the following:
Eric Mindich, Chair, Eton Park Capital Management
Anne Casscells. AETOS Capital, LLC
James S. Chanos, Kynikos Associates LP
Anne Dinning, D. E. Shaw & Co., L.P.
Jonathon S. Jacobson, Highfields Capital Management
Marc Lasry,Avenue Capital Group
Edward A. Mulé, Silver Point Capital
Daniel S. Och, Och-Ziff Capital Management
Daniel H. Stern, Reservoir Capital Group
William Von Mueffling, Cantillon Capital
Michael Vranos, Ellington Management Group LLC
Pardon our hypocrisy, but virtually all of these funds (with the likely exception of Kynikos) would have gotten destroyed had Bernanke, the Chairman of the PWG and the President, decided not to intervene. Furthermore, as is well-known, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets has long been not only the front for the elusive Plunge Protection Team, but is an organization this is so wrapped in secrecy that not even minutes of its meetings are kept as John Crudele of the NY Post found out post his US Treasury FOIA submission. Yet the Asset Managers' Committee seems to be in that gray area where it is not totally consumed by the PWG, and thus it is possible that a record of its actions may actually not disappear into the void once any market critical decision is made.
We concluded our article from over two years ago as follows:
Zero Hedge is submitting a FOIA request to the US Treasury to disclose any and all information, records, emails, telephone conversations, with and amongst members of the committee and specifically focusing on former Goldman Sachs employee and Chair of the Asset Managers' Committee Eric Mindich, at and around the time of the Lehman collapse. We expect nothing but heavily redacted pages at best. Yet with recent scrutiny of latent Goldman interests in virtually every segment of the executive branch, Zero Hedge does find it oddly convenient, that in those dark (for Goldman Sachs) days, the two key people making capital markets related decisions were yet another two Goldman Sachs alumni: Hank Paulson and Eric Mindich. And we believe in the spirit of fake transparency so heavily endorsed by the President, it is worth at least attempting to get some additional information on the deliberations by the proxy entities that truly run this country's economy and capital markets.
We are happy that Bloomberg was more successful in getting a FOIA response than Zero Hedge. We urge Messrs Serill and Neumann to enjoin our request for data on what Paulson may have leaked to his Goldman buddies in advance of the Lehman collapse. Because maybe, just maybe, if the Goldman-run Plunge Protection Team let Lehman fail, it was under direct instructions from Hank Paulson... just as he tipped Mindich et al to the GSEs failure. And all those rumors about a directed run on the bank (whose failure benefited none other more than Goldman Sachs) coordinated by none other than the man in charge of it all, will suddenly come true.
Because we have a sinking feeling we will have been proven absolutely spot on in our "paranoid conspiracy theorism" all over again...

CLOSE Jeff Blashill talks after Day 2 of Red Wings training camp. Video by Helene St. James/DFP
Goal-scoring wing is learning patience and 'looking for a fresh start.'
Detroit Red Wings Anthony Mantha, left, and Jakub Kindl, right, during a scrimmage game on the team's first day of training camp on Friday, September 18, 2015, in Traverse City. (Photo: Julian H. Gonzalez, DFP)
TRAVERSE CITY -- The Red Wings have reason to look at Anthony Mantha and be optimistic.
He has grown from hotshot draft pick to humble pro player. He is hanging out with one of the most mature teenagers among the Wings, one bound to be of good influence. He is talking about earning minutes, not being owed any.
Mantha is participating in his first training camp with the Wings, a year after what was supposed to be his first was derailed by a fractured right tibia that pushed his pro debut to mid-November with the Grand Rapids Griffins.
The Wings drafted Mantha 20th overall in 2013, then watched the 6-foot-5, 214-pound right wing put together a second straight 50-goal season in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.
He finished last season with 15 goals among 33 points in 62 games, unable to dominate like he had as a junior.
Wings general manager Ken Holland said he hoped Mantha learned from the experience.
"At first, I really wanted to play with the Wings," Mantha said Saturday. "Now, I learned their mentality, I learned how they want to do things, I learned how hard it is to make the Wings.
"This year I am looking for a fresh start. I know what I need to do, I know what they are wanting from me. I need to have a great season, whether it is in Detroit or Grand Rapids. I need to prove I can play either way — I can play power play, maybe have a chance on PK with that new coach in Grand Rapids. "
Wings coach Jeff Blashill wants Mantha, who turned 21 on Wednesday, to get comfortable and "you have to find how to play what I call the right way, especially in our system, where we demand you are going to play a 200-foot game and you are going to play from the defensive side of the puck. It takes awhile to learn how to create offense while playing that way."
The demand for a 200-foot game can lessen, though, the more a forward contributes points-wise. Gustav Nyquist is a good example. More than anything, the Wings want to see Mantha produce.
"The one thing with Anthony is, with a player like him, he's got to score," Blashill said. "That is what he does, and that is a confidence thing. When you come in with a ton of confidence, all of a sudden with the injury and what not, it was a little harder than he probably thought it was going to be. The confidence erodes a little bit, and now you've got to build it back up."
Mantha restored some self-esteem during the prospect tournament that preceded training camp. He also is getting a boost from a budding friendship with Dylan Larkin, the 2014 first-round pick who spent the past year wowing at U-M, the World Championships and the AHL playoffs.
"I look at him," Mantha said, "and try to follow him around, and we push one another."
The two have become closer over the past few weeks, bonding as the days in Traverse City grow into weeks.
"We have a good relationship," Larkin said. "We are pretty good buddies off the ice, always hanging out and going to dinner. I've been impressed with him. I think he had a big summer, so I'm excited for what is to come for him. I think he is going to have a good year."
Lurking on Larkin: There might not be two players more delighted to be around one another than Luke Glendening and Larkin. Larkin worked out with Glendening during the summer and sees him as a guiding influence. "Luke and I do have a bond," Larkin said. "He has been a real mentor for me this summer, and he is a true leader."
Glendening is happy to help. "I just try to be a sounding board if he needs something," he said. "He's highly skilled and highly talented, so I don't know how much I can help him in that department. He has a bright future in front of him."
The two former U-M players balance former Spartans Justin Abdelkader and Drew Miller. "It's nice to have one back, especially with Michigan State's football team doing so well," Glendening said. "I need another Wolverine in my corner."

Arctic oil drilling takes 1st steps OFFSHORE DRILLING

Dlouhy, Houston Chronicle Photo: Jennifer A. Dlouhy, Houston Chronicle Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Arctic oil drilling takes 1st steps 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Barrow, Alaska --
Even if Shell strikes oil in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, it could be at least a dozen years - and billions upon billions of dollars - before a single drop of it arrives at a refinery.
Here, far above the Arctic Circle, there is no network of pipelines snaking along the seabed. There are no deep-water ports. Even docks can be hard to come by.
The entire infrastructure to support offshore development in a hostile climate would have to be built from scratch.
"The big technical challenge in the Arctic is simply the scale of it, because there is no infrastructure," said Charlie Williams, a recently retired chief scientist at Shell who sits on a federal drilling safety advisory committee. "It's the sheer scale of putting in all the pipelines and all the platforms, and then putting in all the shore bases to support that."
While exploratory oil drilling in the region is generally done with rigs on floating vessels, year-round oil production and development drilling probably would be done by rigs on stationary platforms installed directly in the seabed - structures that have never been placed in U.S. Arctic waters before.
Finding oil is just the beginning, said Pete Slaiby, the Shell Alaska vice president who is spearheading the company's Arctic venture.
"If we are blessed with development, there's going to be a huge amount of work," Slaiby said, including technological development, government approvals, pipeline construction and far-reaching federally mandated environmental studies.
"It will be, I think, the largest environmental impact statement done in North America," Slaiby added. As a result, any production "will be at least a decade away, and probably longer in the Chukchi."
Thick sheets of ice
The platforms that operate hundreds of miles out in the temperate Gulf of Mexico are of no use in the Arctic, where sheets of ice dozens of feet thick cover the water for much of the year.
Unlike Shell's exploratory drilling this summer, which was limited to a brief "open water" season when ice wasn't covering the sea, a year-round production schedule would demand robust equipment that could withstand icebergs, freezing sea spray and other weather-related threats.
Williams said the industry can draw on experience penetrating other frontier areas and adapt equipment engineered for similarly harsh offshore environments, such as the North Sea.
"I actually think we have good solutions to the technical challenges right now," Williams said.
Current cleanup methods are geared toward warmer water. Regulators will probably insist on new techniques for dealing with oil spills, including equipment to track the movement of spilled crude trapped under ice, and to clean it up. Monitoring options identified in a joint industry study include using oil-sniffing dogs, aerial surveillance, radar and buoys that could move with frozen crude.
Federal regulators will watch closely, vowed Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes.
"This is a frontier area we need to be cautious about," Hayes said. "We are not precluding obviously exploration and potentially production, but we recognize the sensitivities associated with the Arctic and the need to proceed with the best science and best technical input," while respecting the subsistence needs of Alaskan Natives who fish and hunt in the same waters.
Production platforms
Shell's potential production platform design would use a stadium-size base filled with concrete and iron, and have an enclosed facility looming high above the water to avoid deadly ice ridges. It would use a process known as brute-force engineering to withstand first-year, new ice that can pile up underwater, and multiyear ice, which tends to be made of a stronger, freshwater crystal because salt has migrated out.
Shell spokeswoman Kelly op de Weegh said the structure would weigh at least 100,000 tons and be a multibillion-dollar investment.
Existing Arctic pipelines provide a model of what could link Chukchi and Beaufort Sea wells with facilities on land, probably running across the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to connect with the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Station in Prudhoe Bay. Although the pipeline feeding BP's NorthStar facility on a man-made island 6 miles from the Alaska coast is a single-wall structure, two more recent Arctic projects use pipe-in-pipe designs that allow room for insulation and an extra barrier against leaks. Those pipelines are generally buried 6 to 9 feet below the seabed.
Duane DeGeer, manager of Arctic projects at the Houston design firm Intecsea, said research is already under way to discern how deep ice has historically gouged into the seabed of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, which would dictate how far down a pipeline would have to be buried. Pipelines also would have to be designed to withstand the possibility of water slipping through cracks in sea ice, eroding the sea floor and exposing buried pipe. And when pipelines make landfall, they would need to be kept underground long enough to clear decades of eroding shoreline to come.
Although federal regulators would have to approve the design decisions made by Shell or its competitors, there are no Arctic-specific standards that would govern those options.
Engineers, environmentalists and regulators sitting on the Interior Department's offshore safety advisory committee appear likely to recommend that the government impose baseline standards for Arctic offshore drilling, coastal production facilities and pipelines.
Cleanup difficult
Environmentalists insist that Arctic standards would help set a floor for protections in this remote and fragile region. They note that while accidents happen everywhere, when they happen above the Arctic Circle - even on land - they're much more difficult to clean up.
But Hayes said operations and safeguards in the U.S. Arctic can be a model for the rest of the world.
"We are very interested in being the leading edge here, of being a gold standard for Arctic exploration," he said. "Because regardless of what happens in the U.S., there is no question there is going to be offshore development ... in the other Arctic nations."
TEMPE, Ariz. -- Atlanta Falcons receiver Julio Jones has seen cornerbacks try to shadow him before.
They will follow him to both sides of the field and into the slot. They will be his personal spy and mirror his every move. They will be occupied with him all game. But they won't do it alone. Jones has noticed those cornerbacks can't do it alone. He often sees two-man coverage, with a cornerback matched up on Jones at the line of scrimmage and a safety helping from behind.
Jones has also seen teams put the weaker of their two cornerbacks on him, essentially throwing in the white flag before a pass is thrown, letting their better cornerback lock down the opposite side of the field.
That won't be the case Sunday.
Wherever Jones goes against the Arizona Cardinals, All-Pro cornerback Patrick Peterson will be waiting. If Jones lines up to the left of quarterback Matt Ryan, Peterson will be there. To the right? Peterson will be there, too. In the slot? Peterson, who rarely covers in the slot, will likely follow.
It'll be a matchup of the NFL's best receiver against one of the NFL's best press-man cornerbacks.
"He's definitely one of those mutants," Peterson said. "Somebody definitely created him in the lab somewhere with Dr. Doomsville or someone. The guy's unbelievable. He really is. I'm happy to say that I had an opportunity to start this little history with him between us."
Cardinals coach Bruce Arians said he won't have a chance to appreciate and enjoy what's unfolding between Peterson and Jones while it's happening in front of him live. He'll reflect on it in February when he reviews the season.
If he were sitting in the stands at the Georgia Dome this weekend with a beer in hand, Arians would be on the edge of his seat all game watching the two face off.
"I would really enjoy that matchup, because there's so much involved," Arians said. "It's not just Patrick and Julio. It's Matty Ryan and our pressure on him and the front four getting there. The great one-on-one matchups are always fun to watch."
There will be a difference this game for Jones. Peterson won't have help.
It will be Peterson on Jones -- no one else -- and Jones appreciates that about Peterson.

"Every once in a while, we'll get a guy that will match up and want to play that way," Falcons coach Dan Quinn said. "(Jones is) used to that, too, and I know Pat is, as well."
To Peterson, this is the type of game and the type of matchup that, when he retires, will help define his legacy.
"This game means a lot to me and it's important to me, as well, to go out there and have a good game, because Julio is the league's best receiver right now," Peterson said.
Jones is among the few receivers in the league who comprise the standard against which cornerbacks are measured. How Peterson fares Sunday could go a long way in dictating the public's perception of Peterson.
Facing Jones isn't, Peterson said, the same as facing an average or even an above-average receiver.
"It's a night and day difference, because I know I'm going to get 12 to 15 targets when I go up against Julio Jones versus any other receiver," Peterson said. "This way you have an opportunity to build your legacy when you go up against the league's best. We have a great history with one another."
Although Peterson thinks about the matchup, Jones doesn't.
"I don't pay attention to that at all," Jones said. "Pat P., he's a very talented guy but I'm not going to try to elevate my game or whatever it may be because I'm facing Pat P. Every week I get ready the same. I prepare the same way, try to stay consistent and not so much up and down."
They have faced each other since they were freshmen in the SEC in 2008, when Peterson was at LSU and Jones at Alabama. They were drafted back-to-back in 2011, with Peterson going fifth to the Cardinals and Jones to the Falcons at No. 6. Their rivalry continued in the NFL in 2012 and 2014.
It's that last game, however, that still sticks with Peterson.
Jones caught 10 passes for 189 yards and one touchdown in a 29-18 Falcons' win in what Peterson called "definitely one of my worst games of my young NFL career."
Sunday is a chance for redemption. This season, the playing field might be a bit more even -- even if Peterson has been dealing with an illness that left him a "little woozy" Thursday. He wasn't sure what the sickness was, but he was sent home from the Cardinals' facility Wednesday after vomiting before practice. He said he wouldn't miss the game Sunday "for nothing in the world."
During the first half of the 2014 season, Peterson was dealing with the undiagnosed symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. He was sluggish and overweight, checking in at 228 points at times that season. By comparison, he's been consistently weighing in at 203 this season. Peterson faced Jones in 2014 in Week 13, after the diagnosis. He wasn't sure, looking back, how much he weighed for that game. But Peterson wasn't the same cornerback he has been the past two seasons. Even Jones noticed he's lost weight and looks to be in better shape.
"He moves a little better," Jones said.
Peterson also faces Jones as a better all-around cornerback. He committed himself before the 2015 to learning how to study film better. Two years into his new routine, Peterson feels he's inside receivers' heads better.
"I know what they want to try to attack, what they're trying to do in certain situations," said Peterson, who said his football IQ and overall knowledge of the game have improved as a result.
That will be put to the test in one of the most anticipated receiver-cornerback matchups of the season.
"He's still a freak of nature," Peterson said of Jones. "The guy is unbelievable. He has very strong hands. To be that big and that strong and that fast, to have that total package as a receiver, for a (defensive back) that's a nightmare.
"I definitely have my hands full. He's an unbelievable competitor, and I know I'm going to get his best each and every time I go against him."
Back in September, I took my first stab at producing a “proper” piece of machinima. by that, I mean actually filming in-world and then editing the thing together, rather than just editing images and adding a soundtrack.
The results were mixed; while the PC had the omph to do things, I encountered issues with video formats and conversion which resulted in the first attempt suffering from degraded video quality.
Since then, I've not really had the time to focus on things as fully as I would like, but I have been tinkering as and when I can, and getting some guidance – I'd particularly like to thank Ormand Lionheart for her invaluable assistance and suggestions, and also (while he isn't actually a Second Life user), JN, who also came to my aid when I encountered issues with my updated editing software.
For my second test, I took the liberty of filming on Jordan Giant's evocative The Colder Water, about which I blogged back in August. The selection was based both on the fact that I love the environment and setting on the region, and the music I wanted to use, Doulogue by Javolenus seemed to fit the region.
The video is by no means perfect – had some issues with the actual recording when in-world, which has resulted in a slight jerkiness in the video. I also need a lot more practice with the Space Navigator (and get it set to my liking); but hopefully the improvements in overall quality can be seen, now I (sort-of) know what I'm doing.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nosy governments and nervous homeowners, among other drivers of the surveillance society, may soon upstage amateur photographers as the focus for big camera makers such as Canon Inc (7751.T) who spot growing opportunities in the security market.

Canon, the industry leader, has been hit with a sudden downturn in shipments of its top-end digital cameras, an increasingly saturated market sensitive to the recent slowdown in emerging economies and with a receding pace of innovation.
Add to that a compact camera market that has been battered by smartphones with increasingly high-resolution cameras, and companies like Canon have been left scrambling for new markets.
“A major focus for the next phase is increasing our business-to-business (B2B) sales, and of course security cameras - which is a huge market - is part of that,” Canon President and CEO Fujio Mitarai said in an interview.
Canon is looking beyond digital cameras - the last consumer gadget industry still dominated by Japan Inc - and targeting industrial and corporate clients, much like Japanese peers such as Panasonic Corp (6752.T) which fell prey to foreign competition in TVs and other consumer electronics.
Canon sees surveillance cameras, which research firm IHS forecasts will swell by two-thirds to a global market of $23 billion by 2017, as a wide-open playing field with no dominant suppliers and an ideal target for its B2B ambitions.
The company, which counts the U.S. Secret Service as a customer, aims to reach annual sales from the sector of about $1 billion during its next five-year plan from 2016, Mitarai said.
Panasonic said its security camera division posted sales of 13.4 billion yen ($136 million) in the latest quarter and it was aiming for annual growth of 15 percent. Sony Corp (6758.T) said it was also aiming to leverage its image sensor technology to become a major player in the sector.
B2B, OR NOT TO BE?
The market is booming as concerns mount over crime and security, even as headlines stir worries about covert governmental and corporate surveillance operations.
Japan is the third-biggest market for security cameras behind China and the United States, with the switch to networked digital systems from analogue CCTV devices stimulating demand even in saturated markets such as Britain, which had one surveillance camera for every 16 people in 2012, according to IHS.
“The market is growing quite quickly, and is forecast to grow the most in Asia,” said Jon Cropley, principal analyst for video surveillance at IHS. “But it's a highly fragmented and competitive market with lots of companies involved. Coming up with a unique selling point can be difficult.”
Canon says its lens and sensor technology will position it well to shoot to the top of the sector, which is packed with smaller firms but few major players besides Sweden's Axis AB AXIS.ST.
It faced a similar challenge when it targeted the then-fledgling digital camera market more than a decade ago: a fast-growing, fragmented market that was just beginning to mature, when it marched in with a broad product line and proceeded to dominate it. Canon claimed more than a fifth of the total digital camera market in 2012, and 43 percent of the high-end market for interchangeable-lens cameras.
But this year their reliable high-end camera business has turned unexpectedly sour, with analysts reversing a double-digit growth forecast to a double-digit decline.
Worldwide shipments of Canon's interchangeable-lens cameras fell 6.7 percent in the first six months of this year, a sharper decline than the industry average of 5 percent, according to International Data Corp (IDC).
“It appears over the past nine months the interchangeable market has entered a new phase of maturity,” said Chris Chute, research director of digital imaging at IDC, which last week reversed its forecast for the market of an 11.9 percent increase to an 11.3 percent drop.
“A strategy that camera companies have to take is to diversify away from one of their traditional reliably profitable markets,” Chute said. “If anything, I see Canon being one of the leaders moving away from the consumer sector.”
Mitarai, who returned to the helm last year to help turn around a slide in profit, says he is already steering the company in that direction in the hope of reducing its dependence on the consumer market for 70 percent of its sales.
He also said the company is constantly on the lookout to spend some of its 700 billion yen ($7.1 billion) cash pile on an M&A deal to achieve that - whether in security cameras or in another of the cutting-edge technologies it is exploring.

“Security cameras are going to become an important pillar for us,” Mitarai said. “We've already made it a separate division, and think that the global market has limitless possibilities for growth.”

Ted Cruz didn't have much luck getting live human online while making calls at Rep HQ's in FTW today, left this voicemail a few times. pic.twitter.com/rYxZ7Aabg0 — G.J. McCarthy (@gjmccarthy) October 5, 2016
Ted Cruz shook up the election season when he surprisingly endorsed Donald Trump for president. Considering how bitter these two behaved towards each other, that must have been a difficult thing to do. Now, the anguish of having to back your former rival is encompassed in a video of Cruz cold-calling voters to support Trump.
During the primary season, Cruz and Trump seemed to be bitter enemies. While Trump was hurling insults at Cruz's wife and his father, the junior Texas senator waited for his time to pounce. That comeback came in the form of Cruz's passive-aggressive speech at the Republican National Convention, where he told the GOP mass to “vote your conscience.” Cruz seemed to get the last laugh, but all the good he would have garnered for not selling his soul to Trump was extinguished when he did sell his soul to Trump.
Only Cruz really knows why he changed trajectories other than a rejection of Hillary Clinton. Perhaps he was promised a cushy cabinet position or saw the writing on the wall and knew hitching his wagon to the Trump train would ensure his reelection. But Trump hasn't seemed to forget about the RNC speech, for he has relegated Cruz to phone calling duties.
Dallas News photojournalist G.J. McCarthy captured Cruz calling from the Fort Worth, Texas Republican headquarters while asking residents for their votes. Cruz does not mention Trump in his message, but says this election is critical to the GOP. How the video footage is positioned amplifies Cruz's current position.
That is a look of a defeated man, who knows he may have made a huge mistake. And the irony of the cavalcade of Trump and Pence posters hanging above his head is not lost. Making the scene all the more depressing is how he had to leave a voicemail. Ted Cruz, once thought to be the golden boy of the GOP, is now relegated to positions held by college interns.

Mouton, who won four World Rally Championship events and is head of the FIA's Women in Motorsport commission, caused a stir last week when she said that she had no interest in Jorda's exploits.
"If I would suggest names of female drivers who have what it takes to make it to F1, I'd say Simona de Silvestro, Danica Patrick, Susie Wolff or even Beitske Visser, who is performing well in the Formula Renault 3.5 series," she said when asked about her views on Jorda.
"These girls have scored very good results in their career. Other less successful girls have managed to climb the motorsport ladder, but that has more to do with marketing strategies and political reasons, and I am not interested in that."
Surprised by remarks
Jorda is hoping to be able to drive a Lotus car at a filming day later this year, after beginning a development programme with the Enstone-based outfit earlier this season.
Speaking to Motorsport.com about Mouton's remarks, Jorda said that she was amazed Mouton had been so critical without fully understanding what she was up to.
"It really surprised me because if you don't know anybody – I don't know her, she doesn't know me – then you wouldn't talk about them like that," said Jorda.
"I haven't had the chance to tell her what is my programme. She had good achievements in rallying and she gave us a reason to believe in motorsport, but I don't think rallying is the same as F1. So, it really surprised me."
Open invite
Jorda says she is eager to invite Mouton to an F1 race so she can better understand exactly what her plans are with Lotus – and especially the high demands involved in driving a grand prix car.
"I was trying to make contact with her about two years ago, but we never managed to meet up," she said. "It has been hard to get in contact with her but I told her, 'look, come to a race.' It never happened.
"I am going to try again and I will tell her come here, and I will show her what I am doing, and what is an F1 car.
"Maybe she has driven an F1 car in the past but I never saw her doing anything close to F1. I don't have anything against rallying, it is a really good achievement what she did, but I don't know about rallying, and maybe she doesn't know about F1.
"I am happy for her to come, to show her and show my programme."
For some reason, Instagram has become the social-media app people use when they want to show the world some massive meal they're about to shove into their stomachs. How did this become a thing? Is the entire world competing in some contest to rack up the highest calorie count before choking to death on a Bloomin' Onion?
It seems like we could do better things with Instagram than share images of our peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with everyone, but a new artificial-intelligence project reportedly being developed by Google may (and I never thought I would say this) actually make Instagram and its food porn collection useful.
The AI project, unveiled at the Rework Deep Learning Summit in Boston last week, is called Im2Calories and aims to be capable of counting the number of calories in every item on a person's plate simply by examining a photo, according to Popular Science May 29.
Kevin P. Murphy, a researcher who works with Google's research lab and specializes in artificial intelligence and algorithms and theory, said the new AI uses "the depth of each pixel in an image" and "sophisticated deep-learning algorithms" to identify food, judge its size and come up with a calorie count. Murphy also said the photo of the food doesn't need to be high-definition for it to work, according to the Popular Science article.
Murphy said during his presentation that the AI may not get the calorie content correct in the first few tries but it will improve the more people use it and share the results.
Obviously, this new technology could be used to simplify food tracking and improve food diary apps and other nutrition software. However, Murphy noted at the presentation that his big hope is that the technology could be applied to more than just keeping us honest with our Weight Watchers coaches or deterring us from supersizing. He suggested the same AI could be applied in other ways, such as examining traffic patterns to help drivers find a parking spot.
Google spokesman Jason Freidenfelds told CNET that Im2Calories and the algorithms that run it are still at the research stage and that there are "no actual product plans at this stage." So don't get your hopes up yet: "We don't have more to say at this point on whether or how this might make its way into some future product(s), because we'd really just be speculating," Freidenfelds said.
However, can we really be sure we actually talked to a Google spokesperson and not just some supersmart form of AI that can learn how to answer press requests through repetition? We might already be through the looking glass, people.
I always love a good pattern… and this DIY Patterned Stationery makes me smile. Have you seen this week's free shape from Silhouette? Go ahead… take a moment to hop over there and download it, I'll be right here. Now, that you have it, I want to share how I made this cute patterned stationery set. It all started with a white pen. I tried the sketch pen, but the ink was too light for the textured surface of my cardstock. Sooooo, out came my pen holder with my trusty white sakura gel pen, et voila! A project was born! Want to DIY patterned stationery with me?
The What
The How
Step 1: I opened up the 2 shapes in Studio and resized them
Step 2: I created a small flat card shape (rounded rectangle) using the middle of the envelope as a guide. I then created the internal offset to crop the pattern
Step 3: Next, I made a faux liner to crop the pattern so that there is a border. To do this, I created an internal offset of the envelope, then used the rectangle tool to crop it (tip: you can duplicate this and use it later for envelope liners)
Tips: Before sending to cut, select your patterns, then use the penholder and pen to cut first (like the sketch pen) , then cut the cardstock with the blade
Once cut, I folded and glued with a brand-new set of notecards and matching envelopes!

The children, of course, are our future. But we still don't we have a great understanding of what young adults think, because most polls don't contact enough of them to get a clear sense of their views. In particular, it's hard to find accurate data on the opinions of young black, Latino and Asian Americans, even though the day is fast approaching when these groups will outnumber whites in the United States.
If you want to see where the United States is headed, you need to consult young people of color. That's what the Black Youth Project at the University Chicago and the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research aim to do in a massive series of polls over the next year.
“To our knowledge this is the first survey of its kind — the first ongoing, monthly survey of young people that focuses on major racial and ethnic groups,” said Jon Rogowski, a political scientist at Harvard and one of the researchers on the project, along with the University of Chicago's Cathy Cohen and Matthew Luttig.
This week, they released results from their first poll, conducted in June, which reveals that major racial and ethnic fractures remain among young people 18 to 30 years old. Millennials disagree sharply in their beliefs about racism in today's society, in their support for the Black Lives Matter movement, in their approval of President Obama, in their views on guns control -- and, of course, in their political preferences.
The report is another reminder that we are many generations away from becoming a post-racial nation. As the researchers point out, the data “make clear that race is still a factor in determining one's lot in life as well as how young adults see the political, economic and social world.”
What millennials think about politics
Millennial minorities in the survey overwhelmingly identified with Democrats, but whites were split down the middle: 44 percent leaned toward Democrats and 42 percent leaned toward Republicans. In this respect, the young white adults resembled their parents — in the general population, whites lean Republican 49 to 40 percent, according to Pew.
That white millennials have Republican tendencies is not that surprising. Exit polls in 2012 showed that among whites under 30, Republican Mitt Romney led Obama by seven points. This underscores the Republican party's demographic challenges. The GOP is still holding onto a large chunk of young white Americans, but it has struggled to attract minorities, who are becoming an increasingly large part of the electorate.
One surprise among Democrats is that black millennials favored Bernie Sanders to Hillary Clinton 53 to 39 percent. That's not too far off from the split among non-Hispanic white millennials, which was 62 to 32 percent in favor of Sanders, and it challenges the stereotype that Sanders solely appeals to white liberal voters. Among millennials who are Democrats, Sanders commands majority support across ethnic groups. (This pattern was also apparent among primary voters in the exit polls.)
What millennials agree on is that they would not be satisfied with a Hillary Clinton-Donald Trump matchup. A large majority, about 70 percent, said they would want someone from a third party to run. Millennials of all ethnicities agreed overwhelmingly that Trump should release his tax returns, and that Clinton should release her speeches to Wall Street.
They also all said that Donald Trump is a racist.
Their views on the state of the United States
The divide between young minorities and whites is also apparent in their views on policies.
Young whites are more likely to support airstrikes against the Islamic State, building a wall along the Mexican border and deporting undocumented immigrants. They also are more likely than blacks to say that transgender people should be allowed to use bathrooms of the gender they identify with.
Minorities are more liberal on economic issues. They are more likely than whites to support increases in the minimum wage and free tuition at colleges. They are more likely to agree with the idea that wealth in America should be more evenly distributed.
Some of the starkest differences, though, involve racial questions. “The media narrative of a tolerant generation of young adults — much of which was spun in response to young people's widespread acceptance of people based on their sexual orientation — does not easily apply as well to race,” the researchers write.
Minorities were much more likely to say that racism “remains a major problem in our society.” About 80 percent of black millennials agreed with that statement, compared with 74 percent of Latinos and 64 percent of Asians. Only 54 percent of white Americans agreed with that statement.
It may be surprising that even a majority of young whites believe that racism causes serious harm; when researchers asked that same question to adults of any age in 2008, only one-third of whites felt the same way.
The researchers found similar racial splits when they asked millennials what they thought of Obama's job performance — 86 percent of black millennials approved, while only 47 percent of white millennials did. And although a majority of young minorities supported the Black Lives Matter movement, only 41 percent of young whites did.
This survey, which will be the first of several, was based on an unusually large and unusually diverse sample of young Americans. The researchers contacted nearly 2,000 adults between the ages of 18 and 30: about 500 black, 600 white, 500 Latino and 300 Asian.
The large numbers of minorities meant that the margin of error for each racial or ethnic group was relatively narrow — about six percentage points in either direction. In typical national polls, the margin of error is often twice as large for minorities because they are less represented in most surveys.
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to Jon Rogowski as a political scientist at the Washington University in St. Louis. He is now at Harvard as of July.
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The love-hate relationship between Australia and India has added extra spice to Thursday's World Cup semi-final at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG).
There is no shortage of mutual respect between the two teams but as the two most powerful nations in contemporary cricket, they are also the fiercest of rivals.
With players on neither side willing to give any ground, their battle for global supremacy has led to some tense battles on and off the pitch, which have occasionally overheated.
The most infamous clash was during the second match of their 2007-8 series, played at the SCG. India lost the match in the final moments of the last day but that was only the start of the drama.
The Indians were furious that a number of key umpiring decisions had gone against them. Then their spinner Harbhajan Singh was charged with racially abusing Australia's Andrew Symonds in what became known as the ‘Monkeygate' scandal.
Harbhajan was banned for three matches, further upsetting the Indians, who responded by saying they were abandoning the tour and heading home. The International Cricket Council intervened, the charges were later downgraded and the team agreed to stay.
But the rivalry has remained to this day. In the lead-up to the World Cup, the teams played each other in a test and one-day series where tensions again threatened to boil over.
The Australian batsman David Warner and the Indian pair of Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan were all fined by the ICC after a row during the test series while Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc was given a warning.
When the teams switched to One Day Internationals after the test series, Warner was slapped with another fine after telling Indian opener Rohit Sharma to “speak English”.
With the match sold out and hundreds of millions of people expected to watch on television as the teams fight for a place in the World Cup final, all the ingredients are there for another explosive battle.
The players on both teams have already been warned about their behaviour but have shown no signs of backing down with so much at stake.
“They've spent a lot of time in the country so they've adapted well to the conditions, so it's no surprise they're up against us in the semi-final,” Australian all-rounder James Faulkner told a news conference before team training on Monday.

“I think they're a very strong team and we are as well.
“I think there always (is rivalry) in the game, if there isn't you've got problems.
“It's the nature of the game, it's a semi-final, it's cut-throat, there's going to be words said. It's going to be a really tough contest and both teams won't be backing down.”
PHOENIX (Reuters) - An Arizona man was found guilty on Thursday of plotting with others to attack a “Draw Mohammed” cartoon contest in Texas last year and providing material support to the Islamic State group, prosecutors said.

Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, 44, was convicted on all five charges against him by a federal jury in U.S. District Court in Phoenix stemming from the May 3 attack in the Dallas suburb of Garland that left his two alleged associates dead in a shoot-out with police.
The case against Kareem, also known as Decarus Thomas, was the first Islamic State-related prosecution to reach trial of the dozens brought by the federal government across the nation. It is the second jury verdict in such a case, as U.S. Air Force veteran Tairod Pugh was convicted earlier this month in New York.
“This verdict sends a strong message to those who support terrorists,” acting special agent in charge of the FBI's Phoenix division, Justin Tolomeo, said in a statement.
Kareem maintained his innocence and denied involvement in the attacks when he took the stand for two days in the federal trial. His attorney, Daniel Maynard, said he was very disappointed with the verdict.
“I obviously didn't do my job since I believe the jury convicted someone who is innocent,” Maynard said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
Kareem's roommates, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi, of Phoenix were killed by Garland police after they opened fire with assault rifles outside the May 3 cartoon drawing event.
The contest was intended to satirize Islam's Prophet Mohammed. It came months after gunmen killed 12 people in the Paris offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in what was said to be revenge for its cartoons depicting Mohammed.
Such portrayals are considered offensive by Muslims. None of the approximately 150 people attending the event in Garland in May were hurt.
The original indictment said Kareem supplied the two gunmen with arms and helped them prepare for the attack. He was later charged with showing support for the Islamic State militant group in social media posts, researching travel to the Middle East to train with terrorists and seeking to make explosives that could be used during last year's Super Bowl in Arizona, the most-watched U.S. sporting event annually.
Prosecutors said Kareem could face a potential sentence of at least 45 years in prison.
SHORTLY before four o'clock on the afternoon of Monday January 10th, Tunisians gathered around their televisions to listen to Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia's ruler since 1987, address the nation for a second time after three weeks of protests . Over the weekend the protests turned bloody, with at least 35 deaths in the region of Kasserine, near the town of Sibi Bouzid where the unrest started in mid-December.
To the disappointment of many Tunisians, Mr Ben Ali did not address the social and political grievances behind the protests, nor did he signal any willingness to change. The president promised to create 300,000 jobs for unemployed graduates within two years (though with no details on how this might be accomplished), but most of his speech consisted of threats against what he described as "hostile elements in the pay of foreigners, who have sold their souls to extremism and terrorism and are manipulated from abroad."

"It would have been better not to say anything," says Fares Mabrouk, a Tunisian activist in Paris who helps disseminate videos of protests uploaded from mobile phones. The footage has been shared around the world but few have seen it in Tunisia itself, where the internet is heavily censored and the authorities have recently been discovered swiping usernames and passwords from websites such as Facebook. "Millions were awaiting that speech. Ben Ali does not seem to understand the seriousness of the situation."
Mr Mabrouk does not come from the neglected central part of the country where the most violent protests have taken place. But like a growing number of more privileged Tunisians, he worries that an opportunity for reform is being passed over in favour of greater repression. The weekend's deadly intervention by police along with the mass arrests of protestors and a crackdown on bloggers who support them suggest the regime is panicking.
In an attempt to crack down on the demonstrations, schools and universities have been temporary closed. But that may simply free young people, who form the bulk of the protesters, to take to the streets. For the first time since he became president, the portraits of Mr Ben Ali that adorn many buildings have been ripped and burned, while anger mounts against him and his wife's family, whom many Tunisians believe have amassed a large fortune through corruption.
Some Tunisians hope that Mr Ben Ali will go the way of Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian dictator abandoned by his military after mass protests. Rumours, so far unsubstantiated, have spread that the chief of staff of the army, Rachid Ben Ammar, was dismissed after he told police not to fire on protesters.
As yet Tunisia's protests have had no clear leadership. The spontaneous outbursts of poorer regions have now been joined by trade unions. Members of the normally docile official opposition have issued statements urging Mr Ben Ali to prevent the police from using real bullets against protesters. General strikes are being planned later in the week, and a curfew was announced in Tunis on Tuesday. It is not clear where Tunisia's winter of discontent is heading, but it has gone beyond economic grievances and shows no sign of abating.
Neighbours who keep the curtains closed and a boy who likes to draw guns among 'suspects' of terror hotline
A schoolboy 'obsessed' with drawing pictures of bombs and guns, and a neighbour who liked to keep his curtains drawn, are among dozens of people being reported to a police scheme aimed to unearth potential terrorists.
Critics of the Channel Project say it encourages people to spy on their neighbours, but police claim the scheme's aim is to prevent 'vulnerable people' becoming radicalised.
Dozens of people in East Lancashire, mainly aged between 15 and 24, have been reported to police for having either extremist Islamic views, far-right leanings and or being IRA sympathisers.
Vigilance or spying? The Channel Project encourages people to report any suspicious behaviour to police. Critics say it could infringe on the right to privacy
Police complete background checks on all individuals reported before a panel meets to decide if any action needs to be taken.
Interventions can range from a simple chat, to a complex mentoring and counselling process.
Some cases include:
A school pupil who is obsessed with drawing bombs and guns;
A bus passenger expressing racist views;
New neighbours behaving oddly, including keeping their curtains drawn; and
A vulnerable loner who suddenly received visitors to his home at irregular times.
The information has not prompted any criminal investigations, with tip-offs coming from people in public sector jobs, including teachers, social workers and bin men.
But now police are urging the wider community to report their concerns to the hotline.
The pilot schemes set up in Blackburn and Burnley are two of 28 launched last November after concerns that many neighbours in Leeds had suspicions about the 7/7 London bombers but did not report anything to police.
Prevention: The Channel Project was in response to concerns that neighbours in Leeds had suspicions about the 7/7 London bombers but did not report anything
Opponents of the scheme say it could cause more harm than good - striking fear into communities. But police said it was 'not about spying, but identifying vulnerable people and helping them'.
Inspector Paul Goodall, the sceme's coordinator for East Lancashire, said the project aimed to target those with 'extremist views'. He said: 'We are looking at people who would not normally come on to our radar.
'In their behaviour they may not actually be doing anything wrong, but if we have concerns about how they could develop, it is our role to engage with that person.
'The Channel Project is all about supporting vulnerable individuals.
'This is a massive change for us because these people are not criminals. We hope and expect that the numbers of referrals will increase.'
Blackburn MP and for Justice Secretary Jack Straw said a fine balance needed to be found to protect the public and not infringe on people's privacy.
He said: 'The horror of terrorism is that he victims are chosen at random and as someone who was involved in an IRA attack in the 1970s I know hat it is one of those areas that the police cannot ignore.
'I am reassured that this project is in the hands of Lancashire police, who have a fantastic record in working with the community.'
Salim Mulla, chairman of the Lancashire Council of Mosques, said it was a 'step too far'.
He said: 'People in the community already know what their responsibilities are and people will report to the police if they see anything suspicious.
'I think this could just create fear among the community.'
SEATTLE – The Sloan Digital Sky Survey collaboration released the largest-ever digital color image of the sky today.
The new image consists of 1.2 trillion pixels and covers a third of the night sky, capturing half a billion individual stars and galaxies. Every yellow dot in the image (above) is a galaxy, and zooming in on each dot reveals a galaxy's detailed structure and individual star-forming regions.
"We have that sort of detail for this entire area," said astronomer Michael Blanton of New York University at a press conference here at the American Astronomical Society meeting. "It's not just really big, it's also really useful."
The survey has been taking multicolored images of the sky from a single 2.5 meter telescope in New Mexico since 1998 and releasing the photos to the public almost immediately. Its sharp shots of millions of galaxies laid the foundations for citizen science projects such as Galaxy Zoo, Google Sky and World Wide Telescope.
The first two iterations of the survey, called SDSS-I and SDSS-II, covered part of the sky called the northern galactic cap (bottom right in the image above). SDSS-III ran from July 2008 to December 2009 and completed the survey by covering the entire southern galactic cap (bottom left).
"What makes this a really special moment is that this release really completes the mission of the SDSS camera that's been going on for 11 years," Blanton said. The camera that took images in the part of the electromagnetic spectrum visible to human eyes stopped running in December 2009.
But SDSS will continue to take data in other wavelengths for several years. The new publicly available data dump (which is about 30 terabytes in size) includes spectra of millions of galaxies up to 7 billion light-years away, which will help astronomers understand the history of the universe and the effects of dark energy on cosmic structure. A survey called BOSS, which began in 2009 and will run until 2014, will convert the new 2-D image into the largest 3-D map of the distant universe.
SDSS-III also collected spectra from millions of stars as part of a survey called SEGUE-2, which will help astronomers identify streams of stars that the Milky Way stole from smaller satellite galaxies. Astronomers believe large galaxies formed by cannibalizing smaller galaxies that got too close. The remains of these hapless galaxies show up as streams of stars that still move as a flock through the Milky Way.
"For the parts of the sky where we have SEGUE-2 data, we can make a more complete census of these streams, and get a better idea of how our galaxy grew by seeing the remnants of galaxies that were torn apart by our own galaxy," said astronomer Connie Rockosi of the University of California, Santa Cruz.
"This is going to be a really unique reference for the next decade or longer," Blanton said. "It's a true legacy data set."

Le caribou des bois Howard Sandler
Ontario needs to change course if it is going to save the threatened and iconic boreal woodland caribou. Over the last five years, instead of fulfilling its federal obligation to create boreal caribou protection plans, Ontario undermined and weakened its own environmental policies. In 2013, Ontario exempted the logging industry from its Endangered Species Act's (ESA) most important protections, leaving boreal caribou vulnerable to the devastation caused by the rampant logging ravaging much of Ontario's boreal forest. In the absence of genuine action from Ontario to protect boreal caribou populations, this treasured species is expected to disappear from the province within the lifetime of many young children living today.
Boreal Caribou on the Brink
Boreal caribou in Ontario are rapidly losing their critical habitat, placing their future in jeopardy. They rely on intact forest and are highly sensitive to disturbance. Development, particularly logging, has reduced their historic range in Ontario by 40 to 50 percent, and they were already listed as threatened in the province when the ESA came into effect in 2008. Only two of Ontario's 14 woodland caribou ranges are considered “sufficient to sustain caribou,” and the provincial government's own report found that, at their current rate of decline, the species will be extinct in the Ontario in less than 77 years.
Ontario Undermining Caribou Protections
Instead of taking measures to protect the boreal caribou and support industries that sustainably use boreal forest resources, the Ontario government has undermined its own laws in order to prioritize industrial development. Controversially, in July 2013 the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) added 19 exemptions to its previously-renowned ESA, gutting many of the law's protections for at-risk species. These exemptions provide extensive loopholes for major industries, allowing logging companies to avoid meeting the core protection provisions of the ESA that had been put in place to protect Ontario's most vulnerable species.
Today, as long as they are operating under approved business-as-usual forest management plans, logging operations are exempt from the prohibition against damaging or destroying caribou habitat (see Section 22.1). This leaves most of Ontario's boreal caribou habitat completely vulnerable to intrusive and damaging logging activities.
In a 2013 Special Report, Ontario's Environmental Commissioner determined, “By effectively exempting most of the major activities on the landscape that can adversely affect species at risk and their habitats, the regulation thwarts the very purposes of the Act. There is no opportunity to promote the recovery of species at risk.” The Commissioner found that the exemptions “do not allow MNR to say ‘no'” to development in even the most at-risk habitats and concluded, “The opportunity to build the knowledge and capacity to deal with complex challenges facing species within MNR will be lost.”
Challenging the Exemptions in Court
Two Canadian environmental organizations, Wildlands League and Ontario Nature, challenged the exemptions before Ontario's Divisional Court. They argued the Minister of Natural Resources had not considered the exemptions' impact on individual species, as required under law. They also argued, as had the Environmental Commissioner, that the new exemptions were inconsistent with the purpose of the ESA, so their enactment was beyond the Minister's authority.
Without denying that the exemptions could harm at-risk species, the court found in favor of MNR's position that “harm to the species may be accepted in light of the social or economic benefits that will accrue.” In other words, it was acceptable for the ESA's goal of species protection to take a back seat to ostensible economic benefits (a particularly ironic tradeoff since, as NRDC recently discussed, forest workers are increasingly seeing their jobs disappear and their wages fall, even as logging in Ontario increases.) After the Ontario Court of Appeal also found in favor of the MNR, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected the environmental organizations' application for appeal in May 2017.
Caribou Facing Increasing Habitat Loss
There are very few protections left for Ontario's boreal caribou. Weakened by the 2013 exemptions, the ESA provides threatened species with little shield from habitat destruction caused by industrial development: the greatest threat to the boreal caribou. The province also missed the October 5, 2017, federal deadline for submitting caribou protection plans, even though it had five years to produce them. In addition, as a recent Wildlands League report outlines, Ontario's boreal caribou recovery strategy and conservation plans contain no enforceable protection for critical habitat.
Instead, Ontario has continued to allow rampant logging in caribou habitat, regardless of the health of the caribou populations living there. The impacts are alarming. According to Ontario's own data, from 2013 to 2015 anthropogenic (or human-caused) activity disturbed more than 287,000 acres of caribou habitat in southern ranges—an area the size of Los Angeles.[1] New maps produced by NRDC show rapid habitat degradation in two of Ontario's already degraded ranges, Brightsand and Churchill.
Ontario Must Prioritize Caribou Protection
Ontario has the opportunity to reverse its pattern of aggressively prioritizing industrial development over boreal caribou protections.
The province should immediately stop the expansion of the industrial footprint in the critical habitat of boreal caribou ranges that have exceeded 35% disturbance. In addition, Ontario should release long-term range plans to protect at least 65% of each herd's habitat – the minimum threshold to give the herd a 60% chance of long-term survival. In developing these range plans, Ontario should act in partnership with Indigenous Peoples and adhere to their legal responsibility to obtain free, prior, and informed consent from Indigenous Peoples.
In addition, Ontario should repeal the extensive Endangered Species Act exemptions for industry, and implement mandatory and enforceable protections for critical caribou habitat. Because the current exemptions shield logging companies from the ESA's prohibition against damaging or destroying boreal caribou habitat, they are incommensurate with meaningful caribou protections. Rather than giving the logging industry a free pass by gutting species protections, the province should support sustainable economies, including Indigenous-led initiatives.
Meanwhile, the federal government has the opportunity under the Species at Risk Act to protect boreal caribou in Ontario, now that the province has failed to submit timely caribou range plans. Canada should assess what areas remain unprotected, and step in to prevent the degradation of the country's most vulnerable critical boreal caribou habitat. This degradation threatens many Indigenous Peoples' ways of life and tarnishes Canada's international reputation as an environmental leader.
With each passing day, the likelihood of protecting Ontario's boreal caribou for future generations decreases. It is not too late, but the time for action is now.
‘The smallest minds and cowardliest hearts': Is Congress clapping for apartheid?
Mark Twain once described members of Congress as having "the smallest minds and the selfishest souls and the cowardliest hearts that God makes." Twain's mordant assessment provides a parsimonious explanation for the predictably rapturous reception that Bibi Netanyahu received there yesterday. All one can say about the vast majority of our courageous elected officials is that they aren't genuine friends of Israel, because every burst of applause was another nail in the coffin of the Zionist dream.
Why? Because Netanyahu's central message yesterday was an emphatic rejection of a genuine two-state solution. While professing to be willing to make major sacrifices for the sake of peace, his lengthy list of preconditions made it abundantly clear that he thinks Israel is entitled to rule the Palestinian population in perpetuity-even when it becomes numerically larger than Israel's Jewish citizens — and that the United States should back this effort no matter what. And even though the only alternatives to a two-state solution are 1) further ethnic cleansing, 2) a binational, one-state democracy, or 3) permanent apartheid, Congress is just fine with that.
It would be both tiresome and fruitless to fisk Netanyahu's speech in its entirety, but you can find intelligent commentary on it here, here, here, and here. And don't miss Lara Friedman's hilarious annotated version here. Among his various applause lines, my personal favorite was the claim that Israel has to keep its settlements because 650,000 people (i.e., about 10 percent of Israel's population) now live in them. (It's not entirely clear where Netanyahu got that number, as most estimates of the settler population put it "only" half a million or so.)
The key point, however, is that the settlements didn't sprout spontaneously, and the settlers themselves didn't just show up by accident. On the contrary, the vast majority of the settlers are there because every Israeli government since 1967 has actively promoted and subsidized the colonization of the West Bank, even though this policy is contrary to international law and at odds with measures such as U.N. Security Council Resolution 242. Not only does 242 say that Israel should withdraw from territories occupied in the Six Day War (the French version of the official text says "the territories") but it begins by emphasizing "the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force." The United States played a key role in drafting the resolution, and then effectively ignored its implications for the next forty years.
Some people still believe that settlement building was just a wacky project undertaken and backed primarily by religious extremists and by rightwing parties like Likud. In fact, colonization of the West Bank began under the Labor-led governments in the 1960s and 1970s, and governments of all stripes have backed it without exception. Read Gershom Gorenberg's Accidental Empire, Idith Zertal and Akiva Eldar's Lords of the Land, or Shlomo Gazit's Trapped Fools, and you will learn that settlement building was a deliberate policy designed to "create facts," so that future prime ministers like Netanyahu could claim it was simply impossible for Israel to withdraw. And the location of key settlement blocs like Ariel and Ma'ale Adumim were chosen to secure Israeli control over key aquifers and make it difficult-to-impossible to create a viable Palestinian state.
As I said in my previous post, Israel faces a choice — a two-state solution or apartheid — and it is now crystal-clear which one Netanyahu has chosen. I see this situation as genuinely tragic, as he is condemning several more generations to live in bitter conflict and putting his own country's future at risk. That's his privilege, I suppose, but America's blind support for this foolish policy is also a serious threat to U.S. national security. So if your Congressman or Senator was clapping loudly yesterday, you might drop him or her a note and ask why they care more about subsidizing an illegal and unjust occupation than they do about America's long-term welfare and well-being. You'll probably discover that Twain was on to something.
Sharethrough serves millions of ad requests daily, all on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS). At one time, sharing AWS credentials via a shared password vault worked OK. But as we grew, we needed a better, more secure way to manage AWS logins.
We use Terraform to maintain infrastructure and prevent unintentional version drift. Using it to maintain our AWS credentials seemed a logical choice. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) gives us the ability to create individual login (IAM user), assosicate users to a group (IAM group) and assign access control policy (IAM policy). Together, they offer a great solution for user, group and access management.
IAM in Action
In the example below, we are creating an iam_user mason who is a member of the stx iam_group . The stx iam_group is attached to the stx iam_policy with the access policy defined in stx.json. These files are checked into github to prevent drift, the same way we use Terraform to maintain other parts of our infrastructure.
Our Terraform directory structure looks like below. ( client , sam , sfp , and stx are teams within Engineering)
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 # Directory Structure ├── policies │ ├── client.json │ ├── sam.json │ ├── sfp.json │ └── stx.json └── production ├── aws.tf ├── iam_group_membership.tf ├── iam_groups │ └── iam_groups.tf ├── iam_policies │ ├── client.tf │ ├── sam.tf │ ├── sfp.tf │ └── stx.tf ├── iam_policy_attachment.tf ├── iam_users │ ├── client.tf │ ├── sam.tf │ ├── sfp.tf │ └── stx.tf ├── modules.tf ├── production.tfstate ├── production.tfstate.backup ├── temp.tf └── variables.tf
Tree Structure and Explanation
The iam_users directory contains files that create individual users:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 # iam_users/stx.tf resource "aws_iam_user" "mason" { name = "mason" path = "/" } output "mason" { value = "${aws_iam_user.mason.name}" }
The iam_group directory contains a file that creates engineering groups:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 # iam_groups/iam_groups.tf resource "aws_iam_group" "stx" { name = "stx" path = "/" } output "stx" { value = "${aws_iam_group.stx.name}" }
The iam_policies directory files indicate the group policy to use. Actual policies are defined in the policies directory. In this case, the stx engineering group is using the stx.json policy file.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 # iam_policies/stx.tf resource "aws_iam_policy" "stx" { name = "stx" path = "/" description = "Team stx policy" policy = "${file(\"terraform/policies/stx.json\")}" } output "stx" { value = "${aws_iam_policy.stx.name}" } output "stx_arn" { value = "${aws_iam_policy.stx.arn}" }
Policies are defined as json blob inside the policies directory. This policy allows full access to EC2 and S3.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 # policy file: stx.json { "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Action": [ "ec2:*", "s3:*", ], "Effect": "Allow", "Resource": "*" } ] }
The group membership file assigns an iam_user membership to an iam_group :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # iam_group_membership.tf resource "aws_iam_group_membership" "stx" { name = "stx" users = [ "${module.iam_users.mason}" ] group = "${module.iam_groups.stx}" }
The policy attachment file attaches an iam_policy to an iam_group :
1 2 3 4 5 6 # iam_policy_attachment.tf resource "aws_iam_policy_attachment" "stx" { name = "stx" groups = ["${module.iam_groups.stx}"] policy_arn = "${module.iam_policies.stx_arn}" }
At last, the module file maps where the resources are located to better organize the IAM identities :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 # module.tf module "iam_users" { source = "./iam_users/" } module "iam_groups" { source = "./iam_groups/" } module "iam_policies" { source = "./iam_policies/" }
AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
We use two-factor authentication (2FA) as additonal security for AWS logins. The Amazon SDK provides information to enable 2FA for users, but associating an MFA device to a user requires entering two authentication codes from the device. Creating such devices is not within the scope of the SDK.
To associate a MFA device with a user, we wrote a tool that uses oath-tool (to create a virtual MFA for generating the authentication codes) and google charts api to create a qr_code.
Code snippet of the 2FA associator
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 # save the qr_code into a markdown file to display on browser def write_qr_code_file username data = @mfa [ username ] File . open ( "qr_codes/ #{ username } .md" , "w" ) do | file | s = "<a href= \" #{ data [ :qr_code ] } \" rel= \" #{ username } \" >![ #{ username } ]( #{ data [ :qr_code ] } )</a>" file . write ( s ) file . write ( "
" ) file . close end end # generate a vMFA and capture the next 10 codes for user association def create_auth_codes base_32_string_seed , serial_number , username @mfa [ username ] = { base_32_string_seed: base_32_string_seed , serial_number: serial_number , qr_code: "https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chs=200x200&chld=M%7C0&cht=qr&chl=otpauth://totp/ #{ username } @sharethrough?secret= #{ base_32_string_seed } " } codes , stderr , status = Open3 . capture3 ( "oathtool --base32 #{ base_32_string_seed } -w 10 --totp" ) codes . split end
Conclusion
Balancing security with usability is tough. Terraform and IAM identities helped us make our systems more secure without hindering engineers. Engineers now have their own AWS access and secret keys saved in a credential file, and teams can focus on features, knowing that we have our bases covered.
Alfie Allen, better known to fans as Theon Greyjoy, was given a fake script to ensure secrecy — we're so excited to see what ACTUALLY happens!
The thrilling Game Of Thrones season finale is airing tonight, and one of the show's stars admits that even HE doesn't know how it all ends!
Alfie Allen, who plays Theon Greyjoy, says he has no idea how the final episode of the season will play out, the New York Daily News reports. After all, he thought he understood the rhythm of the drama — until the Thrones show-runners played a trick on him by sending a fake script!
“They kind of added a scene where Bran jumps out and stabs me in the chest and says, ‘This is my Winterfell, not yours,'” he said. “And [the instruction] goes, ‘Theon lies on the floor dead.' I think after about two or three weeks the guys I was shooting with said, ‘Guys, you should call him up and tell him it's a joke because he might be sitting there torturing himself, pulling his hair out.'”
The season finale airs June 3 at 9 pm EST on HBO.
Will YOU be watching the Game Of Thrones finale tonight, HollywoodLifers?

Outlander star Gary Lewis today launched a website for anyone interested in learning Gaelic.
The actor, who has starred on the big screen in films such as Billy Elliot and Gangs of New York as well as TV programmes including Silent Witness, had to learn Gaelic for his part as Colum McKenzie, the Laird and Chief of Clan McKenzie, in the TV series Outlander.
He was in his hometown of Glasgow to launch the new-look Gaelic learners' website, LearnGaelic.scot.
LearnGaelic.scot is the popular interactive website that provides a first stop for anyone interested in learning Gaelic with a new emphasis on adult learners.
At the launch, Gary was joined by Gillebride MacMillan, the celebrated Gaelic singer who plays Gwllyn the Bard in Outlander, and the Gaelic coach for the series, Àdhamh Ó Broin.
Gary said: "I have connections to North Uist where my wife's father hails from so I have enjoyed the Gaelic language for many years and have a strong interest in learning it.
"My role in Outlander has allowed me to gain my own respect for the language and the enhanced LearnGaelic.scot website is a great online resource which should help encourage other learners of the language."
Since it was first launched back in 2011, the LearnGaelic website has proven popular with Gaelic learners of all ages particularly the adult audience.
As well as the distinctive .scot url, the new design focuses the site's resources specifically on adult learners. The LearnGaelic.scot/dictionary has become the most comprehensive language tool for Gaelic learners containing 70,000 specially recorded sound files which give instant access to the correct pronunciation of Gaelic words.
New grammar and 'Use Gaelic' sections have been added as well as new resources being introduced on a weekly basis to provide fresh content for learners. A 'Watch Gaelic' resource has also been introduced offering learners the ability to view un-subtitled clips from BBC ALBA programmes with a Gaelic transcription, an English translation and vocabulary for each clip.
The site has grown significantly with a particular spike on Twitter following the launch of Outlander. Over the last year, covering the period June, 2014 May, 2015, over 207,000 unique visitors used the site, a 90 % increase over the same period the previous year (June, 2013 to May, 2014) and 412,103 site visits were recorded in total over the course of last year.
Alan Esslemont, head of content, BBC ALBA and executive producer of LearnGaelic.scot, said: "Since we launched back in 2011 we have noticed more people accessing information on smart mobile devices so a priority was to make it far more accessible and user-friendly for this audience.
"Online activity is a great means to help promote and enhance Gaelic language learning and as such we have witnessed a huge increase in the number of visitors using our site. The number of social media followers has also dramatically increased over the last year with the launch of Outlander contributing greatly towards the awareness of LearnGaelic's Twitter and Facebook pages.
"It has been fantastic to see the site grow in terms of its contribution to Gaelic learning and we are delighted to be offering an enhanced service with additional resources, interactive courses and learning tools for all abilities."

LearnGaelic.scot is a collaboration between Bòrd na Gàidhlig, MG ALBA, the BBC, The Board of Celtic Studies Scotland and Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, in co-operation with a wide variety of educational and Gaelic bodies and with the support of the Scottish Government.
Yuvraj Singh's Wife's Name Is Not Hazel Keech Anymore. She Is Now Called Gurbasant Kaur!
Yuvraj Singh's Wife's Name Is Not Hazel Keech Anymore. She Is Now Called Gurbasant Kaur!
Another wicket down! After Sir Ravindra Jadeja and Harbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh is the latest cricketer to get hitched. He tied the knot with British model turned actress Hazel Keech on November 30.
The wedding ceremony was nothing short of a fairytale and saw a bevy of celebrities in full attendance. What's more, the couple tied the knot not once but twice! Yes, you read that right! The first one was a private ceremony in Fatehgarh Sahib Gurudwara, located 40 kms away from Chandigarh and the other was a full-blown filmy affair in Goa.
Interestingly, during the Gurudwara wedding, Hazel was often referred to as Gurbasant Kaur. While many eyebrows were raised, it was later revealed that on the suggestion of Sant Baba Ram Singh Ji, Hazel's name has been christened to Gurbasant Kaur.

While we all know that Yuvraj and his mum Shabnam Singh are ardent followers of the saint, looks like even Hazel has started following him as well. However, Yuvraj's dad is one member who has openly opposed the idea of following religious gurus. In fact, he even gave his own son's wedding a miss due to the involvement of the baba.
According to reports, Shabnam Singh has even praised daughter-in-law Hazel's spirituality in the past.
“She has met our Guru ji a couple of times and she follows him truly and with full dedication, as she understands we cannot question our Guru Ji. We all know how he saved Yuvi from cancer and helped in bringing my boy back to life,” she had said.
Well, to each their own,right?
From a mythological standpoint I can understand (Hint: marketing) how God might have created Earth specifically as the unique cradle of life for the whole universe but why did he go to such extremes with the other planets in our solar system? Why weren't they simply seven more cookie-cutter-Earths minus the RNA? Why gas giants and airless rocks and asteroid belts and literal fiery Hells? (Right about now Venus' ears would be burning if they weren't already literally burning. If it had ears, which it doesn't, so never mind.)
Speaking of the asteroid belt, thanks, God, for that simply aDORable ring of potential civilization-killers circling old Sol. It's almost like burying Claymore mines outside the local nursery. I'm pretty certain He thought that Mars and Jupiter would be better neighbors, leaving the potential new planet alone but noooOOOOOoo, they had to start throwing their gravitational leaves on each other's lawns. It's conceivable that His intent was to employ it as a future navigational gauntlet against human probing of the outer reaches of the solar system. If so, it's Science: A Whole Bunch, God: Zero-Zip-Nada. At least so far.
The wild diversity in planet geology offers an indication that God possibly approached the whole concept of planet-building with the eye of an artist but the least He could have done was leave better clues to his handiwork, like a signature on the back side of the Moon or a smiley face on Europa or a big heart on the surface of Pluto…
Uhhhh, never mind.
Two people are dead and three are injured after a train derailed in Woss, a small community on northern Vancouver Island.
Officials say a logging train derailed around 8:45 a.m. on Thursday in the Cougar Crescent area of Woss, a hamlet about 130 kilometres north of Campbell River.
David Rushton, the regional district director of Woss, says it's devastating for the small community of 190 people.
“Even to this point tremendous support and it's reassuring to know that it's there,” Rushton said. “My understanding is that we're having counsellors coming down and that people will certainly take advantage of that.”
Unconfirmed reports say a train with as many as 11 rail cars filled with logs may have been on a runaway trip down the tracks. It came upon a maintenance crew working along the rail tracks.
The injured workers were airlifted to hospital, including one who had been trapped under the logs for more than four hours.
“The efforts to get the final patient out were nothing short of heroic, there were a lot of logs to be moved,” said Nat Pottage, Port Hardy's Unit Chief.
The rail line's owner says the train was carrying Western Forest Product personnel and material.
"We are saddened to report an incident with a train derailment in Woss,” president and CEO Don Demens said in a press release. “The safety and security of our staff and the communities where we work are paramount."
The company says it's cooperating with authorities.
It's not yet known what caused the train to derail.
RCMP Island District General Investigation Section is investigating along with the Coroners Service, the Transportation Safety Board and WorkSafeBC.
More investigators are expected on scene Friday.

A number of former players have followed Bob Bradley's path into coaching.
Bob Bradley's last gig in Major League Soccer ended in 2006, but his influence on the league remains stronger than ever. And, judging by the number of coaches who have been developed by Bradley, soccer in the U.S. will carry his mark for some time.
This season, three "Bradley guys" are head coaches of MLS teams and another 13 are in assistant roles. Bradley-influenced coaches are on staffs of more than half the league's 20 teams and several have been head coaches in Africa, Europe and the U.S.
This group has been influenced and inspired by Bradley, but not all are "Bob Clones." They range in age from 35-year-old Jim Curtin, the youngest head coach in MLS, to Preki Radosavljevic, the Sacramento Spirit coach who is six years younger than the 57-year-old Bradley. Some, such as Curtin and the New York Red Bulls' Jesse Marsch, played for Bradley for nearly their entire careers. Others, such as Peter Nowak, who guided D.C. United to the 2004 MLS Cup title, and Hristo Stoichkov, who coached in South Africa before becoming a TV pundit in the U.S., joined Bradley's teams as their playing careers were finishing.
And it is not as though Bradley built this contingent simply through longevity. Twelve players from his first head coaching position, the 1998 MLS Cup- and U.S. Open Cup-winning Chicago Fire, went into coaching; seven of those have been or are head coaches of professional teams.
Bradley might not have set out to establish a coaching development system, but his methods have encouraged many to follow his path.
"I'm excited guys appreciated the environment we created and they learned from that environment and had a passion for it," Bradley said recently from Norway, where he has led Stabaek to a 6-1-1 (19 points) record so far this season, good for second place in the Tippeligaen. "And now they have a chance to do it."
Bradley's enthusiasm and purposefulness sparked many proteges.
"Everyone around Bob becomes a student of the game," Curtin said. "He has a way of questioning and challenging you and getting the most out of you. My second year with him I realized I wanted to be a coach. The environment Bob created, he challenged players to kind of think as coaches, as well. He's a guy I looked up to, a father figure, and I didn't want to let him down."
Bradley's most dedicated follower is probably Marsch, who played for him at Princeton University and on three MLS teams. When Bradley was in charge of Egypt's national team two years ago, Marsch and his family paid a visit to Cairo while on a six-month, around-the-world backpacking trip.
"That would not have been Bob's cup of tea," Marsch said of the trip. "Bob's work ethic was more than any person I've ever seen in my entire life. His attention to detail, preparation, what he put into his work and his job every day was very contagious within the team. It was very apparent how thorough he was at every level. You knew you went into matches more prepared than the opponent."
Bob Bradley spent two years managing the Egyptian national side.
Bradley is not one to get away from it all. A bike ride to Bradley means an early-morning session on a stationary bicycle viewing a video of upcoming opponents.
"I'm a man of many routines," Bradley said. "I try to find a way, some type of workout, to combine physically and mentally. It's important to stay sharp and look at games and teams."
Bradley's influence on how the game is played is going to remain strong. So, what does that mean for the style of play we are going to be experiencing?
Bradley based his coaching methods on several models. When Bradley was at Princeton in the early '90s, his teams mirrored AC Milan's tactics down to placing Marsch in the role of Demetrio Albertini in midfield, another Tiger taking on Franco Baresi's libero position, another playing as Paolo Maldini, and so on and so forth.
Along the way, Bradley has copied, pasted and experimented.
The Chicago Fire's 3-5-2 was built around Lubos Kubik's playmaking ability from the back. His U.S. national team tactics freed up Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan to attack from midfield and provided a launching pad for Jozy Altidore and Charlie Davies in a two-forward setup.
Bradley tries to combine high-pressure defending with a composed, possession game offensively.
"His soccer was more about possession, keeping the ball, looking to counter-attack when it's on," New England Revolution assistant coach Tom Soehn said of Bradley. "I think it was a balance of playing direct and, now, keeping possession. Because once you've played direct you've got teams back and now you can balance your possession a little more.
"He coached with Bruce (Arena) and coached college, and wherever he went he picked up a style. For me it was a style I enjoyed because it was a combination of possession and pressure and creating opportunities because you pressured well. What you can say about Bob was his teams were always organized, both offensively and defensively. Soccer is a game of mistakes and capitalizing on those mistakes and he always prepared you to first cause mistakes and capitalize on them, as well."
Bradley proved himself early on, winning over a veteran contingent he recruited from Europe in his first professional coaching position in Chicago.
Bob Bradley managed the U.S. national team for five years, leading the Yanks to the round of 16 in the 2010 World Cup.
"I don't like to compare coaches or teams," recalled Stoichkov, now a commentator for Univision in Miami. "But it was a fantastic experience. He was a very competent, very prepared coach.
"Bob Bradley was first of all a coach, then a friend, and he was like a father to the players. They learned football from him, he gave them confidence. He showed them, he explained things to them. I think there are very few coaches who work like Bob Bradley. In the game now, the technical and video aspects are becoming more advanced and, even then, he was very prepared. He knew all about the opposing team and how each player needed to train."
Asked to cite influences, Bradley talks about France in the early '80s, guided by Michel Hidalgo (Bradley and Bruce Arena attended the 1984 European Championship); the Milan teams of Fabio Capello and Arrigo Sacchi; Jupp Heynckes' Bayern Munich and Jurgen Klopp's Mainz; Marcelo Bielsa. Bradley observed training sessions of the top clubs and was impressed by the hands-on practices of Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho, but also by Sir Alex Ferguson's style of delegating training ground responsibilities. There does not seem to be a limit to the systems he's studied.
Bradley's initial guide to the coaching world, though, was low-profile and local: German-born New Jersey resident Manny Schellscheidt, who remains a point of reference.
"Manny is older, so they would talk about the game in different ways," said Philadelphia Union assistant coach Mike Sorber. "And if you listen to those two talk, there are certain things he agrees with Manny on, but there's more to it than just how Manny sees it.
"As much as there are discussions with Manny, a lot of his stuff came from experience -- Ohio University, Bruce (Arena), Princeton. He tries endless ideas."
Lacking a professional league to provide coaching models, Bradley, Arena and others drew inspiration from other sports, as well as soccer.
"Bob is a very bright guy," Schellscheidt said. "He's as dedicated as anybody can be. He will do everything to be in form and get a leg up. He wants to make sure there's not too many surprises when his team hits the field.
"He puts the time in and he's not a guy who rests on a little bit of success. He's one of these guys that gets consumed with his job. It's in his blood."
Said Marsch: "There are so many opinions of who he is. Some get who he is and there are some misconceptions, but one thing, he's pushed the envelope wherever he is. The coach he was 20 years ago, 10 years ago, five, is very different than the coach he is now. He's grown so much and refined his philosophy and stayed current with the modern game. He's never satisfied."
Illustration: Simon Letch Our industrial heritage has probably contributed. For much of the first half of last century, the idea that the man brought home the bacon was enshrined in Australia's highly regulated wage fixing system – the basic wage for males was set at roughly twice the female rate on the premise that men were responsible for families' finances. But the male breadwinner model no longer makes much economic sense. Young women have been investing heavily in higher education as they prepare for long, well-paid careers. Female graduates have outnumbered their male counterparts for many years – 60 per cent of Australians who completed a university course in 2014 were women. Even so, the enduring strength of our male breadwinner model means many of those well educated, highly productive workers are relegated to secondary earners when they have children. Some quit the workforce altogether. Meanwhile, an army of less well-trained males keeps soldiering on full-time.
A man's world: Men still tend to be primary breadwinners in the family. Credit:Louise Kennerley Only 57 per cent of mothers whose youngest child is aged under five participate in the labour force (mostly part-time) compared with 94 per cent of fathers in that category. The gender gap is even wider among full-timers with small children. Analysis by Macquarie University's Professor Gabrielle Meagher found that in 2012 about 85 per cent of all fathers with the youngest child under the age of five worked full-time but for mothers in that category, the rate was only 19 per cent. The long-run increase in female workforce participation has stalled for women aged between 25 and 55 years – in that well-educated cohort participation has been relatively static for more than a decade. It's surprising women's workforce participation, and the work and family policies that underpin it, figured so little in the recent election campaign. There may be no better way for Malcolm Turnbull to deliver on his vision for growth, innovation and budget repair than by increasing the involvement of women in the labour market. It promises to simultaneously lift productivity and bolster the federal coffers. A higher rate of female workforce participation, especially full-time, would also help redress an enduring economic challenge – the enormous gap between male and female superannuation balances.
Traditional views on gender roles, especially in child rearing, have helped preserve the status quo. The University of Queensland's Dr Francisco Perales, who researches attitudes to gender, says adherence to traditional gender roles is relatively strong in Australia compared to other developed nations. Things are changing, but slowly. "While it is still quite prevalent for people to think women should fulfil a traditional homemaker role and be the secondary earner and so on, our research shows a modest trend towards more gender egalitarianism since 2001," he said. But it's not just community attitudes that discouraging women from working more. Experts warn government policies to help parents balance work and family have been going backwards.
The high "effective marginal tax rates" on women returning to work after having children – a feature of Australia's tax and welfare system – have helped entrench mothers as secondary earners. Then there's our broken childcare system. The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey, released last week, underscored the need for change when it revealed the average family spend on childcare each week has been growing much faster than household incomes, despite costly government subsidies. Childcare reforms unveiled in the 2015 budget have been postponed because savings to offset the cost of the new scheme were blocked in the Senate. Some of the proposed changes are positive and long overdue but they are unlikely to deliver a major boost to female workforce participation. To do that, Australia's childcare system will require a complete overhaul, not more tinkering. Patricia Apps, professor of public economics at the University of Sydney, argues that if childcare worked more like the school system – where admission is universal and inexpensive for parents – women's workforce participation would surge, savings would improve, the tax base would grow and the fertility rate would rise. She estimates the costs of a universal childcare system would be far outweighed by the economic gains.
"What the government doesn't seem to recognise is if they increased female labour force participation they would make billions," she said. Without sweeping change to the childcare regime the male breadwinner model is likely to linger for some time yet. Matt Wade is a senior writer. Ross Gittins is on leave.
Can you hear it? A voice, booming and boisterous, blowing in upon the cool winds of autumn. A voice that beckons you to come sit a spell and play a good ol' videogame. “They don't make ‘em like this no more,” it says. “Well…most don't. That's why we need to sell a bunch'a copies, so they'll get right to making Zwei 3! Yes siree, with Falcom's storied lineage of action RPGs, it'd be a slam dunk! Ghahahaha!” That voice…is my voice, broad as the sea and hearty as a meal that consists solely of potatoes and slabs of meat.
That's right, true believers, it's Nick, here once again to share with you the myriad fascinations of working in videogame localization. If you've been keeping up, this is the fourth blog I've written about the upcoming release of Zwei: The Ilvard Insurrection. The first entry gave a basic rundown of what the game is like and what you can expect from it, while the second entry went into more depth about the localization work and the nuances of character writing. The third entry was a progress report, detailing where we were in the QA cycle and why we'd be missing our summer release date.
Today, I'd like to tell you a story: the tale of how Zwei: II ended up with the expanded English voice acting it now boasts. Although this news has been known ever since we officially announced the game, I haven't seen much discussion surrounding it, but the process of how “let's add voice acting” went from pie-in-the-sky thought to reality is one I think you'll find fascinating.
See, the interesting thing isn't that we added English dubbing to Zwei: II. We weren't able to secure the rights for the original Japanese voices, so it was pretty much a given we were going to do a dub. No, the most interesting part is that the dub adds a LOT more voicework than was present in the original. Why did we do that? How did we decide what to dub? And how much more is there, exactly? This and more I shall unfold for you, dear reader!
Zwei: II was designed without voice acting in its story scenes, and it holds up perfectly well that way, as classic RPGs do. But, that said, Zwei's story is very driven by its outsized personalities. The characters really sell the scenes, and while I wrote for each of the characters in such a way as to accomplish that without the need for voice acting, their sometimes-cartoonish gusto and theatricality seemed like they'd be even more colorful when brought to life by VAs. I talked with the big boss, Ken, about the prospect, and he told me to put together a script so we could have the studio price out how much it would cost us.
To be honest, I'm still kind of surprised Ken was open to it. After all, Zwei: II isn't a console release of a modern title – it's a PC release of an older title. Maybe that goes to show how well-received Japanese games have been on PC in the last several years. Personally, I think a well-received game like Cold Steel leading the charge as far as “adding additional voice acting to a PC port” did a lot to open the door for a more modest title like Zwei to get a significant bump in voice acting. But success here provided my first challenge: putting together a script.
Now that adding more voice acting was on the table, the question then became, “Okay, so what do we actually voice?” All the battle stuff was covered at a bare minimum due to the fact that it was in the Japanese voice script, so the natural answer was, “Let's just voice all the main story.” That's a reasonable target, and not exceedingly difficult to pull from the full game script, since many of the main story scenes are positioned just before and after the game's major boss battles. I began to assemble a “story scenes” voice script with all the scenes I thought most essential to conveying the game's narrative, breaking it down scene by scene. After handing off a first draft to the studio and getting their estimate, I was given the green light, since it had apparently come in under what we were expecting.
But of course, ever being one to press my luck, I said, “Wellllll…actually there are a couple more scenes I COULD include!” And with a resigned sigh from Ken, I went back in and added a few scenes I had opted to leave on the cutting room floor during my first draft. As things stand, the new voice script's coverage of story events isn't perfect – there's still one boss battle that has its before/after scenes unvoiced (I chose that one to drop because I felt that what was expressed there is also expressed in other voiced scenes well enough), but such are the choices one has to make at the crossroads of idealism and budgetary limitations.
The whole “voicing scenes before and after boss battles” approach worked well because it set up a good amount of consistency as to when players could expect to hear something voiced. It also, by the very nature of the scenes chosen, is really good at building the personalities of the game's antagonists – which is helpful since they do a lot to spur Ragna and Alwen's growth.
The unfortunate downside to my scene-selecting methodology is that I didn't get to include many scenes outside of those. There are only two voiced scenes that aren't tied to before/after boss encounters – one in which Ragna talks about his past (which I thought gave good insight into his character), and a key one at the very start of the game in which Ragna discovers that Alwen is, in fact, a vampire, and they have their first long discussion about their blood contract and how Ragna wants to be equal partners. That's such a defining scene that sets up both protagonists perfectly for everything that is to come that there was never any doubt in my mind that I wanted that one voiced.
At this point, let's stop for a moment and examine the script. The original Japanese script was 808 lines. The number of lines in the new voice script, however, clocked in at 2807. That's basically 2000 newly voiced lines, all story. And while it may not seem gigantic in light of a game like Trails of Cold Steel, you'll certainly be able to feel the presence of the voice acting as you play through the game. Ragna and Alwen in particular saw massive increases: from 88 and 89 to 724 and 548, respectively. We even picked up an entirely new character who had no lines in the original Japanese voice script but did factor into several of the story scenes I had selected!
When casting, I conferred with both Tom and Kris to get their general impressions, and to solicit suggestions in cases where I didn't have any particular VA in mind. Zwei: II is a game that wears its heart on its sleeve, so I was casting with an ear toward a “Saturday Morning Cartoon” feel – expressive voices that have a touch of exaggeration in them. It was a different feel than we'd chased when casting for Trails of Cold Steel, but it got us the sound we were looking for.
Recording took six days, with a stream of VAs coming in to lend us their talent. John accompanied me for the first couple days, while Tom helped in the latter half, both lending some much-welcomed aid by helping me keep track of any changes we made to lines during recording while I was focusing on the line deliveries. To level with you a bit here, I've never been the most organized person, so the voice recording process, with its focus on having everything triple-checked and accounted for, has always felt pretty daunting to me. After all, there's always that cold dread that you'll have an actor in the booth and suddenly, some problem with the script files will pop up, costing you precious time when every minute has value. Thankfully, there were no complications with Zwei's recording – it was actually a pretty smooth, pleasant time (though very busy). Some of our VAs I had worked with before, so seeing them again and trying them in different-sounding roles was fun. Other VAs I was meeting for the first time, and I enjoyed getting to see them at work, as well as seeing what kind of vocal ranges they could pull off (always helpful when we're brainstorming voice casts for future projects).
Our voice director was someone I'd met before, and in fact someone I requested by name after discerning how deep his knowledge ran concerning things of the nerdy persuasion. For Zwei, I didn't want to take a chance on a director that only had a surface-level understanding of anime – I wanted to be able to throw out oddly specific requests like “Play it more like X from the series Y!” and have them understand the voicing intent behind that and translate it into instructions the VAs could make sense of.
Talking with him over the course of the project was a mile-a-minute ride, but among all the really nerdy stuff we talked about, one common thread that really stuck with me is his identification of Zwei as a “pulp story.” Before then, I'd approached Zwei in my mind from that anime-centric perspective it so clearly embodies, but our conversations got me wondering how, as a fan of pulp-style stuff, I'd never consciously made that connection before. In another universe where Zwei wasn't a Japanese videogame, it feels like it'd be a natural fit as a weekly radio serial. The character influences I mentioned in my second blog post all led to “pulp” too, when I followed the strings back.
Back at work, I reviewed all the voice files and marked the ones that needed filters applied, as you do when, for instance, someone is talking to a character telepathically or is possessed by a demon (y'know, your general RPG happenings), and we got them into the game. There's something of a sense of trepidation that comes when you finally drop all those voices into the game proper. You hold your breath, thinking, “That was so much work… I reeeeeeally hope this sounds good!” Fortunately, our VAs didn't disappoint, and hearing some of my favorite scenes brought to life through performance really helped sell the emotion of the scenes, just as I'd hoped at the outset.
Now, maybe you're not fond of dubs. Or maybe you're a purist, wanting to experience the game without the addition of a bunch of voice acting that wasn't in the original. Believe me, I totally understand you. Thankfully, the voice volume is on a separate slider, so you can crank it down and read through at your own pace, with the voices you imagine the characters to have. That kind of experience is fun too, I think, and I'm interested in what those of you who play it both ways think about the ways in which the dub shapes how one perceives the story and characters.
Of course, for you fans of RPG dubs, I'm also interested to discover which characters will become fan-favorites and which lines will be the most entertaining and memorable. Our programmer, Sara, has even gone above and beyond with filled-out lip flap for the dubbed scenes! In the original game, there's a brief lip-flap that's tied to the scroll-out speed of text in a character's text box. What that means in practice is that their mouths move for about a second while the text is displaying, then once it's all there on screen, their mouth doesn't move anymore. It's a perfectly sensible setup for a game without voiced story lines, but in the cases where lines were voiced, I wanted the lip flap to continue as long as the voiced line was still playing. From the sound of it, it took some real doing, but the lip flap does indeed now track to the length of the voice clip in cases where story lines are voiced. It might seem to be a minor detail, but I think it's details like this that help make the experience feel well integrated and authentic.
In any case, you won't have to wonder too much longer what the game sounds like, because it's finally out in less than a week, with a Trueblood vampire-approved release date of October 31st. I hope you'll enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed working on it. After all…everyone could use a little more PASSION in their souls!
In 2015, after a sexually explicit, mainly online relationship with a woman ended, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) threatened to report the woman to the Capitol Police, according to a recording obtained by The Washington Post. Barton had reportedly sent the woman sexually explicit photos, videos, and messages over the course of their relationship, which began on Facebook in 2011.
The woman, who spoke to the Post on the condition of anonymity, recorded the 2015 conversation in which Barton confronted her about communications she had with other women connected to Barton. "I am ready if I have to, I don't want to, but I should take all this crap to the Capitol Hill Police and have them launch an investigation," he said, according to the recording.
On Wednesday, Barton apologized to his constituents after naked photos of him circulated on social media. In a statement, Barton, who is the longest-serving member of Congress from Texas, said he had sexual relationships "with other mature adult women" while separated from his second wife, before their divorce in 2015. "I am sorry I did not use better judgment during those days," he said. But Barton, who has reportedly hired a crisis communications firm, also said that he had suffered a potential crime over the released lewd photos. In Texas, it is a misdemeanor to intentionally publicize images or videos of someone's genitals or sexual activity without consent. Barton said the Capitol Police may be launching an investigation.

The latest set of statistics released by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) show that while Australia still remains strong in mobile subscriber penetration, the country is slipping down the ranks for the number of fixed broadband customers per capita.
The statistics released overnight revealed that at the end of December 2013, there were slightly over 6 million fixed broadband subscribers in Australia, equating to roughly 26 percent of the total population. The majority of these customers were on DSL technology at 21.2 percent, versus 4.1 percent on cable, and 0.7 percent on fibre.
The result is an improvement for Australia, up from 25.6 percent penetration as of June 2013, but slight gains in other OECD countries put Australia down from tied 18th with Austria down to 21st.
The statistics, provided to the OECD by the government also indicate that despite the rollout of the NBN picking up momentum in the second half of 2013, the percentage of Australians connected via fibre somehow dropped from 1.97 percent to 0.7 percent.
Switzerland topped the list with 44.9 percent of its citizens with fixed line broadband, followed by the Netherlands, Denmark, France, and Korea.
Turkey was at the bottom of the rankings, with just 11.2 percent of its citizens connected to fixed broadband.
Growth in mobile remained as strong as ever, although Australia lost its top ranking for mobile subscriber penetration for the half to Finland, which now has a 123.3 percent penetration rate, Australia still came in second at 114.4 percent penetration, or a total of 26.4 million subscriptions for a population of 23 million.
Australia was ahead of Japan, Sweden, Denmark, Korea and the United States, which for the first time reached 100 percent penetration, with over 300 million mobile subscribers.
Mexico was at the bottom of the list, with 14 percent of its citizens with a mobile subscription.
When folks think about Merle Dixon, it is not all positive. We saw Michael Rooker play this character with an amazing kick butt performance that left us hating him, loving him, and sometimes really mad at his words and actions. For every time we got to see him as a loving, protective brother to Daryl, we saw him say something racist or do something to unnecessarily put a character in danger.
Recently, Michael Rooker spoke with The San Antonio Current about playing one of the most polarizing figures every to grace The Walking Dead. Here are some of the best excerpts from the interview:
One of the most interesting things about Merle is the deep fan reaction he elicited. What do you think it was about Merle Dixon, who is definitely not the nicest guy in the world, that made people love him so much?
I think Merle had a little bit of everybody in him. All of us can be not the nicest people in the world, but we all have this inner core when it comes to family that everybody can relate to, and we all wanna think that we would pay the ultimate price for one of our loved ones. That struck a real chord, and I think because of that this character has become even more popular after his death than he was during his life on The Walking Dead. I notice it in the Comic-Cons, and on the street, and in places like the ArcLight Theater. I was walking down the street, and a lady who does the caramel corn came out from working just to stop me and ask if she could give me a hug. I said, “Of course!” And she almost started weeping. She gave me a hug, and then asked, “Can I give you something?” She took me back inside and gave me the freshest caramel corn she had finished making — I tell you, that stuff would just melt in your mouth.
You're talking here about Merle's racist aggression towards T-Dogg, and his comments to Andrea and the others immediately before and after Rick chains him to the pipe in “Guts” (Season 1, Ep. 2). I remember thinking at the time that he meant those things to a point, but that he was also just trying to see what reaction he could provoke.
Right. Definitely Merle was raised a certain way, so his sexism and racism is embedded in his upbringing, but you know, it did not matter one bit who ultimately came on top of that rooftop and told him to stop shooting. It did not matter if the person was red, green, yellow, purple or brown. They were about to get a full double barrel load of Merle Dixon. That's a fact, Jack. And I want you to make sure people realize that Merle Dixon cannot swing the first punch. All he can do is try to get their goat and try to get back at them in some way. So when he's up on that roof, for the other members of the group to listen to this stranger who's not been a part of the group, who, you know what, is no longer a cop — the world has ended, buddy, you aren't a cop any more, we don't have to listen to you, okay? — and for them to kowtow, to literally kowtow and listen to this guy and let him handcuff his group member like that, no matter who he is — at first, Merle is all high, he's back to his verbally inflicting ways. But when they don't unhook him, it really hurts his feelings, and he's affected.

GUWAHATI: Assam government's anti-graft cell on Tuesday arrested director of the government's information and public relations wing, Ranjit Gogoi for his alleged involvement in an estimated Rs 32 crore scam relating to a high-level ‘Vision Assam Mission Assam (VAMA)' media campaign carried out by the Congress government in 2015-16 fiscal.Gogoi, who was arrested from his office here in the evening and produced before the court, has been remanded to seven days police custody.The chief minister special vigilance cell, which probed the alleged scam, has also hinted at possible involvement of the chief minister's office (CMO) when Tarun Gogoi was the chief minister, but underlined that “while the honourbale chief minister (Gogoi) may not be aware of procedural nuances and lapses that took place, senior officers of the CMO , IPRD (information and public relation department) and DIPR (directorate of information and public relation) did not take proper care while processing and implanting the project and incurred wasteful expenditure without achieving the desired result.”The vigilance cell has noted that “VAMA project was a high profile campaign conceived and monitored at the highest level of the government.”The vigilance cell in its report submitted to chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal stated that though “there was a financial sanction of Rs 31.933 crore, there was no compulsion on IPRD and DIPR to spend the entire amount by throwing all plans, strategies and professionalism into the air. They could achieve, by spending half the amount, the same results that they achieved by spending the entire amount. Therefore, there was unethical collusion between the firms (advertising firms) and DIPR while IPRD and CMO appeared to be unconcerned about the money wasted once funds were sanctioned.”According to the FIR lodged by the vigilance cell, the enquiry has revealed “some evidence of misappropriation of money in the form of false or fraudulent claims made by the media buying firms in respect of hoardings and of making payments on part of the director without proper physical verification.”The FIR has named three advertising firms, Brahmaputra Television Network, Delta Publicity and Pradip Advertisement, for their alleged involvement in the scam. The proprietors of Brahmaputra television Network, Rajiv Kr Bora and Anjan Bora had moved the Gauhati High Court seeking anticipatory bail but their bail pleas have been rejected.
How to Design, Code, and Animate SVGs
Surbhi Oberoi Blocked Unblock Follow Jul 12, 2016
You can think of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG's) as responsive graphics. SVG is an XML-based format that allows you to create an image by using defined tags and attributes. Your code will render an image that you can edit right in your code editor.
Here's a sample SVG. If you look at its code, you'll notice that it's made up of tags and attributes, just like an HTML document. The whole thing is contained inside <svg> tag. First, there's a <rect> tag with black strokes and white fill. And inside that, there's an ellipse (almost a circle, but notice the ry and rx attributes) which is filled with red color.
We can use SVG on the web in two ways. We can use the SVG files as the src attribute of <img> tags. So, you can have <img src=”japan.svg”> like you would do with PNGs and JPEGs.
But, the more interesting case (in case you have noticed that the tags have an id attribute like HTML) is that we can directly paste the source of the SVG in a <div> inside our HTML. We can then style these divs like individual building blocks — or even groups of building blocks — the way we want. We can apply CSS, animations, or even add interactivity using JavaScript. This is what makes SVGs one of the most versatile and hottest element right now in HTML.
SVGs are infinitely scalable, responsive, have smaller file size, are future-proof for next-generation bazillion-pixel dense screens, and can be styled, animated and interacted with using known web technologies — namely CSS and JavaScript.
Notice that all these things were previously possible only with a Flash embed — which required a flash player and lots of specialized work. And there's no love going around for Flash these days.
Vector vs Raster images
Raster images are made up of pixels to form a complete image. JPEGs, GIFs and PNGs are common raster image types. Almost all of the photos found on the web are raster images.
Raster images consist of a fixed number of pixels, so resizing them without effecting their resolution is not possible. You may have noticed that resizing most images gives them a grainy, and blurry look. That's because of their fixed pixel count.
Here's what happens when you zoom in on a raster image:
Vector images, on the other hand, are flexible and resolution-independent. They are constructed using geometric shapes — lines, rectangles, curves — or a sequence of commands. You can edit their attributes, such as color, fill, and outline.
One common use for vector images is icons and small icon animations. These will appear crisp, even on the highest density displays such as upcoming 4k smartphones.
Here's what happens when you zoom in on a vector image:
SVG tags
<svg>
The <svg> tag embeds an SVG document inside the current document, HTML for instance. The tag has its own x and y coordinates, height and width, and its own unique id.
Here's what an <svg> tag might look like:
<svg width="580" height="400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<g>
The <g> tag groups the elements together, and acts like a container for related graphic elements. A <g> element can even contain other <g> elements nested within it.
Here's an example of a <g> tag:
<g> <title>background</title> <rect fill="#fff" id="canvas_background" height="402" width="582" y="-1" x="-1"/> <g display="none" overflow="visible" y="0" x="0" height="100%" width="100%" id="canvasGrid"> <rect fill="url(#gridpattern)" stroke-width="0" y="0" x="0" height="100%" width="100%"/> </g> </g>
<rect>
The <rect> element is an SVG basic shape representing a rectangle. The element can have various attributes, like coordinates, height, width, fill color, stroke color, and sharp or rounded corners.
Here's an example of a <rect> tag:
<rect id="svg_1" height="253" width="373" y="59" x="107.5" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="#000" fill="#fff"/>
<use>
The <use> element allows you to clone and reuse the graphical SVG elements including other elements like <g> <rect> as well as other <use> elements.
Here's an example of a <use> tag:
<text y="15">black</text> <use x="50" y="10" xlink:href="#Port" /> <text y="35">red</text> <use x="50" y="30" xlink:href="#Port"/> <text y="55">blue</text> <use x="50" y="50" xlink:href="#Port" style="fill:blue"/
<path>
The <path> element defines a path of coordinates for a shape. The code for path tag might seem cryptic, but don't be intimidated. The following example code can be read like this:
1. “M150 o” — Move to (150,0)
2.”L75 200" — Draw a line to (75,200) from last position (which was (150,0)
3. “L255 200” — Draw a line to (225,200) from last position (which was (75,200)
4. “Z” — Close the loop (draw to starting point)
You probably don't need to learn this since the code for path can be generated in any SVG editor, but it's cool to know.
Here's an example of a <path> tag:
<svg height="210" width="400"> <path d="M150 0 L75 200 L225 200 Z" /> </svg>
<symbol>
Finally, the <symbol> element defines symbols that are reusable. These symbols can only be rendered when called by the <use> element.
Here's an example of a <symbol> tag:
<svg> <symbol id="sym01" viewBox="0 0 150 110"> <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke-width="8" stroke="red" fill="red"/> <circle cx="90" cy="60" r="40" stroke-width="8" stroke="green" fill="white"/> </symbol> <use xlink:href="#sym01" x="0" y="0" width="100" height="50"/> <use xlink:href="#sym01" x="0" y="50" width="75" height="38"/> <use xlink:href="#sym01" x="0" y="100" width="50" height="25"/> </svg>
Creating SVGs
There are plenty of SVG editors available, like Adobe Illustrator, and Inkscape, which is free and open source. Since SVG files are plain-text XML, you could also hand-code one in a pinch.
For this example I'll use a simple online editor where you can design SVGs without having to install anything.
First create a circle
2. Next add more circles and save the source code
CSS3 animations
SVGs can be animated by adding an id or a class to the SVG path in the code and then styling it in CSS3 like any other document. Below is an example of how SVGs can be animated.
CSS3 animation offers a variety of animation types that you can choose from. Line animation is another cool attribute of SVG.
For this next example, I wrote the text “Hi, I am Surbhi” using pen in the editor. Then I used CSS3 keyframes again to animate the stroke.
Notice that each path has a unique id. That is because the delay in the animation is important when animating a stroke with more than one word.
The <animate> tag animations
<animate> is an animation tag built into the SVG element itself. It defines how the attribute of an element changes from the initial value to the end value in the specified animation duration. This is used to animate properties that cannot be animated by CSS alone.
The common elements of the animate tag are color, motion, and transform.
The animate tag is nested inside the shape tag of the object that has to be animated. It does not work on the path coordinates, but only inside the object tags. Notice the additive attribute. It signifies that the animations do not override one another but instead work together at the same time.
Here's an example of animating an SVG using the HTML5 animate tag:
JavaScript based animations and interactivity
Since SVG is just a document with tags, we can also use JavaScript to interact with individual elements of the SVGs by getting hold of their selectors (id or class).
Apart from vanilla JS, there are various JavaScript libraries available for animating and interacting with SVGs like Vivus.js, Snap.svg, RaphaelJS, and Velocity.js.
In the following example, I have used the Vivus.js library along with jQuery to achieve a line stroke animation.
Why not use SVGs for all images?
SVGs are mostly suited for images that can be constructed with few geometrical shapes and formulas. Though, in principle, you can convert anything like your photograph to SVG, the size of the image would be several megabytes, thus defeating the space-saving purpose of using SVGs. You're better off using SVGs for icons, logos, and small animations.
Here is something I created while I was learning about SVGs, using CSS and SVGs, without any libraries. (Don't Judge!) https://github.com/surbhioberoi/surbhi.me
A study of more than 400 children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder has found a link between the children's routine play settings and the severity of their symptoms, researchers report. Those who regularly play in outdoor settings with lots of green (grass and trees, for example) have milder ADHD symptoms than those who play indoors or in built outdoor environments, the researchers found. The association holds even when the researchers controlled for income and other variables.
The study appears in the journal Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 9.5 percent of children aged 4-17 had been diagnosed with ADHD as of 2007. Symptoms include severe difficulty concentrating, hyperactivity and poor impulse control.
Although many children with ADHD are medicated, most "would benefit from a low-cost, side-effect-free way of managing their symptoms," wrote University of Illinois crop sciences visiting teaching associate Andrea Faber Taylor and natural resources and environmental sciences professor Frances (Ming) Kuo, the authors of the study.
Previous research has shown that brief exposure to green outdoor spaces -- and in one study, to photos of green settings -- can improve concentration and impulse control in children and adults in the general population -- individuals without ADHD.
These findings led Taylor and Kuo to examine whether children diagnosed with ADHD, which is characterized by deficits in concentration and impulse control, might also benefit from "green time." In a study published in 2004, they analyzed data from a national Internet-based survey of parents of children formally diagnosed with ADHD and found that activities conducted in greener outdoor settings did correlate with milder symptoms immediately afterward, compared to activities in other settings.
The new study explores other data from the same survey to determine whether the effect also is true for green play settings that are routinely experienced -- the park, playground or backyard that a child visits daily or several times a week.
"Before the current study, we were confident that acute exposures to nature -- sort of one-time doses -- have short-term impacts on ADHD symptoms," Kuo said. "The question is, if you're getting chronic exposure, but it's the same old stuff because it's in your backyard or it's the playground at your school, then does that help?"
To address this question, the researchers examined parents' descriptions of their child's daily play setting and overall symptom severity. They also looked at the children's age, sex, formal diagnosis (ADD or ADHD) and total household income.
The analyses revealed an association between routine play in green, outdoor settings and milder ADHD symptoms.
"On the whole, the green settings were related to milder overall symptoms than either the 'built outdoors' or 'indoors' settings," Taylor said.
The researchers also found that children who were high in hyperactivity (diagnosed with ADHD rather than ADD) tended to have milder symptoms if they regularly played in a green and open environment (such as a soccer field or expansive lawn) rather than in a green space with lots of trees or an indoor or built outdoor setting.
The researchers found no significant differences between boys and girls or income groups in terms of the relationship between the greenness of play settings and overall symptom severity.
Kuo noted that the findings don't by themselves prove that routine playtime in green space reduces symptom severity in children with ADHD. But in light of all the previous studies showing a cause-and-effect relationship between exposure to nature and improved concentration and impulse control, she said, "it is reasonably safe to guess that that's true here as well."
The study was performed with Hatch Act funds, and with support from the USDA CSREES National Research Initiative with a recommendation from the National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council.
The gears in your brain are turning at high speed. Make connections. Memorize. Apply. Memorize more. Differentiate. Eliminate choices. You sit at your desk the minute you open your eyes every morning, until the moment you happily surrender to your bed. You can't figure out where your gluteus maximus begins and the legs of the chair end. Perhaps 40% of that seated time you are brain dead, with your thoughts mindlessly wandering. Your body is waiting for the caffeine surge to kick in and work its magic, and the entire time you're thinking:
Beat the US National Average. Breaks are for the weak. Maybe if I study an extra half hour, I can push my score up another point. What if I don't get a 230? Will I not match? Just beat the US National Average. What do I do if I don't match? How disappointed will my family be? How disappointed will I be? Should I be using more resources? Different resources? Beat the US National Average. What do the forums say? My NBME wasn't what I wanted it to be. I think I'm stupid. I peaked too early. I'll never match. Why did I choose medicine again?
These are just a few of the thoughts that run through a medical student's anxious mind when preparing for the USMLE Step 1 exam. Writing the first of three USMLE Step exams to becoming a licensed American medical professional is an arduous task. It can seem ominous, looming in front of you, waiting to decide your fate. The number you receive on the exam is such a powerful number for students. We peg our hopes and dreams on a good number leading to multiple open doors, and we are determined to think that any number below our expectations will only lead to failure.
One of the biggest challenges during the preparation for the Step 1 is staying positive and mentally strong. It sounds easy, “Yes! Stay positive!” but the anxiety, the fear of the unknown, and the expectations we place on ourselves have the power to put us in a downward spiral. Following are a few tips and pointers students should keep in mind that may help them with their fears and anxiety.
You are not your score.
Coming from a Caribbean medical school, we are misleadingly caught up in the notion that our scores decide our fates. Being an IMG (International Medical Graduate) is disadvantageous, so you need all the right cards for your application; a good Step score is considered a straight flush. However, this is not entirely true. A good score is a good score. It's good. It may even be great! But at the end of the day, it's a score. Your residency application depends on more than just your Step 1 score, although it is a major contributing factor. However, your attitude and your drive to continually better yourself after Step and prove yourself in clinicals and subsequent exams is what will truly be the deciding factor. There are individuals who have matched on their first attempt with a score of just 198 while being an IMG, and others with a score of 244 who took 2 rounds to match. Ultimately, it is hard to know exactly what a program is looking for. Just remember that there are a wide variety of versatile programs that are looking for all sorts of students and are interested in various qualities. The score is powerful, but you are much more powerful than your score.
Task oriented vs. Ego oriented.
In sports, the concept of goal orientation is heavily stressed. In order to deliver, you have to have a set of goals in place that you work towards daily to better yourself. These goals can be further classified into task-oriented and ego-oriented.
Task oriented individuals are intrinsically motivated. They strive to do their best, giving their maximal effort. They enjoy the task at hand. A student studying for Step who is task oriented is also likely to find more happiness. Remember, Step is about mastering the skill of being tested and knowing the information to the best of your abilities.
Ego oriented individuals are focused on being better than others, having the best and right resources, and tend to focus on luck. They are extrinsically motivated. What this means in a Step setting is that these individuals compare themselves to other students and base their happiness, success, and self-validation on doing better than their peers. Success isn't measured so much as being the best they can be, but more so as NOT being the worst.
It is easy to get caught up in the ego trap while studying and constantly mulling over scores of different individuals and where it led them in life. It is advisable that you let go of this mentality and focus on yourself. Try to be the best doctor YOU can be, not just better than the next man or woman.
Repetition. Repetition.
As med students, we already know that it is important to study something, and then study it again, and then again, and maybe another 50 times before it sinks in and becomes a part of your very being. However, we tend to neglect this principle when it comes to our own mental health and positivity.
While studying, I found listening to one of the many brilliant inspirational YouTube videos to be incredibly uplifting. Motivational videos rarely tell you anything you don't know, but sometimes, being reminded in a more dramatic fashion with some great background music helps revive these messages in our minds, and lets us tackle our goals with more veracity. Find a positive activity, whether it is listening to YouTube videos, reviewing a list of all the reasons why you are where you are and where you want to go, or even meditating. Find what works for you and then do it every day.
Fans to keep cool.
As monstrous as Step 1 seems to those writing it, it becomes a tad bit less monstrous if you surround yourself with people who care about you and cheer you on – your fans. Having a support group, whether it is family, friends, or partners is paramount. Support systems can act as a foundation for your ideas and help craft specific solutions to improve a difficult situation. The American Psychological Association states that speaking and listening to others regularly can help you put your own problems in perspective. An additional medical benefit of having these support systems in place, as stated by Johns Hopkins Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Health Disparities, is that stress and anxiety have a tendency to hike up blood pressure and increase heart rates. Having reliable family or friends around to talk to and rely on can decrease these rates among people.
Life after Step 1?
This is an easy pointer to forget. The day I wrote Step 1, I half expected to walk out of the exam and see the heavens part, with confetti falling on me and family and friends congratulating me for writing this 8-hour exam. Instead, I ended up waiting 15 minutes outside my testing center at a Tim Hortons, watching a pair of old timers play chess while sipping on hearty vegetable soup. It was somewhere at this point and subsequent encounters where it truly occurred to me that Step 1 and similar examinations are not my life. I remember talking to peers and stating how I felt 2 years of my life culminated on this one day. I had to prove two years worth of education by obtaining the highest score possible. After writing the Step, though, I found this outlook quite silly. Besides your ability to take a test, this exam doesn't “prove” your worth. Difficult, mentally exhausting examinations are a part of the medical profession. However, they are just passing events that we must deal with graciously. Take it for what it is – an exam – and remember, you have so much more yet to see, so many hurdles yet to cross, and so many rewarding experiences yet to go through.
While being mentally strong and positive throughout this process is difficult, there are many tools at your disposal to help you through it, whether it be family and friends, YouTube videos, or the knowledge that you will be okay.

Real Madrid Will continue at Real in 17/18
It is easy to blame Danilo
Secretario to Danilo: Don't lose confidence
Though it may come as a surprise to some, Danilo will continue to wear the Real Madrid shirt next season.
The defender is going to fight for the position on the right with Dani Carvajal for another campaign, as the player himself has communicated to the club.
It's a decision that Los Blancos have applauded and as Zinedine Zidane already pointed out, he doesn't want too much upheaval in the team for 2017/18.
Danilo's case is no exception.
The Frenchman is happy with the performance of the defender, supports him and wants to continue to count on him.
Last January, he came out in his defence when Danilo was booed by supporters at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu.
"He is a professional who always gives 100%," Zidane said to reporters at the time.
"We want the best version of Danilo.
"I'm not 100%, but 1,000% with him because he is a player that I love."
The booing and whistling made the player rethink his future and he asked to leave the club, but Zidane talked to him and persuaded him to continue, at least until the end of 16/17.
Turnaround
Now the situation has turned 180 degrees.
During the second half of the campaign, and especially in the final stretch, Danilo regained his self-confidence.
In LaLiga, he completed the last four games - key in the title race - replacing an injured Carvajal.
In the Champions League, he played the 90 minutes of the return against Atletico in the semifinals.
Danilo also has a contract until June 30, 2021; four more seasons that he's ready to work through.
With Zizou's rotation he will secure minutes like the rest of the team.
Award-nominated DJ and producer Andski, supported by such big names in trance as Gareth Emery, returns to the Pulsar catalogue with the long-awaited follow-up to his single 'Hidden', this time with a banging tune in collaboration with upcoming artist tSefu.
'Comienzo' is overtaken from the very beginning by a bright and ringing melody, like the sound of twinkling stars, that lead the way to a very heavy kickdrum beat. The melody, steady and continuous throughout the tune, smoothly gives way to the breakdown, leaving the listeners high-spirited, with an almost childish, carefree feeling of joy.
The remixes of this single come from the world renowned DJ Lee Osborne and the talented Bulgarian producers Re-Mono.
Lee Osborne's take starts with a rise that is full of energy and anticipation, slowly building up to the melody, which is accompanied by a heavy synth, adding even more energy to an already powerful banger.
Re-Mono's remix, on the other hand, builds anticipation with a slow build-up of percussive beats, adding clapping and a more vibrant sound, which give the track an even brighter feel. The breakdown in this version is characterized by a soft piano melody that leads the way to a stabbing synth, building the energy towards a perfectly timed drop.
A flea encased in amber dated back to some 20 million years ago, has been discovered. Fossilised bacteria have been isolated from it, and scientists are speculating these bacteria are the oldest example of the causative agent of bubonic plague (what was known as the ‘Black Death' in Medieval times). During the primary time of the ‘Black Death', in the Fourteenth Century, some 75 million people perished worldwide from lymphadenitis (lymph gland infection).
The discovery was made by Dr George Poinar of the College of Science at Oregon State University. The bacteria were detected as dried droplets on the flea's proboscis (tubular mouthpart). The amber was recovered from amber mines in the Dominican Republic (between Puerto Plata and Santiago). Millions of years ago, the area would brave been a rainforest. The discovery of the preserved flea, of age stated, is in itself a rare event.
The recovered organism appears to resemble very closely the bacterium Yersinia pestis. This provides a clue that the bacteria, which is highly infectious to all mammals, including humans, has been around for millions of years and pre-dates humans.
If so, this runs counter to some theories of microbiology that certain pathogens developed in conjunction with people. This far back in time, the bacterium would have been an infectious agent of rodents, transmitted in flea bites. Infection by flea bites remains a common means of transmission of the plague today (as well as by aerosols).
It could also be that the plague was responsible for some extinction events relating to mammals – a reason not previously given very much consideration.
Despite a number of visual similarities (size and shape), it cannot be proven with certainty that the bacteria are identical. This is due to the inability to extract any genetic information. Nevertheless, the bacteria are of the same part-rod and part-spherical shape (‘coccobacilli') characteristic of Y. pestis. Moreover, the detection of the bacteria on the proboscis (as well as similar recovery from the rectum of the male flea) are typical of where the plague-causing bacteria are found on the modern flea.
The discovery of the amber encased flea and its bacterial payload have been published in the Journal of Medical Entomology. The paper is titled “A New Genus of Fleas with Associated Microorganisms in Dominican Amber.”
That was the most common line I heard as I went home to Illinois this weekend for the funeral of my former boss and mentor, Bob Michel.
Michel, an Illinois Republican, was in Congress for 38 years was the longest-serving minority leader in the history of the House.

He was a throwback to a different era, a time before C-SPAN covered each session live, gavel to gavel. He was a legislator's legislator, a man who would rather make deals than throw rhetorical bombs, a Midwest conservative who knew how to build coalitions among Northeast moderate Republicans and boll weevil Southern Democrats.
He spoke with the knowledge of what would play in Peoria. He had common sense, good values and great judgment.
Today, Peoria is struggling. Most people believe that Caterpillar, the region's biggest employer, is going to fold up shop and move elsewhere, if not to Mexico, then possibly to South Carolina or to any place other than Illinois.
I talked to a state legislator who hasn't been paid for eight months because the Illinois governor won't agree to a budget with the Speaker of the Illinois General Assembly. Both Bruce Rauner, the governor, and Mike Madigan, the Speaker, have plenty of personal wealth, but if you are a back-bencher in Springfield having to rely on your spouse's income to make ends meet, the entire idea of public service can get a little stale. Everybody is frustrated by Illinois's budget mess, but nobody knows what to do about it.
To folks in Peoria, President Trump's campaign promises sounded pretty good: keep American jobs in America, revive American manufacturing, make America great again — by making Peoria great again.
It's hard to put your finger on precisely what went wrong in Peoria. In many ways, the city should be well poised to take advantage of globalization. There is no company more tied to exports than Caterpillar. The city itself is surrounded by a farming community that is the breadbasket of the world. But like small cities across the country, Peoria seems to be stagnant. Crime is a persistent problem. Drugs, especially heroin addiction, has devastated certain neighborhoods.
It would be a deathly blow to Peoria if Caterpillar were moved elsewhere. And it is that sense of vulnerability that puts people in a state of anger and depression.
Trump's promise to turn America around resonated with a lot of voters in Peoria. He obviously didn't win the state of Illinois, but he did quite well in the 18th District. Talking to residents there, what they want from the new president is less talk and more action.
More specifically, they want him to take steps to revive the economy. They want him to replace ObamaCare with something better. But they also want him to stop with the sideshows, silly distractions and the useless wars with the media that undermine his credibility and open him up to questions about his temperament to be president.
Even today, Peoria is ranked as one of the most polite cities in America. Being rude simply doesn't play in America's heartland.
I am reminded of what happened when Michel retired from Congress and turned over the reins of power to his successor, then-Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who would go on to become Speaker.
Like Trump, Newt led a hostile takeover of the political establishment. Not one Republican had served in the House majority when they took over in 1995, and Gingrich really had to start from scratch to figure out how to govern. His inexperience is not unlike Trump's.
He too made plenty of tactical errors early on. He too got into needless wars with the media that sidetracked his progress and eroded his credibility with his colleagues. He too had a bold legislative agenda that required cooperation with the Senate, which was never a certainty.
Of course, Trump has more tools at his disposal than Gingrich did. And ultimately, Gingrich did succeed in a getting some big things done, included a balanced budget, welfare reform and pro-growth tax cuts.
During the Gingrich era, Michael Weisskopf and David Maraniss wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, “Tell Newt To Shut Up,” about the turmoil within the leadership during the first two years of the new Republican majority, caused by Gingrich's rhetorical excesses.
If you listen to folks in Peoria, a worthy sequel might be, “Tell Trump to Shut Up.” They want a lot less tweeting and a lot more legislating to make Peoria great again.

Expressed as a percentage, this means that the main grid has shrunk by 3.5%. That compares to an 8.2% shrinkage in 2013 (from 20,992 to 19,273 regions, a loss of 1719) and a 12% reduction in 2012 (23,857 to 20,992, a loss of 2865 regions).
There are likely to be a number of reasons for the slow down in losses, all interacting with one another. While one ideologue opted to pooh-pooh it, in September 2011 I pointed to one contributing factor to the then increasing rate of decline in region numbers as likely being due to physical world economic issues. With their disposable income diminishing, people were finding an outlay of $125 a month for virtual land increasingly hard to justify, and so were divesting themselves of it; something which likely continued through 2012 and early 2013.
While I'm not about to say we've turned the corner where the physical world economic situation is concerned, it is probable that by late 2013 we'd reached a point where those still with a residential homestead of their own were more willing to grit their teeth and pay for the land they hold, thus contributing to the slowing of shrinkage.
So what does that mean for the year ahead? While nothing is guaranteed, I tend to sway towards the view that the decline in region numbers will continue to slow, but at less than the rate we've seen in from late 2013 through 2014. I'm also inclined to think we won't see any significant rise in region numbers through 2015 (unless some kind of external factor comes into play or the Lab does opt to do something quite unexpected to cause people to suddenly want lots of land).
One thing the slow-down will hopefully do is decrease future calls for tier cuts. As I explained back in January 2013, unless the Lab have a substantive means of compensating for the revenue loss resulting from any “reasonable” tier, any such cut will likely hurt the company (and SL) more than help. Nor is the Lab's profit margin anywhere near the levels sometimes mentioned (e.g. the 200% recently claimed in this blog), such that they could simply “absorb” any tier cut without feeling the impact.
In 2008, estimates put the Lab's earnings at around $90-95 million, and their possible profit margin at between $40-$50 million (48-50%) – see the articles here and here. I assume these estimates are for gross profits, as neither makes allowances for tax.
More to the point, there seems to be a slight flaw in both estimates: they only appear to reference the costs involved in running simulator servers. No mention is made of the various back-end services such as group chat, group management, asset management, login, transaction management and payment, (and today, the avatar baking service), the various web services (Marketplace), and so on. While the costs associated with all of these are obviously going to be a lot lower than those for the simulator hosts, they shouldn't be entirely discounted. There's also third-party support costs (in 2008-2010, for example, the Lab was paying Rivers Run Red and 80/20 Studio; today there are the costs involved in using the Highwinds CDN service).
Hence why, when responding to the 2008 profit estimates, Mark Kingdon was in all probability being entirely hosted when he stated they weren't that high.
Looking at Tyche Shepherd's Grid Survey estimates and taking pointers from the few bits of information the Lab do give, I'd say it is not unreasonable to put their annual revenue at around US$70-72 million. While the costs associated with running hardware, etc, have also fallen over the same period, it's very unlikely they've done so at a rate that has allowed the Lab to maintain the levels of profit it may well have been generating in 2008-2010. I'd actually put the likely ceiling on their gross profits at around $20-22 million (including profits from Blocksworld).
Which, when all is said and done, may be a good deal lower than past estimates have allowed, still isn't anything to be sneezed at. It's likely to be enough to both drive whatever improvements can be brought to SL and driving forward the development of the Lab's “next generation” virtual world(s) platform.
Nor should the latter be seen as “taking” anything away from SL simply because its money is being pumped into it.
While SL is still currently in a position where it can be enjoyed and improved, the fact is that with the best will in the world, it is already hamstrung. LL themselves have often indicated that some of the deeper issues cannot be easily fixed without a complete rebuild. And as we've seen over the last few years, it is locked into an inflexible and vulnerable revenue model; one which cannot easily be be “fixed” or “replaced” without potentially doing greater harm to the platform and the Lab, and which is expensively burdensome to users.
We also shouldn't lose sight of the fact that other people are starting to sit up and consider the opportunities offered by social virtual environments, and that it is growing increasingly likely that at some point something will appear to rival SL not just in terms of public appeal, but with us SL's existing users. Just because this hasn't happened so far, doesn't by extension mean it won't.
Put all this together and it makes a good deal of sense for the Lab to try to position themselves such that as other things do come along / as SL more clearly starts to approach the end of the road in a few years time (or really starts pricing itself out of the market), they're in a position to present us with a platform free from many of the shortfalls inherent in SL, and which offers us the ability to transition over to it without losing all of the emotional, social and creative investment we've made in SL over the years.

Some baby birds are meeting a slimy end. Voracious supersized slugs have been seen chomping on chicks in nests on or near the ground.
“The actual moment of slugs predating on nestlings isn't easy to observe,” says Katarzyna Turzańska at the University of Wroclaw in Poland. “You are more likely to come across the traces of the ‘tragedy': dead or alive nestlings with heavy injuries, covered in slime – and often slugs' droppings found nearby.”
She and Justyna Chachulska, a colleague at the University of Zielona Góra in Poland, were studying common whitethroat birds near Wroclaw, in Poland, when they spotted a slug of the Arion genus in a nest with newly hatched chicks. The next day, the slug was gone, and the chicks were dead with severe injuries on their bodies that hinted at the slug as the culprit.

They were gobsmacked. “We couldn't believe that the slug had killed the nestlings,” says Turzańska. “We talked to many experienced ornithologists, but none of them had observed slug predatory behaviour towards birds before.”
But it turns out that this was not a one-off event: Turzańska and Chachulska found that there had also been reports of this type of behaviour before. Most of them occurred in Europe and concerned species that nest close to ground, such as the whitethroat, wood and reed warbler, and chiffchaff.
A few papers described an actual attack, showing unequivocally that slugs do predate on nestlings. Others described the injuries as being different from those left by other predators, which, together with mucus trails and droppings, suggested a slug as the cause of death.
But for many, this behaviour comes as a surprise. Ben Rowson, a zoologist at the National Museum Wales in the UK, says he was not aware of all these cases of slugs eating birds.
Slime wave
Slugs are not picky eaters: they will munch on anything from tender leaves to decomposing plants, animal carcasses, faeces and rotting paper. Some species are known to feed on earthworms and other slugs.
Slugs are known to detect odours, so Turzańska and Chachulska suggest that they may be able to catch the scent of nestlings and seek them out. But there is no evidence that they do this yet.
“When a slug finds itself inside a nest – probably accidentally, or maybe by actively searching for this type of food – it just starts foraging on the living nestlings using its radula, or tongue covered in tiny teeth,” says Turzańska. “The nestlings are unable to defend themselves and are eaten alive.”
Surprisingly, the birds' parents don't seem to defend them, perhaps because such predation does not happen often enough for them to have evolved a defence response. A blackcap was even seen incubating a slug feeding on dead chicks.
The culprits are the three large European slug species from the Arionidae family of “roundback slugs”: the red slug (Arion rufus), the black slug (Arion ater), and the invasive Spanish slug (Arion vulgaris).
It is often difficult to work out which species of slug is responsible, but the signs that a slug attack has happened – including huge skin wounds, holes in beaks or muscles, and missing eyes – are obvious.
The Spanish slug has spread to many European countries, posing threats to plants and crops. These mass invasions could also affect local bird populations.
“If these invasive slugs are attacking birds, it's one more thing that makes them unwelcome,” says Rowson. “Although we face additional foreign slug species in the UK, several of which are spreading, I think the amount of nestlings attacked by slugs would be very small compared to those by their vertebrate predators, such as magpies, grey squirrels and hedgehogs.”

The television industry is very much in a phase of recycling old shows in the hope of cashing in on fandom and the nostalgia audiences have for them. There have been failures (Heroes Reborn) and successes (The X-Files) but the return of Twin Peaks was something different from this manufactured nostalgia. Twin Peaks returned because of a creative vision between Mark Frost and David Lynch and should be classed as art before anything else. The returned show transcended its lovable quirky origins as part-detective drama, part soap-opera spoof and barreled full force into the bizarre supernatural and metaphysical world introduced in the original show. The Return was a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma surrounded by a horror-comedy-thriller that blew minds and tickled heart strings and ultimately is nothing short of a masterpiece and one of the best things to ever call television home. The Internet was a great place to delve into the mysteries after each episode but there was one thing that I saw consistently that annoyed me: the constant praise of David Lynch for everything. I'm a big Lynch fan but we can't forget that the other side of the writing duo, Mark Frost, deserves the praise too and he proves his worth in his two recently released Twin Peaks books that were written purely by Frost. Books I believe every Twin Peaks fan should read because this past year we didn't just get ‘Lynched' we also got ‘Frosted'.
The first book was ‘The Secret History of Twin Peaks' and was released in October of 2016 to seemingly set up the upcoming new season but ended up doing so much more. The book takes the form of a dossier, a collection of various documentation including newspaper articles and government files, created by a mysterious character known as The Archivist detailing the history of the town of Twin Peaks, its citizens and the supernatural elements at play there. To add another layer, FBI Agent Tamara Preston, who was seen in The Return, is tasked with analysing the dossier and her notes and impressions can be seen in the margins throughout the book. ‘Secret History' is an incredible look at the wider world of Twin Peaks, expanding on the lives of minor characters in the show and exploring how so many conspiracy theories and unexplained events, from extra-terrestrials to Richard Nixon, can fit into the Twin Peaks mythos. While billed as a companion to the latest season, ‘Secret History' feels like it's its own piece of the Twin Peaks puzzle, capable of standing alone as a wonderfully barmy addition to the lore. Looking back after watching the latest season of the show, the book does offer some hints to story points and characters but the book feels like Frost staking a claim in the franchise showing he can be just as idiosyncratic and wacky as his more famously so writing partner. Oh, and if you're going to pick up ‘Secret History' then make sure to get some Dr Jacoby style 3D glasses too if you want the full effect.
Frost's second book was released soon after the latest season of the show concluded. Titled Twin Peaks: The Final Dossier it is much more of a straightforward companion for the show. Well, as straightforward as a series with multiple dimensions, realities and doppelgangers can be. The epistolary nature of ‘Secret History' is gone for a cleaner format designed in the form of a series of files named for various characters and locations, written by Tammy after the events of The Return. The book details what happened to characters between the original show and The Return and hints at where they are afterwards. I won't spoil anything here but details are given on Audrey, Philip Jeffries, Judy and we finally discover the answer to “How's Annie?”. It's not all about the ambiguous elements of the show however as we get closure on beloved characters and relationships including Big Ed and Norma and a certain log. Part of what we all love about Twin Peaks, particularly the ending of the latest season, is the mystery and I was initially wary that the book would answer too much. Thankfully it doesn't, instead playing with the lasting ambiguity by only answering things heavily implied in the show and the evidence it gives towards the wider mysteries expands them rather than concludes them.
Frost's writing is unsurprisingly fantastic, not just in the creation of the huge mythology but in capturing the unique voices of certain characters and witticisms whether on self-reflective ridiculousness or the odd political reference – a certain orange-faced, small-handed rich guy makes an unnamed appearance. The books also succeeds by being from a human perspective, mostly from Tammy's POV. Instead of Frost revealing everything because he knows it he makes Tammy work for the information and some of it she never acquires because it makes logical sense that she wouldn't. We as TV viewers know more than her about some aspects because we were there watching it happen on TV whereas Tammy wasn't. While she puts a lot of information and evidence together, Frost leaves the putting together of the jigsaw pieces to the reader and that more intellectual approach is rewarding.
There has been chatter since the finale on whether we will get more Twin Peaks on television and while I would most definitely be open to it if Frost and Lynch are passionate about continuing but if this is the end then I am content. I love the ending of the series and the two books by Frost add to the unending mystery and unique texture of Twin Peaks. I haven't read the books and want more Twin Peaks then they come highly recommended.
Have you read Mark Frost's Twin Peaks books? Let me know in the comments and geek out with me about TV, movies, books and videogames on Twitter @kylebrrtt.
As a journalist, I can't say I'm surprised about the recent Rolling Stone UVA rape debacle. I'm also not surprised by how the public has responded to Rolling Stone's callous apology for its shoddy reporting and editing. By casting a renewed shadow of doubt on rape accusers and accusations, Rolling Stone and reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely have indeed done survivors of rape a horrific disservice.
As a mother of two sons, however, here's what does surprise me: How little attention defendants of civil liberties have paid to what unsubstantiated rape charges can do to the lives of the accused. Even if it turns out that Erdely was dead wrong. Even if “Jackie's” allegations about Phi Kappa Psi were completely fabricated, there will be an indelible smudge on that fraternity and those young men. And no apology will take that away.
Sure, you can find diatribes on right-wing websites and TV stations that sing this refrain. But among liberals like myself? I've listened to colleagues and friends rage endlessly about the male predator crisis on campus.
And I've bitten my tongue so hard I've practically bled. That's because even my meekest attempts to question if this anti-date-rape crusade might be spinning into a full-blown hysteria have been gunned down. It's been made clear that coming out “on the side” of an accused rapist is tone-deaf, misogynistic, and anti-feminist.
I am a feminist, for whatever that's worth. I am a person who is outraged by any act of violence. But I also support the American presumption that a person is innocent until proven guilty.
I fear for young women who may become the next rape statistic. But I look at my two adolescent sons and I fear for them, too.
I've heard advocates emphasize that only a tiny percentage of rape accusations are fallacious. I believe that. But the sexual landscape is becoming brutally hard to navigate. We are well beyond the notion that a stranger must pop out of an alley for it to be considered an attack. As our definition of consensual sex continues to morph, some young women could interpret certain unfortunate sexual encounters as “rape” when they may just have been stupid, risky, unpleasant and regrettable.
In this hyper-sensitized environment, it's not an unreasonable stretch for me to imagine my own son or one of his friends drinking too much, falling into bed with a young woman who has also drunk too much, and waking up in the morning to discover he's a “rapist.”
So what are young men to make of all this? Avoiding problems isn't merely a matter of making sure a woman says “yes.” As many of us who pawed and partied our way through young adulthood know, sex can be confusing, messy and full of second thoughts. My friends and I woke up on plenty of mornings, hungover and mortified about the stupid choices we'd made and the sketchy encounters we'd had. But do I think back for a minute on these incidents as anything approaching rape? Absolutely not.
Sexual predation on campus is an issue we must deal with. The first step must be dealing with alcohol and substance abuse among young adults. A national study of undergraduates found that 55 percent of females and 75 percent of males involved in date rape had been drinking or using drugs prior to the incident. A 2002 study published in the Journal of American College Health asked 772 college undergrads if they'd ever woken up after a night of drinking and found themselves unable to remember what they'd done or where they had been. Among those who drank within the past two weeks, 1 in 10 reported having blacked out during that period. Many later learned they had “vandalized property, driven a car, had sexual intercourse, or engaged in other risky behaviors.”
This problem has probably been exacerbated by the fact that since the drinking age was raised to 21, college alcohol use has gone underground. Kids get drunk within the secretive walls of frats and private apartments, while the universities look the other way. And they look away again when traumatized victims knock on their doors complaining they've been attacked.
I recently shared my concerns with a friend, who is the mother of three teen sons. She responded that women have silently endured the tragic toll of date rape for so long that the pendulum may have to swing in the other direction and hurt some innocent males before we find a balance.
Maybe so. But it won't mow down my sons as it swings in their direction. I will tell them not to let their passions dictate their actions. I'll warn them to abstain from alcohol and drugs when mingling with girls. I'll draw up contracts they can ask potential partners to sign before they engage in sex. Maybe I'll even ask them to have a witness present. Come to think of it, does anyone know where I can buy a male chastity belt? It just may be the next rage on campus.
Occupy Wall Street broke a silence. What was long only whispered between friends was shouted from the centers of hundreds of cities across the globe — that a grand economic experiment has failed. A gaping chasm has opened up between the rich and the rest, and citizens no longer believe that widespread prosperity will be achieved through the growth-centered economic policies of decades past. Moreover, these policies also mean ecological suicide. Thus, Occupy Wall Street signals the beginning of the end for the troubled experiment that was prosperity through growth.
While the year-old Occupy movement struggles for relevance and impact, a years-in-the-making economic experiment is underway, one that could change cities forever and deliver on their promise as crucibles for positive social transformation. Like Occupy, this experiment takes its cues from the modality of the Internet. However, it translates this into new way of managing society's assets at the city scale, rather than relying on a national political agenda.
The “new” mode is so intuitive, so effective in meeting human needs, so natural to humans that it won't need the trillions in advertising and government support required by the old guard's experiment. It's a child's earliest moral lesson; every major religion teaches its wisdom. Today, the Internet and the many digital commons it spawned re-teach the lesson to those who forgot it. It's the default logic of Gen Y, the first generation raised on the Internet. This “new” experiment is prosperity through sharing.

The very notion of prosperity is being redefined by a new generation. It no longer means McMansions, SUVs, and Rolexes — baubles which Millennials watched their parents destroy themselves over. Many want something different, and most couldn't afford the old dream anyway, even if they wanted it. In this new experiment, prosperity is defined by healthy relationships, realizing one's creative potential, civic participation, meaningful experiences, and purposeful work — all things that actually deliver happiness.
In a sharing economy, products connect us rather than operating as status symbols that divide. Here product service systems and time-tested urban commons like libraries, parks, streets, and public transportation make our daily needs widely accessible. Here access trumps the burdens of ownership. Here we stop destroying our planet chasing a manufactured dream.
Instead, we come home to where prosperity has long been centered — within the vital relationships forged in our homes, neighborhoods, and cities. It's no accident that Gen Y is flocking to cities in what is the greatest migration in history. But there's an epoch-making twist beyond these shifts: the Internet widens the circle of sharing beyond family, tribe, and nation to the global scale.
This may sound like the fantasy of an idealist, but scores of new companies have emerged recently to help strangers share a surprisingly wide variety of assets — mostly in cities, the perfect platform for sharing. They include Airbnb and Tripping (rooms and apartments); Loosecubes and LiquidSpace (office space); RelayRides, Getaround, and Wheelz (peer car sharing); Techshop and hackerspaces (industrial workspace); La Cocina (commercial kitchen space); ParkatmyHouse and Park Circa (parking space); Zimride, Sidecar, and Ridejoy (ride sharing); SharedEarth and Hyperlocavore (garden sharing); Grubwithus (restaurant dinners); Vayable (experiences); Skillshare and TaskRabbit (skill sharing); Thredup (childrens clothes); and Yerdle (general).
This list just scratches the surface. Lisa Gansky, author of The Mesh: Why The Future of Business is Sharing, has identified thousands of such startups. Many are currently small, local, or struggling; others have substantial user traction, funding, and national or international reach. Meanwhile, as Rachel Botsman, author of What's Mine is Yours: The Rise of Collaborative Consumption, states, bike sharing is the fastest growing form of public transportation. The largest program, in Hangzhou, China, has over 50,000 bikes. Car sharing is also undergoing a global boom.
The rise of these services is an important signal that net culture is becoming dominant. The values and practices of social web are now being used to manage our relationships and assets in the real world. Smartphones turn this into a location-specific, real-time, on-demand affair.

The sharing economy turns consumer culture on its head.
This is a world where we help each other realize our creative potential, instead of judging each other by what we buy. Where a good online reputation provides more access to resources. Where the more you contribute to the common good, the more you're respected. Where we host, fund, teach, drive, care, guide, and cook for friends and strangers alike with little to no mediation. This is a world where we help each other. To paraphrase Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, we used to keep up with the Joneses, now we share with them.
The last half of the 20th century witnessed an experiment to expand freedom through privatization and a diminished welfare state. Instead, it enslaved billions of people through debt. That experiment turned out to be just as oppressive as state-managed economies, if not more. In this century, we're trying a third way — a way beyond market and state. Through networks and commons, we're opening the world to one another on a peer-to-peer basis, and a new level of freedom is being realized through our social obligations rather than despite them. This is, indeed, a brave new world.
The positive dynamics of car sharing suggest the possible impact should these services prevail and restructure the economy in favor of access rather than ownership. Car sharing is now a decades-old archetype within the sharing economy, only truly coming of age recently thanks to mature technology, a global reach, and the first publicly traded car-sharing company, Zipcar, which went public earlier this year. With maturity comes evidence of sharing's impact:
Car sharing, the gateway drug to the sharing economy.
While more research needs to be done to understand the impact of sharing, these statistics suggest that a city can significantly broaden citizen access to resources, dramatically reduce resource consumption, and strengthen the urban economy all through one simple, low-cost strategy: sharing. Social entrepreneurs need to take note of sharing as a systemic intervention in a world of bandaid solutions.
Furthermore, car sharing is not just the archetype of the sharing economy, it may also be the gateway drug. Shareable Magazine and Latitude Research's “The New Sharing Economy” survey found that car sharers share across significantly more asset categories than non-car sharers. The model of car sharing could be the future of our most important assets. Here, our material reality is reordered according to the architecture of the Internet, arguably the ultimate commons. Here, nearly everything becomes available to nearly everybody from the cloud at a low cost, on a pay-per-drink basis. Assets do not idle. We use only what we need when we need it. No waste. No want.

This future is not assured.
For maximum public benefit, sharing services should be complemented by other low-cost, low-tech ways to enable sharing, such as cooperative enterprises, exemplified by the 80,000 worker-owners of the Mondragon cooperative in Spain. Commons-based urban development as exemplified by Enrique Penalosa's transformative investments in public parks, schools, and transportation when mayor of Bogota, Colombia, should also play a crucial role. In addition, the sharing economy must be fought for in the courts and halls of government. Just as peer-to-peer car-sharing companies needed to change laws for neighbors to share cars, so must other sharing enterprises. Just as the growth economy depended on a particular regulatory framework, so will the sharing economy.
Today, some of the most successful sharing services operate in regulatory gray areas. In the U.S., most local laws do not guarantee you'll keep your insurance if you rent a car to a neighbor, nor do they allow you to sell vegetables grown in your backyard, operate a for-profit ride-sharing service, or offer a spare room for short-term rental. This list goes on.
The sharing movement must do something much more difficult than building anew to obsolete the old — it must hack the law to allow the new to emerge. This process may be easier than it sounds. It can be done city by city. The doors of city halls are more open than those of national governments, and the benefits will manifest most dramatically there.
A new, more joyful and sustainable way of life is within reach. It will have to be fought for, but it's worth fighting for, because in this way of life, everyone wins, not just the 1 percent. And while many have waked to the potential of cities as crucibles of transformation, they have not fully awoken to this truth: cities will not save humanity until they're conceived as networks and commons, as places to collaborate and share.

A version of this first appeared in the December 2011 edition of SPUR's "The Urbanist" magazine.
Full out war between Democrats and the White House broke out today when Senate Democrats on Tuesday refused to attend a committee vote on two President Trump's more controversial nominees, effectively delaying their consideration. Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee boycotted votes to advance Tom Price, Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, and Steven Mnuchin, his selection to head the Treasury Department.
Since at least one democrat must be on present for the vote to be held, the move will effectively delay and potentially prevent the confirmation votes on Mnuchin and Price. The duo is among some of the more contentious selections to join Trump's Cabinet.
Democrats walked out of the Senate Finance Committee hearing room, arguing that Mnuchin and Price misled senators in their testimony before the panel, and saying they could not allow a vote to proceed without more information. Minutes before the scheduled vote on the pair, democrats said they refused to enter the hearing room until they get answers to their questions about Price's stock purchase in an Australian biotechnology company.
"At a minimum, I believe the committee should postpone this vote" and have an opportunity to talk to officials at the biotech company, Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the committee, told reporters. He said they'll be willing to move forward on Price and Treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin only after their questions are answered, especially on Price, whom Wyden suggested hasn't been "straight" with the committee.
Both Price and Mnuchin had been targeted fiercely by Democrats on a range of ethical issues. Price was pressed on his investment activity in various medical companies, and whether he improperly mixed his political activity with his personal portfolio. Mnuchin's time at the head of OneWest Bank, and whether it treated homeowners facing foreclosure fairly, was central to his testimony.
"He misled Congress and he misled the American people," Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the panel, said of Price.
According to The Hill, republicans expressed outrage at the move, while Democrats gathered outside the Senate Finance Committee hearing room to outline their gripes with the selections.
“I can't understand why senators, who know we're going to have these two people go through, can't support the committee,” said Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). “I'm very disappointed in this kind of crap. … Some of this is because they just don't like the president.”
“This is the most pathetic thing I've seen in my whole time in the United States Senate,” Hatch said, adding he would try to hold a vote on the nominees later today.
Expect a furious Trump tweet slamming Democratic opposition momentarily.
It all started with a small tip of intelligence.
A U.S. airman in Virginia spotted a piece of intel thousands of miles away. Ten days later, warplanes bombed 11 sites in the Middle East where American military officials say Islamic State militants manufactured deadly drones.
The operation -- detailed for the first time by Air Force officials to Military.com -- underscores a growing trend in modern warfare in which troops at their home bases are intimately involved in wars half a world away. It also highlights a new way of analyzing intelligence to find, track and kill enemies and their weapons, they say.
"Analysis is the foundation that's going to drive everything," Air Force Lt. Gen. VeraLinn "Dash" Jamieson, the service's deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, said in an interview at the Pentagon on Thursday. "This [way of] thinking is not just top-down driven. It's going to be enabled bottom up."
Jamieson noted the airman -- identified only as Senior Airman Jean, assigned to Distributed Ground System-1 at Langley Air Force Base -- was able to maneuver her way through the data in large part because of her training in critical analysis and observation.
Jamieson, who assumed her post in November, said the intel career field and the service as a whole are shifting toward an analysis-based infrastructure that will enhance multiple missions across the force.
In this case, the airman's instincts kicked in while working the Distributed Common Ground System, a globally networked system that can process intelligence from MQ-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-4 Global Hawk drones, and U-2 Dragon Lady spy planes, among other aircraft, to visualize strikes and dissect the aftermath. The system also lets users monitor chats between pilots in any theater across the globe.
On any given day, the DGS teams observe more than 50 intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance sorties and 1,200-plus hours of motion imagery; produce about 3,000 signals intelligence, or SIGINT, reports; exploit 1,250 still images; and manage 20 terabytes of data, according to a 2015 Air Force description of the system.
The Signal
Jean -- who was mission qualified trained, known as MQT in the intel community -- had been certified in immediate data collection and involved in the planning team that reviews information over time to establish a pattern of life, Jamieson said. She found herself on a team that was overlooking a MQ-1 Predator mission and, by observing the intelligence, was tipped off to the "needle in the haystack" hit, Jamieson said.
Jamieson didn't specify what the tip was but hinted it wasn't a visual cue.
"It was a signal -- not seeing," she said. "So that's why she was able to talk to the crew and her team and say, 'Let's put some eyes on this, so we can see what's going on.' "
Jamieson added, "We noticed it was not a signal we had identified often [before]."
Officials later disclosed to Military.com the intelligence was received on a mission observing ISIS militants during the offensives in both Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria. Non-visual signals may include, as examples, an audio signature, water signature or chemical signature.
"We worked with the [intelligence community] in the course of an hour or two, refined that down to a couple block locations inside an urban area. We were then able to talk to the Pred[ator] team, and said, 'Hey, we think we have an anomaly, what do you think?' They agreed," Jamieson said.
She said they then looked for a visual cue.
"We put a Predator overtop and we used the [full-motion video] to see if there was any kind of pattern of life that we noticed. They did notice something: They noticed a vehicle, an individual get out of the vehicle … and took something, and put it in the back of the vehicle."
Upon review, the teams perceived it to be a small drone.
There have been multiple examples of ISIS rigging small, off-the shelf drones and model airplanes as time bombs in both Iraq and Syria. In recent weeks, their tactics have escalated in areas such as western Mosul, where Iraqi forces have launched the latest offensive to diminish the ISIS stronghold.
ISIS began using small drones in 2014 to counter forces by gathering intel, as well as documenting suicide bombings to post on its radical websites to boost morale, according to The Washington Post. In October, a U.S. official confirmed another drone incident, but with deadly consequences -- two Kurdish Peshmerga fighters were killed while trying to dismantle a model airplane that was shot down in northern Iraq, according to The New York Times.
"A top priority for me at the moment is this emerging danger that we're seeing in the Middle East in respect to unmanned aerial systems -- these cheap, buy-them-over-the-internet, small drones. And if explosives are placed on them, as we've seen a handful of times now in Syria and Iraq, they can do damage," then-Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said after the October attack.
While the U.S. has deployed new technology to disable ISIS drones, including the DroneDefender, an assault rifle-style product that features a directed energy frequency jammer, Iraqi security forces have yet to get their hands on the weaponry.
Zeroing In
The pilot and the sensor operator stayed on the vehicle where the drone was spotted, and began mapping its routine, Jamieson said.
The goal was to determine "is there a network going on?" Jamieson said. The next crew rotations for both the Predator and analysis teams were given permission to stay on the vehicle, as was the next day's crew.
"They were able to stay on the target," she said, "and they were working with the 363rd [ISR] Wing … an integrated DGS and targeting cell."
The unit is the Air Force's only wing focused on "content-dominant multi-intelligence analysis and targeting for five distinct mission sets: air defenses, counter-space, counter-ISR, theater ballistic missile and cruise missile threat, and air threat," according to the service.
The target and analysis cell portion re-examined the data to develop the target in coordination with teams already on hand tracking and disseminating details on the ISIS network.
It had been just 10 days from Jean's find to strike approval coordinated through the Joint Task Force, Jamieson said.
"On the 11th day, they went in on the strike," she said, and Langley stayed on the mission for processing, exploitation and dissemination, as well as battle damage assessment of the operation.
"They had the pattern of life knowledge," she said.
As a result, more than 10 facilities with pieces or parts of small drones controlled by ISIS were destroyed because "of one senior airman identifying a signal, and taking it through fruition because she said, 'The analysis I knew would prove out,' " Jamieson said of the conversation she had with the airman.
The service has since identified new tactics, techniques and procedures to improve analysis at the beginning of an intel mission. Officials didn't say if they have taken out similar targets given Jean's find, but are hopeful airmen will echo her aptitude.
Airmen know analysis, "they always have," Jamieson said. "But now they know that is a priority from the top and [we] are encouraging more to do that.
"We need to have sound analysis to actually go through our mission because it's all about the airman. Yes, the platforms enable a lot of things, but it's, 'How are the airmen going to be able to critically think and employ tactics as they use these platforms?' " Jamieson said.

At the end of second term, this is what I had accomplished. More information on the development during second term can be found here and here.
Far from finished I had a few goals I wanted to achieve in time for my exhibition in Lithuania in July and hopefully also in time for the next deadline in third term. They were as follows:
Make the glasses successfully, included the main frame, arms and tiny screws Improve the objects and their amber aesthetic— these objects were lacking in the cracks, imperfections, trapped things, veins and had a somewhat tacky quality to them Figure out what varnish to use.
(Side note, there are good links to explain the kinds of molds I've made here and here.)
1. The Glasses:
The Main Frame:
By the end of second term I had successfully made a ‘plug' mold, but not cast into it yet. Here are, in chronological order the casts that resulted:
The first few casts lost their shape a little and flattened out. Through making more and more casts, I found the way to demold at just the right time. Demold too early and the shape of the glasses will be warped (they flatten out). Demold too late and the flashing is much harder to get off (may end up taking off a nose-pad or two).
Earlier versions on the left, very flattened out. Later, more accurately shaped versions on the right.
Arms:
This time I used the method of pouring silicone into a box I had made with clay. I bought Mold Star 30 which has a 45 minute pot life and 6 hour cure time. For this kind of mold, I poured into one corner slowly to avoid the formation of air bubbles. I was also hoping that a silicone with 45 minute pot life would have more than enough time to let any possible air bubbles float to the top…
Unfortunately that wasn't the case:
I quickly moved on and tried again. Imploring the ‘plug' method like I had with the frames:
I did an original thin layer in the Mold Star 16 (the lighter blue), so that there were definitely no air bubbles.
It turned out much more successfully:
2: Improving the objects and their amber aesthetic:
I knew that by casting repeatedly, the quality of the casts would most likely improve, so I simultaneously experimented with how to make the amber aesthetic more believable while perfecting the quality of casts.
On the left is the last turtle cast of second term, on the right is the first of second. Part of the improvement lied in applying more resin to the mold after the first part had cured to fill in any remaining gaps.
At the end of last term I had experimented with using “resin chips”. Unfortunately they lose their definition when more resin is added. I needed a new approach for how to create a higher contrast effect and soon tried my hand at using caramel.
Some of the caramel I made:
Placed it into the molds and added resin:
On the left are keys that did not use caramel. They were also shaped incorrectly from being in a vice— which caused the keys to warp. I decided to try the halves separately to lessen that effect, it worked.
Resin chips on the left. Caramel and bug/dirt on the right.
The effect of the caramel is more believable more in objects with greater depth.
The problem with caramel is that it dissolves. And the problem with resin is that it requires sanding underwater to avoid scratches. I needed to devise a way to remove flashing and extra parts without losing the caramel. I solved this by removing flashing earlier with a scalpel and smoothing edges by carving into the casts slightly. I also needed a way of sealing in the caramel (For when it isn't entirely tapped in resin, especially in flat/thin objects) to prevent it from melting in the summer heat etc— I thought more on varnishes.
3.What varnishes to use
Above: sanded, but not varnished resin crayons.
Satin on left, Gloss on right. They look pretty similar to me. I decided to go with the gloss finish when I was varnishing things, but I didn't feel like all the objects required the varnish.
Recap, this was at the end of last term:
And this is the end of this term:
Things that could use improvement still:
That turtle. I need to make one that is neat and contains the caramel for the amber effect. The glasses. Although the arms attach to the face, they are not as robust as I would like them. There are holes in critical positions that mean the arms come off too easily. Maybe the crayons. Not sure how, perhaps a greater range of colors.
Other than that, I'm quite happy with the progress I've made and I'm very excited to have these in my exhibition.

Replication is one of the foundational ideas behind science. It's when researchers take older studies and reproduce them to see if the findings hold up.
Testing, validating, retesting: It's all part of the slow and grinding process to arrive at some semblance of scientific truth.
Yet it seems that way too often, when we hear about researchers trying to replicate studies, they simply flop or flounder. Some have even called this a "crisis of irreproducibility."
Consider the newest evidence: a landmark study published today in the journal Science. More than 270 researchers from around the world came together to replicate 100 recent findings from top psychology journals. By one measure, only 36 percent showed results that were consistent with the original findings. In other words, many more than half of the replications failed.
The results of this study may actually be too generous
"The results are more or less consistent with what we've seen in other fields," said Ivan Oransky, one of the founders of the blog Retraction Watch, which tracks scientific retractions. Still, he applauded the effort: "Because the authors worked with the original researchers and repeated the experiments, the paper is an example of the gold standard of replication."
In reality, the replication failure rate might be even higher But Stanford's John Ioannidis, who famously penned a paper arguing that most published research findings are wrong, explained that exactly because it's the gold standard, the results might be a little too generous; in reality, the replication failure rate might be even higher.
"I say this because the 100 assessed studies were all published in the best journals, so one would expect the quality of the research and the false rates to be higher if studies from all journals were assessed," he said.
The 100 studies replicated ended up excluding some 50 others for which the replication was thought to be too difficult. "Among those that did get attempted, difficult, challenging replication was a strong predictor of replication failure, so the failure rates might have been even higher in the 50 or so papers that no one dared to replicate," Ioannidis said.
Again, the scientists worked closely with the researchers of the original papers, to get their data and talk over the details of their methods. This is why this effort is considered top quality— they tried really hard to understand the original research and duplicate it — but that collaboration may have also biased the results, increasing the chances of a successful replication.
"In a few cases [the original authors] affected the choice of which exact experiment among many should be attempted to replicate," said Ioannidis.
Just listen to how difficult it was to repeat just one experiment
Even with all this buy-in and support, running a replication is an extremely difficult task, explained one of the people on the team, University of Virginia PhD candidate David Reinhard. In fact, after talking to Reinhard, I've come to the view the chance of reproducing a study and arriving at the same result — especially in a field like psychology, where local culture and context are so important — as next to nil.
Reinhard had been hearing a lot about the problem of irreproducibility in science recently and wanted to get firsthand experience with replication. He had no idea what he was in for — and his journey tells a lot about how arduous science can be.
To begin with, the original study he wanted to replicate failed during the pretesting stage. That's the first little-appreciated step of any replication (or study, for that matter) when researchers run preliminary tests to make sure their experiment is viable.
Reinhard spent hours on the phone with the original study authors. He also had to translate some of the data from German.
The study he finally settled on was originally run in Germany. It looked at how "global versus local processing influenced the way participants used priming information in their judgment of others."
In English, that means the researchers were studying how people use concepts they are currently thinking about (in this case, aggression) to make judgments about other people's ambiguous behavior when they were in one of two mindsets: a big-picture (global) mindset versus a more detail-oriented (local) mindset. The original study had found that they were more suggestible when thinking big.
"Fortunately for me, the authors of the study were helpful in terms of getting the materials and communication," Reinhard said. He spent hours on the phone with them — talking over the data, getting information about details that were missing or unclear in the methods section of the paper (where researchers spell out how an experiment was conducted). He also had to translate some of the data from German to English, which took more time and resources.
This cooperation was essential, he said, and it's not necessarily always present. Even still, he added, "There were a lot of difficulties that arose."
Reinhard had to figure out how to translate the social context, bringing a study that ran in Germany to students at the University of Virginia. For example, the original research used maps from Germany. "We decided to use maps of one of the states in the US, so it would be less weird for people in Virginia," he said.
After all that, he couldn't reproduce the original findings
Another factor: Americans' perceptions of aggressive behavior are different from Germans', and the study hinged on participants scoring their perceptions of aggression. The German researchers who ran the original study based it on some previous research that was done in America, but they changed the ratings scale because the Germans' threshold for aggressive behavior was much higher.
Now Reinhard had to change them back — just one of a number of variables that had to be manipulated.
In the end, he couldn't reproduce their findings, and he doesn't know why his experiment failed. "When you change the materials, a lot of things can become part of the equation," he said. Maybe the cultural context mattered, or using different stimuli (like the new maps) made a difference.
Or it could just be that the original finding was wrong.
"I still think replication is an extremely important part of science, and I think that's one of the really great things about this project," Reinhard said. But he's also come to a more nuanced view of replication, that sometimes the replications themselves can be wrong, too, for any number of reasons.
"The replication is just another sort of data point that there is when it comes to the effect but it's not the definitive answer," he added. "We need a better understanding of what a replication does and doesn't say."
Here's how to make replication science easier
After reading the study and talking to Reinhard, I had a much better sense of how replication works. But I also felt pretty sorry about the state of replication science.
It seemed a little too random, unsystematic, and patchwork — not at all the panacea many have made it out to be.
I asked Brian Nosek, the University of Virginia psychologist who led the Science effort, what he learned in the process. He came to a conclusion very similar to Reinhard's:
My main observation here is that reproducibility is hard. That's for many reasons. Scientists are working on hard problems. They're investigating things where we don't know the answer. So the fact that things go wrong in the research process, meaning we don't get to the right answer right away, is no surprise. That should be expected.
To make it easier, he suggested some fixes. For one thing, he said, scientists need to get better at sharing the details — and all the assumptions they may have made — in the methods sections of their papers.
"It would be great to have stronger norms about being more detailed with the methods," he said. He also suggested added supplements at the end of papers that get into the procedural nitty-gritty, to help anyone to want to repeat an experiment.
"If I can rapidly get up to speed, I have a much better chance of approximating the results," he said. (Nosek has detailed other potential fixes in these guidelines for publishing scientific studies, which I wrote about here — all part of his work at the Center for Open Science.)
Ioannidis agreed and added that more transparency and better data sharing are also key. "It is better to do this in an organized fashion with buy-in from all leading investigators in a scientific discipline rather than have to try to find the investigator in each case and ask him or her in detective-work fashion about details, data, and methods that are otherwise unavailable," he said. "Investigators move, quit science, die, lose their data, have their hard drives with all their files destroyed, and so forth."
What both Ioannidis and Nosek are saying is that we need to have a better infrastructure for replication in place.
For now, science is slowly lurching along in this this direction. And that's good news, because trying to do a replication — even with all the infrastructure of a world-famous experiment behind you, as Reinhard had — is challenging. Trying to do it alone is probably impossible.

Trump Threatened To Kill The Iran Nuclear Deal. But The Deal Wins — For Now
Enlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images
President Trump's Iran address creates uncertainty about the long-term survival of the two-year-old nuclear deal. It opens the door to Congress to find ways out of it, even as he threatened — yet again — to use his power as president to break the deal himself.
But for now, the deal stands — with the administration itself acknowledging it's better to have it than to break it.
Instead, the administration says it wants to redefine the U.S. relationship with Iran beyond the nuclear agreement. Trump reviewed Iran's missile tests and support for Hezbollah, Hamas and Iraqi militias that have targeted U.S. troops.
Why the deal wins — for now
For all his denunciations of the deal, Trump's move Friday is another instance in which he has passed up a chance to break it.
True, he didn't certify the deal again, as he has twice before under a recurring 90-day review stipulation. But that does not take the U.S. out of it.
The certification isn't part of the deal. It's just a requirement Congress put on President Barack Obama to make him own a deal Congress didn't like. Trump's refusal to certify just puts the onus on Congress now to do something about it.
And Trump isn't even asking Congress to take the U.S. out of the deal — as it could by imposing the sanctions that were lifted in exchange for Iran allowing limits on its nuclear program.
It's useful to look at the reason Trump used for not recertifying the deal. Congress gives the president a menu of reasons.
The president could have asserted that Iran is not in compliance. But "We don't dispute that they're under technical compliance," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters Thursday, before the president made his announcement. (Tillerson did say the requirements for complying aren't strong enough.)
Trump also could have said that the lifting of sanctions — part of the deal — was no longer vital to U.S. national security. But then how could he reasonably lift the sanctions again when they come up for regular renewal? Trump just waived some again last month, keeping the U.S. in the deal.
In his speech Friday, Trump carefully stated that he refuses to certify the deal because he can't ensure that — using phrasing from Congress — the sanctions relief in the deal is "appropriate and proportionate" to what Iran gives on its end of the bargain.
Even there, Trump could ask Congress to impose sanctions that would break the deal — but he is not. Instead, he is asking for new laws that would snap sanctions in place if Iran tries to ramp up its nuclear program.
The administration has also called for the deal to be renegotiated. But on Thursday, Tillerson acknowledged that's unlikely — just as European allies who spent years working on the deal have stressed.
What Iran gets
Trump's threats to eventually bring down the deal mean Iran can now blame the U.S. for shaking up an agreement that it is widely seen as complying with and is backed by Europe, Russia, China and the U.N. Security Council. As some backers of the deal worry, it's hardliners in Iran who will benefit most because they will say the moderates were mistaken to make a deal that is about to fall apart because of a fickle and hostile United States.

Meanwhile, Iran will continue to get its sanctions relief and do business with other signatories.
The administration did impose new sanctions (not covered by the deal) Friday on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, a wing of Iran's military that trains and backs militias around the region. But the Revolutionary Guard is already heavily sanctioned by the U.S.
European business rolls on
European diplomats have been lining up to urge the Trump administration to stay in the deal. They're nervous that an anti-Iran current in Congress could eventually spoil the agreement. And they worry that if the U.S. exits the deal, it could try to punish the companies from Europe that are doing business with Iran.
For now, they can go on developing things like aircraft, auto and oil deals with the Islamic Republic. And Trump's threats have drawn attention to the possibility that Europe and Iran could just continue with the deal and without the U.S.
European countries have shown some more willingness to consider other actions to pressure Iran to rein in its hardliners. That could be because of Trump's threats to scrap the deal.
Trump keeps the pressure on
Threats for future steps may have more impact than anything else Trump did on Iran this week. By staying in the deal, he keeps those threats alive.
And that means Trump can continue to raise Iran as an issue, as he did throughout his campaign and since taking office. That goes over well with his supporters, especially those who recall that the Iran agreement was a hallmark of the Obama administration.
"In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated," Trump said Friday. Considering his efforts to dismantle other Obama legacies — like Obamacare or leniency for undocumented child immigrants — this could be a step toward eventually pulling the U.S. out of the Iran deal.
Or it could remain a threat, while Trump carefully pairs his denunciations with careful measures to keep the deal in place.

Development in Beverly Hills is never easy. But your Waldorf Astoria project—on the local ballot for the second time now—is a good case study of just how challenging development on the Westside has become. Let's start by describing your project.
Beny Alagem: In 2008, the Beverly Hills City Council approved our plans, which included the Waldorf Astoria on the corner of Wilshire and Santa Monica and two condominium buildings on Merv Griffin Way. Those three streets form a triangle. One condominium tower, on the Santa Monica side of the triangle, was 18 stories. The other, on the Wilshire side, was eight stories. We also received approval for a conference meeting room on the Wilshire side.
In all, 170 rooms in the Waldorf Astoria and 110 condominiums between the two towers were approved by the City Council in 2008.
Then, the opposition mounted a signature collection against us and took us to the ballot for a referendum. In November of 2008, we won that referendum by a very slim margin—just 129 votes. That's why today, the Waldorf Astoria is under construction. It is set to open in 2017.
You've now proposed changes to your plan. What transpired since 2008 that led you to rethink and amend a plan that was already approved?
Over the years, I have always looked at the competitive landscape—at what's happening from Downtown all the way to Santa Monica. Right now, there are around 4,000 hotel rooms either under construction or in the planning stages. We need to differentiate ourselves. We need to be dynamic, not static.
The Beverly Hilton is a 62-year-old hotel. When I bought it in 2003, it was starved and fatigued. I invested $100 million, and we redid the whole hotel. We took everything down to the studs and totally rebuilt it. But that's not enough.
In order to compete with the cool and elegant hotels that are coming onto the market today, we needed to be different. And to me, living in LA, there is nothing that could differentiate us more than creating an open space.
The open space not only provides a beautiful green space surrounding the hotel, but also creates a 1.7-acre public space for local residents to enjoy year-round. The 2008 plan includes an eight-story building on Wilshire Boulevard that blocks much of the hotel from the street. This new plan removes that building and creates a beautiful park that can never be built on.
I'm fortunate enough to have a nine-acre property and two great hotels, one of which—the Waldorf Astoria—will open in March, and the other of which has a long and important history in Beverly Hills. I want to create a beautiful outdoor park, which we will maintain to the highest degree of elegance, with programs for the public. That will differentiate us for the next 60 years.
How does your new plan reconfigure the Hilton property?
Before receiving our approvals in 2008, we had 19 public hearings on the Waldorf Astoria development. Over the course of three years, we were totally vetted by the Planning Commission, the Architectural Commission, the rest of the City Council, and other city entities.
According to our various consultants, the amended plan is totally compliant with our original environmental impact report. I am not adding one square inch, a single sellable unit, or any new uses. The only change relates to the height.
Everything remains the same—except moving the eight stories originally planned for the Wilshire building to the top of the building on Santa Monica. In essence, I want to combine the eight-story building and the 18-story building into one 26-story building. Why? Because that would allow me to open up 1.7 acres for a publicly accessible park adjacent to the hotel.
Why did you choose to skip the city's planning process and go directly to the ballot to effectuate this plan? Why not go through the city's legislative and planning processes to amend your project?
We already went through the process. What happened to us in 2008, after our project was approved by the city? Opposition mounted and took us to the ballot anyway.
Since we are fully compliant with our environmental impact report other than the height, I'm going directly to the voters.
I believe in individual vision. To me, the best process is bringing the issue before the residents. Let the people make the decision.
The Initiative process has been part of California law for more than 100 years, and thousands of Beverly Hills residents signed a petition this spring to put the Initiative on the ballot. The question before voters is simple: do you prefer the 2008 plan with two buildings and no public park, or the Measure HH plan with one building and a 1.7 acre park.
The one significant opponent of yours apparently is a fellow developer, Wang Jianlin's Wanda Group, which is proposing a new hotel in its One Beverly Hills project adjacent to your property. Is that typical—two competing developers contesting local land-use decisions via ballot measure?
No, it's very atypical. We are very surprised at it. I don't know what their motivations are. Of course, they are before the Planning Commission and the City Council right now to try to get 200,000 square feet of residential space changed into hotel space for their project.
I have no problem with their project, except—and we've said this publicly at Planning Commission hearings—that they have placed their loading dock in front of the entrance to the Beverly Hilton. They have eight acres; how about moving it somewhere else? Surely there's space elsewhere for the loading deck. That's our main beef with them, yet they're attacking me nonstop.
I think there must be more to their opposition than our one ask. They may have political motivations; they may think it will help them with the City Council or the mayor, who objects to our project.
In fact, three planning commissioners and three City Councilmembers signed onto the initiative against our project. There must be some other interest here.
My only aim is keeping the Beverly Hilton relevant and competitive. That's a benefit to the residents, because they get 18-19 cents of every dollar we bring into the hotel. We are the largest employer and the largest independent hotel in the city of Beverly Hills.
We are in a very interesting situation. But I am confident in the residents. Whatever they decide, that's what it will be.
To confirm: Even if Beverly Hills' Measure HH should lose in November, you would still build out the original project that was approved in 2008?
Absolutely. If our amendment is not approved, we will go forth with the original plan to build both an 18-story building and an eight-story building.
In other words, I'll either build Plan A or Plan B. Plan A—the new plan, with the 1.7-acre park—is much better than Plan B, with two buildings.
I already have a tall building approved. If you don't like a height of 26 stories, you won't like 18 stories, either. But we're offering a park in exchange for that height difference.
You cannot tell the difference between 18 and 26 stories when you are on the ground. But a 1.7-acre park will be noticeable.

I want to open a park—plain and simple.
Turning back to the development itself, what are you most proud of in its design? What are the state-of-the-art components?
We are very proud of the fact that 100 percent of our irrigation, both for the new park and for the Waldorf Astoria, will be recycled water. I think we're the only one in Beverly Hills—and probably the only hotel in the state of California—to have equipment already installed for water recycling.
We're also striving for our buildings to reach the highest level of sustainability, which is the LEED Gold ranking. We're not sparing a penny on that.
A central issue arising from Measure HH is who should be the steward of a city's built environment—who should choose, and enforce, a city's planning vision. How do you answer that question?
Measure HH is extremely consistent with the planning vision the City government approved for this site eight years ago. The ballot measure asks for an amendment that basically improves the plan by reorganizing existing approvals. Our residents want a vision for the next 20-25 years. But before you can have that, you have to have a strong elected leader who can engage with residents about the vision, and then make a final decision.
For that, you have to have cohesiveness among politicians. When there is no leadership, no cohesiveness, and lots of division, politicians are basically not performing their jobs. And when they don't perform the job of creating an outline and a clear vision for the city, then the problem starts.
That's why private enterprises, developers, and entrepreneurs are exploring their own visions with the residents of the area that they live in.
Suppose you someday decided to run for Mayor of Beverly Hills. What would be the 20- to 30-year vision you would share with Beverly Hills electorate?
I would take a step back and look at what created Beverly Hills. We must look at our history in order to see what happened, and how Beverly Hills became what it is today—and also not to repeat mistakes that were made.
The city of Beverly Hills started with one of the greatest hotels—the Beverly Hills Hotel. It was founded by Margaret J. Anderson, whose family had another hotel in Hollywood. She came to Beverly Hills—then an empty area—and put it on top of one of the hills. Nothing was around it.
Look at what's around it today. You can't find a home around there for less than $10 million. They're all in the multimillion dollars.
The hotel was a good neighbor: They created something that people wanted to be around. Today, people are proud to say, “My home is next to the Beverly Hills Hotel.”
Or take Rodeo Drive. Rodeo Drive was essentially created by four entrepreneurs. They saw this street, as it was then, with gas stations and some small restaurants and horses crawling around, and they had a vision of creating a beautiful main street for retailers. But they needed to bring the people.
For 10 years, they traveled all around the world on their own expense to bring retailers to Beverly Hills and to create the name Rodeo. That had a tremendous impact on Beverly Hills, and people developed around it.
That's our history. Today, why do people move to our city? First of all, because it's a beautiful, safe place. You can walk around at any time. We have a strong police force. We have a great school system. You want your kids to grow up here.
But years ago, we were ranked as the fourth best place in California. Today, we're at around 100th place.
I look at the City Council, and while it's good that they are representing and protecting us, what we don't have is participation. I have nothing against the individuals in City Council, but probably less than a third of residents are voting to elect these officials. I think the timing of local elections should coincide with major state elections so that more people get involved.
Another issue I see is the appointment of volunteers to the different commissions. We must look at their backgrounds. We must look at their experience and understanding of urban development—especially for the Planning Commission. This is not the job to learn on the city's expense. You have to have at least basic knowledge and the skillset to analyze cases that are brought to you. Most importantly, that commission needs to fulfill the vision of the city and its leaders.
We need open discussions. What's best for everybody? Let's have a lot of Town Hall meetings and civilly talk about it. As it is, when my team presents before City Council or the Planning Commission, we have three minutes to speak and that's it—and sometimes we're even interrupted and not given more time.
Business and government must meet together and have an open-table discussion. We can have disagreements, but at the end of the day, we need to understand what brings the city's lifestyle and quality of life to all the people.
Should a hotel designed in 2016 be any different from a hotel designed in 2000?
First of all, size is a difference. A standard room in the Waldorf Astoria—the minimum size—is 640 square feet, including the balcony. We've also increased the size of our suites to raise the level of luxury.

SEOUL/BEIJING (Reuters) - Curbing North Korea's nuclear ambitions will top South Korean President Moon Jae-in's agenda in Beijing during a visit this week aimed at breaking the ice after a furious row over Seoul's deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system.

While both South Korea and China share the goal of getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and stop testing increasingly sophisticated long-range missiles, the two have not seen eye-to-eye on how to achieve this.
China has been particularly angered at the deployment of U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, saying its powerful radar can see far into China and will do nothing to ease tension with North Korea.
At his third meeting this year with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday in Beijing, Moon is expected to reaffirm South Korea's agreement with China in late October that they would normalise exchanges and move past the dispute over THAAD, which froze trade and business exchanges between the two.
The THAAD disagreement had dented South Korea's economic growth, especially its tourism industry, as group tours from China came to a halt while charter flights from South Korea were cancelled.
While China still objects to THAAD, it has said it understands South Korea's decision to deploy it.
In an interview with Chinese state television shown late on Monday, Moon said THAAD's presence was inevitable due to the looming North Korean threat but assured it would not be used against China.
“South Korea will be extremely careful from here on out that the THAAD system is not invasive of China's security. South Korea has received promises from the United States multiple times regarding this,” Moon said.
Joint efforts by China and South Korea could have “good results” if they work together to bring North Korea to the negotiating table, he added.
North Korea has shown little sign it wants to engage in formal talks, with its state media citing leader Kim Jong-un as saying on Tuesday North Korea should develop and manufacture more diverse weapons to “completely overpower the enemy”.
Kim was addressing a rare munitions conference on Monday to laud the North's latest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).
North Korea last month test-launched what it called its most advanced ICBM in defiance of international sanctions and condemnation as it presses on with its mission to create a nuclear-tipped missile that can hit the United States.
Speaking over the weekend, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Moon had chosen to have “friendly cooperation” with China, and China was willing to work with South Korea to bring peace and stability to the Korean peninsula.
During his first visit to China since taking office in May this year, Moon is expected to get bilateral economic exchanges back on track. According to South Korean media, Moon will be accompanied by the biggest business entourage ever with more than 220 businesses taking part in the four-day visit.

Bomber uses aid supply vehicle to target busloads of evacuees waiting to leave besieged towns
A suicide car bomber has killed and injured at least 100 people and fractured a complex deal to evacuate four besieged towns in Syria, leaving thousands of people trapped in limbo.
The bomber targeted buses full of evacuees from government-held towns as they waited in a rebel-held area on the outskirts of Aleppo. He drove his explosives up to their vehicles in a van meant to carry aid supplies.
The Syrian Civil Defence in Aleppo province, also known as the White Helmets, said their volunteers pulled at least 100 bodies from the site of the explosion. White Helmets member Ibrahim Alhaj said the dead included many children and women.

Syrian state media said at least 39 were killed, including children. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at 43, adding that it would likely rise because of the extensive damage.
Images from the scene showed bodies on the ground around blackened vehicles, as thick smoke rose into the air. A senior rebel official said about 20 fighters guarding the buses had been killed, along with people inside.
Residents of rebel-held towns waiting in buses in government territory said they were terrified they could face reprisal attacks.
They appealed to international organisations including the UN for security guarantees, asking them to “provide the necessary protection to reach our final destinations”.
UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres condemned the attack on Saturday in a statement from his spokesman Stephane Dujarric, and called on all parties “to ensure the safety and security of those waiting to be evacuated.”
“Those responsible for today's attack must be brought to justice,” the statement added.
Several hours after the explosion, the Lebanese TV channel al-Manar, which is close to the Syrian government, showed new buses arriving to replace those damaged, as reports suggested the stalled exchange would soon restart.
Activists in opposition-held areas said they were waiting for confirmation that buses were on the move again. Both groups of evacuees, effectively being held as hostages, are just a short drive from their destinations.
About 7,000 people and fighters were being evacuated this weekend in a complex humanitarian deal that took months to agree.
Under it, 5,000 people were offered safe passage from the government-held towns of Fua and Kefraya, which are surrounded by rebels, and 2,000 left the rebel-held towns of Madaya and Zabadani near Damascus, which are besieged by government forces.
Both groups became stranded outside Aleppo, however, after the deal stalled and the two sides started wrangling over the number of fighters to be evacuated.
Ahmed Afandar, a resident evacuated from his home near Madaya, said: “The people are restless and the situation is disastrous. All these thousands of people are stuck in less than half a kilometre.”
The evacuees from Madaya were expected to head to rebel-held Idlib, 30 miles south-west of Aleppo.
Critics say the string of evacuations, which could see some 30,000 people moved across battle lines over the next 60 days, amounts to forced displacement along political and sectarian lines.

Radiohead previously said they planned to return to the studio before year's end to begin work on their ninth album, and we now have confirmation that they've done just that.
In a new interview with BBC Radio 1 (scroll to the 1:34:00 mark), guitarist Jonny Greenwood said the band is in the studio right now. “I'm late, they've all gone there now,” Greenwood quipped, before confirming the band is in fact “playing and recording.” He added that it's still early in the process and “we don't know” what sonic direction the album may take.
“I always feel as when we start up like we still don't know really how to do it, and we don't know quite what to do. ‘Looking down avenues' is a very kind way of putting the kind of fumbling that we do, mainly because every time we try and do it like the last time because that worked, it never seems to work. So we talk about different approaches and we're currently trying a bunch out.”
Whenever it finally does surface, the album will serve as the follow-up to 2011's The King of Limbs. See our list of 12 potential songs that could end up on the new LP.
The list of those who oppose Mississippi's "religious protection" law is growing as several amicus briefs were filed in federal court Dec. 23. (Photo: Justin Sellers/The Clarion-Ledger)
Two days before Christmas, 70 groups and individuals were included in motions filed in federal court offering additional reasons why House Bill 1523, a law Gov. Phil Bryant has chosen to defend, should be struck down. HB 1523, or the "Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act," legalizes discrimination against the LGBTQ community, opponents of the law claim.
The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is gearing up to hear arguments on HB 1523 after U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled the law unconstitutional in June. On Dec. 23, various attorneys filed six amicus briefs in the appellant court representing a total of 70 people or groups with a strong interest in the case.
RELATED: HB 1523 protest features performance of Mississippi-native's song
One of those, filed by Los Angeles-based attorney Justine Daniels, included local businesses like Molpus Woodlands Group, Belhaven Residential LLC, Ocean Springs Seafood Market Inc., Pritchett Engineering & Planning LLC,The ‘Sip Magazine LLC, Two Rivers Realty LLC, David Neil McCarty Law Firm PLLC, First Natchez Radio Group Inc. and Front Porch Fodder Publishing LLC as well as larger entities like Bloomberg L.P., International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), American International Group Inc., Levi Strauss & Co., and CVS Health Corp. Local firm Carson Law Group PLLC was also listed as counsel for these groups, which are described in this case by the legal term "amicus curiae."
"Most — if not all of the Amici — employ and/or serve lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (“LGBT”) persons or other citizens targeted by House Bill 1523 (“H.B. 1523”). And all the Amici agree that H.B. 1523 propagates — indeed legalizes — discrimination, undermining the public's interest in equality and acceptance," it stated.
Another brief, filed by local attorney Michael J. Bentley, demonstrated opposition to HB 1523 from Sanderson Farms Inc., headquartered in Laurel, Jackson law firm Sharpe & Wise and Mississippi business people Jack Reed Jr., president of R. W. Reed Co., John Palmer Sr., founder of GulfSouth Capital Inc., retired farmer William Percy III, Tim Medley of Medley & Brown and Talamieka Brice of Brice Media LLC. It also included same-sex couples Kelly Kyle and Hal Caudell, an attorney and a Nissan contract manager, and Amber and Jessica Kirkendoll.
"The law has no legitimate secular purpose, and whatever purpose the state might think up now is a sham for the Legislature's religiously motivated decision to confer favored status on one set of Christian beliefs about marriage and gender roles," Bentley wrote.
On Dec. 22, Los Angeles-based attorney Andrew Lundberg filed a similar motion on behalf of more than 80 national scholars who study LGBTQ populations and issues. In Mississippi, 3.3 percent of adults self-identify as LGBT, 13,650 of which identify as transgender, Lundberg wrote in his motion. And LGBTQ Mississippians are raising thousands of children. "A much higher percentage of LGBT people are raising children in Mississippi, compared to the nation as a whole," Lundberg wrote.
RELATED: Groups ask court to keep ban on HB 1523
"Research demonstrates that LGBT Mississippians and their families are vulnerable socio-economically and many are subject to discrimination in employment, housing and other important aspects of their lives. HB 1523, by elevating anti-LGBT religious beliefs over others, demeans and disadvantages LGBT people in the state. The Court should affirm the District Court's ruling," the motion states.
The original group of plaintiffs challenging the law — more than a dozen Mississippi ministers, community leaders, civic activists and a Hattiesburg church — asked the appeals court to allow Reeves' decision banning the law from taking effect to stand earlier this month.
Reeves ruled HB 1523 unconstitutional just minutes before it was set to begin July 1, writing that the law "violates both the guarantee of religious neutrality and the promise of equal protection of the laws."
Though Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood declined to appeal the decision on behalf of the state, Bryant hired private attorneys, including some working for Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal group that helped write HB 1523, to ask that the court uphold the law he signed in April.
Bryant argues HB 1523 "gives the opponents of same-sex marriage the same conscientious-objector protections that federal law confers on the opponents of warfare, abortion, capital punishment and physician-assisted suicide."

Background Edit
After tension between Russia and Britain in Europe ended with the June 1878 Congress of Berlin, Russia turned its attention to Central Asia. That same summer, Russia sent an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul. Sher Ali Khan, the Amir of Afghanistan, tried unsuccessfully to keep them out. Russian envoys arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878, and on 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission too.[9] The Amir not only refused to receive a British mission under Neville Bowles Chamberlain, but threatened to stop it if it were dispatched. Lord Lytton, the viceroy of India, ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for Kabul in September 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the Khyber Pass, triggering the Second Anglo–Afghan War.[9]
War Edit
Aftermath Edit
Abdur Rahman had confirmed the Treaty of Gandamak, leaving the British in control of the territories ceded by Yaqub Khan and ensuring British control of Afghanistan's foreign policy in exchange for protection and a subsidy.[16] Abandoning the provocative policy of maintaining a British resident in Kabul, but having achieved all their other objectives, the British withdrew.[14]

I keep encountering situations where RDBMS users think that one second for query execution is anything near fast. Most recently, in this Stack Overflow question:
Hibernate SQL In clause making CPU usage to 100%
The poster's original question was why a similar query executes in one second when executed in SQL Server Management Studio whereas the (seemingly) same query executes in 60 seconds when executed from Hibernate. The query looks similar to this:
select Student_Id from Student_Table where Roll_No in ('A101','A102','A103',.....'A250');
There might be many reasons for this difference. But the most striking message here is:
Please do not believe that 1 second is fast.
Databases are incredibly fast and simple queries like the one above should execute in virtually no time, even on mediocre servers. Even on your laptop! Markus Winand has made it a point to tell you that in 80% of all performance issues, all you have to do is to add that missing index. And that's the case here as well!
The poster's original table contains only two indexes:
CREATE TABLE student_table ( Student_Id BIGINT NOT NULL IDENTITY , Class_Id BIGINT NOT NULL , Student_First_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL , Student_Last_Name VARCHAR(100) , Roll_No VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY (Student_Id) , CONSTRAINT UK_StudentUnique_1 UNIQUE (Class_Id, Roll_No) );
There is an index to implement the PRIMARY KEY , and there's another index for the UNIQUE constraint, but both indexes aren't really very useful, as the query predicate filters on Roll_No , which is only the second column of the UNIQUE constraint. When executing the above query on roughly 8 million rows, I'm getting an index scan on the UNIQUE index and the query runs in three seconds:
This “Index Scan” operation is not good at all. I'm actually running through all of the index to find all the applicable Roll_No values in each index leaf node. This is explained well in Use The Index Luke's page about concatenated indexes
The solution
But the good news is, SQL Server Management Studio gives you immediate tuning advice. Just right-click on the execution plan and choose “Missing Index Details…” to get the following advice:
/* Missing Index Details from SQLQuery1.sql - LUKAS-ENVY\SQLEXPRESS.test The Query Processor estimates that implementing the following index could improve the query cost by 87.5035%. */ /* USE [test] GO CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [<Name of Missing Index>] ON [dbo].[student_table] ([Roll_No]) INCLUDE ([Student_Id]) GO */
This doesn't necessarily mean that the above index is the optimal choice for all your queries, but the fact that you're querying using a predicate on Roll_No should be a strong-enough indicator that you should have an index on at least this Roll_No column. The simplest possible index here is simply:
CREATE INDEX i_student_roll_no ON student_table (Roll_No);
With that index in place, we'll now get an “Index Seek” operation, which runs instantly:
Covering index
In this particular case, a “covering index” as suggested by Vlad Mihalcea in his answer might be appropriate. For instance:
CREATE INDEX i_student_roll_no ON student_table (Roll_No, Student_Id);
The advantage of a covering index is that all the information needed for the query execution is already contained in the index. This is true in this particular case, but it can also be dangerous as:
The covering index needs more space, and if the table is already large, space might become an issue
The covering index only adds value as long as the query doesn't also use additional columns (e.g. for projections, calculations, additional filtering, sorting, etc.). This is probably not the case in this simple example, which might change quickly in the near future
Thus, a covering index shouldn't be your default choice in such cases. Better be conservative and add only those columns in the index, that add immediate value for filtering.
Conclusion
I'd like to repeat this time and again:
Do NOT think that one second is fast
In fact:
Do NOT think that anything beyond 2-3ms is fast!
Unless you're doing heavy reporting or batch processing, where processing time obviously might take a bit longer, simple queries like these should never be anything slower than instant. And most of the time, you can achieve this speed by adding an index.
On a side-note
The poster of the aforementioned question obviously has other issues as well. None of the above explain the execution speed difference between Hibernate and “plain SQL”. But again, the message here is that if your “plain SQL” already takes more than one second, you have a very low-hanging fruit to fix.

Blogging is such a funny thing, a constant pull between complete anonymity and total exposure. Being more than a bit shy and reserved in my real life persona, I rather enjoy the wall I get to hide behind while I ride on this internet superhighway, so I didn't know what to make of an email I received shortly after posting this Asian turkey burger with Sriracha mayo recipe asking if I'd like to be interviewed for a documentary about Sriracha.
A couple of years ago I would have quickly shunned the idea—too much fear and pressure in plopping in front of camera to be a talking head—but right now I'm in a "busting out of my shell" phase, and decided to dive right in, for better or worse. As the interview looms later this afternoon, my head is whirling with mixture of anxiety and tasty tidbits I could impart in my love for Sriracha, which got me thinking of this recipe I had lurking in the backlog for Thai beef rolls with sweet chili sauce—featuring a brief cameo by Sriracha, of course.
Of all the hundreds of grilling recipes I've tackled since starting the Meatwave, this is up there as one of my fondest. There are a lot of reasons for this, starting with the fact that these were first introduced to me at a Meatwave by one of my most loyal followers, Chris. I fell in love with his creation instantly—the spicy Thai meat paired with the sweet basil was a most perfect of pairings, leaving me to mostly hord the beef skewers for myself that day, unable to get enough.
After that, I knew I had to make these myself, which brings about the second reason this recipe is so close to my heart—it posed a good challenge. While Chris's version used regular sweet basil, I was dead set on finding the more appropriate Thai basil. The journey for it brought me through multiple neighborhoods and Asian groceries that dot the 7 line in Queens, but I didn't come up with gold until I hit Main Street, which just happens to be a Thai basil Mecca.
With my ingredient quest fulfilled, I went forth mixing the beef with a rather ubiquitous combination of Thai flavors—green onions, mint, chilies, fish sauce and sugar. I formed the cutest little meat logs and picked off the largest basil leaves to wrap the beef in before skewering them.
And enter Sriracha. Only playing a minimal role in the ingredient list, this paste comprised of chilis, vinegar, garlic, sugar and salt didn't let its presence go unknown. Without the Sriracha, this dipping sauce would have had no kick, and the balance between sweet and spicy is just another reason I love this recipe so.
Just as I'm about ready to walk out the door to become a certified student film food documentary celebrity, these little beauties got their 15 minutes, photographing like superstar. The greatest achievement though is their taste totally blew their good looks to bits. All the diverse flavors came together to be both a contradiction and compliment, creating a complexity that was an excitement in each mouthful. Now, if I can only turn out a fraction as good on film as these babies did in my stomach, I'll be lucky.
Thai Beef Rolls with Sweet Chili Sauce
- serves 6 -
Adapted from Weber's Charcoal Grilling: The Art of Cooking With Live Fire by Jamie Purviance and Tim Turner.
Ingredients
For the sauce:
3 tablespoons granulated sugar
3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon thinly sliced green onions
1 tablespoon fish sauce
2 teaspoons Sriracha
For the filling:
1 pound ground chuck (80% lean)
1/4 cup thinly sliced green onions
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint
1 tablespoon finely chopped Thai chilis
1 teaspoon fish sauce
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 bunch of Thai basil
12 wooden skewers, soaked in water for at least 30 minutes
Procedure
1. Mix all the ingredients for the sauce in a small bowl until the sugar has dissolved.
2. In a large bowl, gently combine the ground chuck with the rest of the filling ingredients.
3. Shape a tablespoon of the filling into a small log. Wrap 1 basil leaf around the beef and thread onto a skewer. Repeat until all of the filling is gone.
4. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread coals out evenly over the charcoal grate. Clean and oil the cooking grate. Grill the rolls until the filling is fully cooked and slightly firm, about 6 to 8 minutes, turning once during cooking. Serve immediately with the dipping sauce.
Evading RF (radar frequency) missiles is not unlike running from a bear. You don't have to outrun the threat itself but merely offer up a more tasty morsel instead—be that your pudgy buddy or, in the case of air combat, a juicy decoy with an enormous radar cross-section.
The/ALE-50, nicknamed "Little Buddy," is a towed decoy designed to counter incoming RF missiles. Carried in an under-wing pylon and deployed at the end of a long tow rope, the ALE-50 exploits an RF missile's basic targeting function—that is, locking on and tracking their targets by continually pinging them with radar—by presenting a target with a massive radar cross-section compared to the plane pulling it. The RF missile interprets this larger cross-section as a bigger plane (and presumably more valuable target) and locks onto the decoy instead.

First developed in 1988, the US Air Force, Navy, and Marines now all employ this countermeasure in their F-16, F/A-18E/F, and B-1B aircraft. It's seen action in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq and has successfully intercepted missiles in both training and actual combat. And while the $22,000 price tag affixed to each of the 27,000 ALE-50 units Raytheon has already delivered to the military might seem steep, compared to losing a $66.3 million Super Hornet, they're a steal.

The security guard who shot and killed a Westminster man this weekend may have been justified, police said Monday, because the victim pointed a pellet gun that looked like a real gun at the guard.
“This airsoft gun, in particular, had the orange cap removed. But even then, in the heat of the moment in darkness, it's hard to tell. They really look like real guns,” Westminster police spokeswoman Cheri Spottke said.
Family members said David Ludewig, 24, was celebrating news his wife was pregnant with their first child. He was drunk, they said, when the guard confronted him for allegedly urinating on a trash bin outside his apartment at 8300 North Sheridan Boulevard at approximately 1:30 a.m. on Saturday.
After the confrontation, police said, Ludewig returned to his home to fetch the weapon. Then, according to police, witnesses said the guard retreated after Ludewig pointed the weapon at him. The guard then fired.
Spottke said the guard, whose name hasn't been released, works for Pentagon Protective Service and is licensed to carry a gun in the city.
“I don't think he probably would have chosen to fire his weapon had he not thought there was a direct threat to his life,” she said.
Ludewig's cousin, Johnny Secrest, witnessed the confrontation and said that many residents complained about the guard. But he said his cousin made a mistake.
“Nobody please pull a pellet gun out,” he said. “It is the wrong thing to do.”
Monday's statement from police is the first indication they believe the guard may not have been at fault. Earlier, Spottke said in a statement: “The Westminster police would like to remind everyone it is difficult to differentiate between an airsoft gun and a real gun. This is an ongoing investigation and the case will be presented to the district attorney's office later in the week.”
Ludewig's family has planned a celebration of his life and benefit for his unborn child at Herman's Hideaway in Denver on Sept. 25 from 7 p.m. to midnight.
The victims went missing after their delegation came under attack during an outreach visit to the southern town of Womey on September 16
Published 9:13 AM, September 25, 2014
CONAKRY, Guinea – Police in Guinea have arrested 27 suspects over the murders of an eight-member Ebola education team attacked by angry locals in an area at the epicenter of the outbreak, the government said on Wednesday, September 24.
The victims, said to include local health officials and journalists, went missing after their delegation came under attack during an outreach visit to the southern town of Womey on Tuesday last week, September 16.
Eight bodies were recovered from the septic tank of a nearby primary school two days later.
"Most of the main perpetrators of these crimes have been placed under arrest -- a total of 27 people," Justice Minister Cheick Sacko told a news conference in the capital Conakry.
He said the suspects were being questioned in the southern city of N'Zerekore by the public prosecutor.
"The government will see this to the end. I promise to see that justice is done and to make the guilty pay the price for this inhuman tragedy," he added.
The deadliest Ebola epidemic on record has killed nearly 3,000 people in west Africa and infected twice that number, according to the World Health Organization.
The virus emerged in Guinea at the start of the year and has infected 1,008 Guineans, killing 632 of them.
The spread in Guinea has been accompanied by fear and paranoia by villagers who feel the government and the international community cannot be trusted.
Many Guineans believe local and foreign healthcare workers are part of a conspiracy to either deliberately introduce the outbreak, or invented it as a means of luring Africans to clinics to harvest their blood and organs.
Police lieutenant Richard Haba told Agence France-Presse last week the outreach team was attacked by protesters who had come "to kill them because they think Ebola is nothing more than an invention of white people to kill black people".
At least 21 people were wounded during violent scenes in which the team was pelted with stones, according to local police.
There was further violence on Tuesday, September 23, in the southwestern town of Forecariah between security forces and locals angry at the burial by Red Cross workers of an elderly woman thought to have contracted Ebola.
Witnesses told Agence France-Presse on Wednesday protesters threw stones at the burial team, forcing them to flee as traffic came to a standstill and shops and offices were closed.
A local government official said the family had been wrongly informed that the Red Cross were going to cut up the body.
There was no immediate information on the size of the crowd and whether there had been any casualties. – Rappler.com
Congress approved legislation Friday that allows retired Marine Gen. James Mattis to run the Pentagon in the Trump administration.
The House easily cleared the bill, 268-151, despite complaints from many Democrats that Republicans had rushed the measure unnecessarily. The Senate overwhelmingly passed the legislation a day earlier. A White House spokesman said President Barack Obama would sign the measure if Congress approved it before he leaves office.
The bill grants a one-time exception for Mattis from the law that bars former service members who have been out of uniform for less than seven years from holding the top Pentagon job. The restriction is meant to preserve civilian control of the military. Mattis, 66, retired from the Marine Corps in 2013.
Congress last granted an exception to the law in 1950 for George Marshall, a former five-star Army general and secretary of state.
Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said the panel held no substantive hearings to examine the impact of the legislation. He also faulted Republicans for not pushing back when the Trump transition team refused to allow Mattis to testify before the panel Thursday afternoon after he had completed his confirmation hearing in the Senate.
"We are being treated as irrelevant," Smith said.
Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the committee's top Republican, blamed the transition team for "short-sightedness." But he rejected Smith's assessment.
"We're not irrelevant because if we do not vote for this legislation, (Mattis) does not serve," Thornberry said.
He also said that passing the bill before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in ensures a seamless transition at the Pentagon at a time when the United States faces an array of threats.
"The fact is unless we pass this bill today we are not able to have a secretary of defense on Jan. 20," Thornberry said. The House will not be in session next week.
The Senate passed the legislation by an 81-17 vote with 30 Democrats backing the bill. The legislation is separate from a Senate confirmation vote on Mattis. But the strong bipartisan support signals there are no real hurdles to approving Trump's choice for defense secretary.
During a military career than lasted four decades, Mattis served in numerous senior military positions, including commander of U.S. Central Command in charge of all American forces in the Middle East.
“You get really overwhelmed by all the issues about returning to work,” said Ms. Cohen, who left her job in finance to focus on raising four children during her 11 years out of the work force. “It is hard to separate the real ones that are emotional versus the actual conversations that you might have.”
Of course, not all new parents or people in need of a leave to care for children or aging parents can afford a timeout. Most women in the workplace see little or no choice about returning to full-time work after their maternity leave ends, with so many families today relying on two incomes to get by. In 40 percent of households with children under the age of 18, married and single mothers are either the sole or primary source of income for the family, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center analysis.
Betsy Myers, the founding director of the Center for Women and Business at Bentley University, said women filled about half of the middle-management ranks in many companies today. “Then there is a drop-off,” she said. “They go from 50 percent to 10 percent to 15 percent of women in their C-suite jobs.”
She said companies were recognizing they had to do more to retain women managers to get balanced leadership at the top. One of the most important ways, she said, is to show how much company leaders value employees considering a hiatus.
Ms. Myers, author of the book “Take The Lead,” also said that both men and women needed to be involved in figuring how to create a work force with gender balance. So do different generations, she said, given the rise of millennials in the workplace and their expectations of living a more balanced life.
In a reflection of this, the women's employee affinity network at the bank HSBC changed its name, she said. “They call it the Balance Affinity Network,” she said. “They want to invite men to the table and the different generations. They want to create a culture where it is not just, ‘How do we keep women?' but ‘How do we harness the best talent in our company where people will want to stay?' ”

Julia Stiles in Between Us
My film Between Us is about to come out in theaters and one of the questions I've been asked at some of the 22 festivals in seven countries I've been to (and yes, that sound you hear is my feet splashing on the beach when I won the Grand Jury Prize in the Bahamas) is how the hell I got a cast like Julia Stiles, Taye Diggs, Melissa George and David Harbour in a movie that according to Kickstarter only cost $10,000? So let me explain…
1. Choose Castable Material. One reason I chose to adapt an Off-Broadway play in the first place is I knew I'd find good, castable material that no one else was turning into a feature. I actually turned down Beau Willimon's play Farragut North, and George Clooney turned it into Ides of March and got a happy ending from my sloppy seconds. It was good, but I knew would be hard to adapt for a low budget, if need be. But with Between Us, I knew it was at its heart four people in two rooms — how hard could that be? More importantly, the four parts were incredibly well written, with great chew-the-scenery moments for each actor. They were also written for 30-ish-year-old actors, and the two female parts were especially rich. That's key: There are far more working (and famous) actresses than actors, and there aren't enough good parts for them. So if you can get a script with really great female roles, you're golden.
2. Assemble a Team. Contrary to popular wisdom, you don't need an A-list casting director. What you need is someone who can sound like a credible casting director on the phone. I teamed up with Alison Buck, who'd been recommended by my pal, director Matthew Harrison. Alison had recently moved to L.A. from New Zealand and been working as a casting director in her spare time while also holding down a day job as a manager. Which meant that she had an office, a phone, knew the casting lingo and had the confidence to sound like the movie was happening. Yes, she had some contacts in the agenting world, but that's not why we got her. She also had the stamina to stay committed to the film for what wound up being over four years.
But the casting director was only part of the team. I also needed to surround myself with a credible group of producers. To that end, I rounded up New Yorker Mike Ryan, who'd had seven films at Sundance. His claim to fame was helping discover Amy Adams in Junebug. I got Hans Ritter in L.A., who'd been instrumental in discovering Ellen Page in Hard Candy. Barry Hennessey was a four-time Emmy winning producer on Amazing Race… and had been my line producer on my previous film. And to top it off, we got Dana Altman, my producing partner on my first film, and Robert Altman's grandson… not bad casting genes in his DNA! And of course, as the co-founder of Slamdance, and with some good casting under my belt for my previous film (Open House with Oscar-nominee Sally Kellerman, Anthony Rapp, Kellie Martin, et al), there was proof that I knew how to work with at least somewhat fancy actors.
3. Aim High. So with that team on paper, we decided to tell people we were making the film for $2 or 3 million! This was in 2007-8, so it didn't sound so crazy at the time. And at that budget, the prevailing wisdom was to offer something called “Schedule F” which SAG says is a $65,000 flat rate. Now of course, we didn't have a dime. So that meant we were doing “finance contingent” casting. Which means some of the agents and managers will take you seriously (10% of $65k is still enough to support at least a small coke habit), so they'll get someone in the office to do coverage on the script and it gets in the system.
4. Go to New York. Something I learned by casting both Open House and Between Us is to target junior agents at the big agencies — and specifically ones in their New York offices. The L.A. talent agents are all running around like crazy trying to get their actors booked into pilot season. Television is where the long-term money is for the agencies. The L.A. people have neither the time nor inclination to worry about indie films, no matter what their budget. But, the New York branches of those same agencies spend more time trying to get prestige Broadway jobs for their L.A.-based high profile actor clients. Consequently, they're also better attuned to know which actors in their clientele are inclined to want to do (and can afford to do) meaty, “actor-y” roles — whether they be on stage or in indie films. In general, the New York agents also tend to have gone to classier Ivy League schools, think they're smarter, and have more time on their hands to actually sit down and read a script (and not just pass it on to a bitter intern to do coverage).
The sweet spot is to find a junior agent in New York — someone who just finished being an assistant, just got their own desk, but doesn't yet have their own assistant. These are the hungry young bucks, eager to make a mark for themselves by discovering great material and prove themselves to their senior agents, A-list clients and the big bosses in L.A. And without their own assistants, they'll actually answer their own phone!
5. Be Bi-Coastally Curious. From New York, come back to L.A.. This confuses the agencies, in a good way. If they think you're bi-coastal, they will take you more seriously (Scott Rudin has offices in L.A. and N.Y., why shouldn't you?). If you live in L.A., get a 917 number. If you live in N.Y., get a 323. Leave messages at 6:00 AM in L.A. or 9:00 PM in N.Y. Then play them off against each other: “Oh yes, that sitcom actor's good, but your N.Y. colleague has this other Broadway actor that seems more… how do I put this? Substantial. Do you have any feature actors who are better?”
6. Don't Have a List! Every director has some sort of list in mind about your dream cast. Forget it! You will never get your dream cast. Not all of them, not on your budget, and not on the week you want to start shooting. And then when you do cast someone else, you will always view them as inferior to the person you had in mind when you wrote the script or made your list. This is an important concept both creatively and practically.
Agents spend most of their time soullessly getting offers and pushing them on to their clients. For this, they went to Penn? So, when you meet with that junior agent in NY, tell him or her about the roles, and then say, “Who do you think would be good in this?” All of a sudden, it empowers the agent and makes them emotionally vested in the film. They will undoubtedly come up with the exact same list of clients that you would have thought of from scouring IMDbPro, but sometimes they will surprise you and come up with a new client they just signed, or someone bigger than you thought you could get. The point is, it will be their idea, and they will work ten times harder to get that person than if you had suggested them. Now they have something to prove to you (and their colleagues), and not the other way around.
7. Develop Relationships with Agents Yourself. No matter how good or powerful your casting director is, you as the filmmaker need to develop and cultivate relationships with talent agents and managers yourself: Buy them coffee in Park City, take them out to breakfast in Venice, share sushi on St. Mark's. Whatever it takes. This is much better time spent than cultivating relationships with actors: You could spend 20 years buddying up to the next Tom Cruise, but when you finally need to cast your famous BFF, they might happen to be in rehab that month, and you're screwed. But agents or managers who you know will always have other clients available, and will have them for not just this film, but for all your films in the future. That junior agent in New York will be a senior manager in L.A. by the time you make your next movie.
Even if you've gotten an A-list casting director, you need to develop these relationships yourself. You may have gotten lucky with a casting director this time, but next year when you want to make a Dogma 95 film in your kitchen, you won't have a casting director to fall back on. It's also more impressive for the young agents and managers to speak with the “director” and not just the casting director. Alison and I had a great system: If she contacted an agent, she would constantly refer to “the director” following up with them, and when I knew an agent, I would refer to my “casting director” as following up with them. It gave the impression that we had a real team who cared what that agent thought. And of course we always said our “assistants” would be dropping off a script, though invariably the assistant was me.
8. Play the Agency Game. As friendly as you get with one agent, make sure you're also friends with another. Typically you get three bites at the apple with an agency: If three actors pass on the same script, they will stop returning your calls. And if all your actors do come from the same agent, then the power shifts, and you're beholden to that agent — for better or for worse. To keep your casting momentum going, it's best to play the agencies off against each other. Use the nuggets of success with one agency (“Oh, you know WME's got the script out to Jennifer…”) as leverage to get the other agencies to move (“Well, yes, I suppose you could slip it to Ben for the weekend read”). Likewise, play the managers off against the agencies. Remember, it's a game. Have fun with it! (And to really see how much fun it is to play agencies against each other, see this.)
9. Bait and Switch. With Between Us, just as we were getting a great cast, the economy fell through in 2008 and there was no way to make a film for any budget. Luckily for me, I got a book deal on a completely unrelated project, and after it had run its course two years later, we came back to Between Us — but this time the approach was to do it on a microbudget. Yes, we raised $10,000 on Kickstarter (back when that was considered a successful campaign) but indirectly raised another $30,000 or so. That was enough money to be able to pay actors $100 a day (SAG ultra-low scale if your budget is under $200k).
The crew wouldn't get paid, but that's our problem, not the actors. The script was exactly the same as before; we never rewrote it for a smaller budget. So we could go back to the same agents and managers we were in touch with before and they would still take our calls and use the same coverage as before. Legally, if you have a backed offer they have to pass it on to their clients, no matter how small that offer is. And frankly, an agent will take you more seriously if you have 100% of a $40,000 budget in the bank than if you have zero percent of a $3 million budget in the bank.
10. Set a Start Date. This is a lesson I learned from Robert Altman: Set a start date, and they will come. For most actors — particularly those who've been on TV series, or big-budget movies — they don't need the money. It really doesn't matter whether it's $65,000 or $100 a day. They're doing it for the roles. The key thing is the start date. If they're available, they will want to work. Actors abhor a vacuum in their schedules. And there's nothing agents hate more than whiny clients calling them every day asking why they're out of work. The start date is more important than the budget: No one wants to get left behind.
11. Make it Real. As soon as you start asking questions like “does your client have any peanut allergies we should be aware of?” (since all you can afford to feed them is PB&J) or “what is your client's hat size?” (to give the impression that you've already hired a wardrobe department), the agents will believe that you really are making the movie.
12. Magnetic Balls of Iron. You need some serious cojones to pull all this off properly. It helps to know that you have backup actors in a pinch. For literally years, I had been meeting actors for coffee (it's axiomatic that actors don't eat, so you can take them to reasonably nice places and not go broke). So I knew we could always make the film with talented actors if we wanted. Remember, as you cast, most of these so-called attachments will fall through. The micro-budget indie will always get trumped by the Spielberg film or pilot shoot for Scandal. But as long as they don't all fall through the same day, you're fine. In our case, Taye Diggs originally thought he was signing up to be in a movie with Michael C. Hall, America Ferrera and Kerry Washington. But thankfully, as they all dropped out at different times, Taye stuck with the film and we were able to build up our cast again. And of course, his agent was now even more motivated to help us out (which he definitely did).
13. Take Advantage of Others' Misfortune. As you get closer to that start date, your ability to cast closer to the A-list actually increases. In our case, the best example was Julia Stiles. She'd always been floating around our lists (I lied; of course we had lists), but I knew she was booked for six months in a Neil LaBute play on Broadway. But her agent called me in a panic: Despite rehearsing for a month, that play's financing had fallen through two hours before, and they needed to fill Julia's schedule. Was I interested? Yes, make the offer! (I knew her manager was already a fan of the script, having taken him to breakfast in Venice some three years before). Within 24 hours, Julia called me and said she was in. Two weeks later, she was in my kitchen rehearsing the movie.
Now then, was all this the work of years of careful preparation and planning? Or did we simply take advantage of an actress in her most vulnerable emotional state and swoop in to save her? It doesn't matter. The point is we made the movie with amazing actors who delivered performances that are already winning awards and critical plaudits.
And by the way, remember that so-called $10,000 budget? Once we did get our actors and started shooting, we got a very nice financier to invest in the film. His check may have only cleared three days before the END of principal photography, but clear it did, and even most of the crew got paid. It may not be the ideal way to make a movie, but it's definitely one way.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau thinks Canadians old enough to drink alcohol are old enough to smoke marijuana legally.
Trudeau made the point at a press conference in Ottawa Thursday, days after a federal task force on marijuana legalization recommended the national minimum age to buy recreational marijuana be set at 18. The report also suggested provinces and territories be permitted to raise the age to harmonize with alcohol consumption laws.

In most provinces, the legal drinking age is 19. In Quebec, Manitoba, and Alberta, the age limit is 18.
The Canadian Medical Association had urged the task force to recommend a minimum age of 21, pointing to evidence that brains are still developing until the age of 25.
The prime minister, who has long said pot legalization is about keeping the drug away from children and profits away from criminals, told reporters the task force's recommendation felt like a “reasonable” compromise.
“We know the largest misdeeds of marijuana use happens at a lower age than 18, 19 years of age, and I think this is a responsible approach that we have found in terms of balance that is both practical and useful,” he said in French.
High minimum age would preserve illicit market: report
The task force, chaired by former Liberal justice minister Anne McLellan, acknowledged in its report that there are a range of views on the right age to be able to buy legal pot.

Setting the age too high risks “preserving the illicit market,” the report reads, and raising the possibility young Canadians will face criminal records since “the highest rates of use are in the 18 to 24 age range.”
The report also said a minimum age of 25, as recommended by the CMA, was “unrealistic” and would force many young Canadians to turn to the black market.
Tories blast recommendation
Conservative health critic Colin Carrie charged in the House of Commons Tuesday that the recommendation “directly contradicted” the prime minister's aims to keep the drug away from kids.
“Are the Liberals going to make a political decision or an evidence-based decision?.”
— Colin Carrie
Carrie pointed to the CMA's recommendation and scientific evidence that pot use can have “serious effects” on the brain up to the age of 25.
“Are the Liberals going to make a political decision or an evidence-based decision?” Carrie asked.
Health Minister Jane Philpott responded that the government will review the task force's report closely before tabling legislation in the spring to legalize, regulate and restrict access to cannabis.
NDP wants immediate decriminalization
On Thursday, Trudeau said he was confident the upcoming legislation will “protect children from the easy access they currently have to marijuana and to remove the criminal element that exists in the marijuana market.”
Meanwhile, New Democrats continue to hammer Trudeau over his refusal to immediately decriminalize pot so young Canadians will not continue to get criminal records for possessing a drug that will one day be legal in Canada.
NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair asked Trudeau in the House this week how he was protecting young Canadians by continuing to hand out criminal convictions.
“Until we change the laws, the laws stand,” Trudeau said.

Advertisement At least 200 people have been killed in violence between Christians and Muslims in the Nigerian city of Jos, says the monitoring group, Human Rights Watch. Troops ordered by Nigeria's vice-president to help police restore order have arrived and are patrolling the streets, enforcing a 24-hour curfew. The fighting, which broke out on Sunday, has prompted thousands of people to flee the city. Houses, mosques and churches have been burnt down and many people arrested. It is believed to be the first time Goodluck Jonathan has used executive powers since President Umaru Yar'Adua left Nigeria for hospital treatment in Saudi Arabia in November. Lt Col Shekari Galadima, a spokesman for the 3rd Division of the Nigerian Army, told the BBC's Network Africa programmes the streets were calm and the troops in control of the situation. The area has seen several bouts of deadly violence in recent years. At least 200 people were killed in an outbreak of fighting between Muslims and Christians in 2008, while some 1,000 died in a riot in 2001. Violence spreading The current violence has forced at least 3,000 people from their homes. On Tuesday the violence spread beyond the city boundaries to neighbouring areas. ANALYSIS Shehu Saulawa, BBC Hausa Jos has long been a time-bomb waiting to explode. The town is split into Christian and Muslim areas. The divisions have been perpetuated by Nigeria's system of classifying people as indigenes and settlers. Hausa-speaking Muslims have been living in Jos for many decades but are still classified as settlers, meaning it is difficult for them to stand for election. The two groups are also divided along party political lines with Christians mostly backing the ruling PDP, and Muslims generally supporting the opposition ANPP. In Nigeria, political office means access to resources. The death toll has not been verified independently and it is not known how many Christians have died. Human Rights Watch say at least 200 have died in the latest outbreak of violence. Balarabe Dawud, head of the Central Mosque in Jos, told AFP news agency he had counted 192 bodies since Sunday. Muhammad Tanko Shittu, a mosque worker who was helping to prepare mass burials, told Reuters he had counted 149 bodies. Jos is in Nigeria's volatile Middle Belt - between the mainly Muslim north and the south where the majority is Christian or follow traditional religions. Correspondents say such clashes in Nigeria are often blamed on sectarianism. However, poverty and access to resources such as land often lie at the root of the violence. It is unclear what the trigger was for the latest bout of violence. Plateau State spokesman Dan Manjang told Network Africa there were reports that it may have started after a football match. But he said it would be surprising if football was the reason. Reuters quoted residents as saying the violence started after an argument over the rebuilding of homes destroyed in the 2008 clashes.

LANSING, Mich. - Senator Coleman A. Young II has introduced a bill to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in Michigan.
Senate Bill No. 813 would require dispensaries to apply, register, pay renewal fees, and regulate growth, testing, and more.
It's estimated that the marijuana business could become a $400 million a year boost to the Michigan economy if laws similar to those in Colorado are introduced in Michigan.
“This isn't the wild, wild west,” Young said. “It would be heavily regulated.”
Young said too many people are in jail on marijuana raps and he wants to see that end and see the government get out of the way.
“If you're 21 or older and you're not hurting anybody and you want to smoke a bong and stare at a fireplace for four and a half hours, that's your right,” Young said. “Leave people alone.”
Taxes would be imposed on dispensaries and growing facilities, with the revenue going to education and other public purposes.
Young said the state should regulate it at every turn and that taxes would run high.
“We can tax it,” Young said. “We can use the money for the educational system like they do in Colorado. I just think it would be a great benefit if we did it.”
The bill stipulates the use of marijuana should be legal for people ages 21 and above.
It has been referred to the Committee on Judiciary for further review.

The director of national intelligence on Wednesday said officials had seen signs of attempted cyberattacks on 2016 presidential campaigns.
“We've already had some indications of that,” James R. Clapper Jr. said at a cyber-event at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington.
He did not indicate whether the attempted intrusions were successful or whether they were by foreign or domestic hackers. Nor did he specify whether the websites or campaign networks of Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders or Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump were targeted.
“We're aware that campaigns and related organizations and individuals are targeted by actors with a variety of motivations — from philosophical differences to espionage — and capabilities — from defacements to intrusions,” said Brian P. Hale, director of public affairs for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. “We defer to FBI for specific incidents.”
In 2008, Chinese hackers compromised the computer networks of Sens. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.). In 2012, foreign and domestic hackers tried to gain access to the campaign networks of Obama and Mitt Romney (R).
The U.S. government and American businesses have become constant targets for hackers. In 2013, federal agents notified more than 3,000 U.S. companies that their computer systems had been hacked in the previous year. The Pentagon reportedly sees millions of attempts a day.
Clapper said the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are working “to educate campaigns against potential cyberthreats.”
He added: “I anticipate as the campaigns intensify, we'll probably have more of those [attempts].”

Recently, a short clip of Apink's Son Naeun's acting in “Twenty Again” went viral on Korean social media with people mocking her lack of skills in acting. A post was even made on Pann, a popular Korean community site titled, “Why is Son Naeun so bad at acting..”.
“Her fans keep saying she's good at acting on Pann so I took a look at her acting and she's bad… Which part are people saying she's good in. All the comments on the video say she's terrible as well.”

Therefore, if students talk about how school sucks and they know that it is normal that school sucks because their parents tell them that school sucked for them too and their teachers tell them that they have to accept it, then they will not believe that anything is wrong and will not fight for improvement. They can't imagine that there is an alternative.
If people talk about the rate of divorces, they will all agree that this is really bad and that relationships are really difficult. They will not discuss whether the model of an exclusive two-person relationship is really the only available model or if other models might work better.
If only about half the population takes part in elections and the results are discussed with either disillusion, disappointment or, more commonly now, shock, now one suggests that maybe this political system of democracy is not the best we have despite its flaws.
If you suggest to students of a regular school that there are alternative schools, their eyes glaze over or they make “dancing your name”-jokes or they even get angry or they get really skeptical. If you talk to people about open relationships they will say “That's not for me” without ever really considering it or they tell you that they don't understand it or they might get angry. If you tell people that democracy is not the only way of living together and probably not the best, they look at you as if you switched to a different language or they ask you if you want to go back to communism or Hitler, often not without a sense of anger.
If you point out to the prisons most people are living in, they mostly will refuse to look at it because they have learned to accept prison as the normal state of things. The kid in Room goes through a long period of fear and regression because to him being locked in a room with your mom all your life was normal. People in unhappy relationships or mind-numbing jobs or hindering childhood traumas are often the same. They rather live with someone they have stopped loving a long time ago instead of thinking about alternatives. Sure, they might have an affair but it's clear that this is wrong and temporary. Having a career in a job you don't particularly enjoy seems more reasonable than to find a more likeable job. Therapy seems threatening to many.
President Barack Obama's approval rating sank to a new low Friday, according to Gallup's daily presidential tracking poll.
Just 40 percent of Americans say they approve of Obama's performance as president. That is down three percentage points from Thursday. Fifty percent say they do not approve of the job he is doing.
The poor rating comes amidst an increasingly chaotic debate over raising the debt ceiling, as the deadline looms to raise it or risk the government defaulting on its debts.
Just 41 percent of the public said they approved of the way Obama was handling the debt-ceiling negotiations, while 52 percent disapproved, according to another Gallup poll released Thursday. Nonetheless, Obama still polls better than congressional leadership. Speaker of the House John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid both received even lower approval rates.
The president's 40 percent approval rating follows a Pew Research Center for the People and the Press poll released Thursday that found Obama's support among independents has eroded a great deal. Fully 54 percent of independents disapprove of Obama's performance as president, according to the Pew poll, the most during his time in office. Just 36 percent approve of the job he is doing.
Obama has also lost ground against a generic Republican challenger, attracting 41 percent of the vote when matched with an unnamed Republican, who polled 40 percent.
Obama's approval rating is below that of former President Bill Clinton's lowest approval rating during the government shutdowns of 1995. At the very end of the shutdown, Clinton's approval rating was 42 percent, but quickly rebounded back to over 50 percent. His lowest approval rating ever was 37 percent in June 1993.

One of the most hotly debated topics in the world of the Go programming language, is the lack of generics. Generics are considered a key feature in other statically typed programming languages like Java or C#. However, the makers of Go resisted the demand to add it to the language so far. A key reason why Go's makers and developers could utilize the language in complex production software without the presence of generics, is because of the “empty interface” feature, which helped fill some of the gaps left by the lack of generics in Go.
After going through the feedback that I received for the article, I just wanted to clarify that the article doesn't cover every single user case for generics. The purpose of the article is rather to give the reader an idea of why people like generics, and what Go can offer instead.
It is also recommended to only use empty interfaces when you have no other choice. Otherwise, you can create your own interface that is supported by the types you are expected to use. An example of an unavoidable situation where you have to use the empty interface is the Print functions in the ‘fmt' package, or the Json marshaller in the ‘encoding/json' package, where you have no idea what types will come your way.
Generics, an overview
First things first, let's start this correctly: What exactly are generics and why are they important?
The governing principle behind generic programming is that you write your code with ‘types to be specified later'. This basically means that you don't specify your object types while writing your code, but instead you use ‘templates' or ‘placeholders' to be later replaced with your types. At compile time, the compiler can perform proper type checks.
Let's explore an example in Java where we make use of generics. We'll write a class called genericsdemo, which will host two methods: storeValue and printStoredValue.
The storeValue method will take a value of ANY type, then store it in a variable. The value could be an integer, a string, a custom object, whatever your heart pleases. Whereas the printStoredValue method will print the stored value.
Here is how the code will look like:
public class genericsdemo<T> { T value; public void storeValue(T v){ value = v; } public void printStoredValue(){ System.out.println(value); } } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 public class genericsdemo < T > { T value ; public void storeValue ( T v ) { value = v ; } public void printStoredValue ( ) { System . out . println ( value ) ; } }
In the above code we use generics to allow the class to accept a value of any type. The key here is to use the <T> syntax in our class declaration. This allows us to then use T as the placeholder for our still unknown type.
Now let's look into how we would use the genericsdemo class:
genericsdemo<Double> gd_double = new genericsdemo(); gd_double.storeValue(44.5); gd_double.printStoredValue(); genericsdemo<String> gd_string = new genericsdemo(); gd_string.storeValue("Hello"); gd_string.printStoredValue(); 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 genericsdemo < Double > gd_double = new genericsdemo ( ) ; gd_double . storeValue ( 44.5 ) ; gd_double . printStoredValue ( ) ; genericsdemo < String > gd_string = new genericsdemo ( ) ; gd_string . storeValue ( "Hello" ) ; gd_string . printStoredValue ( ) ;
In the above code, we first create an instance of the genericsdemo class, where we specify the data type of <T> to be a double. Then, we store a value of 44.5. At the end, we print the stored value.
We then repeat the same logic, except this time we instantiate the genericsdemo class with a String type instead of a double.
If I run the code, I get an output that looks like this:
So obviously our code accepted both data types (float and string) perfectly fine without complaining, and here -my dear reader- is where the power of generics lies for statically typed languages.
You can see how much power and flexibility generics can offer you as a developer. It is extremely popular with SDKs and API libraries, as it allows you to write a single piece of code that can support multiple different types in one go.
Generics vs Go
Now let's move back to the Go language. Go does not support generics in any official capacity. This means that the lovely piece of Java code we covered above has no parallels in the Go language. But then what to do when we need to write a piece of code that is expected to support different data types at the same time? This is where the concept of the empty interface comes in. Unfortunately, it doesn't take us all the way there, however it offers a nice ‘middle of the road' solution to the problems that generics in other languages attempt to solve.
One very important remark to note though, is that we shouldn't rely on the empty interface on every single situation. Overusing the empty interface can result of unreadable or unpredictable code on the long run. However, using it with just the right dosage should be perfectly fine. So make sure you keep that in mind whenever you consider writing a new piece of code with the empty interface.
What is the empty interface?
So what exactly is the empty interface in the Go programming language? It is exactly what the name says: it's an empty interface:
interface{} 1 interface { }
But why is it special? The answer rests on the fact that in the Go programming language, implementing an interface is implicit and not explicit. In other words, there is no implements keyword like in Java to connect an interface with a type that implements it. Instead, Go will look for the types in your code that implement the same methods as the interface, then implicitly connect those types to the said interface.
For example, if I wrote an interface that looks like this:
type myinterface interface { method1() } 1 2 3 type myinterface interface { method1 ( ) }
Then, I wrote a struct type that looks like this:
type mystruct struct{} func (ms mystruct) method1() { } func (ms mystruct) anothermethod() { } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 type mystruct struct { } func ( ms mystruct ) method1 ( ) { } func ( ms mystruct ) anothermethod ( ) { }
The mystruct type becomes automatically a child of the myinterface interface, no special keywords needed. This means we can use myinterface in place of mystruct in our code, like this:
func main() { ms := mystruct{} testfunction(ms) } func testfunction(mi myinterface) { } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 func main ( ) { ms : = mystruct { } testfunction ( ms ) } func testfunction ( mi myinterface ) { }
In the above code testfunction takes an argument of type myinterface. However, since mystruct is a child of myinterface, the testfunction function will happily accept a value of type mystruct as an argument.
The caveat here though, is that in order to get back a value of type of mystruct from a value of type myinterface, we need to use a Go feature called ‘Type assertion'. Here is how this would look like:
func testfunction(mi myinterface) { ms := mi.(mystruct) //type assertion ms.method1() } 1 2 3 4 func testfunction ( mi myinterface ) { ms : = mi . ( mystruct ) //type assertion ms . method1 ( ) }
In the above code, we used type assertion to extract mystruct from it's parent interface myinterface.
Type assertion is a useful feature in Go that involves extracting a concrete type from it's parent interface. Because of this, you can only use Type assertions on interfaces.
This implicit relationship between myinterface and mystruct is what makes the empty interface special. Since the empty interface doesn't include any methods, then in practice, any Go type is implicitly a child of the empty interface. In other words, we can substitute any Go type with the empty interface. Consider the testfunction example again, it could have been written as follows with the same result as before:
func testfunction(mi interface{}) { ms := mi.(mystruct) ms.method1() } 1 2 3 4 func testfunction ( mi interface { } ) { ms : = mi . ( mystruct ) ms . method1 ( ) }
However, since the empty interface type could accept any type and not just mystruct, we can substitute it with any other Go type as we please:
func testfunctionint(i interface{}){ myint := i.(int) fmt.Println("myint is: ", myint) } func testfunctionstring(i interface{}){ mystring := i.(string) fmt.Println("mystring is:", mystring) } func main() { myint := 4 testfunctionint(myint) mystring := "hello" testfunctionstring(mystring) } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 func testfunctionint ( i interface { } ) { myint : = i . ( int ) fmt . Println ( "myint is: " , myint ) } func testfunctionstring ( i interface { } ) { mystring : = i . ( string ) fmt . Println ( "mystring is:" , mystring ) } func main ( ) { myint : = 4 testfunctionint ( myint ) mystring : = "hello" testfunctionstring ( mystring ) }
In the above code, we made use of the empty interface to act as an int type in one case, and a string type in another. This all looks nice, but I am sure you would agree with me that the code could use more elegance! Luckily Go comes to the rescue with another feature called ‘type switch', here is how this would look like:
func testfunction(i interface{}) { //type switch switch v := i.(type) { case string: fmt.Println("mystring is:", v) case int: fmt.Println("myint is: ", v) } } func main() { myint := 4 testfunction(myint) mystring := "hello" testfunction(mystring) } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 func testfunction ( i interface { } ) { //type switch switch v : = i . ( type ) { case string : fmt . Println ( "mystring is:" , v ) case int : fmt . Println ( "myint is: " , v ) } } func main ( ) { myint : = 4 testfunction ( myint ) mystring : = "hello" testfunction ( mystring ) }
As you can infer from the above code, the ‘type switch' feature is a simple switch statement that is capable of switching between datatypes. In our case, we had two options, either a string type or an int type. The code above will produce the same results as the other code snippet that made use of the testfunctionstring, and testfunctionint functions.
Perfect, with this, you should have a good idea of what the empty interface in golang is about, and why it usually gets mentioned in situations where generics are expected to help. Most of Go APIs make use of the empty interface to accept multiple types.
Consider the fmt package for example, a very popular function in the package is fmt.Println which is used to write a new line to the standard output. Most of us use this function whenever we want to print out a quick line to debug a program or see an output. If you dive deeper into this function, you'd find that the function signature looks like this:
func Println(a ...interface{}) (n int, err error) 1 func Println ( a . . . interface { } ) ( n int , err error )
The function takes a dynamic list of arguments, all of them are of the empty interface type. This is why when I type fmt.println(“hello”,4) , I get no complains about unmatched types.
Now comes the important question: why does everybody complain about the fact that Go does not have decent support for generics, if we can make use of the power of the empty interface, then go on to live happily ever after?
The answer is simple: In almost all cases, when we make use of the empty interface in Go, we have to convert the value back to the original type at runtime in order to obtain the original value (remember how we had to use type assertion or type switch?). This is similar in principle to the concept of ‘boxing' in other languages, where we can use a parent type (type ‘Object' for example in Java) to represent all child types, then figure out at runtime how to get the child from parent. This typically comes with some price in performance.
Generics, on the other hand, don't work that way. For generics, the type checking happens at compile time, and has no visible overheads at runtime.
There is an interesting stackoverflow thread discussing the performance of type assertions, type castings, and type switches in Go , they have been steadily improving over the years. However, the fact still stands that you have to design your code in a way to expect a type conversion somewhere after the usage of the empty interface: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28024884/does-a-type-assertion-type-switch-have-bad-performance-is-slow-in-go
Some people think that Go doesn't need full generics support, while others very strongly disagree. The purpose of this article is not to prove one point of view is right or wrong, but rather to shed some light into how you can utilize the empty interface in your code to build more flexible software.

Slasher movies are, by their very nature, retrospective. Regardless of the year in which they were made slashers use the same character archetypes, the same narrative beats, the same broad strokes that they always have and, for me, that's part of the charm. I know when I'm sitting down to watch one exactly what to expect; the enjoyment comes not from the body count but rather the creative ways in which we get to the expected final jump scare at the end. Post-modern slashers, like Wes Craven's mostly-excellent ‘Scream', gave us an extra layer of intertextuality; the narrative was comfortingly familiar and safe, the dialogue however showed a more obvious and knowing referencing of the genre. Cyclical as these things are, however, in recent years the slasher sub-genre has fallen out of favour with new offerings limited to the indie market; in actuality, this is probably how these films are best created, in the same abject financial conditions, by the same kind of passionate and creative people, who made the originals that we love.
‘Don't Go To The Reunion' tells the story of a group of friends who play a trick on a horror film-loving geek at high school that results in his expulsion from school just prior to graduation. After ten years pass, the friends are invited to attend a class reunion but, when they arrive, it becomes apparent that sinister forces are at work. When people start going missing at the hands of a faceless killer, the group must overcome their differences to survive the night.
The plot in ‘Reunion' is fairly standard fare. Anyone who is familiar with the sub-genre (if you're reading this review, it is likely that you are) will be able to plot out its direction and will very quickly have a suspect for the killer come the ending. So far, so predictable, and everything proceeds according to expectation; the body count rises, slasher logic is in full facepalm effect, and we arrive at the final act in due course. This is when the movie throws its curveball however and, as our villain narrates prior events, the movie takes on a different complexion and you realise just how clever some of the references are. ‘Reunion' is a film that is made by horror fans for horror fans; some references are quite obvious (character names, a female version of the Krueger jumper, etc.) but some are very subtle and it is only when they are pointed out during the film's conclusion that they become apparent. Whilst the plot is fairly predictable the constant referencing of slasher lore and history is where the fun is for aficionados.
This is director Steve Goltz's debut feature-length movie although he has made some short films in the genre prior to this, including the very entertaining ‘Teddy' in 2011. Whilst ‘Reunion' is still very short – I timed it at around 65minutes plus credits – it feels like a complete and well-rounded piece, a proper feature film despite its brevity. He clearly has a good eye too and much of the film is shot in a voyeuristic style reminiscent of ‘Myers-cam' from ‘Halloween', giving it an early Eighties indie feel. This is further supported by surprisingly good use of sound and, although there are a couple of sections when the blaring-synth jump scare is employed, the cheesiness of this is playfully referenced part way through; once again, this is entirely in keeping with the retro nature of the production.
The film, by slasher standards at least, has quite a small body count and it is here that the mega-low budget nature of the production is most obvious. Goltz sticks to practical make-up effects and clever edits to give the impression that you have seen more than is onscreen; ‘Reunion' is not particularly gory or graphic but I suspect that finances dictated toning down this aspect. The cast who fall victim to these deaths are a little uneven but generally solid although there are clear standouts. Our final girl, and the main focus of the story, is Erica played by Stephanie Leigh Rose who is likeable throughout and is easy to root for once things go south. The real highlight, however, is douchebag jock Joe played by Mike Goltz, who is very convincingly detestable and whose foul mouth gives us most of the film's humour; he has a real future in genre films and is definitely someone for whom to keep an eye out.
I really enjoyed ‘Don't Go To The Reunion'. If, like me, you are a true fan of the slasher niche there's much here to like. It is true that it lacks the blood and gore that some would enjoy but that isn't really the point of the movie. It is, in the purest sense, an old fashioned slasher; made on a tiny budget, with a hokey premise, but by people who love and respect the genre. The biggest compliment I can pay ‘Reunion' is that its low budget, its sensibility, its limitations even, give it a rough, homemade, traditional feel; if you didn't know it was made in 2013, you would easily believe it as a legitimate Eighties production. Slashers have given breaks to many talented actors and directors over the years; on the evidence here, Steve Goltz is one to watch.

Police dug through Walter Korte's trash four times. They searched his car, his office, and his home. They found thousands of pictures, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports, including "magazine clippings of celebrities" as well as "erotic and pornographic pictures that appeared to be printed off websites." The "vast majority" of the images "appeared legal and depicted adults and transgender individuals." Some of the photos showed "young men clothed and unclothed," some of whom "appeared to be in their late teens." One of those pictures was ultimately determined to qualify as child pornography under Virginia law, meaning that it was a "sexually explicit" image of "an identifiable minor," i.e., someone younger than 18. As a result, Korte, a former film studies professor at the University of Virginia with no criminal record, faces up to a year in jail and registration as a sex offender under a plea agreement a judge is considering.
According to the proposed plea deal, Korte "knowingly possess[ed] child pornography," a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. The "knowingly" part is a bit puzzling, since even the police did not know that the single purportedly illegal image, showing a boy in his "late teens," was child pornography until they consulted experts at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. It also is not clear why prosecutors, who noted that "police did not find evidence of any hands-on crimes against minors" and that a "psychosexual evaluation" indicated Korte "would not be a risk for hands-on offending," are insisting that he register as a sex offender, which is not required by statute for possession of child pornography unless it is a second offense. The whole point of registration is supposed to be protecting people from "hands-on crimes." When prosecutors admit a defendant poses no such risk but want him to register anyway, they reinforce the impression that registration is actually punishment in the guise of regulation.
The local CBS station reports that the sentencing judge, Cheryl Higgins, "expressed some concerns about the plea deal and said she would prefer to hold a pre-sentencing hearing before accepting Korte's plea." Higgins also asked that the single image on which the case against Korte is based "be filed with the court under seal so it could be used to determine Korte's sentence." I can't tell whether Higgins is worried that the plea deal is too hard on Korte or too easy on him. But I can't see what is gained by locking up a 73-year-old man who poses no threat to public safety or by branding him as a dangerous predator.
Campus police at the University of Virginia began the investigation that led to Korte's arrest in July 2016 based on a tip that someone had left child pornography in a trash bin near the school. According to the Times-Dispatch, the caller also mentioned that "several faculty members in nearby buildings recently had been cleaning out their offices." That tip about child pornography was almost certainly wrong, since just one of the thousands of pictures that police eventually seized was deemed illegal, and chances are it was not lying on top of the bin the first time they came by. The desperate searches that followed were aimed at validating the original, spurious report, all for the sake of sending a harmless old man to jail over a piece of paper. When I say "pedophilia panic," this is the sort of thing I have in mind.
The Canadian government is defending its controversial decision to ban the export of narwhal tusks from most of the Nunavut communities currently selling the spear-like objects that inspired the unicorn myth.
Officials with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans told Postmedia News on Friday that Canada's hands are essentially tied on the issue because of its commitment to the protocols of an international wildlife treaty controlling the global trade in animal parts — including the long, spiralling tooth that serves as a sensor and mating adornment for the iconic Arctic whale.
The tusks, which can grow longer than three metres, are coveted by collectors as rare keepsakes or used by ivory carvers to make canes, figurines and other objects. A few hundred from Arctic Canada are sold annually to buyers abroad, fetching prices of as much as $2,000 each and generating significant supplementary income for many Inuit hunters.
In 2006, a single mounted narwhal tusk sold at a U.S. auction for more than $16,000.
While acknowledging it was a "difficult decision" that will have a financial impact on Inuit communities, DFO spokesman Alain Belle-Isle said: "The result would be even worse if we skirted the rules," regulating foreign sales of the tusks.
"If we didn't follow our obligations," he noted, "we could face sanctions," including a total ban on all narwhal products from all Canadian suppliers.
The federal department informed Nunavut communities earlier this week that in order to comply with the terms of CITES — the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora — Canada would suspend foreign sales of narwhal tusks harvested in 2010 in 17 of the 22 Inuit communities that are now exporting the objects.
News of the decision prompted outrage from Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., which represents Inuit land-claim interests in the territory. Inuit hunters are already facing international pressure over seal and polar bear harvests.
"DFO does not have the right to impose such restrictions upon Inuit, particularly when the (narwhal) population is thriving, and harvest numbers do not threaten the species," NTI president Cathy Towtongie said in a statement issued this week. "NTI is considering legal options at this time."
While narwhals are widely seen as one of the Arctic's most vulnerable species in an era of climate change and melting ice, Canadian scientists using new counting methods recently revised the estimated population of the whales at the north of Baffin Island to 60,000 from 30,000.
DFO said Friday that it's working with Nunavut wildlife officials, as well as hunters' and trappers' organizations and other stakeholders, to review current harvest levels and scientific data with an eye to creating a new, sustainable management plan and reconsidering the export ban next year.
"From a conservation and an international-obligation perspective, the science advice indicated that some of the narwhal populations were at risk and that the harvest levels were not sustainable," said Sylvie Lapointe, DFO's director of international fisheries management and the official in charge of CITES compliance.
She said that while the decision has "no impact on the domestic management of narwhals or domestic trade," the partial ban means that potential foreign sales "won't be a driver to increase harvest levels" in areas of the Arctic identified as having more vulnerable narwhal populations.
But Okalik Eegeesiak, president of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, representing several affected communities at the north end of Baffin Island, said Friday she thinks "the government has to backtrack" on the decision.
Earlier this year, QIA won a court fight with the Canadian government to halt a proposed seismic survey in Lancaster Sound that Inuit group and environmentalists said was planned without proper public consultation or adequate concern about the environmental impact.
And earlier this month, Eegeesiak was in Ottawa to celebrate an announcement by Environment Minister John Baird that a planned Lancaster Sound marine park would proceed and that no further seismic surveys would be conducted.
"We're surprised," Eegeesiak said Friday about the decision on narwhal tusks, "that the government has made yet another decision without consulting Inuit about something that could have a huge impact on our communities."
Virginia's Presidential Primary is coming up on February 12th and, for some time now, I've been trying to figure out who I was going to vote for, or even if I was going to vote at all.
On the Republican side, before the election ended yesterday, my choices were bleak indeed. I've already reiterated before the reasons I can't support John McCain, Mitt Romney, and Mike Huckabee and there's no need to repeat them here. Up until December or January, I probably would have cast my vote for Ron Paul even though I didn't agree with him on two important issues — immigration and foreign policy — but, with the newsletter story being the straw that broke the camel's back, I quickly became disillusioned with both the campaign and the candidate and now I don't think that his campaign will have any lasting impact on the Republican Party. If there were still a race, I probably still would have voted for Paul just to cast a protest vote, but that seems utterly pointless now.
But, you see, I live in Virginia and we have completely open primaries. When Virginians go to the polls on Tuesday, they simply need to ask for the Democratic or Republican ballot, and they can vote for whom they please. While I personally think that party primaries should be closed affairs, the open primary presents me with a very interesting opportunity this year.
The Republican race is over, but the Democratic primary isn't and it's possibly the most important race that this nation has seen.
Issues aside, I have come to the conclusion that the worst thing that has happened to this country has been the fact that we've been living in a Bush-Clinton-Bush dynasty for the past 20 years. The first Bush Administration wasn't all that bad, and George H.W. Bush was, faults aside, a relatively decent person. But you wouldn't have known that from the rhetoric thrown at him from both the left and the right. Then, when Bill & Hillary Clinton came to power in 1993 — and, make no mistake, these two have always been a team — the political atmosphere in this country changed, and it changed for the worse.
It wasn't all the Clintons either, almost from the day the Clinton Administration came into office there was this element of the right whose opposition to the President was nothing short of venomous. There were allegations that Bill Clinton was involved in drug-running (remember Mena anyone ?), that Vince Foster had been murdered, that Bill had an illegitimate black child, even that the Clinton Administration administered the Oklahoma City bombing. It was the era of the militas, and black helicopter conspiracy theories, and the Y2K nonsense.
And it was the era when the Contract for America died on the altar of the Lewinsky scandal and ill-considered impeachment hearings.
Then, George W. Bush came into office. I just knew things weren't going to calm down when he won in a closely-fought disputed election that was, ultimately, decided by the Supreme Court (correctly I would submit), and they didn't. The Loony Left picked up right where the Loony Right had left off.
And then 9/11 happened. For awhile, it seemed like something had happened that would, much like World War II, unite the country. For a time, it did, but only for a time. The conspiracy theories started almost as soon as the smoke stopped floating into the sky and the 9/11 Truthers are still with us. The political venom in the air since 2001 is, if anything, worse than what we saw during the Clinton Administration and, once again, both sides are to blame. Michael Moore is an idiot, and so is Ann Coulter.
We're yelling at each other and accomplishing nothing.
What's needed, I am convinced, is a break with the past and a new direction. In some sense, although I hate to admit it, John McCain represents that for the GOP but Barack Obama represents it even more and, more importantly, is running against the one person who, if she wins, would guarantee a return to same crap we've been dealing with since 1993 on both sides of the political aisle.
A few weeks ago Mark at Publius endures explained why he could support Barack Obama, and I agree with him:
I could not disagree more with Obama on many of his policies. Yet I find myself drawn to supporting him – passionately, even – because his goals are liberal in the classical sense. I repeat – I do not think his means are libertarian in any way, and are arguably not even classically liberal means. But the goals, so far as I can see, ARE classically liberal. His are not goals centered entirely around maximizing his own political power, and thus he is a candidate worthy of my deep respect. These ultimate ends are the same ends as exist for us perjoratively-named cosmo-libertarians (as well as for other derivations of classical liberalism).
For all these reasons, on February 12th, I will be voting for a Democratic Presidential candidate for the first time in my life, and I will be voting for Barack Obama.
Does this mean I would vote for Obama in November if he's the nominee ? No, and, frankly I probably wouldn't. I also won't vote for John McCain. But the Democrats deserve to have their best candidate as their nominee, and they deserve to have the Clinton machine destroyed, and if I can help in that process I am happy to.
Domestic handset maker will launch India's most affordable for Rs 251 today evening, a move that is set to disrupt the growing handset market in the country.
Defence Minister Manohar Parrikkar will launch the 'Freedom 251' in an event presided over by Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi.
Important specifications of to include a 4-inch display, 1.3GHz quad-core processor, 1GB RAM, 8GB internal storage (expandable up to 32GB), 3.2-megapixel back camera, 0.3-megapixel front camera, and a 1450mAh battery.
Bookings for the open on February 18 at 6am and close on 21 February at 8pm. The company says deliveries will be completed by 30th June 2016.
The launch is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for "empowering India to the last person, transforming India's growth story", the Noida-based company said.
Established last year, will start with the assembly of handsets in Phase-I and aims at full indigenous development of the feature-rich smartphones, it said.
It did not disclose any other details about manufacturing, products and pricing.
A new entrant in the Indian mobile phone market, had launched one of India's cheapest 4G at Rs 2,999, recently. It has launched two other feature phones in the market.
India, one of the fastest growing smartphone markets globally, is poised to overtake the US as the second-largest market in next few years.
In the last few months, global smartphone makers, including the likes of Xiaomi, Motorola and Gionee have commenced assembling their handsets in India, where the government is pushing local manufacturing through its initiative.
Band's headlining performance closing the festival
Biffy Clyro‘s Simon Neil says that the band's headlining performance at Reading festival has produced “moments [they'll] never forget”.
Speaking in the middle of their set, frontman Neil told the crowd that they thought it “couldn't get any better” than their headlining performance at the festival in 2013. He also told the audience to “Mon the Reading” – a play on the famous ‘Mon the Biffy' fan phrase.
The Kilmarnock trio headlined Leeds last night (August 26) and are currently headlining Reading today (August 28) in what is their 10th appearance at the festivals – and the second time they have headlined.

Meanwhile, the band have said they feel as though they have “paid our dues” at Reading and Leeds festivals over the years.
“To be asked [to headline] before was such a huge moment in the band's life,” guitarist James Johnston told the BBC. “I think we have probably paid our dues, we've played all the small stage and worked our way up.”
Asked why they have such a close relationship with the festivals, Johnston replied: “It feels like there is a lot of good will from the punters that come here. We feel it is an opportunity to try and improve on what we did before, maybe we will pick up some new fans. It is one that has long been really close to our hearts,” he added.
Montgomery County police have released surveillance video from a Silver Spring 7-Eleven allegedly showing about 50 teens and young adults taking pretty much whatever they wanted without paying: snacks, drinks, you name it.
Lovely world we live in.
The group swooped in on the store, on Tech Road, around 11:30 p.m. on Saturday. In the videos, “customers” can be seen walking in and out of the store with snacks, bypassing the cash register to settle up on the charges.
A similar flash mob crime unfolded at a Germantown 7-Eleven in August, but police don't think there is any connection — except, of course, brazen thefts caught on tape.
Police are asking anyone who recognizes individuals in the video to call them at 301-565-5835.
You can watch below. Some of the people in the video may not be connected with the alleged crime.
Skepta appears to be working on another surprise collaboration, after sharing a photo of himself in the studio with Mick Jagger.
The grime hero posted the photo of himself with The Rolling Stones‘ frontman to Instagram, with no information as to whether it would be for Sketpa's own new material, a new Stones record, or a completely separate project entirely.

Speaking to NME about his plans for new material, Skepta said: “I haven't been working on my next album at the moment, but what I have been doing is working on how I'm gonna do good for what's happening on Earth at the moment. At every stage of my life, I've always wanted to do good for Earth. When I was a kid I used to stop bullies. I'd get so angry when I saw people being bullied I'd be like ‘stop doing that to him!'”
He continued: “Then you get to 16, you get to music. Energetic little guy on stage, you want change – ‘stop the fuckery, stop the fuckery'. At my time, it's J Hus' time, I feel like it's all the young artists' time to be on the stage enjoying themselves. I'm not saying I want to stop music, but I want to find how at this age, how I can ‘stop the fuckery' again. And I will be ‘stopping the fuckery' until I die. I feel like that's what Boy Better Know want to do.”
Skepta and Boy Better Know will take over the O2 Arena and complex on August 27 for what has been described as a “day of music, film, gaming, sport, food and London lifestyle”. Tickets are available here.
Embedding reform can be a trying process. Witness the Dáil. Three weeks into the earlier starts – 9.30am instead of 10.30am – and it hasn't been easy.
Week one and Minister for Transport Leo Varadkar apologised for being 10 minutes late after getting stuck in traffic. On Wednesday, Independent TD Shane Ross missed his slot for questions, sending his apologies that he too was stuck in traffic. Yesterday, 9.30am became 9.38am with no explanation as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the chair. Nobody passed comment and questions continued until time was called at 10.45 am.
Fianna Fáil's Seán Fleming objected. They had started eight minutes late and there was time for two more questions, he grumbled.
“Actually there are four minutes left,” replied the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and time for one question.
An hour later, the Fianna Fáil man was on his feet again and there was loud jeering and laughter when he asked about the sale of State assets.
There would be no money this calendar year from the sale of those assets, he said. The troika was leaving the building, so to speak, and wouldn't be asking that they be sold. The EU wouldn't be asking either and the Opposition certainly didn't want them sold.
“Your party sold the whole country,” shouted Minister of State Dinny McGinley, quick on the ball about what was coming.
Undeterred, the Fianna Fáil man continued provocatively. Why is the Labour Party, headed by the Tánaiste and ably assisted by Minister for Energy Pat Rabbitte, determined to sell off Bord Gáis assets next year as well as power generation plants by the ESB, “when no one other than Fine Gael is asking you
to do so?”
A cacophony of sound and laughter erupted. The Tánaiste had the heartiest laugh. “Well, of all the hard-necked hypocrisy I've heard in this House in the past three years, this beats it all,” he said.
Here was the party that did the deal with the troika to sell €5 billion worth of assets, he said. “To get €5 billion by the end of 2010, you'd have had to sell every State company, port, airport and virtually everything the State owned.”
It was almost three years to the day since Fianna Fáil brought the troika in and put the country in receivership, he added, to near hysterical laughter and cheers. “For you to come in today with this cant, hypocrisy and nonsense, it really does beat Banagher.” Government bench cheers raised the roof.
Fleming came back.
“It's clear I've rattled the Tánaiste,” he said calmly. Why was Labour determined to take on Fine Gael clothes and sell national infrastructure, Fleming persisted amid the jeering.
“The only rattle we're getting here,” retorted the Tánaiste “is the rattle of the decrepit memorandum of understanding and the empty vessel that is now Fianna Fáil.”
When the chuckles faded to silence, Independent TD Finian McGrath piped up: “You didn't answer the question.”
That does beat Banagher.
Hair
Hair is a very important expression of who we are. It is often the first thing you notice when you meet someone, especially if they have nice hair. Well-groomed, luxuriant, lustrous, hair is, quite simply, beautiful and sexy. It can signify youth, health, strength and vitality.
Many people don't feel right unless their hair looks perfect. If their hair looks good they feel great. Otherwise they say they are having a 'bad hair day'. This applies to men and well as women.
Hair reacts to our state of well being. This includes our physical, spiritual, and emotional bodies.
Emotionally, if we are in balance, our hair grows and looks beautiful as a personification of of our inner self. Under stress many people have hair loss or their hair looses its texture and sheen.
One such disease is Alopecia which is a highly unpredictable, autoimmune skin disease resulting in the loss of hair on the scalp and elsewhere on the body.
Hair Loss Disease: Alopecia Areata Genetic Origin Discovered The Epoch Times - July 1, 2010
Other factors that affect hair include: physical illnesses, diet, skin conditions, hormones, shampoos and conditioners, hair dyes,perms, the water you use to wash you hair, as well as other factors that impact on our daily lives.
The manner in which people care for their hair varies greatly. Some people just wash their hair and let it dry naturally, others spend hours blow drying and styling it. We all seem to find a style that is 'us' and keep it until something in our liveschanges - and we change our hairstyle along with it.
The hair we are born with changes several times during our time on planet Earth.
Some of these changes occur naturally, while others get a little help from hair stylists and the barber. The term 'Barber' comes from the Latin word barba meaning beard. It may surprise you to know that the earliest records of barbers show that they were the foremost men of their tribe. They were the medicine men and the priests. But primitive man was very superstitious and the early tribes believed that both good and bad spirits, which entered the body through the hairs on the head, inhabited every individual.
Negative spirits could only be driven out of the individual by cutting the hair, thus various fashions of hair cutting were practiced by different tribes and making the barber the most important man in the community. In fact, the barbers in these tribal days arranged all marriages and baptized all children. They were the chief figures in the religious ceremonies. During these ceremonies, the hair was allowed to hang loosely over the shoulders so that the evil spirits could come out. After the dancing, the long hair was cut in the prevailing fashion by the barbers and combed back tightly so that the evil spirits could not enter the person, nor the good spirits get out.
Most babies lose their newborn hair, the new hair growing in with a different color and texture. Some babies remain bald until after a year old or more.
Children's hairstyles vary depending on the natural texture of the hair, the parental choices, and the society in which they live. Mothers who keep their daughters in short hair usually tell me it's because the child will not allow them to groom the daughter's hair or the child's hair is very thin and fine and looks best when short. Mothers seem to favorite feminine hair-dos for their daughters, as long hair can be styled according to weather and other circumstances.
Teenage years go to coloring hair, experiment with the latest fades, long hair for girls, perms, extensions, hair moose, and other products that help create a desired effect. Next to body weight and eye color, hair says the most about someone's appearance. People notice your hair.
Men with receding hairlines seem to like the bald look, shaving their heads. Why Do Men Go Bald? Live Science - February 2, 2007
Many women keep the same style most of their lives, wile others change style and color with mood and events in their lives. Keep your hairstyle and color youthful.
In many cultures long hair is the norm for women - and sometimes men - in all age groups.
How much time and energy you put into your hair varies with how important it is to you.
If you are lucky you have 'wash and wear' hair that always looks great after it is washed and dries naturally.
If you are like most people you have to create the illusion of how you see yourself by finding your hair color and styling your hair evey day.
Accessories placed in your hair - such as jewels, fancy pins and other ornaments - enhance your look.
Psychological Disorders
Many people who are mentally ill often tend to:
- cut off random chunks of hair
- dye their hair black - a true sign of depression
- loss their hair in different parts of the head
- do not properly maintain their hair
- dye their hair based on a multiple personal disorder
- twirl their hair
- pull their hair out - Trichotillomania an impulse control disorder
Physiology of Hair
On the average there are over one hundred thousand strands of hair on a young adult. Blondes average about 140,000 strands, brunettes average 108,000 and redheads average 90,000. Hair grows at a rate of about 150mm a year and each individual hair lasts for two to six years before it falls out, the follicle has a rest for a while, while another takes its place. Hair grows quickest in young adult women aged between sixteen and twenty-four (who are often then at the height of their possible reproductive capacity)
The quality and appearance of hair is influenced by overall health and diet as would be expected. Anorexics who starve themselves often have very fine, brittle hair deficient in various minerals. Hair conveys information about a person and their state of health-analysis of the hair can also tell what drugs they have taken. Long hair obviously suggests at least a recent history of good health.

Dream Symbology
Hair references power. The Leo personality generally has a thick mane of hair of long - often wavy - hair.
To dream of hair in your dreams could suggest some strong thoughts are floating around up there but a strong mental power can hold them in check.
To dream of gray or silver hair could suggest wise thoughts.
For a woman to dream that she has beautiful hair when in reality she does not, denotes carelessness in her personality.
For a man to dream of losing his hair, suggests too much generosity will put him in the poor house.
To dream that you cut your hair close to your head may signify regrets of a willful extravagance.
Hair and Magic Occult practices sometimes include
pieces of hair while performing spells.
Looking Younger
Hair makes a statement at any age.
I believe that longer hair, kept in a natural color, or highlighted softly, is more youthful that short gray hair.
For some reason when the hormones change during menopause many women become depressed cut their hair short and let it go gray. Of course, hormonal hair loss at that time happens for most women, but there are ways to keep thins looking natural.
Gray hair styled in a youthful fashion is often youthful looking.
Is it important to look and feel young?
For most people this is the case especially in western societies where much is judged on appearance. A clean, well kept person, signals a functional person.
When you look young, you feel young and you send out the message: "I am young in mind, and in control."
When you look better, you act and feel better.
When you look older, sickly and poorly kept, especially as you age, you often make the statement, "I am depressed and not in control. I am bored and getting laid back and perhaps lazy about my appearance after years of dealing with issues.
Historical Figures and Myths
Metaphysics
Long hair is primal as it stirs and arouses something within us, from sexuality to the goddess, priestess archetype.
Subconsciously, long hair references a return to the creational source - water - the flow of the collective unconscious. In many places woman style their hair in 'snail shell' curls turning to the right. This is linked with golden ratio - spiraling movement of consciousness from the head - energy moving upward through the crown chakra.
We are in the Age of Aquarius - The title song of the hit show 'Hair'.
Aquarius represents the mother creator - the priestess and goddess the creational mythology - the return of feminine energies - higher frequency energy.
Aquarius is always portrayed with long flowing tresses - often flowing into creation.
The Mother - Prime Creator - is (Is-is or Isis or Ishtar) portrayed as tall, slim, with flowing long hair.
She is the lunar goddess of the temple.
She is sexy and alluring - her hair naturally thick and often wavy.
She is the Mother Nurturer - The Protector
Mythological gods and goddesses of creation are portrayed with long hair as a return to our natural state of being.
The femme fatale look is generally about long sensual hair, that stirs the emotions, and ignites the flame. A woman letting loose her long tresses - that have been tied or pinned back, suddenly is seductive and alluring. Her energies are strong as she shakes looses her lion mane of hair.
Many men, throughout history had long hair or wore curly large haired wigs. The list would include gods, ascended masters, religious figures, people in the arts, etc.
Female heroines with long hair are always in vogue, adding romanticism to them.
No longer are they quiet and demure waiting to be rescued.
This is the age of Aquarius the return of the feminine powers.
Country singers always have mountains of hair sometimes wearing wigs.
Hair is all part of the illusion - the game.
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The best teams find ways to win. The Vancouver Canucks did just that to reach another milestone during their record-setting season.
Christopher Higgins had two goals and an assist and the Canucks, despite being outshot and outchanced, beat the Columbus Blue Jackets 4-1 on Sunday to reach 50 victories for the first time in their 40-year history.
Canucks backup Cory Schneider made 39 saves to improve to 15-3-2 and help the NHL-leading Canucks add to their franchise-best points total (109) and run their road winning streak to eight, matching the club record set in early 2004.
"Teams are obviously getting themselves prepared for us," coach Alain Vigneault said. "I thought Columbus, tonight, played real strong. At the end of the night, our goaltender was better than their goaltender and we won the game."
Christian Ehrhoff and Henrik Sedin also scored for Vancouver. Mason Raymond added three assists and Ryan Kesler had two. The Canucks have won 10 of 11 overall and seven in a row against Columbus.
"There's going to be games like this during the season when you're not feeling your best," Sedin said. "I think tonight we had 20 guys that weren't at their best."
R.J. Umberger scored for Columbus with just under 10 minutes remaining to spoil Schneider's shutout bid.
"We just couldn't score, couldn't bury it," Umberger said. "We peppered them with shots from everywhere. We had a lot of rebounds. It's frustrating when you get those chances and don't score."
Ehrhoff opened the scoring at 7:52 of the first period. After a turnover by Antoine Vermette, Raymond fed an open Ehrhoff at the right circle and he snapped a shot past Mathieu Garon, who finished with 20 saves.
Columbus was pressing for the equalizer in the second period and carried the play, outshooting the Canucks 25-12 after two periods. They couldn't beat Schneider, who was quick to snuff out second chances.
Vancouver scored twice early in the third to pull away.
"[We were] just trying to hunker down a little bit," said Higgins, who scored his first goals as a Canuck since being acquired at the trade deadline. "They were taking the game to us and we just wanted to flip the script a little bit and play a much tighter third period."
With the NHL's best power play at work, Kesler fed Henrik Sedin alone in front for a backhand flick past Garon for his 19th at 3:36.
After Columbus failed to generate a dangerous scoring chance on a 1:05 two-man advantage, Higgins made it 3-0 with the Blue Jackets once again nowhere near the goal scorer. On the rush, Kesler slotted a long pass from the right wing to Higgins at the lower-left circle and he snapped the puck home at 9:03.
Two minutes later, Umberger charged down the left wing and snapped a hard shot on goal.
"I was leaning a little bit," Schneider said. "I wasn't sure if he was going to throw it out front. It hit me, hit the post, hit my head and crossed the line by an inch. I got some breaks during the game. Pucks just missed some sticks and the net. It comes back to get you."
Again alone near the crease, Higgins closed out the scoring with his 13th of the season for another Vancouver power-play goal.
Edmonton Oilers center Connor McDavid scored a goal in each period of Saturday's game 5-2 win over the Dallas Stars for his first NHL hat trick.
None of McDavid's goals could really be called highlights. The 19-year-old captain did everything within his capacity to create opportunities, but he also needed a little bit of luck. His first goal required an opponent's assistance; McDavid's shot deflected into the net off the stick of Stars defenseman John Klingberg, who couldn't collect the puck in time.
McDavid's second and third goals were solid taps on fortunate rebounds. In the second period, he caught a blocked shot to keep the Oilers in their offensive zone, then skated to the goal to find a perfect angle between the net and Stars goalie Kari Lehtonen. His final goal of the game started as a possible trademark McDavid breakaway that would end with an embarrassed goaltender, but the Oiler left the puck behind. Teammate Jesse Puljujarvi took a slapshot, but it was blocked and bounced McDavid's way. Once again, he found open net and scored.
McDavid hadn't scored a goal in 10 games before his hat trick. He now has eight goals on the season.
Here is this weeks summary of sentiment data for the stock market:
The weekly AAII measure of sentiment continues to reflect a repentant US retail investor. This week the bulls were unchanged at 34% while the bears increased 9% points to 49%. This is a very abrupt change as it was just 4 weeks ago (Sentiment Overview: Week Of July 31st, 2009) that we had the mirror opposite with 48% bulls and 31% bears. And it was only 2 weeks ago when we saw 51% bulls! This is especially meaningful as the market is actually trading higher
Meanwhile, the Investors Intelligence Advisors Index - a metric of the mood of stock market newsletter editors - is finally showing extreme levels of bullishness. This week's results pushed the bulls slightly upwards to 51.5% while at the same time reducing the bears to just 19.8%. That widened the gap between the two camps to almost 32% points or put another way, we now have almost 3 optimistic editors for every gloomy one.
So it took the II a few weeks to arrive at the +50% levels of bullishness that we saw from the AAII earlier this month. But while the AAII's recent lopsided sentiment corresponded to the swing top in May 2008, the discrepancy in the II is even more ominous.
The last time we had less than 20% of the stock market advisors bearish was in October 2007 - the start of the bear market. While the percentage points between the two camps isn't as wide as in October 2007 (40% points), it is 31.7% points - close enough to merit caution for the bulls.
Right now, looking at these two popular sentiment metrics can be confusing. Either one is ahead of the other or they are both wrong. Fortunately there are many other indicators we will take a look at after the jump.
Conference Board: Consumer Confidence
The preliminary data for August was stronger than expected, as it rose to 54.1 - the first increase since May 2009:
More interesting was the sub-index measuring investor sentiment. Bullishness for equities rose 8% points to 36.5% while bearishness decreased (by 7.6% points) to 26.4%. That may not seem like any extreme level, especially when compared to the AAII and II metrics cited above, however a 10.1% point gap is the largest bullish one since - you guessed it - October 2007.
The Daily Sentiment Index (DSI)
Jake Bernstein's DSI continues to climb along with the S&P 500. It started this month at 87% and it has been nudged slightly higher by its end to 89%. This is, needless to say, rather extreme and from a contrarian perspective, bearish. It leaves its normal ‘high' range of 60%-70% in the dust and is even the highest since 2007. Which should raise a few eyebrows as we know thanks to hindsight, that was a (cyclical) bull market. And here we are now, merely 50% higher after a counter-trend rally and even more giddy than at the bull market top. In contrast, at the low in late February 2009 the DSI was 2%.
Option Traders
There is no significant change in the sentiment picture from either the ISEE Sentiment index or the CBOE's put call ratio index. The ISEE (equity only) finished the week with almost twice the number of call buyers as put buyers. But it continues to be mired in neutral territory once we step back for some perspective. The same can be said for the traditional put call ratio as it recovered slightly from last Friday's one day (0.4) extreme reading. The short term average of the put call ratio (equity only) has fallen below the up trending channel as shown in last week's sentiment overview.
Gallup Index of Investor Optimism
Dovetailing with the Consumer Confidence statistics mentioned above, the most recent monthly Gallup poll of investor optimism rose to its highest level for the year:
This broad measure of investor perceptions continued to rise out of the historic low it reached earlier in the year when it fell to -64. That was the lowest it has ever fallen since its inception in October 1996. This month the index reached +9, the first time that it has regained positive territory since June 2008.
Checking in with the Greybeards
I like to keep a loose finger on the pulse of the market participants who I refer to as the ‘Greybeards' - those who have been around more than a few market cycles and have profited to tell tales about it. Among these, Doug Kass has the distinction of calling the spring low and catching the rebound. So now that he is calling the top, we need to pay attention. Even more intriguing, a thestreet.com pollshows that 70% agree with him that the market has topped (while 30% don't):
By the way, I mentioned Kass' call days ago at news.tradersnarrative.com so if you want to stay current on interesting articles, news and analysis make sure you bookmark it and check back often.
David Rosenberg continues to label this a robust bear market rally and refuses to consider it as anything else. Needless to say, he expects lower prices ahead.
Corporate Insiders
According to TrimTabs, corporate insider selling has spiked to $6.1 billion - the highest amount since May 2008 when the S&P 500 peaked at 1420. More important than the dollar amount involved, the ratio of selling to buying reached 30.6 - the highest since 2004. To provide further perspective, the ratio at the spring low was 2:1 and its long term average is 7:1. As well TrimTabs reports that their own proprietary liquidity metric, TrimTabs Demand Index, which measures 18 fund flow and sentiment indicators has turned down for the first time since March 2009. A caveat, corporate insiders are not the all seeing, all knowing entities that they sound like. They have been wrong or early many times before. However, they still merit attention, especially when their actions reach a crescendo.
Acting decisively in a crisis is seen as one of Mr. Sarkozy's virtues, and the events of the last 10 days in Toulouse have allowed him to remind the French of what they like about him, rather than what they dislike.

Mr. Sarkozy is likely to gain a few points in the opinion polls, Mr. Perrineau said, and may reach his goal of beating Mr. Hollande in the first round of the election on April 22, when 10 candidates are competing. Among those are Ms. Le Pen, the centrist François Bayrou and the far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who is also squeezing Mr. Hollande.
“But the second round is much harder for Sarkozy,” Mr. Perrineau said. He believes that Mr. Hollande, who has a still-comfortable lead against Mr. Sarkozy in a head-to-head race, will win the presidency in the runoff on May 6.
Christian Salmon, writing in the magazine Marianne, asked, “Can one appeal to national unity, to respect, to healing when one has inflamed passions and divided the French?” He then described the way this national drama had been used “to capture the emotions of voters for electoral ends.”
The Toulouse killings allowed Mr. Sarkozy “the means to place himself in the heart of the campaign and reduce his adversaries to silence,” Mr. Salmon wrote. While the campaign was formally suspended, “we could only hear him — he was the only one able to campaign,” albeit through his office.
While Mr. Sarkozy remained aloof, his lieutenants attacked Mr. Hollande and Mr. Bayrou as having politicized Toulouse. Mr. Hollande had urged politicians to watch their “vocabulary,” while Mr. Bayrou had criticized the harsh anti-immigrant statements of Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Le Pen as a contributing factor “to a growing climate of intolerance” that led to the singling out of minorities.
After Mr. Merah turned out to be the killer, however — the very kind of radicalized child of immigrants that the right and far right have warned about — the foreign minister, Alain Juppé, called such insinuations of politicization “ignoble,” adding, “Let's not add the disgusting to the horrific.”
Video
Mr. Sarkozy's tough-talking party leader, Jean-François Copé, criticized “the permanent ambiguity” of the Socialist Party, citing its abstention on the vote to ban the full-face veil in 2010 and what he called Mr. Hollande's failure to make security a priority.

Mr. Hollande took the high road, but his spokeswoman, Delphine Batho, said that Mr. Copé should be ashamed. “Shame on those who polemicize at the very moment that police intervened and were wounded,” she said, while a former Socialist prime minister, Laurent Fabius, promised, “We will be hard on crime, and I weigh my words.” Pierre Moscovici, head of the Hollande campaign, said he was “shocked by the indecency of the behavior” of Mr. Copé “in a tragic moment for the whole nation.”
These have not been comfortable days for Mr. Hollande, who has called for unity, for popular support for the police and for sympathy with the victims, both Muslim and Jewish. On Thursday, Mr. Hollande issued a news release, hailing “an end to insufferable anguish” in Toulouse.

He said that “this ordeal reminds us that the fight against terrorism is a combat of every moment and allows for neither laxity nor weakness.” The French republic is stronger than its enemies, he said, and can defend itself “without losing anything of its values against its worst adversaries.”
While sincere, his words paled against the image of the president, standing before the French and European flags in the gilded Élysée Palace, on national television, calling for national unity and announcing seemingly harsh new measures to crack down on extremism.
Mr. Sarkozy said he would prosecute people who regularly consulted jihadist Web sites or who traveled abroad for indoctrination. “Any person who habitually consults Internet sites that praise terrorism and call for hatred and violence will be punished under criminal law,” he said, as well as anyone who travels abroad for “indoctrination into ideologies that lead to terrorism.” He also announced that he was instructing the authorities to investigate the promotion of extremism in French prisons — hardly a new problem, since nearly every French proponent of fundamentalist or jihadi thinking has been radicalized in French prisons, which have, experts estimate, a sizable majority of Muslim inmates.
But Mr. Sarkozy's speech was a reminder, as he prepared to return in earnest to the campaign Thursday evening, of the extraordinary powers of the French president, who is a kind of republican monarch. And who — to Mr. Sarkozy's cost at the beginning of his presidency, when he earned a reputation for loving “bling-bling” and wealthy friends — is expected to act like one. After a couple of days off line, his campaign Web site returned on Thursday afternoon, and he went to Strasbourg for an election rally in the evening. The “president-candidate” is back, but the campaign has shifted.
Each week after every eviction, host Julie Chen will answer a few of EW's burning questions about the latest episode of Big Brother.
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: I was positively riveted watching Christine's husband and family talk about how uncomfortable they were watching her cuddle and flirt with Cody. What do you make of the whole Christine-Cody situation, and does her husband have a right to be upset?
JULIE CHEN: Christine's husband has every right to be upset. In fact, he wasn't upset enough. All I know is if I ever did what Christine did then I would be coming home to no husband at all!!! Then again Christine is a free spirit and he knew who he married in the first place.
EW: America soundly rejected Team America's self-appointed mission to put on a play. Let's be honest — how lame was that, Julie?
CHEN: That was no play! And Derrick even called it “that Broadway thing?!?!” Wha?!?!? There were no story lines, no dialogue, no interaction between any of them. That was a string of imitations of one another. Funny ones. But NOT a play! Fail!!!
EW: You showed some videos from loved ones back home to the contestants. Why decide to give them that little morsel of communication?
CHEN: Seeing human emotion from each houseguest is always good TV. It's also a nice little reminder for each one as to why they are there. They are doing it to better the lives of those they love.
EW: It's pretty much impossible not to love Donny. Where does he rank among some of the most popular Big Brother players ever?
CHEN: He has by far the highest likeability rating we've ever had on this show! And it doesn't surprise me one bit. I dare you to find one person out there who doesn't like him. He is awesome. The real deal.
People are fed up. They're tired of seeing police shoot and kill black men, only to be told to calm down when they get angry at what they see as another unjust killing of another black man by another police officer.
At Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where police officers killed Alton Sterling, one black woman captured the anger so many people feel when she was told to calm down in the face of a heavily armed police force:
Baton Rouge is not having it...wow pic.twitter.com/U1KcC6tIn8 — logizzle (@iRUNx_LA) July 10, 2016
"I'm hurting. My people out here are hurting," she said. "My kids … they're going to walk these streets freely, just like everyone else can walk these streets freely. I'm not standing down."
For many people, it is bad enough that they have to suffer through the risks of simply walking down the street and catching the attention of an overly aggressive officer. But the idea that future generations — their younger family members, their children, or their grandchildren — will have to go through the same thing only amplifies the injustice.
As she stated, "We have been mistreated for more than 300 years. There is blood on these streets, sir. Why are we going to continue being peaceful when they are killing my brothers and sisters?"
Watch: Why recording the police is so important
Murray 'stunned' government might shutter over Planned Parenthood
Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said Thursday that Republican pressure to include a rider to a budget deal defunding Planned Parenthood is “stunning” to her as a woman and that Senate leadership will not back down in their support of women's health issues.
“I am really stunned. And I am angry as a woman that we have come to this after weeks of negotiating on numbers… that there are those in the Republican party in the House who are willing to shutdown the government, take people's paychecks away from them because they want to deny women access to health care in this country,” Murray told reporters. “Every woman and every man in this country ought to be saying, ‘What are you doing?'”
Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said repeatedly Thursday that the spending talks between Senate Democrats, the White House and Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) essentially have broken down in the 11th hour not over figures but over “ideology.”
Reid devoted much of his floor remarks, and then later statement in a press conference, to discussing the women's health-based negotiations sticking point.
Murray's plea Thursday, though, had a more personal and passionate tone, saying that the budget talk developments late Wednesday evening and early Thursday morning regarding abortion rights were “stunning to me as a woman.”
Senate Republicans Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine already have indicated publicly that they would not support the House GOP plan to cut off government funds from Planned Parenthood. Thursday, advocates for the organization rallied at the Capitol.
“We in the Senate are going to stand up,” Murray said. “We are not going to allow them to push us into taking away women's right to health care access in order to keep the government funded.”
Reid and Boehner are slated to meet with President Barack Obama at the White House Thursday afternoon.

Premier Series to return with format changes in 2018
Announced in February this year, the Overwatch Premier Series has hosted high level competition in China with ¥4,000,000 CNY (~$600,000 USD) in prize money spread across four separate events. Despite the relative success of the tournament, doubts were raised about the future of the Premier Series due to NetEase picking up the Shanghai Overwatch League spot. As Banana Culture are the current producers of the Premier Series, speculation was raised that the Chinese scene would undergo drastic change next year.
Blizzard China's Senior Director of Esports, Lawrence Chi, has put these rumours to rest, confirming the return of the Premier Series next year in a community Q&A. Chi also detailed format changes for the Premier Series to address some of the problems experienced this year.
In the tournament's current format teams were awarded tournament points for high placements in the Spring and Summer series. These points were then used to determine the eight invited teams for the Premier Series Grand Finals event. This has proven problematic due to the constantly changing nature of the Chinese Overwatch scene. With teams disbanding or entering lengthy slumps, tournament points awarded earlier in the year have failed to properly reward newer competitors. This flaw in the system was most evident in the case of Oh My God's invite to the Premier Series Grand Final, despite their 11th place finish in the Summer Series, whilst LinGan e-Sports missed out on an invite despite being in better form in recent times.
Blizzard's solution to this problem is to change the Premier Series to a number of shorter cups instead of the current system of lengthy Spring and Summer series leading to the Grand Final series and the APAC Premier. Chi stated that this system would be able to better address the constantly changing competitive scene when allocating tournament points, as well as the benefit of being able to host events in multiple Chinese cities.
Chi also mentioned that the cup model would open up time for third party tournaments to be held, with the possibility of these tournaments being allocated Premier Series tournament points if they met Blizzard's standards. The small off-seasons between the Premier Series events has limited the feasibility of lengthy third party tournaments to be held in China in 2017.
The Overwatch Premier Series will continue to run in Asia alongside the Pacific Championship and APEX. More details about the future of the Premier Series are to be released shortly after the conclusion of the APAC Premier.
The most common criticisms of a universal basic income (UBI) are that it is unfeasible and too expensive. However, in a recent series on UBI in the Washington Post, some of the strongest attacks dealt with the possibility that it may undermine civil society in the United States.
Jonathan Coppage, associate editor of The American Conservative magazine, argues that a UBI provides the freedom to “no longer be needed” by the marketplace, where many societal bonds are formed. A UBI would remove these ties, Coppage said.
In India, a UBI trial demonstrated instead that a UBI has the potential to increase entrepreneurial and economic activity. Also, unlike the current entitlement system, UBI benefits do not diminish as income rises, so replacing current social services with a UBI can actually encourage individuals to enter the marketplace.
A cautionary tale does emerge from rentier states in the Middle East. Rentier states, such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, use oil revenue to provide their citizens with lavish social services in order to buy loyalty to the government. Some argue that this environment has contributed to the underdevelopment of rentier states' civil societies, while others dispute this theory.
Nonetheless, the lessons from rentier states cannot properly be applied to implementing a UBI in the United States. There are far too many cultural and institutional differences (such as the repressive politics of many rentier states) to make these countries a useful case study.
In Alaska, the Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) provides a more accurate illustration of how a UBI would affect civil society in America. The PFD provides an annual payment from the state's oil revenues to each citizen of Alaska. It is arguably the closest program to a full UBI in the world.
One of the best measures of the strength of civil society is the level of volunteerism, as it indicates how invested individuals are in the betterment of their communities. Alaska is ranked as having the tenth highest volunteer participation as a percentage of the population in the United States. Additionally, from 1989 to 2006, Alaska's volunteer rate increased by 10 percent.
Many have made the case that a UBI would increase support for civil society as it would allow individuals to shift some of their time to civic engagement. Although more in-depth statistical analysis would be needed to demonstrate that Alaska's high volunteerism rate is a partial result of the PFD, it is easy to see why it may be the case; the financial freedom resulting from a UBI allows people to dedicate more time to activities that truly benefit them and their community.
At the very least, the experience in Alaska shows us that a universal basic income in the United States would not be the death of civil society. In fact, it could be the very stimulus civil society needs to thrive.
SANDY — Police were attempting Tuesday to sort out the details and verify stories in the case of an alleged kidnapping over the weekend that was thwarted by an officer who saw the alleged victim mouth the word "help."
Umar Hayat Raja, 35, of Sandy, was arrested Saturday and booked into the Salt Lake County Jail for investigation of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated robbery, drug possession and possession of drug paraphernalia.
Sandy Police Sgt. Jason Nielsen said a man claimed he was "grieving" at Larkin Cemetery, 1950 E. Dimple Dell Road, between 12:30 a.m. and 1 a.m. Saturday when Raja approached him and demanded at knifepoint that he load his bicycle into the back of his car and drive him around.
As they were driving, Raja "kept gloating that he has killed before" and threatened to stab the man, according to a Salt Lake County Jail report.
The two drove to the parking lot at Jordan Commons, 9335 S. State, where the man told police Raja demanded that they switch seats so Raja could drive, Nielsen said. Raja then drove erratically and nearly hit a police patrol car, he said.
The officer pulled up next to the vehicle, and the man mouthed or quietly said "help me" to the officer, Nielsen said. The officer followed the vehicle and stopped Raja without incident when he pulled into a gas station, Nielsen said.
Investigators found a knife in Raja's backpack and drugs hidden in a sock, according to the jail report.
At the time, Raja declined to speak to investigators unless his lawyer was present, Nielsen said. Detectives hoped to talk to Raja soon to get his side of the story about what unfolded, he said.
Until then, the case will be "investigated as it was reported," Nielsen said.
Court records show a man filed for a protective order against Raja on Friday. It was not immediately known whether the same man was the victim of Saturday's alleged kidnapping.
Court records also list Raja's last known address as being close to the cemetery.
Raja was charged with aggravated assault in April and had a warrant out for his arrest for failing to appear in court when Sandy police picked him up, according to court records. He was also charged in December with assault in a domestic violence-related case, but the case was later dismissed, court records state.
In 2014, Raja was convicted in separate cases of drug possession and theft, and he was ordered to undergo drug treatment and domestic violence counseling, court records state.

President Obama's secret plan to protect the “open Internet” is locked inside the Federal Communications Commission. We don't know what's in the 322 pages, but we are told it includes a transparency rule.
We think it also includes a no-blocking rule, which is crucial because the commission's own website has been blocking access to the press releases of its minority commissioners.
The FCC, consisting of five appointed members, is celebrating the democratic process used in formulating the 332-page plan. In a campaign coordinated with the White House, commission staff solicited several million form letters from activists cheering the ever-popular “Title II reclassification.” Nearly 1 million voters responded furiously with comments of their own, advocating the exact opposite policy, one of Internet freedom. Many senators and congressmen are skeptical an “independent, expert” agency is supposed to work this way. Commission staff, however, are warning Congress, and its 535 elected representatives, to buzz off, lest it intrude on democracy.
The White House has spoken with authority. It directed the FCC to use “Title II of the Telecommunications Act” of 1996 to boost the deployment of “gigabyte” broadband. Never mind that the White House meant Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, or that it confused bytes with bits — it's gigabit broadband. Oh, lighten up. Comm Act, Telecom Act — close enough, right? And what's a mere factor of eight when designing complex technical systems?
Regardless, Congress doesn't understand the law it passed in 1996. It thinks it told the FCC to leave the Internet alone. “It is the policy of the United States,” Congress said in the bipartisan Telecommunications Act of 1996, “to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation.” Oh, dearest Congress. Such a quaint understanding of words.
Concise statutory statements are no match for the FCC's linguistic gymnastics. For starters, Internet service providers, the commission's press secretary informed us, will no longer be part of the Internet. See how easy that is. Congress says the Internet should be “unfettered” by regulation. The FCC says: ISPs aren't the Internet. Voilà.
As a backup, it is also handy, when you think Congress or the courts may have tied your hands in one way, to make up a new service to regulate. Reading between the lines of various public statements, it seems the FCC is cleverly deploying this tool. Even though consumer ISPs don't provide a service to websites on the “edge” of the network, the commission will pretend they do — and then regulate that service.
It is also helpful to pick and choose the victims of the new policy. For example, Google, which accounts for around 20% of Internet traffic, is one of the most robust and long-standing backers of Internet regulation. Thanks to the rush of democratic expertise from liberal arts activists, however, the rules Google thought it wanted have snowballed beyond recognition. So on Friday, Google once again insisted the FCC exempt it from the new rules.
Turning language upside down is also effective — and lots of fun. Many skeptics of regulation are worried that government intrusions into such a technical and dynamic realm as the Internet could slow its pace of experimentation and growth. So in hearings last month, one activist warned Congress not to “micromanage” the FCC, lest Congress interfere with the FCC's “flexibility” and capacity to “innovate.” Brilliant! Two points for a reversal!
Flexibility in one's advocacy is crucial, too. For the last decade, fans of government-run Internet argued that the U.S. had fallen woefully behind the rest of the world, with “pathetically slow” broadband and mobile. That's why we needed Washington to step in and run the Internet. But when consumers looked around them and saw a booming Internet sector, with an overwhelming rush of content, apps and devices, with loads of Silicon Valley startups achieving billion-dollar valuations, and with evidence piling up that the U.S. leads the world in Internet infrastructure, the argument lost its effectiveness.
So the advocates switched course with great agility. “Consumers,” the new argument goes, “like the Internet the way it is.” Which is, of course, why we need 332 pages of new regulations — to protect the thriving U.S. Internet . . . from the engineers and entrepreneurs who brought you the Internet.
Unfortunately for the FCC, the courts will almost certainly overturn the president's plan, and so all its creative rationales will vanish into the wind. Genius denied.

American semiconductor company Qualcomm is currently working on a deal for the acquisition of another chip manufacturer, NXP Semiconductors.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Qualcomm is looking to finalize the acquisition within the next three months. Analysts estimate that Qualcomm may have to spend as much as $30 billion to acquire the Netherlands-based chipmaker, in what would be the latest shift in the arena of semiconductors.
Note that Japanese internet and telecommunications conglomerate SoftBank announced its takeover of UK-based chip designer ARM Holdings for $32 billion back in July.
A Deeper Look Into NXP Semiconductors
NXP Semiconductors, which was formerly known as Philips Semiconductors, was founded in 1953. In 2002, the company partnered with Sony and invented the NFC technology found in modern smartphones running on both iOS and Android. The technology provides the backbone for contactless mobile payment systems such as Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay.
NFC is also capable of smartphone automation via NFC tags. It also has applications for games and gaming controllers. In fact, Microsoft released a Kinect development kit that incorporates NFC technology.
Aside from NFC chips, NXP also has its own lineup of automotive microcontrollers and processors as well as RF products and ARM SoCs.
In 2006, NXP was sold to a group of private equity investors but it wasn't until 2010 that it completed its IPO. In 2015, NXP acquired Freescale Semiconductor, a Texas-based chip designer and manufacturer, for $12 billion.
The acquisition of Freescale cemented NXP's position as the leading automotive chipmaker and added to its existing business in audio infotainment, vehicle networks and security. NXP automotive unit chief executive Kurt Sievers commented that the Freescale acquisition pushed NXP into new application areas in cars including powertrain, safety and body electronics.
NXP reported a $6.1 billion revenue for 2015 that gave the company a $1.5 billion net income. As of this year, the chipmaker listed a total of 45,000 employees that work in its manufacturing sites, wafer fabs and test and assembly facilities in more than 35 countries.
How Qualcomm's Acquisition Of NXP Impacts The Chip Sector
Analysts think NXP's product portfolio complements that of Qualcomm's. Moreover, when Qualcomm acquires NXP, it can open new lines of business and put the company in a dominant position as an automotive chip supplier.
Note that Qualcomm has been poking at the auto industry as of late and started to introduce chips and modems that are specifically tailored for connected automobiles, that is the Snapdragon 820.
Moreover, branching out to new markets can help ensure that Qualcomm financials stay solid. The company's revenues have fallen significantly starting from Q2 2015 due to canceled deals and underperformance within the smartphone market.
Qualcomm's plans of expanding its business beyond mobile computing is evident in the recent release of Snapdragon 600E and 410E SoCs, which are both open to third-party distributors.
"Snapdragon is a powerful and versatile processor with many potential applications in a wide variety of IoT applications and we can now offer this technology to a much wider range of customers with the additional benefit of long-term support and availability," says Qualcomm SVP of product management Raj Talluri.
Both chips can be used on robots, smart appliances and everything in between.

Kennedy took flying lessons at the Flight Safety Academy in Vero Beach, Florida.[33] In April 1998, he received his pilot's license, which he had dreamed about since he was a child.[28] The death of his cousin Michael in a skiing accident brought about a change in Kennedy, making death "just seem closer and closer."[50] Kennedy felt so distressed that he took a hiatus from his piloting lessons at Flight Safety International in Florida for three months. His sister Caroline had hoped that his decision to stop taking piloting lessons would be permanent, but when he resumed, she resigned herself to the "fact that she could do little to stop him."[51]

A drawing of three-year-old JFK Jr. saluting his father's coffin, placed on a memorial wall for him shortly after his death John F. Kennedy Jr. was the first child ever born to a president-elect of the United States. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the assassination of John Jr.'s father on November 22, 1963, the New York Daily News re-ran the famous photograph of the three-year-old John Jr. saluting his father's coffin during the funeral procession. Photographer Dan Farrell, who took the photo, called it "the saddest thing I've ever seen in my whole life".[66] In 2000, Reaching Up, the organization which Kennedy founded in 1989, joined with The City University of New York to establish the John F. Kennedy Jr. Institute.[67] On September 19, 2003, the ARCO Forum at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government was renamed to the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum of Public Affairs. An active participant in Forum events, Kennedy had been a member of the Senior Advisory Committee of Harvard's Institute of Politics for fifteen years. Kennedy's paternal uncle, Ted, said the renaming symbolically linked Kennedy and his father while his sister, Caroline, stated the renaming represented his love of discussing politics.[68]

​ Dani Alves has dropped the biggest hint yet that he is set to leave Barcelona on a free transfer in the summer after posting an Instagram image of himself and his four Brazilian team-mates , along with what seemed like a good bye message.
The 31-year-old full-back, who is out of contract in the summer, posted a picture with Douglas, Adriano, Rafinha and Neymar and seemed to suggest that he is getting ready to leave in the near future.
The picture was uploaded with the caption, "My Brazilian family makes me proud, to be part of this quintet is good. If you have to go, do it with boldness, a beautiful smile and joy in the heart. I'm going to go, so let it be like that. Try to be happy and don't try to be perfect."
In recent weeks, Alves's agent, Dinorah Santana, had publicly revealed that Barcelona had yet to approach the player about an extension and would have no problems leaving after seven years at Camp Nou.
Manchester United are rumoured to be one of the interested parties, with preliminary talks with Santana already believed to have taken place.

One of the most important uses for machine intelligence in e-commerce applications is adaptive pricing – that is, dynamically changing the price of a product in an online store based on characteristics of the user, the product, and the store. It's a technique that's used extensively by big on-line retailers like Amazon, but it's less common for smaller companies.
Partly this is because of the risk of getting prices wrong. If you offer an online user a price that's too high, you're going to fail to convert that user. If you offer one that's too low, you unnecessarily cut into your margin.
Another reason is the difficulty of implementation. Traditional procedural code can be OK for the most trivial adaptive pricing, but if you have more than a couple of factors that affect price, the code can become complex and unmaintainable. It's also hard to test its accuracy, and unhandled edge cases can cause devastating or embarrassing outcomes (free cars, billion-dollar paper-clips).
Machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, require a sizable corpus of data to show successes and failures. Unless you're willing to offer some cohort of customers an array of random prices for a product in order to determine its optimal price, machine learning for pricing can present some challenges.
One technique that's worked well for companies with a two-sided market, like Uber, is to have a market-based bid-and-ask system. Uber, for example, slowly raises the end user's “bid” for a ride until some driver chooses to respond. This can be really useful, but if your two-sided market isn't real-time (Etsy providers can only knit so fast, after all), then bid-and-ask won't be very useful.
In this post, I go over a simple technique for adaptive pricing using fuzzy logic.
Why fuzzy logic?
Fuzzy logic is a machine intelligence technique based on multivariate truth values. A fuzzy logic agent works by mapping exact or “crisp” values into data structures representing membership in a so-called “fuzzy set”. So a user who's been to your site 2 times might not be exactly a new user, but they're kind of a new user and kind of experienced user. Fuzzy logic assigns a value to their membership in each set — say, they're 75% new, and 40% experienced.
Fuzzy logic then allows you to define rules to reason about these sets — something like, “IF the user is new, THEN the discount will be high.” If the user is only partially a member of the set, the output is only partially a member of its set. You can define multiple rules, and it's OK if they're potentially conflicting.
A fuzzy agent then converts these fuzzy output membership measurements to a “crisp” single value which can be used for further processing in a procedural language.
If you have base fuzzy logic software, or you use an API like fuzzy.io, the steps for developing a new fuzzy logic agent are pretty simple:
Define your output variables and their fuzzy sets.
Define your input variables and their fuzzy sets.
Define the rules that link your inputs to your outputs. Usually, this is a one-to-one match of one input fuzzy set to one output fuzzy set.
Fuzzy logic is a good fit for adaptive pricing for a number of reasons:
Like procedural methods, it uses explicit rule definition by the programmer to direct its calculations.
It doesn't require much data to get started. In fact, it depends on your own experience with your customers.
It has smoothly varying output as you vary an input. Procedural code tends to have discontinuities as you hit different thresholds (“if (userAge >= 2) { … }”).
It handles contradictory inputs well. You can have one factor that suggests a high price, and another that suggests a low price, and a fuzzy logic agent will synthesize the two and come out with a reasonable middle ground.
It handles new inputs well. You can get started on an adaptive pricing algorithm with only a few inputs, and then add new inputs as they come up.
It handles missing data well. If you don't know the number of times the user has been on the site for some reason, you can do a calculation with the other factors you do know, and you'll get a reasonable output.
It's relatively easy to audit. Figuring out why a discount was higher or lower than you intuitively expected can be done just by looking at the fuzzified versions of the inputs and outputs.
There are some restrictions to using fuzzy logic, too. The algorithm requires numerical inputs, so if you have input data like “user is in North Dakota”, you need to reframe it to something like “User is in a state with 0.1% market penetration”. Usually it's relatively easy to do.
Defining output variables
For adaptive pricing, there are a couple of different ways to define an output. One is to define the price that will be offered to the customer. That's reasonable, but if you have multiple products available in your store, with widely varying prices, it will mean you need to have a different fuzzy agent for each product. That can be hard to develop and maintain.
Instead, I recommend modelling your adaptive pricing as an adaptive discount. Here, your output is a discount in percent values. Full price would be a discount of 0%, and a free product would be a discount of 100%. The advantage here is that you can use the same fuzzy agent for all your products. You also avoid having out-of-bounds pricing that shocks customers (compare Uber's problems with unexpectedly high “surge pricing”). You can also set a maximum value of the discount to match your profit margin (assuming your margin is about the same on all your products!). You may be willing to sell a product below margin to activate a new customer, but if not, you can use the discount's maximum value to prevent losing money on your adaptive pricing algorithm.
In this diagram, I've defined a discount output variable and its five corresponding fuzzy sets: “veryLow”, “low”, “moderate”, “high”, and “veryHigh”. This is a pretty common pattern in fuzzy engineering: input and output variables usually come with 3, 5, 7, or occasionally 9 outputs.
The diagram shows each fuzzy set, with the variable value in the x axis and the percentage of membership in the y axis. In this example, a discount of 20% is “moderate”, and a discount of 5% has a 50% membership in the “veryLow” set and a 50% membership in the “low” fuzzy set.
I chose 45% as the maximum discount, and then mapped out the other fuzzy sets from there. All of these numbers are based on more or less intuitive reasoning on my part. In a real-world situation, you can do customer surveys or talk to people in your company to get their ideas of what a “moderate” discount is. There are also mechanisms for varying these parameters based on experience (see below).
One thing to note is that at each output value, the membership in all the fuzzy sets adds up to about 100%. This isn't strictly required, but it tends to give smoother-varying outputs.
It's worth noting that this model is going to give a non-zero discount for almost any input values. You may want to set your base prices slightly higher to accommodate this.
Choosing inputs
There are a lot of different input variables you can use for an adaptive pricing algorithm. I've chosen a few here to give some ideas.
One important input is product popularity. How well is the current product selling? If it's not selling very well, it makes sense to offer steeper discounts. If it's selling very well, little or no discount makes sense. To model popularity, I've used the number of sales per week of the product. (I use sales per week to smooth over discrepancies between weekend and weekday Web traffic.) The above fuzzy sets show typical values for a medium-sized e-commerce site; it's relatively easy to expand or contract them. As your e-commerce site grows, varying these input parameters makes a lot of sense.
It's probably also worth noting that calculating the current number of sales per week of a product at runtime is too compute-intensive. This kind of input data should really be pre-calculated, probably on a weekly basis.
Another thing to note is that the number of fuzzy sets in this input is 5 — exactly the same number of fuzzy sets in the discount output variable. This is a good rule-of-thumb, since it makes mapping input variables to output variables in your rules much easier.
A similar input would be product category popularity. There may be value in incenting users to purchase products in underperforming categories, even if the product itself is doing well.
Again, popularity is measured in sales per week. The shape of the category popularity fuzzy sets is roughly the same as the product popularity, but the numbers are somewhat higher — representing a typical ecommerce site with a few products per category, with a few high performers and mostly average performers.
Another input would be store-wide performance. How have numbers been lately? If they've been low, it might make sense to juice the numbers with some bigger discounts.
Here, I've chosen another 5 fuzzy sets, denominated by annual revenue in US dollars. Obviously, what's “ok” for a mid-sized ecommerce site is “terrible” for Apple or Amazon, so these numbers need to be tuned for the company running the site. Especially in periods of high growth, what's “good” in February may be “bad” by April.
For other site-wide inputs, adapting the price by time of day also makes sense. Depending on their market, most ecommerce sites drop off sales dramatically at nights and on weekends. Giving users an incentive here can boost those numbers.
Note that providing the input on this item will require a) figuring out what hour of the week (like 3-4PM on Tuesday) it is and b) looking up the sales for this hour of the week in a database. If sales per hour varies more than 1-2 orders of magnitude, it may make sense to use a logarithmic scale here.
Finally, what about varying the discount based on aspects of the user? One important user metric is recency — how long the user has been signed up. You may want to get new users activated, so providing a discount makes sense.
Here, we're measuring user recency in terms of hours since first acquisition (usually either arriving on a landing page or sign up). The concentration is on very recent users (less than 5 days). Anything larger will get a veryLongTerm membership (and thus, a veryLow discount).
User sales are linked to, but not proportional to, user recency. Long-time users can fail to activate for a long time. In this case, I've broken down the user sales into “unactivated”, “activated”, “frequent”, “veryFrequent” and “whale”. Note that number of sales per user is an integer, so a lot of these values are impossible. But it's still worthwhile to map the input onto a smoothly-continuous set.
There are a number of other user characteristics you can key prices to. One that's especially helpful is market penetration. This is a measure of your company's penetration of a given geographical market, measured in numbers per million. It requires, again, two important lookups: first, identifying the user's geographical location, either based on information they provided you, or on their IP address, or on data from the browser. That will give a latitude/longitude pair, which in turn has to be mapped into a “market” as you define it — a city, county, US state or Canadian province, or country. You'll then need some information on your previous sales to that market.
Here, I've only defined three fuzzy sets — “low”, “medium”, and “high”. Most of the heavy lifting on market penetration happens well before the fuzzy agent gets the input.
Rules
The last step in fuzzy agent design is defining rules to link inputs to outputs. Because we've mostly used inputs with the same number of fuzzy sets as the output, it's relatively easy to define our rules.
For some inputs, like productPopularity, we map the output sets inversely to the input sets. So, if productPopularity is low, the discount is high, and if productPopularity is veryHigh, the discount is veryLow.
For others, like userSales, there's more of a bow shape. Users who have not activated often get high discounts, and top customers also get high discounts. The ones in the middle get low or moderate discounts.
Next steps
If you're interested in trying out this example, it's possible to sign up at fuzzy.io and set up a new fuzzy agent with a Web API.
The next steps, after designing a fuzzy agent, are integrating it into the store. This can happen either through a plugin, or with custom code. Fuzzy.io has a number of Open Source libraries for connecting to the service, for example.
Another important step is varying the fuzzy set boundaries and inputs based on performance. This process, called fuzzy learning, requires a feedback mechanism, showing the performance of each discount value. Performance, here, would be profit on the sale, if any. This feedback can be used to tune the inputs.
"When Jim Doyle was governor and Mary Burke was commerce secretary," Wisconsin saw "billions in middle-class tax hikes on nursing home beds, gas, phones and garbage."
Gov. Scott Walker's latest TV ad seeks to link his leading rival for governor to "billions" in tax increases approved under Walker's predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle.
The new TV spot, which uses a gambling motif complete with playing cards that depict Doyle as a joker and Burke as a queen, says:
"When Jim Doyle was governor and Mary Burke was commerce secretary, they gambled taxpayer money on dreadful policies, like billions in middle-class tax hikes on nursing home beds, gas, phones and garbage."
The ad then blames the duo for "state budgets that created billions in deficits, and unemployment rates above the national average for the only time in 25 years."
"Wisconsin can't afford to be dealt another bad hand by Mary Burke," it concludes.
The unemployment rate claim is a familiar one. We gave the state Republican Party a Mostly True when it said "The only time over the last 25 years when the state's unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. average was when Burke was commerce secretary."
But what about the tax-hike claim in the ad?
When we asked Walker campaign spokeswoman Alleigh Marré for back up, she pointed in part to fiscal estimates for specific tax and fee increases in the proposed 2007-'09 state budget, as calculated by the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau.
The bureau is considered the gold standard for budget scorekeeping.
The estimates show that when Burke was commerce secretary (Feb. 2005 - Nov. 2007), Doyle's proposed 2007-'09 budget sought a higher tax on nursing home beds and proposed a new tax on oil company revenues based on vehicle fuel sales.
What about taxes on "garbage" and "phones"?
They are not listed as tax increases, but the same Fiscal Bureau report tallies fee increases. Doyle sought increases in "tipping fees" for disposing of recyclables and industrial waste. And he sought fees on telecommunications companies to help fund various library services.
The gas and nursing home taxes came to $305 million in Doyle's two-year budget proposal. The fees would have added another $61 million.
Grand total: $366 million.
That's far short of the "billions" mentioned in the TV ad.
The gap grows when you look at the final version of that 2007 budget as signed by Doyle. The Legislature, which was under split control of Democrats and Republicans, changed the budget and the final budget included $19 million in increases for the items mentioned in the TV ad.
In the list she sent us, Marré added a big item not mentioned in the TV ad: a $414 million tax increase on hospital's revenue, to support state health programs.
It didn't make it into the adopted budget, but even if you count that proposal, the tally is $780 million, not "billions."
When asked about the ad's "billions" claim, Marré contended other Doyle budgets -- not just 2007-09 -- are fair game. The TV ad, she said, is meant to refer to tax increases at any point in Doyle's time (2003-2011) -- or increases during Burke's state time.
But the ad isn't clear on that.
The ad's language -- "When Jim Doyle was governor and Mary Burke was commerce secretary" -- refers to their time together. And Burke was around for development of just one budget.
Later budget
Nevertheless, we took a look at the 2009-11 budget, which Marré argued should be included when evaluating the ad.
By our calculation, that second budget proposal contained $520 million to $1.35 billion in new taxes and fees on the four items cited in the ad. (It depends on whether you count $830 million in fees on telecommunications companies as a levy on "phones"; the bill barred companies from passing it directly along on consumers' bills).
So if you add the two budgets together, there were as much as $1.7 billion in new taxes on those four items.
But there's a major problem with tying Burke to that budget.
She left more than a year before it was proposed.
Marré brought up one last point, a quote from Burke that is also in the TV ad, which says, "Mary Burke came out saying, ‘I support Gov. Doyle's positions entirely.'"
Burke did say that, in an interview with the Wisconsin State Journal:
Q: Are you politically active?
Burke: No, and I can't say why or why not...I've always been an independent. I've always voted for who I thought was the best person for the position. I support Gov. Doyle's positions entirely. I'm very impressed, and I'm starting to feel very Democratic at this point because I feel he is just doing so much that's right for Wisconsin that creates a better place to live for everyone."
The comment is sweeping, so it's fair game.
But it's from April 2005.
That gives it limited value at best as evidence of how Burke felt about a Doyle budget proposed after she left state government.
Our rating
In a campaign ad, Walker says that "when Jim Doyle was governor and Mary Burke was commerce secretary," Wisconsin saw "billions in middle-class tax hikes on nursing home beds, gas, phones and garbage."
As a cabinet secretary, Burke would have had some impact on one of Doyle's budgets. And it did contain increases on those four items.
But the ad misfires badly on the math and the blame game.
Proposed new taxes and fees in that one budget totalled $366 million on nursing homes, gas, garbage and phones, not "billions." And the tally was far less in the final version of the budget Doyle signed.
Beyond that, Burke was gone when Doyle's subsequent budget sought up to $1.35 billion more for those items in 2009.
We rate Walker's claim False.
The Sky rider had higher-than-allowed amounts of Salbutamol in his system during the Vuelta a Espana.
MPCC — the voluntary advocacy group promoting cycling ethics — is pressuring Team Sky to suspend Chris Froome until his asthma case plays out.
Team Sky is not among seven WorldTour teams that are part of the group, but that didn't stop the MPCC board from pressing its case that the best thing for cycling is for Froome to temporarily step aside.
“[The] MPCC and its Board of Directors, without making any assumption towards the final decision, asks Team Sky to suspend its rider on a voluntary basis, until the end of the procedure,” an MPCC press release stated Monday. “This measure would allow the rider and It's team to focus on their defense with serenity, but also to avoid tension among many managers and riders.”
The fact that Froome is still able to race — though it is worth pointing out there are no major races until next month — has rankled some within the cycling community.
WADA rules, however, state clearly that Froome is not facing a provisional ban for turning in a urine sample in September with double the allowed limit of Salbutamol. The drug is a threshold product — called a “specified substance” in WADA jargon — and does not trigger a provisional ban in the case of an “adverse analytical finding.”
Froome is currently in Mallorca for a Team Sky pre-season training camp, and shows no signs of stepping aside as his case plays out. Froome denies culpability, and said he did not take more than allowed doses of Salbutamol, a product that is allowed under WADA rules in spray form but under strict quantity limits.
The MPCC — Movement Pour Cyclisme Credible — was created in 2007. Twenty Pro Continental team, nine Continental teams, and six women's teams are members.
As of now, only seven WorldTour teams participate: Ag2r-La Mondiale, Bora-Hansgrohe, Dimension Data, FDJ, Lotto-Soudal, Team Sunweb, and Education First-Drapac (Cannondale-Drapac).
MPCC members vow to follow a stricter ethical code than outlined by WADA and UCI rules, in part to engender confidence via transparency. One of those tenets is to voluntarily sideline riders if they run afoul with an anti-doping investigation.
Froome tested positive for elevated levels of Salbutamol in a routine anti-doping control on September 7. Froome and Team Sky were notified September 20. The story only broke via leaks last week.
The MPCC also requested a formal investigation into comments made by former Sky coach Shane Sutton in a BBC documentary suggesting that Team Sky's use of TUEs (therapeutic-use exceptions) might have been for a competitive advantage.
“MPCC also requests that UCI opens an inquiry following Shane Sutton's statements. The former Team Sky and UK's national team's coach admitted that some of the medicine requiring a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) might have been used to enhance performance,” the release said.
“Given the zero tolerance that everyone advocates and the necessity for transparency, MPCC renews its wish to see Team Sky and all the other teams, sponsors, organizers … to join MPCC on a voluntary basis. MPCC's philosophy, alongside the UCI, can make a real difference in the fight against doping.”
Listen to our discussion of the Froome case on the VeloNews podcast:
This tutorial assumes you have basic knowledge in web development and knows basic programming. I recommend that you first read my previous post titled “Hello world app with the vibe.d web framework” if you are new to vibe.d web framework.
In my previous post on using vibe.d web framework, I showed how vibe.d can make web development easy. In this tutorial, I will show how you can use vibe.d to create a form to submit data and files.
Create a new vibe.d project. I will call mine vibe-upload ;
aberba@mx:~/workspace/d/ $ dub init vibe-upload --type = vibe.d Package recipe format ( sdl/json ) [ json]: Name [ vibe-upload]: Description [ A simple vibe.d server application.]: Author name [ Lawrence Aberba]: License [ proprietary]: Copyright string [ Copyright © 2016, Lawrence Aberba]: Add dependency ( leave empty to skip ) [] : Successfully created an empty project in '/home/aberba/workspace/d/' . Package sucessfully created in vibe-upload
The contents of the project folder is as follows;
aberba@mx:~/workspace/d/vibe-upload $ ls dub.json public source views
Implementing form for text data
For starters, lets see how sending textual form data (text) works using HTTP POST. Create an index.dt file in views folder and insert the following diet template code;
doctype html head title File upload body form(method='post', action='/upload', enctype='multipart/form-data') p label(for='title') Title br input(name='title',type='text') p button(type='submit') Send
The contents of the source/app.d file will now be as follows;
import vibe . d ; static this () { auto router = new URLRouter ; router . get ( "*" , staticTemplate ! "index.dt" ); auto settings = new HTTPServerSettings ; settings . port = 8080 ; settings . bindAddresses = [ "::1" , "127.0.0.1" ]; listenHTTP ( settings , router ); logInfo ( "Server Running" ); }
Unlike the previous vibe.d post, the router.get() HTTP route here uses the staticTemplate function to render index.dt as a static template for all GET requests (You can configure it however you want).
Now its time to write a function to handle form submission using a POST request. Let's write an upload function above the main function and register it in router to handle form submission through /upload URL as specified in the form property ( action='/upload' ).
void upload ( HTTPServerRequest req , HTTPServerResponse res ) { import std . stdio ; string title = req . form . get ( "title" ); writeln ( "Form title is: " , title ); res . redirect ( "/" ); }
The above upload function will extract the title input data from the req.form property using its get method (use req.query.get() method for an HTTP GET request). For now, we just write the title to the console and redirect to the browser back to the homepage. Run the server and fill-in the text input of the form which should look like the screenshot below;
Implementing file upload
Now we are ready to add file upload functionality. Open the index.dt file and add a file input.
doctype html head title File upload body form(method='post', action='/upload', enctype='multipart/form-data') p label(for='title') Title br input(name='title',type='text') p p label(for='document') Select your document file br input(name='document', type='file') p br button(type='submit') Send
Create a new folder named uploads in your public folder where we will store all uploaded files. Now lets update the upload function to support file upload;
void upload ( HTTPServerRequest req , HTTPServerResponse res ) { import std . stdio ; string title = req . form . get ( "title" ); // File upload here auto file = "document" in req . files ; try { moveFile ( file . tempPath , Path ( "./public/uploads" ) ~ file . filename ); writeln ( "Uploaded successfully!" ); } catch ( Exception e ) { writeln ( "Exception thrown, trying copy" ); copyFile ( file . tempPath , Path ( "./public/uploads" ) ~ file . filename ); } writeln ( "Form title is: " , title ); res . redirect ( "/" ); }
In the above code, we use a try/catch block to handle exceptions in cases where moving file from the temporal folder to public/uploads fail (file permission restriction, etc).
NOTE: The maximum default size for file upload is 2MB (2097152 bytes). You can change that in settings.maxRequestSize = XLU; where X is the number of bytes (1MB is 1048576 bytes). See the documentation of maxRequestSize for more options.
Now it's time to register the upload function to the /upload POST route in router . Add the following code below router.get("*", staticTemplate!"index.dt"); to do that;
router . post ( "/upload" , & upload );
Now we are all set test our app. Build the project again and the form should now look like the screenshot below;
Fill-in the title input, select a sample file and submit form. If everything is successful, you should see the title input value printed in your command-line and the file should be uploaded to the public/uploads folder.
I hope you find this tutorial useful. In future tutorial, I will show how you can upload multiple files.
Kim Kardashian recently gave fans a preview of Kanye West's newest Yeezys, and people are not feeling them.
The white Adidas trainers, called the Yeezy Mud Rat 500s, are part of Yeezy's Spring 2018 collection.

The shoes received an overwhelmingly negative response on Kim's Instagram:
“Wait....are we being serious RN?” one commenter wrote, while others added comments like “Wat r those” and “Those are the ugliest things I've ever seen.”
One follower got very descriptive and wrote, “They look all extra CHUNKY ALL AROUND, not cute at ALL!! I don't care if they had cost hundreds of dollars and you gave them to me, I would NEVER WEAR THEM but I would give them to my great great grandfather, he may like them but then maybe NOT!!!”
Twitter was equally unenthused about the new Yeezys:

According to Highsnobiety, the shoes are made of suede, cow leather, mesh and 3M reflective piping and also come in a gray suede color. There's no price point yet, though Yeezys typically sell for $200-$350 and resell prices are usually over $1,000.
The shoes are similar to the on-trend ugly and sometimes dirty and distressed sneakers we've seen from designers in 2017:

Azumanga, being the seminal manga, produced an enormous number of imitations and cameos. Usually it's something small, like Chiyo-chichi on a fan in Love Hina. In Ichigo Mashimaro, Chiyo-chichi and Yotsuba meet the main cast outright (and Chiyo-chichi says "I am Azuma").
The anime prompted some of that as well. Here's a little cameo in Happy Lesson:
Azumanga's creators did it too:
I wish someone told me what they referred... In this case, we can be reasonably sure that it is, indeed, a cameo (unless it's just a joke designed to make fans to crack their heads guessing). But I know a trickier case.
In Chobits, a sizeable chunk of the action happens in a bakery called "Tirol". This is how its sign looks:
The sign says "欧風菓子 チロル" (oufuu kashi chiroru, European Sweets "Tirol"). Now, in ep.24 of Azumanga they have a Tirol too! It's even shown twice, by night and by day:
Here's the signage, enlarged:
It's a little blurry, but it clearly says "手作りお菓子 チロル" (tezukuri okashi chiroru, Handmade Sweets "Tirol"). Is this a reference to Chobits?
I honestly do not know. Chobits and Azumanga Daioh were broadcast in the same season (which begs the question just how Rie Tanaka managed to do lead roles in both!). Tirol appears in Chobits ep.8, which gives about three months or so to insert the reference into Azumanga ep.24. It is possible. And it's too much of coincidence. But for a purposeful reference, it's too timid.
A night on the gin-joint town. And on the newbie tab, at least the part where a bill was presented.
And it would end in a hotel room, many hours later, with an alleged sexual assault by three Toronto constables against a female parking enforcement officer.
“Rookie Buy Night” it was called, the scrubeenie in this case a cub cop, or wannabe cop, that was her ambition, all of them working out of 51 Division.
Leslie Nyznik, Joshua Cabero and Sameer Kara each pleaded not guilty to the charges a week ago when the trial was to have started with jury selection. In a surprise last-minute move, however, the defendants opted to have the case heard by judge-alone.
Those facts aren't in contention. Security video from the hotel shows Nyznik entering the elevator, plastic bags in hand. Kara, leaning heavily into his colleague, is also captured lurching into the hotel a couple of hours before midnight.
A room there had been booked just after noon, with Nyznik checking in around 2:06 p.m., just after finishing his shift.
An admission of facts — the part that isn't being contested — is brief. The accused admit being with the complainant — her name protected by a publication ban — throughout the evening, as they meandered from one saloon to another. A couple of other officers in the original party group checked out earlier. Also departing the scene at the Pravda point — because he'd thrown up on himself — was Kara. A colleague helped him get to the Westin Harbour Castle Hotel on the nearby waterfront.
At about 3:30 a.m., now into Saturday, the complainant is seen leaving the hotel alone, getting into a cab. Within 15 minutes she'd sent a text about the incident to a friend.
At 12:20 a.m., Nyznik and Cabero arrive at the Westin in the company of the complainant. Up the elevator they all go, to Room 2340.
What transpired in those three hours?
“Mr. Nyznik, Mr. Kara, Mr. Cabero and (the complainant) are alone in that hotel room,” Crown Attorney Mabel Lai told Justice Anne Molloy in her condensed opening. “The dispute is about what happened in that hotel room during that time.
“The Crown will allege that the three defendants before the court variously engaged in intercourse and oral sex with (the complainant) without consent. That will be the crux of the Crown's case.''
The “festivities”, court heard, had begun at the Westin. Just after 6 p.m., the group “migrated” to the CC Lounge. That's where the complainant joined them around 8:45.
There is an abundance of video documenting most of this, though no footage was recovered by investigators from Pravda.
In the broad outline provided by Lai, the Crown said the complainant will relate what she did in the nine days between the alleged incident and her formal reporting of it to her supervisor on January 26.
In the interim, the complainant had spoken about the event to friends. She'd also gone, over that weekend, to two Toronto hospitals.
Lai said court would hear, from among a long list of witnesses — the trial is expected to last four or five weeks — the evidence of two expert witnesses, one of them a toxicologist. “I expect she'll tell you that urine and blood samples collected … on January 19,” by a sexual assault specialist nurse, “yielded no significant findings for drugs or alcohol.”
Also scheduled to testify is a forensic biologist who will speak to DNA profiles taken from a rectal swab, an external general swab taken from the complainant, the outside of her bustier, inside crotch area of her jeans and her blouse.
Based on Kara's DNA profile, “he cannot be excluded as the donor of the semen on these items,” said Lai.
The probability of Kara and a randomly selected individual unrelated to him would share that DNA profile is about 1 in 440 million for the rectal swab and 1 in 68 trillion for the other swabs.
A second DNA profile was taken from a swab taken from the complainant's pendant necklace and brassiere cups, said Lai. Based on Nyznik's DNA profile, the forensic biologist is expected to explain that officer can't be excluded as the “donor of the semen” found on those articles, and the probability that Nyznik and a randomly selected individual unrelated to him would share that DNA profile “is about 1 in 490 quadrillion.”
The trial hasn't got to any of that yet.
Instead, the first day was spent almost entirely on a laborious scrutiny of the stills and video collected by investigators, with Nyznik's defence lawyer Joanne Mulcahy doing all the cross-examination heavy lifting on behalf of the three top-drawer defence teams, a go-to cast featuring Harry Black, Patrick Ducharme and Alan Gold.
With Det. Sgt. Jeffrey Attenborough — at the time with the criminal investigations unit from Professional Standards and lead investigator on the case — in the witness stand, Mulcahy educed a litany of shortcomings and gaps in the video evidence collected. Attenborough, who went on vacation just after the case was opened, had no explanation for why video from all the surveillance cameras at the CC Lounge had not been recovered, nor why footage from various hotel cameras was missing, even though those images had been documented by the hotel's security staff in the “camera activity report” turned over along with the UBS flash drive.
Example: Footage purportedly showing two of the accused leaving the Westin at 8:45 Saturday morning, apparently going for a walk, and returning shortly thereafter. All three are seen leaving together in a cab once Nyznik checked out at 9:12 a.m.
That original missing hotel video is no longer available, due to a “video crash” which erased the material, except for one clip subsequently located.
“All the other footage is gone?” asked Mulcahy.
Attenborough: “To my knowledge, yes ma'am.”
The relevance of the missing video is unclear, beyond the implication that the investigation had been sloppy and inept.
From his repeatedly spot-on music video spoofs to his hilarious cult classic film UHF to his current crazed co-hosting of Comedy Bang! Bang!, Al Yankovic – better known as “Weird Al” – has been mercilessly tickling our funny bones since the 1980s (who can forget “Another One Rides the Bus” or “Eat It”?). But while his stardom may be now cemented on YouTube, his TV appearances are equally memorable and even more manic. Only know him from perfect pop parodies? Here are five freakily great examples of Weird Al turning up the eccentricity dial from ten to eleven, oh hell, to twelve.
1. Comedy Bang! Bang!
(Season 1, Ep. 10: “Weird Al Wears a Different Hawaiian Shirt”)
Scott Aukerman's show bumped up Weird Al from guest star to co-host and bandleader this season. While the IFC series has always excelled at poking fun at talk shows, Weird Al's presence can take an episode into crazy-land in a heartbeat. Just check out his first appearance in which he gets to lead a daring rescue. “Goddammit, give me an Emmy already!” We agree. He's priceless.
2. My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic
(Season 4, Ep. 12: “Pinkie Pride”)
Yes, the Weirdness of Al also translates when he's just a voice of a cartoon. In this animated series for young and old bronies alike, Weird Al can be heard as the character Cheese Sandwich: a party-planning pony who goes head-to-head against the ever-cheerful Pinkie Pie. Songs with random non-sequiturs ensue and horse sense is learned. Even in a career filled with many WTF moments, the “why am I laughing” sentiment stands out here. And yes, there's a polka.
3. Teen Titans Go!
(“Two Parter: Part Two” (Season 2, Ep. 18))
Darkseid may be one of the most feared villains in the DC Universe, but give the tyrannical megalomaniac a lozenge to suck on and he sounds surprisingly like…Weird Al. Still, Yankovic's Darkseid is one bad mofo: lasers come out of eyeballs, stuff gets blown up, and it takes a team of Titans to take this dude down. Interestingly, both the Titans and Darkseid are fans of Weird Al, but for completely different reasons. You can decide which team you're on.
4. Robot Chicken
(“The Munnery” Season 2, Episode 32)
Weird Al's 2006 hit song “Weasel Stomping Day” gets the Robot Chicken treatment. If you're partial to furry rodents, you probably should skip this altogether. But if not, you're got ready for some serious “oh, no they didn't” moments. Ah, Adult Swim. How you love to take it there. We cannot look away.
5. Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp
(“Auditions” Season 1, Episode 4)
A prequel to a camp classic, this series debuted on Netflix in 2015. Every sleepaway camp needs good kid-friendly entertainment, and what could be more entertaining than a hypnotist played by none other than Weird Al? Just wait until the end of the episode when you find out what his true purpose at Camp Firewood is. It's not making pseudo-adolescents cluck like chickens and moo like cows.

Have mercy!
Anyway — the song in the commercial is clearly very similar to the John Butler Trio song. As for domestic violence ... I can't really get behind the argument that it promotes it since Stamos pops up without a scratch, and also, this commercial aired during a football game, where players routinely batter each other on the field with absolutely no delicious yogurt at stake.
According to a response on the Oikos Facebook page, they "wanted to entertain viewers with a light-hearted, playful depiction of our product. Our intention was to promote yogurt in an unexpected, humorous commercial, and not to make light of any form of domestic violence or abuse whether the victim is a woman or a man. We're sorry if our ad offended anyone. We take your concerns very seriously and are looking into this matter right away."
You can watch the commercial here and read about how "critics are raving" about it. And for comparison, here's the John Butler Trio song.
Meanwhile, I think it's time for The Great Greek Yogurt Debate. What's your favorite? Mine is FAGE. I like that they separate the fruit from the yogurt so you can more consistently mix it than you can the fruit-on-the-bottom types. Let's just say that if John Stamos tried to bogart my FAGE, I'd head-butt him in that handsome little face of his.
Imran Rehman now helps men who have suffered forced marriage
When Imran Rehman was 10, he was taken to Pakistan and found himself in the middle of an enormous family party.
He remembers being told to sit next to a little girl in a fine dress. He did not understand why, but he and the little girl were, jointly, the centre of attention.
They were showered with money and presents and they had garlands cast around their necks.
Imran said: "I was just paying attention to the food and the money. I didn't know what was happening. I just thought it was a party."
It was not until five years later - the year he sat his O-levels - that he was shown a photograph of that celebration - and he finally understood its significance. It had been his own engagement party.
The little girl was his five-year-old first cousin. She was also to be his wife - whether he liked it or not.
Locked up
"It made me feel sick, knowing that was my engagement. I went off the rails. I got into the wrong crowd, I got into fights, I got expelled from two schools," he said.
To get him to behave, his parents took measures that many people might see as extreme.
They sent him to Pakistan, telling him it was so he could see the area where they had been born. For a while, he says, "it was nice to be on holiday".
Then, one morning, he says, he was drugged, taken to a mosque in a deserted village, and imprisoned. Once there, he had shackles locked around his feet.
"I was kept in a room, locked up. I had to sleep like that. I even had to eat, go to the bath, toilet, shackled like that, for 15 days."
Emotional blackmail
With the help of friends, he was eventually able to find his way back to the UK.
When he got home, the only explanation he got from his family was it was his "rehabilitation".
You're a man, you don't cry - if you cry, you're not supposed to show your tears
Imran Rehman
The pressure continued, perhaps to a lesser degree, for years, until something happened that finally made up his mind up that he had to get married.
He said: "I was 24. I was working at Birmingham airport. I got a phone call to say one of my close relatives was extremely ill. I was the first person there, by their bedside. I said: 'What can I do to help?'"
His poorly relative told him that if anything was to happen to her, it would be his fault, for not going to Pakistan to get married. He says he was emotionally blackmailed, and he felt that he had no choice.
"So I went to Pakistan. I didn't want that on my head, you know," he said.
Family disowned
He married his cousin. But the marriage only lasted a month before Imran told his family it was over.
He was told he had just two choices: "Stay with your wife, buy a house, have kids, live your life. Or get disowned."
"So I left home," he said.
It was the beginning of a seven-year severance from his family. He says he drifted from job to job, drank too much and struggled to deal with his trauma.
"My family had disowned me. I just thought: 'I've got to stand on my own two feet and try and battle it out'. Which I couldn't understand how to do."
'Stressed out'
He eventually found a support organisation called Karma Nirvana. At the time, this Derby-based self-help group was only for women.
But they realised, through their dealings with Imran, that men were also vulnerable to becoming victims of honour-based violence.
Now, Imran works with Karma Nirvana as a support worker for men who suffer in the same way he did.
He says it is harder for men to seek help than women because men are not allowed to be open about their feelings.
Before, when I was alone, I used to feel like I was the only man who was going through it
Imran Rehman
He said: "You're a man, you don't cry. If you cry, you're not supposed to show your tears. It really stressed me out.
"I knew there was no support for me to go anywhere. Now, there is support out there for men. I encourage men to come forward.
"What I tend to do is I tell my personal experiences to the men I work with, male victims. And believe me, they do open up."
Imran now supports 36 men who have been victims of forced marriage or honour-based violence.
He says helping them get over their problems is a way to help himself to stay positive.
"It makes me feel good, you know? I know I'm not alone any more. Before, when I was alone, I used to feel like I was the only man who was going through it," he said.
Now he knows there are others who have gone through what he has been through. And he hopes they will all get the kind of support that will help keep them safe from their families.
Donald Trump has won the election. Now it is up to America's institutions, and the people within them, to check his worst instincts.
There is danger in Trump. He's a man with authoritarian impulses, a conspiracy theorist's bent, and a taste for vengeance. He has an alarming temperament, little impulse control, and less decency. He has a demagogue's instinct for finding enemies and a bully's instinct for finding their weaknesses. He is uninterested in policy, unrestrained by shame, and unbound by norms. He surrounds himself with sycophants and enablers, and he believes both the facts and the falsehoods he finds congenial.
But he is entering an office that is weaker than many realize. For all the same reasons Barack Obama could not bring about the change he had made people believe in, Trump cannot wrench America to his vision of greatness. He is constrained by the House and the Senate, by the Supreme Court, by the executive agencies, and — in ways less formal but no less powerful — by his own staff and party.
There would be more comfort in this if there were more opposition inside these institutions. But Republicans control everything — the House, the Senate, and, after an appointment, the Supreme Court. If Trump is to be checked, it will be because his own party checks him.
So far, the GOP has not shown much interest or ability in standing up to their standard-bearer. Top Republicans closed ranks around Trump despite believing him fundamentally unfit for office. Their embrace did not, however, lead to Trump surrounding himself with more professional staff, developing sounder policy, or moderating his worst instincts.
Already, the Trump campaign has leaked that they will fill their administration with the most supportive staff they can find, not the best. But the number of jobs they appear to have candidates for is slim. They will need many more bodies to fill both the White House and the executive agencies. This is a place where the Republican Party could potentially play a role in surrounding Trump with calmer, wiser advisers who could provide him better information and curb his worst impulses.
The Republican Congress will use Trump to pass the agenda it has already crafted — Paul Ryan's bargain has always been that he will endorse a man he clearly believes to be dangerous so long as that man appears likely to sign his budget. Trump is a dealmaker, and he'll presumably hold up his end of the deal. The question is whether Congress will attempt to check Trump elsewhere — on surveillance, on wartime powers, on trade.
But our institutions are only as good as the people running them. Parties have strong incentives to back their president — that's how Trump united the GOP after he became the nominee, and it's how he'll hold it together after he takes the White House. There's been little evidence that Republicans — even the ones who clearly recognize Trump's danger — are willing to risk electoral sanction to protect the country they profess to love.
House and Senate Republicans know that Trump's success is their success, that his strength is their strength. The same goes for his staff, and his appointees. The question is whether they can structure a version of success for him that keeps the country safe, and whether they will be willing, if the worst comes to pass, to cross their president for their country.
If there is hope, it is here: The incentives of governance are different from the incentives of opposition. The Republican majority will have to face the voters in 2018, and then again in 2020. If they have taken health insurance from tens of millions of people without replacement, if they have ripped open families and communities with indiscriminate deportation, if they have embroiled us in disastrous wars or confrontations, if they have sent the economy into tailspin, those elections will not be pleasant.
Perhaps this is a weight Trump will feel in a way he has not over the course of the campaign, and he will change his behavior accordingly. But even if he doesn't, Republicans have a majority, and it will be one they hope to keep. To keep it, they will need to govern well, or at least convince the electorate they have governed well. And to govern well, they will need to keep Trump's worst tendencies in check. Now we see how strong the American system really is.
Viewpoint: Cosmic-Ray Showers Reveal Muon Mystery

The Pierre Auger Observatory has detected more muons from cosmic-ray showers than predicted by the most up-to-date particle-physics models.

The Large Hadron Collider at CERN produces proton collisions with center-of-mass energies that are 13 thousand times greater than the proton's rest mass. At such extreme energies these collisions create many secondary particles, whose distribution in momentum and energy reveals how the particles interact with one another. A key question is whether the interactions determined at the LHC are the same at higher energies. Luckily, nature already provides such high-energy collisions—albeit at a much lower rate—in the form of cosmic rays entering our atmosphere. Using its giant array of particle detectors, the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina has found that more muons arrive on the ground from cosmic-ray showers than expected from models using LHC data as input [1]. The showers that the Auger collaboration analyzed come from atmospheric cosmic-ray collisions that are 10 times higher in energy than the collisions produced at the LHC. This result may therefore suggest that our understanding of hadronic interactions (that is, interactions between protons, neutrons, and mesons) from accelerator measurements is incomplete.
Cosmic rays are relativistic particles (mostly protons and light nuclei) that are produced by supernovae and other powerful sources in and beyond our galaxy. When a cosmic-ray particle collides with a molecule in Earth's atmosphere, it generates a cascade of secondary particles. An incident proton, for example, will typically expend 40% of its energy producing a secondary proton or neutron, together with a large number of other hadrons, mostly pions. Neutral pions decay immediately to two photons that generate an electromagnetic “cascade” comprising electron-positron pairs and gamma rays. Charged pions with high energies interact again in the atmosphere. The neutral pions they produce contribute further to the electromagnetic component of the shower, while other particles carry energy forward to subsequent interactions. Lower-energy charged pions decay before interacting again and produce muons, which largely survive to the ground.
Unlike detectors at accelerators, experiments like Auger do not directly detect the initial collision but only the secondary cascade that it generates. This is simply because the rate of events is too low: At an energy equivalent to 10 times the center-of-mass energy at the LHC, the cosmic-ray flux is only about one particle per square kilometer per year. This is far too low to observe the collision directly with a detector in space or a balloon-borne detector above the atmosphere. Auger, with a detector array that spans 3000 square kilometers, may collect only a few thousand such events per year. In comparison, the LHC can produce a billion proton collisions per second.
Auger observes the first interaction indirectly by analyzing the shower of particles it generates [2]. To detect shower particles that reach the ground, the observatory uses 1660 water-filled tanks separated from each other by more than a kilometer. When struck by a high-speed particle, the water emits a flash of light (Cherenkov radiation). Auger complements the detection of particles on the ground by tracking the path of a cascade in the atmosphere with four telescopes, placed at the perimeter of the array, that are sensitive to the fluorescent light generated by the cascade (Fig. 1).
Events seen by both the fluorescence telescopes and the water tanks are called hybrid events. They constitute only a small fraction of all of the ground events because the fluorescence can only be observed on clear, moonless nights. However, they are a particularly valuable subsample because the fluorescence from the shower as a function of its penetration into the atmosphere—the shower profile—is sensitive to the mixture of nuclei in the primary cosmic radiation [3]. Also, because most of the muons arriving at the ground are from interactions involving charged pions, the ground signal is primarily sensitive to the properties of hadronic interactions. On the other hand, the atmospheric cascade probed by the telescope consists mostly of electrons and positrons descended from the first few hadronic interactions. It therefore reflects the primary particles' energies. In their new analysis, the Auger collaboration uses a sample of 411 hybrid events, collected over nine years, in a narrow energy range of around 1 0 1 9 eV.
For each hybrid event, the Auger researchers compare two quantities: the signal measured at the ground and the signal expected at the ground, which they compute with models that use parameters determined by the latest LHC measurements. A complication for these computations is that they depend on the identity of the nucleus involved in the first collision and on where in the atmosphere the shower starts and how it develops, all of which vary from shower to shower. To solve this problem, the Auger team simulates each event 25,000 times, on average, thereby sampling all the possibilities for how the different particle interactions are distributed in energy and in the atmosphere. They then pick several simulations that fit the telescope measurements well. From these “best fit” telescope measurements, they predict the signal on the ground using two models based on LHC data.
But there is an additional wrinkle. The signal at the ground comes both from muons and from the electrons and positrons produced by the electromagnetic cascade. Since these two components cannot be distinguished, the researchers must predict them separately. Fortunately, the electromagnetic component dominates for cascades arriving from straight above the observatory, while the muon component dominates for angles of arrival exceeding 37 degrees. (The data correspond to events with arrival angles from 0 to 60 degrees.) Taking account of this difference, the researchers scale the two components predicted by the models separately to obtain the best fit to the data. The scaling factor they get for the electromagnetic component is near unity, but it is between 1.3 and 1.6 for the hadronic component. In other words, Auger has detected about 30–60% more muons than expected.
This discrepancy has been seen before. In 2000, the HiRes-MIA hybrid array in Utah found a higher density of muons at 600 m from the shower's trajectory than expected from (then current) models of hadronic interactions [4]. Last year, the problem showed up in the analysis of nearly horizontal showers at Auger [5]. The new results from Auger put the muon excess on a firmer basis by making a tight connection between the telescope measurements and the signal on the ground. This finding suggests that the best models of hadronic interactions are missing something. One possibility is that they do not account for a process that keeps more energy in the hadronic component; for example, a higher production of baryon-antibaryon pairs [6]. Another option is that the physics of strong interactions changes at energies beyond those tested at the LHC [7, 8].
What's next? The Auger collaboration can extend its analysis outside the narrow energy range to look for an energy dependence of the discrepancy, which would provide a clue to its origin. For a complementary test, they could also analyze other observables that are sensitive to hadronic interactions, such as the height at which muons are produced. Finally, a significant upgrade called “Auger Prime” is underway [9]. This will allow the team to measure the muon and electromagnetic contributions to the ground signal separately, removing a significant source of uncertainty in their current analysis.

Scientists and climate policy wonks usually say global warming is caused by "human activities." This shorthand obscures an important point: that while we humans are certainly responsible for climate change on some level, just a few of us, particularly in industry and government, are a lot more responsible than the rest of us.
After all, I like humans. I like activities, too. And it's industry practices and government policies that largely determine how much heat-trapping emissions our human activities produce.

Industrial-scale Carbon Burning Is Causing Climate Change; Humans Are Just Doing Activities
From a scientific perspective, recent climate change is caused by an excess of heat-trapping emissions in the atmosphere. The gases happen to be coming from extracting and then burning massive amounts of coal and oil, as well as destroying tropical forests.
Because scientists have invested so much effort in successfully differentiating between natural and "human-caused" warming -- and because a loud minority of fossil fuel companies, ideological groups and politicians have insisted for decades that scientists are wrong -- the terms of the broader debate about climate change are often stuck on this point, at least in the United States.
When we focus on the "human activities" that are causing climate change, we sound like we're laying climate blame on things like using a washer and dryer, driving, flipping a light switch and other day-to-day things many humans in the developed world take for granted and that many humans in the developing world would very much like to do, too.

In an ideal world, these human activities would continue. They simply wouldn't produce the heat-trapping gases that are rapidly altering the climate on which we depend.
As it stands, our best individual attempts at limiting the carbon footprint of our human activities can only go so far -- and many steps are much harder than they should be, even in the developed world:
I can buy the most fuel-efficient car, but if the gas I'm using to fill it up was extracted from tar sands, my carbon footprint will be larger than it would be otherwise.
If my utility company buys a lot of coal because government policies subsidize it, LED lightbulbs, an electric car, and turning the light switch off when I leave a room can only get me so far.
I can put solar panels on my roof -- if my state and local government don't throw up unnecessary barriers at the behest of energy companies.
I can studiously make deforestation-free purchases, but only if companies tell me how they make their products.
Given these constraints, we need to be clearer about what is really causing climate change. "Human activities" are great. Climate change is caused by industrial activities. And those activities are incentivized by government policy, which industry goes out of its way to influence.
A Few of Us Are Way More Responsible for Climate Change Than All of Us
I got to thinking about this because of Rick Heede. He's a geographer who has done the careful work of figuring out how much of the carbon in our atmosphere can be traced back to the coal and oil that companies have extracted from the Earth.
The numbers are head-turning: Two thirds of all industrial carbon emissions come from just 90 institutions. Several of those institutions, including Chevron, ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, and Conoco Phillips, have extracted more carbon from the Earth than most countries.
As Heede put it, the heads of these institutions could fit comfortably in a Greyhound bus. And if you've been paying attention to the climate debate, you know that many of these same companies have spent decades deceiving the public and policymakers about science -- practices that disturbingly continue to this day, despite the scientific risks of climate change becoming ever starker.
So while we all share in the "blame" for climate change, only a few of the 7 billion humans on this planet truly have the power to determine how much more coal and oil comes out of the Earth and how much stays in the ground. The Onion explained this better than I ever could. After Heede's research was published, the satirical news site went with this headline: "New Report Finds Climate Change Caused by 7 Billion Key Individuals." Seems silly, right? But that's effectively what we're saying when we reduce the cause of climate change to "human activities."
Corporate and Government Policies Constrain Our Ability to Make Free Choices
As the climate debate evolves, it may start to look like more like debates we've had -- and are still having -- on public health issues. Too often, those debates have involved conservatives and liberals talking past one another, with conservatives standing up for individual rights and liberals looking to hold corporations that cause public-health problems accountable.
I'm a pragmatist, so those broken debates frustrate me to no end. We can't ignore individual choice and responsibility; at the same time, we also have to recognize that our individual choices are constrained by corporate practices and government laws and regulations. It's wrong for individuals to neglect their personal responsibility; it's also wrong for corporations to stand in the way of government policies that would reduce the harm we face from their products.
Take obesity, for instance. It can be thought of as an individual problem -- overeating and a lack of exercise. But it is also arguably a societal problem caused, in large part, by misguided public policies such as agricultural subsidies that make 100 calories of Doritos substantially cheaper than 100 calories of bell peppers, and by a junk-food lobby that is fighting to keep kids hooked on their unhealthy products.
So who is responsible for obesity? This kid with a cheap bag of Doritos (and, presumably, his parents)?

Or policymakers who continue to subsidize refined grains at the expense of whole foods, usually at the behest of agricultural companies?

Or take smoking. Individuals bear some responsibility for choosing to smoke; tobacco companies also bear responsibility for spending billions marketing an addictive substance and trying to cover up the science linking their products to lung disease.
So where do we assign responsibility for the harm caused by smoking? To these teenagers?

Or to the companies that operate machines capable of churning out millions of cheap, inhalable nicotine-delivery devices?

And who is responsible for climate change?
This energy-conscious kid?

A company digging coal out of the ground in Wyoming?

Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson?

The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee?

The answer is "yes." It should be obvious, though, that the company extracting coal, the CEO planning for a future of more and more oil extraction and the senators we've elected to serve the public interest bear far more responsibility than our young superhero at the light switch.
The Future Is About Better Choices, Not Feeling Guilty About the Past
We were all born into a world that was heavily reliant on coal and oil. Our grandparents didn't know that that these products were causing climate change any more than they knew that smoking was causing lung cancer or that a corn-chip-based diet was unhealthy.
Now we know. That's a gift science has given us.
Solving a problem as big as climate change isn't an activity individual humans can decide to do on their own. We need government to create better ground rules for energy production that account for the climate risks we face. That means we need companies to stop misrepresenting the science. They also need to stop trying to tilt the rules in favor of business models that neglect scientific realities.
My grandparents (pictured above with infant me) were born into a world where corn chips were a treat, smoking calmed your nerves and climate change was what happened when you moved to California.
Our grandchildren can be born into a world where "human activities" don't cause climate change at all because we've figured out how to make clean energy as ubiquitous as fossil fuels are today.
What a gift that could be.
The Vikings may have shed the Erhardt-Perkins offense with the addition of offensive coordinator Norv Turner, but they won't let go of the greater Erhardt legacy, especially when it helps them. Football historians will note that former Pittsburgh Steelers center and current Hall of Famer Dermontti Dawson was the first pulling center the NFL had seen, something he petitioned offensive coordinator Ron Erhardt to allow him to do in a preseason game in 1992. Despite any issues that could have cropped up in the quarterback-center exchange, Erhardt greenlighted it. It changed the game.
Though Sullivan likely won't reach the level of notoriety that Dawson did for his part in innovating NFL run blocking, he deserves consideration as the game's best. The fact that he's been asked to pull this year, just like Dawson, is just one of the many reasons he can provide tools that other centers can not. Beyond that, he's one of the most cerebral and technically sound players the NFL has. Should he play at this level for a few more years, even if he doesn't get the Pro Bowl or All-Pro recognition he deserves (he was awarded All-Pro recognition in 2012), he needs to be a serious contender for a spot in the Hall of Fame.
Before his All-Pro year started, Robert Mays at Grantland profiled why Sullivan is his favorite center:
No matter whom you ask, whether it's coaches or teammates, the first answer anyone gives about what makes John Sullivan exceptional is the same — his mind. Sullivan went to Notre Dame after graduating from Greenwich High School in Connecticut; Musgrave still remembers recruiting him while he was the University of Virginia's offensive coordinator. “He's very sharp,” Musgrave says. “Nothing on the football field surprises John.” That intelligence manifests in Sullivan's preparation. Musgrave says that as Minnesota game plans on Monday and Tuesday, they do so at a graduate level, thanks in large part to his center. “He's able to see the entire defense,” Davidson says. “He knows what to expect based on linebacker location, safety location, different alignments out of the nose guards. All the stuff that he can accumulate over the week, it all means something to him.”
Ask around and that's what you'll hear. The offensive line staff can't get away from how ridiculously intelligent Sullivan is, and his teammates are the same. Brandon Fusco couldn't hide how impressed he was with how intelligent Sullivan is. I asked him what made Sullivan so revered among the staff, and he said “[If] anyone who knew half of the mental side of the game there was in football… It's unbelievable. He knows everything. It seems like he knows when blitzes are coming, what front we're going to get. Where the O-Linebackers are going to be. Where the pressure's coming from at all times. It makes our job, everything so much easier, just having him and his smarts.”
Charlie Johnson said likewise. “He's super smart. Great football IQ. He's able to see things in a defense that I don't think most centers can pick up. He's a guy who's looking beyond the front seven. He'll look at the safety rotations and stuff and he's a technician. You hardly ever see him in a bad position.”
His backup agrees. Joe Berger, who has been in the league with four different teams (the Miami Dolphins twice), says that Sullivan “understands the game the best of of any center I've played with or behind or next to.”
For context, Berger was in camp with 8-year vet Jeff Mitchell, 8-year vet Seth McKinney, 7-year vet and Rimington Trophy winner (given to the best center in college football) Jake Grove, 5-time Pro Bowler and 2-time All Pro Andre Gurode (Berger was with the Cowboys for three of Gurode's Pro Bowl years and one of his All-Pro years), and first-round pick and Pro Bowler Mike Pouncey.
High praise.
Said Berger of Sullivan's study habits, “He's a student of the game, he knows what's going to happen. He studies film. I think that that really helps his game out.”
As Jeff Davidson, the offensive line coach with the Vikings said to Mays, “I hate saying this for a guy that's currently playing for me, but he's one of the best I've ever been around, in that I truly believe that I could walk out of the room and he could run the meetings.”
Obviously, it takes more than a high football IQ to do well. Fusco, noted for his own physical play and aggressive on-field attitude, spoke out in favor of John's physical abilities. While Robert Mays' profile touches on hand strength and leverage, Fusco notes that Sullivan's approach to blocking is distinct from other centers. After talking about Sullivan's football intelligence, the former Slippery Rock center detailed what else makes the Minnesota lineman so great, “He's physical. He's not one of those laid back centers that's going to wait for someone come into him. He's going to attack them and get in their face.
“There are not a lot of physical centers. He's a bigger center in this league. With his size, he's meant to be physical. The way he plays, he has an attitude for it. It makes him a great player.”
Sullivan isn't just noted for his ability to win matches based on his leverage. Consistently around the league, you hear about his hand strength and ability to carry people out of the play. It's difficult to disengage from him, and he'll use players' momentum against themselves.
Fusco said it simply, “I think he's by far the best center.”
This is a fact that has slowly been recognized by people who follow football. Before the 2012 season, John Clayton referred to John Sullivan as a “journeyman” center, a reference not to whether or not he's traveled among teams (he hasn't), but a mediocre make-work talent level. But that year he agreed to a contract extension and earned his All-Pro recognition, though he was already coming off of a season where Pro Football Focus ranked him as the third-best center in the NFL.
In 2012, they gave him top billing.
Though his 2013 was a struggle to start the season, he still ended up as their third-graded center with an incredible second half of the season—one which would have ended up with a 16-game grade that was the best grade a center put together in the past five years and the third-highest in PFF history (stretching back to 2007). Even knowing he had a down year, he graded negatively in only four games. All of that comes with just his after-snap performance—it doesn't even take into account how well he sets up the offensive line.
This all matches Dawson's strengths, but what stood out was his ability to be an effective pulling center. Sullivan is doing that again, after he did it much more often at Notre Dame. His ability to pull and get into space to block is a big advantage. He pulled quite a few times in the Vikings' game against Oakland, and Sullivan was as excited as anybody to install this new wrinkle in the Vikings offense, despite being a little rusty.
“I did it a lot in college. I was really familiar with it. I haven't done it in a while. It's a part of this offense that makes us more dangerous,” he said. When asked if there were issues re-adapting to a scheme that has him pull, particularly in regards to footwork, Sullivan acknowledged the learning curve but dismissed its importance in the long run.
“I need to embrace [it] and that I need to get it done. Ultimately it's about the scheme, not the individual player. Whether or not you're comfortable with what you're doing, you've got to get the job done,” he said. About the footwork he said, “It takes a little bit to get the footwork right and even then it's never perfect. You're constantly having to make improvements. You think you'll have something figured out and then something else goes. That's why we're out here practicing every single day.”
The ability to pull the center is something that coordinators love to have. Grantland noted Chip Kelly's offense doing it as part of a wider set of innovations he's pioneering into the league. While we've seen centers pull before, small wrinkles like these can add up to an even more innovative run offense than the already effective one the Vikings have.
There's a very good chance that who pulls is determined by the front. In stretch plays with a pin-and-pull concept, like the play above seems to be, the center can often make a “me” or “you” call depending on whether or not the nose tackle is playside (in this case, heads up on the center is playside) or on the backside of the play. Against different fronts, you can expect the backside guard (Brandon Fusco in this case) to pull.
There's a lot more involved in this than just whether or not the nose tackle is head-up over the center. As Johnson said, “There's a lot of different things—whether he's covered or uncovered, where the ‘backer is lined up. Depends on the look you get from the defense.”
Sullivan echoed the flexibility that a pulling center provides as a running option. “It's just creating angles on a defense. Generally when you're pulling, it's because there's somebody with a better angle down blocking, and therefore you're walling off a defense in a certain way, just creating running lanes. So as long as you're athletic enough to do it, it's a great option and a great weapon.”
Those leverages are difficult to map out without a blackboard to diagram, but the angles created by the offense against the defense is the biggest reason he's been asked to pull.
Pulling centers is no longer rare like it once was, but adding this to his resume only strengthens his case as the best in the game. The Vikings won't necessarily integrate this into their game once the regular season starts—it's why they practice it—but it certainly makes the team more dynamic.
Recognition is something Sullivan deserves, but it's not something he craves. As Mays wrote:
It isn't in the quality of play from each man but in how that play will be recognized. Offensive linemen are almost universally unheralded, but Sullivan remains the overlooked of the overlooked. After two years as arguably the league's most effective center, he has yet to be selected to a Pro Bowl. He was voted All-Pro by the Pro Football Writers Association in 2012 but snubbed by the AP. Nowhere is the NFL's dispersal of accolades more broken than for interior offensive linemen, where name recognition trumps all else. (An example: Jeff Saturday, who was relieved of his duties as the Packers' center last season, was invited to the Pro Bowl.) For the past two seasons, Sullivan has been its chief victim. Sullivan sounds resigned when discussing it. “I'd love to go to the Pro Bowl,” he says, “but the Pro Bowl system is what it is. When I retire, I'd like to be a guy that my teammates all say, ‘We could count on him.'” It's a platitude, but it's true. A center is responsible for everyone around him.
They said the same of Dawson. For now, Sullivan is fulfilling his responsibility admirably.

It's essential for Pug parents like you to know certain basic factors that determine your relationship with your Pug and can go a long way in training him effectively.
Before you begin training your Pug, it is absolutely essential that you build a loving bond with him. This is important as it helps you to understand his needs and instincts and also allows your Pug to have complete trust in you.
Let us see how…….
How To Bond With Your Pug
Building a bond with your Pug is the first and the most crucial step involved in training him successfully. As soon as you bring your Pug home, you must first try to develop a caring and loving relationship with him in order to win his trust and confidence.
When Pugs are secure in the knowledge that they belong to the family, they are more likely to respond better to their owners' training commands. Just like with any relationship, there must be mutual trust and respect between you and your Pug.
Trust takes time to develop and respect comes from defining boundaries and treating any breach of those boundaries with firmness and fairness.
Without enforceable limitations, respect can't be developed. And when there is no respect, building a bond with your Pug is almost impossible.
Golden Rules To Building A Relationship With Your Pug :
Spend quality time together;
Take him out in the world and experience life together;
Establish and promote a level of mutual respect; and
Develop a way of communicating to understand each other's needs.
Building a bond with your Pug will not only help you manage him better but will also make your Pug calm, quiet and an extremely well-adjusted pet.
Love Your Pug and He Will Love You back
Once you're succesful in building a bond with your Pug, you can rest assured that training him and teaching him new and clever tricks will be a cakewalk.
How Your Pug Learns…
Your Pug's learning period can be divided into five phases:
The Teaching Phase - This is the phase where you must physically demonstrate to your Pug exactly what you want him to do.
The Practicing Phase - Practice makes Perfect. Once a lesson is learnt, practice with your Pug what you have just taught him.
The Generalizing Phase - Here you must continue practicing with your Pug in different locations and in an environment with a few distractions. You can take your Pug out for a walk, or to a nearby park and command him to practice whatever you've taught him.
Practicing the learned lessons in multiple locations and in the presence of small distractions will help him learn and retain lessons better .
The Testing Phase - Once you're sure that your Pug has achieved almost 90% success….he responds correctly almost every time you give a command, you must start testing his accuracy in newer locations with a lot of distractions.
Example: Take him to the local shopping mall and ask him to obey your command. He may not come up with the correct response the very first time you do this, but you must not lose hope.
The idea is to test your Pug to see how he responds in an environment which is new to him. Set-up a situation where you are in control of the environment and your Pug.
There are only 2 possibilities:
Your Pug succeeds!!! (Trumpets please!)
In case your Pug fails, re-examine the situation. Review and/or change your training. Then try testing again.
Keep on testing until he succeeds. Follow the rule of the 3 Ps – patience, persistence, praise.
Internalizing Phase - Finally, comes the extremely rewarding phase where your Pug does everything he is taught to do even without your commands.
Remember:
Never scold your Pug if he fails. It's not his fault. You have failed as a trainer!
You must be patient and persistent for your efforts to show rewards.
Appreciate and love your Pug when he does it right! A little encouragement will work wonders for your Pug.
Pug Training is easy when you do it right.

Anyone with celiac disease quickly learns that the protein gluten is found in wheat, barley, rye – and a whole host of foods, not just cereal-based ones, but packaged products such as malt vinegar, pre-made burgers (as a filler) and soya sauce. But one food that is at least getting a second chance on the gluten-free diet is Avena sativa – the common oat.
Oats do not inherently contain gluten protein, yet they are usually listed next to wheat, barley and rye as cereal grains to be avoided on the strict gluten-free diet. Why is this? The issue has been that oats in the field are commonly grown alongside or in rotation with the gluten-containing grains. It's easy to get cross-contact during growing and harvesting, as well as through transportation on railway grain cars.
For these reasons, it's accepted by experts that “regular” oats are likely to contain gluten and should be strictly avoided by those with celiac disease.
But fortunately, “regular” oats are no longer the only oats available. In recent years, it has become possible to purchase uncontaminated oats and, in the U.S., consumers can now find certified gluten-free oats and oat products. In other words, some manufacturers are now going the distance to ensure the oats remain “pure” and don't get exposed to gluten.
There have been many scientific studies looking at these pure oats and celiac disease. Two recent studies – one focused on introducing oats to the diets of children with celiac disease and the other on the long-term effects of oat consumption in adults with celiac disease – found no harmful effects related to including moderate amounts of pure, uncontaminated oats in the gluten- free diet.
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the national dietitians' organization, has released a position statement on oats confirming that the majority of those with celiac can eat up to 50 grams per day (about half a cup) of gluten-free dry rolled oats without any problems.
However, there is one crucial caveat: a small subset of people with celiac disease will actually react to a protein found in pure oats, known as avenin, just as if they were reacting to gluten. While it's not known how many with celiac disease react to avenin, it's generally accepted that it's a small minority. According to the University of Chicago's Celiac Disease Center, “perhaps fewer than 1 percent of celiac patients show a reaction to a large amount of oats in their diets.”
Unfortunately, there is not yet any clinical test to determine who will react to oats and who will not, so if a decision is made to incorporate oats into the gluten-free diet, there are precautions to follow. Melinda Dennis, a registered dietitian and the nutrition coordinator at the Celiac Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, notes that before anyone adds oats to their gluten-free diet, this should be discussed with a dietitian or doctor. She also stresses only eating the proper kind of oats: “They must be pure, uncontaminated, gluten-free oats, specifically labeled as such.”
The newly diagnosed must ensure they are properly following the gluten-free diet, with all symptoms resolved and blood tests showing normal levels of antibodies associated with celiac disease. Then, the addition of oats should occur gradually, with lots of water intake, while informing the doctor of any symptoms. After three to six months, it's important to follow up with a gastroenterologist.
The increased fiber intake from oats can also result in temporary gastrointestinal symptoms like bloating and gas – which can be confused with celiac symptoms. This is another reason why it's important to incorporate oats into the diet gradually, and in concert with the advice of a dietitian or doctor. Adding pure oats to the gluten-free diet can be a boon to nutrition. Dennis says the grain is a good source of fiber, protein and B vitamins, and can also help to lower cholesterol levels. But beyond the nutritional benefit, being able to cook with oats increases the diversity of the diet, which is always welcome to those avoiding gluten.
At the end of the day, it's up to the individual to decide what's right for his or her diet. Odds are that no problems will occur from eating a small amount of gluten-free oats, and adding them to the diet can boost nutrition and expand meal options. However, if symptoms appear, or antibody levels rise, speak to your doctor. Keep in mind that there are the unlucky few who can't even tolerate pure oats.

The Deficit: The Talk Is Big, But The Number Is Shrinking
The deficit is the nation's annual budget shortfall, the difference between what the government spends in one year and what it takes in. In 2009, '10, '11 and '12, it was huge.
"You look at the president's budget," said House Speaker John Boehner in 2012, "and we've got trillion-dollar deficits for as far as the eye can see."
"We're going to have trillion-dollar deficits for years to come," said former congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul.
"When I first walked through the door," said President Obama in 2010, "the deficit stood at $1.3 trillion, with projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade."
And on it went. For a while it seemed like no one ever just talked about the deficit. It was always the trillion-dollar deficit.
Except that past year, it shrank dramatically. Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former Obama administration economist, explains that reality defies the rhetoric.
"The budget deficit has gone from 10 percent of GDP in 2009 — it was quite high — to about 4 percent of GDP in 2013," Bernstein says.
Like most economists, he prefers to look at the deficit as it relates to the overall size of the U.S. economy.
"That decline is the largest four-year decline in budget deficits since 1950," he says. "So they've fallen a ton."
The Federal Budget Deficit Notes - Congress was on recess in October 2012 and most Augusts.
The reason is a mix of lower spending and higher revenue. The budget sequester is part of it, but only a very small part.
More savings come from older spending cuts, the fading out of the stimulus and fewer people falling into the social safety net as the economy improves. The better economy also raises more tax revenue, and last year's fiscal cliff budget deal ended the payroll tax holiday and added a bit to the tax burden of the wealthy.
The deficit is projected to fall even further this year, perhaps to as low as 3 percent of GDP, and even further the next year. Bernstein says that's what you'd expect: Deficits generally rise in a recession.
"When the economy strengthens they're supposed to get smaller, and guess what: That's what's been happening," he says. "There was never a deficit crisis in the first place."
Oh, yes, there was — and is — says Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C. Duncan says even a smaller annual deficit still adds to the cumulative national debt.
"We're $17.5 trillion in debt and it's climbing every day," he says. "Somebody's going to have to deal with that. I think it's our obligation. If not us, who? If not now, when? We have to deal with the nation's debt."
Duncan and other Republicans also don't like seeing the deficit reduced by tax increases. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., says Washington still needs to deal with the long-term drivers of government spending — rising health care costs and an aging population.
"If we don't, we'll see the deficit back, unfortunately, in very few years to where it was just a couple years ago," Cole says.
The Congressional Budget Office projects the deficit will begin to rise again later this decade. In the meantime, Cole says, Congress will want to put off the painful decisions on Medicare and Social Security.
"It's sort of like when you go on a diet and you lose the first 10 pounds and it's, 'Great, I guess I can go out and splurge tonight,' " he says. "And you find out you really can't. You have to stay at it. We're going to have to get at deficit reduction, which means entitlement reform at some point. Unfortunately, that's something the two sides have not been able to come together on."
Voters are sending mixed signals on the matter. Most would say the deficit situation is getting worse, says Michael Dimock, vice president of research at the Pew Research Center.
"People certainly don't feel like we're making progress on the deficit," Dimock says. "In December, we asked people whether we've made progress in reducing the budget deficit, and only 29 percent said yes. Sixty-six percent said no, we haven't."
Dimock chalks this up partially to confusion about the difference between the deficit and the debt. But also, when budget deficits were huge and growing, they got a whole lot more attention than the shrinking deficit is getting now.
Dimock says that lack of attention may explain why there's been a huge drop in the percentage of people polled who think cutting the deficit should be a top priority.
"It's the biggest drop in public priorities that we saw between last year and this year," he says. "For an issue that had been rising as a concern so consistently, to see it turn down so sharply really does stand out."
It's worth noting that Republicans polled think it is far more important than Democrats. Populationwide, though, reducing the deficit has now fallen below strengthening the economy, preventing terrorism, improving education and protecting social security.
Image: South Australian Zero Waste
As of 1 January 2009, South Australian retailers and shoppers have four months to become accustomed to life without lightweight checkout style plastic bags. The government in that state will as of 4 May 2009 impose fines of up to $5,000 AUD on retailers using that form of bag. Even 100% degradable plastic bags will be banned, as they just break down into smaller plastic shards of plastic anyhow.
Although there were moves for this to be a national campaign (like that of the world first incandescent bulb ban), only South Australia had the balls to follow through on the bags issue. Coincidentally it also the only state in the country to also have a functioning container deposit legislation (CDL) [PDF], whereby beverage bottles carry a refundable deposit (of 10 cents) atop their purchase price, to encourage the return of the container for recycling.The ban applies to all retail outlets in the state and should bag suppliers offer bags to retailers they know to be in breach of the ban those suppliers will face a $20,000 AUD fine. The SA Government suggest that rather than customers getting free bags with their purchases they've been paying up to $15 per household per year to cover the cost of some 37,000 tonnes of plastic polymer derived from non-renewable resources.
Certain bags currently in use are exempt from the ban. These include: ‘compostable' bags that state they meet the Australian Standard, as well as supermarket bags dispensed for loose fruit and vegetables, paper bags, heavier plastic bags as provided by boutique stores, and the now ubiquitous square polypropylene reusable bags.
It is the latter that feature in the associated TV commercial, where the government encourage BYO (bring your own) Bags. South Australian Zero Waste have also dedicated a website to the phaseout, which lists those other governments worldwide with the gumption to also walk this road.

Do you guys need me to announce any picks at the podium tomorrow @VanCanucks ? — Strombone (@strombone1) June 30, 2013
The 2013 NHL Entry Draft is only an hour away, and their is of course a high volume of trade talks and rumours floating around on the draft floor and in the ether. Let's round up the latest ahead of this years marathon, one day event.
Read past the jump.
The Province's Ben Kuzma suspects the Canucks will look to address a lack organizational depth at left-wing with their first round pick today:
…There's a lack of organization depth at left wing with Mason Raymond expected to also tested unrestricted free agency. The Canucks don't have a second-round choice, having surrendered it along with Kevin Connauton at the trade deadline. With new coach John Tortorella looking for more bite and the Canucks drafting bigger centres in Brendan Gaunce, Alexandre Mallet and Joseph Labate, they could use the same amount of size and sandpaper on the left side with their 24th pick — if they don't move up by swapping selections or in a possible Cory Schneider trade.
Derek Jory polled myself, Jeff Angus, Jeff Paterson, John Garrett and Tyson Giutiato on the subject of which players we'd like to see the Canucks target with the clubs late first round pick.
Iain Macintyre focuses on Mike Gillis's underwhelming draft record:
But Vancouver's collection of prospects is ranked 29th among 30 NHL organizations by the Hockey News while the Canucks, eliminated in the first round of the playoffs the last two seasons, have tilted at the draft even farther away from the WHL and its powerhouse sibling, the Ontario Hockey League, since Mike Gillis became general manager in 2008. Heading into Sunday's NHL talent lottery in New Jersey, the Canucks have drafted 30 players in Gillis' first five years. Only five of these players were from the OHL and just two from the WHL — both chosen in 2008. The Canucks also went four years without drafting any B.C.-born player before choosing Victoria Tier-2 junior Wesley Myron in the sixth round last year.
We took a detailed look at Mike Gillis's draft record earlier in the week as well.
On Friday I looked at how the new collective bargaining agreement might impact Vancouver's late round draft strategy:
After last year's draft, while addressing the media, Gillis shed some light on the club's late-round draft strategy: “In the fourth round and beyond we like to select players who are going into a college program to develop for a few more years. It gives you more opportunity and more development time.” Under the 2005 NHL CBA – which Gillis has operated under for the entirety of his tenure through to this most recent season – drafting college bound players was the only way to retain “exclusive negotiating rights” to an “unsigned draft pick” for four years (so long as that player remained a “bona fide student”). Meanwhile teams would only retain the exclusive negotiating rights to international or CHL players for two years. To summarize simply: under the previous agreement, if a team drafted an NCAA player (or an NCAA bound player) they'd receive a longer timeline for which to evaluate that player before deciding to sign him to one of their fifty available contracts. Under the rules pertaining to the entry draft in the 2013 NHL CBA, teams will still retain exclusive negotiating rights to NCAA (or NCAA bound) players aged 18 or 19 for four years, so long as that player remains a “bona fide student.” But there's also a new type of player that teams will retain the exclusive right of negotiation to under the new CBA: international prospects (or in the language of Aritlce 8.6 (d): players drafted from a club outside North America).
Tony Gallagher describes Mike Gillis as "over a barrel" on the Luongo front:
The Canucks have been blithely ignoring the shouting the market has been sending their way with respect to this Roberto Luongo fiasco, and now that they are just flat out running of time, they have decided to listen. What they have to be hearing are some very unpleasant sounds. Presuming they can't make a deal for Lui, the only card left to play is to put him on waivers, and if nobody is biting, the only way they can avoid a ridiculously expensive buyout is to trade Schneider, the very person who started this whole mess by proving he's a better goalie. And judging by the way they are dragging their feet, it sounds like ownership doesn't wants any part of paying somebody not to play or play for someone else, even though it may have been pressure from them that got this deal done in the first place.
Gallagher is tight with Vancouver ownership and management, but I still see no reason to believe that the use of a compliance buyout is a non-starter for the Canucks. I'd also mention that the perception that Vancouver won't use a buy out helps strengthen their essentially non-existent leverage on the Luongo trade front…
Speaking of strengthening non-existent leverage on the Luongo trade front, here's my take on Mike Gillis's Saturday media availability for the Sporting News:
It goes without saying that the Canucks might be in better shape, value wise, were they to retain Luongo while banking whatever Schneider returns in a trade, than they would be with Schneider and the scraps (if that) that Luongo might fetch. Whether or not returning Luongo is a realistic scenario, however, following a calendar year perpetually on the trade block, is a matter of some skepticism. As Sunday approaches, the Canucks and their GM appear to be running in place. The goaltender trade roadshow will hit its second NHL draft, and this time the situation certainly has a more urgent feel to it. Something has to give, and while the Canucks would surely prefer that their intentions remain opaque ahead of Sunday's chaos, what gives will probably still be the something most of us expect.
Finally as rumours multiply about the Canucks stock-piling draft picks, it's the same old song out of Mike Gillis:

What do you expect to go down today? Are you scared? Angry? Excited? Chime in and let us know in the comments!
Earlier this week, President Trump made waves when he announced there would be no deal with the Democrats in the forthcoming budget battle. He increased the swells when he also insisted there would be no tax increases, contrary to Democrats' wishes. On December 8, the government faces yet another partial shutdown unless the president and Congress can agree on a mechanism to fund it through the end of the year.
In response, Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and the handful of other Leftist holdovers in Congress took to the airwaves—yet again—to portray Trump as an irrational leader. Schumer publicly ruminated how it would be better for congressional Democratic leaders to iron out deals with congressional Republicans over both the pending budget battle and the tax reform legislation.
Can you blame them? Trump is running circles around Schumer and the Democrats—to say nothing of congressional Republicans.
What Schumer and the Democrats don't understand is that Trump has already outmaneuvered them. Schumer has no desire to work with Trump because he doesn't know what he's getting. Trump's unpredictability has left the entire political class cowed. The Democrats can only behave as the party of “No!” and the Republicans have no choice but to limp along after Trump, lest they suffer at the polls.
This is good for Trump and even better for America.
How Do You Spell “Deal”?
With a vital midterm election next November, the Democrats will need to hobble the Republicans any way they can. Democratic leaders like Schumer are not open to a deal that concedes any significant ground to the Republicans. They need talking points for 2018. This is why the Democrats continue behaving as though they still have the majority. Trump understands this, which is why he is prodding the Democrats publicly.
In response, Democratic leaders can only argue that the Democrats were really close to making a deal with the Republicans until that nasty man in the White House waded into the discussion (no, they really weren't). Purported “conservative” Democrats promise that a deal can be had—and soon!—so long as Trump and the Republicans meet the Democrats' demands. Democrats think “deal” is spelled s-u-r-r-e-n-d-e-r. And until recently, they were confident that they'd find sufficient numbers of Republicans willing to overlook their novel sort of spelling.
The Democrats are lost. They have no viable candidates going into the 2020 presidential election and as long as the economy continues its astounding GDP growth rates, Trump's supposed low favorability ratings will mean little in either 2018 or 2020. All the Democrats can do is behave as obstructionists—which is what they're doing.
Trump's Non-Ideology
To complicate the Left's narrative, Trump clearly has a set of principles he's following. They just aren't ideological.
Trump's aim is to boost the economy quickly to secure as much economic prosperity for as many Americans as possible. This is not a goal shared by most Democrats. It's not a goal of most Republican leaders, either (unless it's accomplished according to their stated “principles”).
Neither Democrats nor Republicans are used to thinking in terms of the common good anymore. Both factions are more concerned with the interests of their masters; identity groups in the case of Democrats and ideological purists and donors when it comes to the Republicans.
The Democrats should understand that Trump will hold his ground—and even advocate things that most Democrats would favor (such as preventing Republicans from slashing people's 401(k)s to “pay for” their proposed tax cut). Every Democrat should be applauding Trump for bucking his own party's orthodoxy and protecting the little guy, since a 401(k) is still the best middle-class savings program available. Where were the Democrats when Trump stood up to U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) by refusing to support any tax bill that diminished 401(k)s?
Defying Republican Stereotypes
When Donald Trump ran for president, he defied all standards of conventional political logic. Here was a billionaire real estate mogul from Manhattan who had been a nominal Democrat most of his adult life. Yet, Trump ran as a Republican and campaigned against their globalist, free-trade orthodoxy. Trump broke the mold of the classic American political archetype. Republicans were meant to be buttoned-up, detached elites. Democrats were supposed to be hip men and women of the people. Yet, the reverse was true in 2016. As president, Trump continues defying the stereotype of a Republican president.
When Schumer publicly pleads to do a deal with Mitch McConnell and the usual conservative suspects, it's because Schumer knows that he can run roughshod over them. The Democrats understand how to frighten Republican leaders in Washington, D.C.—even when the Republicans have control over the levers of power. With Trump, Schumer and the Democrats don't know who they're dealing with. What they do know is that Trump is going to run roughshod over them.
Trump will not allow the Democrats to set the narrative and box him in (which is why they hate his use of Twitter so much). President Trump will go to the left of Senator Schumer when it suits him, as he did with the 401(k) argument; he will run to the right when he must—always fighting to secure the best deal for the ailing middle-class.
Meanwhile, Trump's moves are confounding the political class, which is why the elites are ratcheting up their personal attacks on Trump, his advisers, and his family—it's all they've got.
United States Supreme Court case
Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case that decided that redistricting (attempts to change the way voting districts are delineated) issues present justiciable questions, thus enabling federal courts to intervene and to decide redistricting cases. The defendants unsuccessfully argued that redistricting of legislative districts is a "political question", and hence not a question that may be resolved by federal courts.
Background [ edit ]
Plaintiff Charles Baker was a Republican who lived in Shelby County, Tennessee, and had served as the mayor of Millington, Tennessee, near Memphis.[1] The Tennessee State Constitution required that legislative districts for the Tennessee General Assembly be redrawn every ten years according to the federal census to provide for districts of substantially equal population (as was to be done for congressional districts). Baker's complaint was that Tennessee had not redistricted since 1901, in response to the 1900 census.
By the time of Baker's lawsuit, the population had shifted such that his district in Shelby County had about ten times as many residents as some of the rural districts. The votes of rural citizens were overrepresented compared to those of urban citizens. Baker's argument was that this discrepancy was causing him to fail to receive the "equal protection of the laws" required by the Fourteenth Amendment. Defendant Joe Carr was sued in his position as Secretary of State for Tennessee. Carr was not the person who set the district lines – the state legislature had done that – but was sued ex officio as the person who was ultimately responsible for the conduct of elections in the state and for the publication of district maps.
The state of Tennessee argued that the composition of legislative districts was essentially a political question, not a judicial one, as had been held by Colegrove v. Green'[2], a plurality opinion of the Court in which Justice Felix Frankfurter declared that "Courts ought not to enter this political thicket." Frankfurter believed that relief for legislative malapportionment had to be won through the political process.[3]
Decision [ edit ]
The decision of Baker v. Carr was one of the most wrenching in the Court's history. The case had to be put over for reargument because in conference no clear majority emerged for either side of the case. Associate Justice Charles Evans Whittaker was so torn over the case that he eventually had to recuse himself for health reasons. The arduous decisional process in Baker is often blamed for Whittaker's subsequent health problems, which forced him to retire from the Court in 1962.[4]
The opinion was finally handed down in March 1962, nearly a year after it was initially argued. The Court split 6 to 2 in ruling that Baker's case was justiciable, producing, in addition to the opinion of the Court by Justice William J. Brennan, three concurring opinions and two dissenting opinions. Brennan reformulated the political question doctrine, identifying six factors to help in determining which questions were "political" in nature. Cases that are political in nature are marked by:
"Textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department;" as an example of this, Brennan cited issues of foreign affairs and executive war powers, arguing that cases involving such matters would be "political questions" "A lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it;" "The impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion;" "The impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government;" "An unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made;" "The potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question."
Justice Tom C. Clark switched his vote at the last minute to a concurrence on the substance of Baker's claims, which would have enabled a majority which could have granted relief for Baker. Instead the Supreme Court remanded the case to the District Court.
The large majority in this case can in many ways be attributed to Justice Brennan, who convinced Potter Stewart that the case was a narrow ruling dealing only with the right to challenge the statute. Brennan also talked down Justices Black and Douglas from their usual absolutist positions to achieve a compromise.[5]
Dissent by Justices Frankfurter and Harlan [ edit ]
Frankfurter, joined by Justice John Marshall Harlan II, dissented vigorously and at length, arguing that the Court had cast aside history and judicial restraint, and violated the separation of powers between legislatures and Courts.[6] He wrote:
Appellants invoke the right to vote and to have their votes counted. But they are permitted to vote and their votes are counted. They go to the polls, they cast their ballots, they send their representatives to the state councils. Their complaint is simply that the representatives are not sufficiently numerous or powerful.
Aftermath [ edit ]
Having declared redistricting issues justiciable in Baker, the court laid out a new test for evaluating such claims. The Court formulated the famous "one person, one vote" standard under American jurisprudence for legislative redistricting, holding that each individual had to be weighted equally in legislative apportionment. This affected numerous state legislatures that had not redistricted congressional districts for decades, despite major population shifts. It also ultimately affected the composition of state legislative districts as well, which in Alabama and numerous other states had overrepresented rural districts and underrepresented urban districts with much greater populations.
This principle was formally enunciated in Reynolds v. Sims (1964). The Court decided that in states with bicameral legislatures, as had Alabama, the state in this suit, both houses had to be apportioned on this standard. This voided the provision of the Alabama Constitution which had provided for two state senators from each county and similar provisions elsewhere. (Similarly, the Tennessee Constitution had a provision that prevented counties from being split and portions of a county being attached to other counties or parts of counties in the creation of a legislative district. This was overridden under the principle of basing districts on population. Today counties are frequently split among districts in forming Tennessee State Senate districts.) "One person, one vote" was first applied as a standard for Congressional districts. State legislatures were supposed to redistrict according to changes in population but many had not for decades.
Baker v. Carr and subsequent cases fundamentally changed the nature of political representation in the United States, requiring not just Tennessee but nearly every state to redistrict during the 1960s, often several times. This re-apportionment increased the political power of urban areas with greater population and reduced the influence of more rural areas.[7] After he left the Court, Chief Justice Earl Warren called the Baker v. Carr line of cases the most important in his tenure as Chief Justice.[8]

I've committed a terrible crime. I don't agree with a government policy.
My name is Mark Rogers but you might know me as “Grandpa Mark”. I'm a retired computer software programmer and I'm being threatened with legal action by the Australian government.
Over the past few years, I've felt more and more worried about what the government is doing to our health system. Cuts to pathology and diagnostic imaging that affect the most vulnerable. The freeze on the Medicare rebate pushing up costs for GPs and other health professionals, and reducing bulk billing as costs rise. Not to mention the billions of dollars have been cut from grants to hospitals.

Then there are the myths being propagated by our politicians – that Medicare is unsustainable, that Australia's public health system is bloated and inefficient, and that charging people more to see their primary health professionals will save Australia money. These myths and political spin sway the outcome of elections while the future direction of healthcare is not properly discussed or the options fully understood.
And finally, there are the areas of healthcare that should receive more public attention. Like, why does our government underwrite health insurer's profits through the private health rebate? And why is our government pursuing international treaties that would lead to higher prices for medicines and allow foreign investors to sue the Australian government in secret tribunals if the government enacts new public health laws?
I see a stronger Medicare building a better future for Australians. That's why I decided to build my “Save Medicare” website back in December 2014, after attending a meeting of people worried about the future of Australia's healthcare. I wanted my website to bring together important facts and detailed analysis in one place. I wanted to prompt a proper discussion on the direction of healthcare in this country and give people links to further action. I wanted to expose the hidden war being waged on our Medicare, that is slowly corroding universality and access.
Australia spends 9.5% of its GDP on healthcare. The Unites States of America spends 17.7% of its GDP on health care with poorer outcomes and not all the population are covered. The USA relies heavily on the private market for health care.
Most OECD countries have adopted publicly funded universal health care because they believe it is the most efficient means of delivering high quality health care for the whole population. Furthermore, Medicare is a driver for future Australian prosperity. A free universal health system like Medicare reduces inequality and that benefit boosts national growth. Despite this, the current Australian government (and other Australian decision makers) are pursuing strategies to adopt a more privatised system.
Experts agree private health insurance is broken. But how can it be fixed? Read more
My website gets a bit of traffic, but if the Save Medicare Sydney community group doesn't hold a rally and hand out flyers then the hits dwindle. That all changed on Wednesday before last, when I received a letter from the office of the Australian government solicitor. The letter said that I am not allowed to use the word Medicare, or the Medicare green and gold on my website. It threatened court and “damages” for my efforts to prompt a public discussion about what the government is doing to Medicare.
I don't have the actual true Medicare logo on the website, just the same colours with the words Save Medicare. I can't see how any thinking person could think I am pretending to be Medicare, or that I am marketing something for personal profit. I'm being pursued like I'm producing and selling a counterfeit product through Aldi or Coles. But the truth is I'm trying to build the brand of Medicare rather than diminish it. It is the government which has threatened Medicare by cutting billions of dollars out of it.
This is a serious situation for me and my family – we own our own home and have some superannuation, but I can't afford to fight the government myself. But imagine the precedent it would set if I were to back down. For example, imagine if an opponent of WestConnex couldn't register a domain name referring to the very project that they're opposing? That's why I've decided to keep my website up, despite the legal threats – and continue to spread the truth about what this government is doing to Medicare.
If you can take a moment, check out the website (www.savemedicare.org) and judge for yourself if you think it's a threat to Medicare. If you think it isn't, raise your concerns with your local federal MP – because today it is me, but tomorrow it could be you.

A few points are awarded to the top five finishers on the stages and race leaders but riders who sacrifice themselves for their leaders and their teams, rarely score points.
“It's very unbalanced because the points system does not give anything to those who finish further down the classification. They should set it up so it provides a much broader range of points,” the Katusha rider told Cyclingnews.
“The winner shouldn't finish the season with 600 points, he should finish with 15,000. That way a team worker who gets 300 or 400 will have something to offer, in terms of points, to a squad.”
Rodríguez cited the case of Joost Posthuma, the Dutch rider retired at the end of this season partly because he did not have any points to offer a WorldTour team.
Posthuma was part of the 2011 Leopard Trek line-up for the Tour de France team which put both Andy and Fränk Schleck on the final podium behind Cadel Evans. However, his important role as a domestique was of little value in a system which puts UCI points as one of the most critical factors in any team's bid for the WorldTour.
“Posthuma didn't get a team because he didn't have any points, it's a total disgrace,” Rodriguez said. “They should triple or quadruple the points value and increase the number of riders that get points up to the guy who finishes thirtieth. Or if somebody wins, then his team-mates should automatically get some points as well.”
A finisher on the podium both of the Giro and the Vuelta, as well as the winner of the Tour of Lombardy and Fleche Wallone, Rodríguez topped the UCI WorldTour individual ranking with 692 points, 91 more than the runner-up, Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins (Team Sky).
Rodriguez also gained points in the Tour of the Basque Country, Tirreno-Adriatico and the Clásica San Sebastian, whilst Wiggins took points in Paris-Nice, Romandie and the Criterium du Dauphiné.
Rodriguez hopes that the UCI will change the points scoring system during next spring's series of summit meetings called after the long series of doping scandals and Lance Armstrong's suspension and loss of his seven Tour de France victories.
“Given they want to sort out all kinds of things there, this should be on the list of their priorities as well,” Rodriguez said.
Below you will find an extremely powerful and inspiring speech by Chris Hedges. The award winning journalist has been ahead of the curve on many issues of national and global importance, including being one of the earliest critics of the Iraq war. Chris has an unshakable moral compass and a passion to match it. He has been a shining light in a sea of darkness and cowardice when it comes to public figures speaking truth to power, including having led the charge to sue the Obama administration on the right to imprison American citizens without trial.
Thank you for all you do, Chris.
Here is Chris Hedges' infamous comparison of two frightening visions of the future...
The two greatest visions of a future dystopia were George Orwell's “1984” and Aldous Huxley's “Brave New World.” The debate, between those who watched our descent towards corporate totalitarianism, was who was right. Would we be, as Orwell wrote, dominated by a repressive surveillance and security state that used crude and violent forms of control? Or would we be, as Huxley envisioned, entranced by entertainment and spectacle, captivated by technology and seduced by profligate consumption to embrace our own oppression? It turns out Orwell and Huxley were both right. Huxley saw the first stage of our enslavement. Orwell saw the second.
We have been gradually disempowered by a corporate state that, as Huxley foresaw, seduced and manipulated us through sensual gratification, cheap mass-produced goods, boundless credit, political theater and amusement. While we were entertained, the regulations that once kept predatory corporate power in check were dismantled, the laws that once protected us were rewritten and we were impoverished. Now that credit is drying up, good jobs for the working class are gone forever and mass-produced goods are unaffordable, we find ourselves transported from “Brave New World” to “1984.” The state, crippled by massive deficits, endless war and corporate malfeasance, is sliding toward bankruptcy. It is time for Big Brother to take over from Huxley's feelies, the orgy-porgy and the centrifugal bumble-puppy. We are moving from a society where we are skillfully manipulated by lies and illusions to one where we are overtly controlled.
...
The corporate state does not find its expression in a demagogue or charismatic leader. It is defined by the anonymity and facelessness of the corporation. Corporations, who hire attractive spokespeople like Barack Obama, control the uses of science, technology, education and mass communication. They control the messages in movies and television. And, as in “Brave New World,” they use these tools of communication to bolster tyranny. Our systems of mass communication, as Wolin writes, “block out, eliminate whatever might introduce qualification, ambiguity, or dialogue, anything that might weaken or complicate the holistic force of their creation, to its total impression.”
The result is a monochromatic system of information. Celebrity courtiers, masquerading as journalists, experts and specialists, identify our problems and patiently explain the parameters. All those who argue outside the imposed parameters are dismissed as irrelevant cranks, extremists or members of a radical left. Prescient social critics, from Ralph Nader to Noam Chomsky, are banished. Acceptable opinions have a range of A to B. The culture, under the tutelage of these corporate courtiers, becomes, as Huxley noted, a world of cheerful conformity, as well as an endless and finally fatal optimism. We busy ourselves buying products that promise to change our lives, make us more beautiful, confident or successful as we are steadily stripped of rights, money and influence. All messages we receive through these systems of communication, whether on the nightly news or talk shows like “Oprah,” promise a brighter, happier tomorrow. And this, as Wolin points out, is “the same ideology that invites corporate executives to exaggerate profits and conceal losses, but always with a sunny face.” We have been entranced, as Wolin writes, by “continuous technological advances” that “encourage elaborate fantasies of individual prowess, eternal youthfulness, beauty through surgery, actions measured in nanoseconds: a dream-laden culture of ever-expanding control and possibility, whose denizens are prone to fantasies because the vast majority have imagination but little scientific knowledge.”
Our manufacturing base has been dismantled. Speculators and swindlers have looted the U.S. Treasury and stolen billions from small shareholders who had set aside money for retirement or college. Civil liberties, including habeas corpus and protection from warrantless wiretapping, have been taken away. Basic services, including public education and health care, have been handed over to the corporations to exploit for profit. The few who raise voices of dissent, who refuse to engage in the corporate happy talk, are derided by the corporate establishment as freaks.
...
The façade is crumbling. And as more and more people realize that they have been used and robbed, we will move swiftly from Huxley's “Brave New World” to Orwell's “1984.” The public, at some point, will have to face some very unpleasant truths. The good-paying jobs are not coming back. The largest deficits in human history mean that we are trapped in a debt peonage system that will be used by the corporate state to eradicate the last vestiges of social protection for citizens, including Social Security. The state has devolved from a capitalist democracy to neo-feudalism. And when these truths become apparent, anger will replace the corporate-imposed cheerful conformity. The bleakness of our post-industrial pockets, where some 40 million Americans live in a state of poverty and tens of millions in a category called “near poverty,” coupled with the lack of credit to save families from foreclosures, bank repossessions and bankruptcy from medical bills, means that inverted totalitarianism will no longer work.
...
The noose is tightening. The era of amusement is being replaced by the era of repression. Tens of millions of citizens have had their e-mails and phone records turned over to the government. We are the most monitored and spied-on citizenry in human history. Many of us have our daily routine caught on dozens of security cameras. Our proclivities and habits are recorded on the Internet. Our profiles are electronically generated. Our bodies are patted down at airports and filmed by scanners. And public service announcements, car inspection stickers, and public transportation posters constantly urge us to report suspicious activity. The enemy is everywhere.
...
“Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating?” Orwell wrote. “It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery and torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself.”
James Charles (Facebook)
When 17-year-old James Charles was named the first male ambassador for CoverGirl this month, the company's message was simple: “All of our CoverGirls are role models and boundary-breakers, fearlessly expressing themselves, standing up for what they believe and redefining what it means to be beautiful,” the makeup brand said in a press release. “James Charles is no exception.”
But one mother did take exception to the brand's inclusive message, penning an article for the Homeschool Conservative lamenting the impact a male CoverGirl had on her 6-year-old son.
“Mommy, why doesn't daddy wear makeup,” 6-year-old Mark reportedly asked his mom Sarah.
“Both of us were caught off guard, we didn't know how to answer,” Sarah wrote. “I don't know why, but the most logical thing we could think of at that moment was to say, ‘No, that's a girl.'”
When it became apparent that Charles is in fact a male, she told her kid, “Daddy doesn't wear makeup because makeup is for girls.”
“Well why is that boy wearing makeup?” her son pressed Sarah wrote about the “moral dilemma” generated by her child's inquisitive nature:
“Do I lie to my son? Or do I tell my 6-year-old my full opinion? I thought about lying and saying, ‘That's how his eyes really look.' Or, do I tell the truth and have a deeper discussion with him? Maybe, ‘That's the way his mommy and daddy chose to raise him. But, that's not the way we are choosing to raise you.' Does a parent end it there? Or continue to say, ‘That is sinful and wrong. He shouldn't be doing that, and his parents are wrong.'”
Sarah wrote it's “a shame” she and her husband cannot “take [their] eyes off our son for a single second.”
“Thank god we homeschool,” the mother added.
Sarah said she's now forced to find a new makeup brand because she “can't support” CoverGirl's latest GoverGirl. She noted that the company's decision to include a male in makeup makes her “hesitant to let [her son] go over to a friend's house.
“Our world is headed in a direction where my 6-year-old son is having to grow up so much faster than I want him to,” Sarah wrote.

“I don't think Christianity or religion had to do anything with him killing people,” Ms. Heu added. “If it really did have something to do with it, when he came in, first he would have asked every single body to say what their religion was before he started shooting them.”
The gunman never approached Ms. Heu. Lying face down in the front of the huddle, the blood of fellow students pooled beneath her, she said, she thought she appeared to be dead. “The only thing I could think of was: Just be calm,” she said. “Try not to make your chest go up and down so high. Because he's going to realize that you're still alive and he's going to make you stand up. And you stand up — that's it.”

Had the gunman asked, Ms. Heu would have told him that she is not a Christian. Her family practices Hmong shamanism.
At some point, the gunman handed a package to 18-year-old Matthew Downing and instructed him to deliver it to the police.
For reasons that remain unclear, the gunman exited the classroom. When the police arrived at 10:44 a.m., Mr. Harper-Mercer stood in the doorway of the building, then moved outside, firing at two officers. Detective Sgt. Joe Kaney and Detective Todd Spingath of the Roseburg police had arrived without bulletproof vests; they fired three rounds. One lodged in the gunman's side, the police said.
Mr. Harper-Mercer, 26, then returned to the classroom, where he fatally shot himself. Mr. Downing, the student entrusted with the envelope, shouted for a student to kick the weapon — or weapons — away from the gunman's hand. The police later recovered six guns and copious ammunition from the school.

Ms. Heu sprinted out of the room. She entered a men's bathroom, she said, but was repelled by what she saw there: a long gun on the ground in the stall for the disabled, and a bag with its zipper open. She ran out of the building; Mr. Downing followed.
Creating the illusion of extra inches when armed only with the clothes on your back may seem like a tall order. But by tailoring your wardrobe (in some cases, literally) to suit your stature it's possible to piece together outfits in a way that helps both you, and your style credentials, reach new heights.
Stylist Freddie Kemp, from online style counsel provider Thread, is on hand with the long and the short of it.
Make The Cut
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but a lot of clothes providers cannot be relied upon to cater to everyone's needs – namely, yours. But just because it doesn't fit off the peg doesn't mean you need to leave it on the rail. Befriending a local tailor is the best way to make your favourite purchases work for you.
The reason? There are certain clothes lengths and proportions that work best for shorter blokes. “A blazer, for example, should finish just below your bum in length and the sleeve should finish with 1/2 inch of shirt cuff showing,” explains Kemp.
“For smart shirts, sleeves should finish just below your wrist, any longer and it could swamp you,” he continues. Fingers crossed your tailor will realise this too; if not then use these recommendations as a litmus test of quality and take your business elsewhere.
Not Your Bag
Streetwear hypemen look away now. Wearing baggy clothes like longline T-shirts and skate hoodies is doing nothing for your lofty ambitions. “You don't want anything oversized or too big as this will only emphasise your stature,” says Kemp.
Opt for slim or straight fits instead. You might miss out on the next Yeezy drop, but at least you don't have to spend the night camping in Soho with a crew of 15-year-olds (and their mums, obviously).
Tone Down
Try to keep your outfits tonal rather than resorting to block-colours worn on top and bottom. “By avoiding anything too contrasting you create a continuation of colour down your body, which can help to give the illusion of a longer frame,” explains Kemp.
This is, however, not an excuse to deploy your triple denim, Canadian tuxedo. Woah there, cowboy etc.
Feet For Inches
Step away from the Cuban heels. Instead, selecting the appropriate footwear is a classic case of less is more.
“Prioritise low-top silhouettes like brogues or Oxfords rather than boots or high-tops, which cut your legs down to make you look shorter,” says Kemp.
Tonal soles offer the same lengthening effect as your clothing, while thicker lug or commando soles not only exceptional grip but can also add a welcome inch to your overall height.
Along The Right Lines
OK, so it's probably the advice you've heard a hundred times before, but in this case that's because it works. Avoid horizontal stripes (apologies to those Bretons amongst you) because they make you look broader.
“And so it follows that vertical stripes make you look taller,” Kemp continues. “Although it goes without saying that you should avoid overdoing this with vertical stripes on top and bottom [unless it's a suit, of course].” A good vertical stripe shirt like a blue and white striped button-down Oxford shirt is a wardrobe must-own.
Tips For Tuck
Sartorial advice for short men is not universally effective. An important distinction must always be made between guys with different body proportions; work out which part of you is longer and this will guide your choices.
“If you have longer legs and a shorter torso, keep your shirt untucked to elongate your upper half,” advises Kemp. This works the other way around, too: if you have a longer torso and your legs are on the short side, tuck in your shirt.
And what to wear on your bottom half now? “Again, it's all about proportions. If your legs are long and your torso is short, then shorts can look great,” says Kemp. But short legs are broken up and further shortened by shorts. If needs must then be sure to wear them on your waist, not hips, to give your legs an extra couple of inches.

Some lucky whale watchers in Dana Point, CA were treated to an amazing display of a dolphin superpod! There was an about 2,000 dolphins participating in the stampede as they collectively worked together to form a mob to gather food. Dolphins are smart creations and some species have actually developed socially communal and cooperative hunting practices, meaning they've figured out that searching for food in larger numbers is better and more efficient than doing it alone.
Dolphins normally live in pods with up to a dozen members, but groups of them will work together to hunt as seen in the footage. Events like this communal food gathering normally has more than 1,000 members and this particular superpod is “probably determined by the number of dolphins able to be sustained by the school of prey,” according to Animal Planet News.
The tale of 2014-2015 is one that differs significantly from 2013-2014 despite little change in the roster. The main pieces were still in place for the Sharks during both seasons but the results were completely different. San Jose went from a 111 point team to an 89 point team. The idea the Sharks needed to ‘take a step back' I'm sure didn't include a 22 point drop in the standings with almost the same roster.The Sharks possession was almost the complete opposite this season from what it was the previous year.The dip from December – March torched most of the Sharks 2014-2015 season. They didn't play anywhere near the great hockey they played in the previous season.For the year, Marleau and Couture dropped around 3% CF each while Joe Thornton and Joe Pavelski remained within 0.04% and 0.18% of their previous season totals. Those are your major minute players for the Sharks up front and the struggles of the second line had a major impact on the Sharks forgettable season. The impact trickled down to the defenders with Vlasic and Braun suffering as a result because Marleau and Couture are the forwards they play the most 5v5 minutes with.The 2014-2015 Sharks spent only two months above 53% compared to the five months the 2013-2014 Sharks spent above that mark. By the time this year's Sharks got themselves back up above 53% - April - it was too late. They were a capable team that didn't always ice the ideal lineup, but the real hindrance on possession was the struggles of guys like Marleau, Couture and Wingels.The Sharks shot under league average in each of the last two seasons. It made little impact on the 13/14 season because possession was so strong and they could afford to be slightly below average shooting because they had average goaltending and a great possession game. This year when the Sharks received below average shooting and average goaltending there was nothing to save them. They weren't playing strong hockey and couldn't compensate for missing numbers. The difference was 0.4% at 5v5 - on the lower end for this year, which didn't help.Shooting percentage in general is full of luck. The 0.4% difference might seem trivial just looking at the small number but that 0.4% of worse luck cost the Sharks 8 goals over their 1960 5v5 shots on goal – the difference in being in the bottom 10 for 5v5 GF and being smack dab in the middle. San Jose took nearly 200 more shots in 13/14 and shot more successfully at a higher percentage – which placed them in the top five 5v5 GF. That goes back to possession – they gave themselves a better opportunity in the offensive zone. San Jose went from being the 5th highest scoring 5v5 team to the 9th worst when the drop shouldn't have been that significant had they not struggled in possession as dearly.The Sharks 5v5 save percentage for 13/14 was 92.2%, for 14/15 it was 92.0% - barely any difference. The Sharks tenders did basically what they did the year before – come in slightly below the league average.Without the significantly better possession game, the below league average numbers hurt a lot more. More luck in the shot percent department or above average goaltending and the Sharks would have been able to outrun the possession numbers and get into the playoffs – but everyone would have known they weren't a contending team at the end of the day based on what they did for possession.The end result of all this is that the Sharks can get back to being a playoff team with a possession fix. The goaltending isn't going to get much better based on who is available unless they make a trade. The shooting percentage is luck driven and can't drop much more – only three teams shot worse at 5v5 than San Jose. If you're going to be an average team shooting and in goal then you need a strong possession game if you want to compete. The foundation of a strong possession game gives you a chance for luck to even out.Providing certain players can get their game back to a higher level the Sharks will be alright as long as the coaching staff – whether it's McLellan or someone else – can settle down with in-game management and trust what works. Do they still need a boost on defence? Sure they do, but they need Couture's line to get the job done as well or they're going to struggle to get back to the post-season.Thanks for reading.
Fewer than 100 Al Qaeda in Afghanistan: CIA chief
Updated
CIA director Leon Panetta has estimated there are only 50 to 100 Al Qaeda militants operating inside Afghanistan, as US forces work to "flush out" mastermind Osama bin Laden.
Mr Panetta said US forces had killed or captured at least half the Al Qaeda leadership, making the terrorist group the weakest it has been since the 9/11 attacks.
"We continue to disrupt them. We continue to impact on their command and control," he said.
"We continue to impact on their ability to plan attacks in this country."
The spy chief estimated Al Qaeda's numbers have shrunk dramatically in Afghanistan.
"[Al Qaeda] is probably at its weakest point since 9/11 and their escape from Afghanistan into Pakistan," he said.
"I think at most, we're looking at maybe 50 to 100, maybe less.
"There's no question that the main location of Al Qaeda is in the tribal areas of Pakistan. If we keep that pressure on, we think ultimately we can flush out bin Laden."
Mr Panetta said bin Laden remained "in very deep hiding" in a tribal area in Pakistan surrounded by tremendous security and that the Taliban is "engaged in greater violence right now".
"They're doing more on IED's (improvised explosive devices)," he said.
"They're going after our troops. There's no question about that."
Mr Panetta admitted the war in Afghanistan was taking much longer and was much harder than anyone anticipated.
At the end of the deadliest month in Afghanistan for allied forces, Mr Panetta said progress was being made but there are still serious problems with governance and corruption.
"The key to success or failure is whether the Afghans accept responsibility and are able to deploy an effective army and police force to maintain stability," he said.

It's finally here. Google and Samsung have jointly unveiled the Samsung Galaxy Nexus Android phone, the first smartphone to run the latest 4.0 "Ice Cream Sandwich" version of Google's Android operating system. So, when can Aussies get their hands on it?
• All about the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
• Ice Cream Sandwich: The most delicious Android yet
• The best upcoming smartphones in 2011
Google and Samsung revealed the Galaxy Nexus will be available in "November" but specific Australian pricing and availability was not announced. Going off previous deals, the Galaxy Nexus is likely to be sold by at least one Australian carrier — Vodafone exclusively sold both the Nexus One and the Nexus S in Australia, albeit for a short period of time. However, there has been no confirmation that the Galaxy Nexus will be officially sold by an Australian carrier at all, even if this is pretty likely.
Rather than wait for a carrier to release the Galaxy Nexus, it's possible to get one earlier in Australia if you buy outright. This is made possible by what is called grey importing, also called parallel importing. A grey import tech product is one that is imported from another country without the permission of the intellectual property owner, in this case Samsung and Google. This can be achieved by an Australian business that buys the product overseas and then sells it online, or simply an International business that will ship the product to Australia.
Is a grey import Galaxy Nexus different to the Australian model?
As it's a "Pure Google" phone, the differences between an Australian model (if it emerges) and an imported model will be minimal, if there are any at all. The main difference is likely to be carrier branding, often in the form of a telco logo when you turn the phone on and some shortcuts to telco services in the app drawer. In other words, you won't be missing much at all if you import the Galaxy Nexus.
How many models of the Galaxy Nexus are there?
There are officially two models of the Galaxy Nexus around the world: a HSDPA+ model and an LTE-capable model, both coming in 16GB and 32GB sizes. The HSDPA+ model is the one you want to use in Australia — it will work on all Australian networks including Telstra's 850MHz Next G network and the 900MHz and 2100MHz networks used by Optus and Vodafone. The LTE version of the Galaxy Nexus is likely to operate on the 700MHz band used by US carrier Verizon Wireless, meaning it probably won't work on Telstra's 1800MHZ 4G LTE network. Details on the LTE version are sparse: Samsung says an LTE version will be available "depending on the region".
Keep in mind that the Galaxy Nexus does not have a microSD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory. Take this into account before you decide to purchase the 16GB model. We recommend the 32GB model if you're undecided, though this model appears harder to find than the 16GB one.
Where can I purchase the Galaxy Nexus?
You can order the Galaxy Nexus online from a variety of Web sites including both Australian and International ones.
Australian online stores
The Galaxy Nexus is likely to eventually be sold through a number of Australian stores, but one of the more reputable is MobiCity. It currently lists the 16GB version of the Galaxy Nexus for $829 and has it available for pre-order now. It is expected to ship on Monday 7 November, so you should receive it a few days later. MobiCity has just the 16GB model at this stage, although you will take on the 32GB version if and when it becomes available.
MobiCity is slightly pricier than other alternatives, but it does offer a 12 month Australian warranty. This is not a Samsung or Google warranty, but is serviced by a company called Australian Warranty Services. The basic warranty that comes with any MobiCity purchase includes replacement within the first 48 hours if the product is dead on arrival (DOA), an assessment guarantee within 48 hours of receipt and a repair guarantee within 30 days. MobiCity also says that a replacement device will be offered if it is unable to repair the Galaxy Nexus within the guaranteed timeframe.
Kogan also sells the Galaxy Nexus. It lists the 16GB model for $799 plus delivery. Curiously, the dispatch date is marked Sunday 30 November, but Kogan says "it will very likely be a number of weeks before this."
Expansys lists both the 16GB and 32GB versions of the Galaxy Nexus for pre-order but does not provide a price for either. Expansys offers a one year limited repair warranty and promises a full refund or replacement if the device is found to be faulty within 14 days
Other Australian online stores that sell imported smartphones like Millenius, dMavo and Techrific don't currently list the Galaxy Nexus but are likely to sell it in the near future.
International online stores
Australian sites aside, there are also a number of international sites who will ship the Galaxy Nexus. Two of the most popular are the UK pair Handtek and Clove. Handtek lists both the 16GB and 32GB models of the Galaxy Nexus, but only provides a price for the former. You can order it for £419.99 plus £26.90 for shipping down under totalling £448.89 — around $687 Australian dollars at the time of writing.
Clove only lists the 16GB model of the Galaxy Nexus. Interestingly, it says that the 32GB model won't be released in the UK. Whether this will be the same story in Australia is unknown. You can buy the Galaxy Nexus from clove for £429 plus £24 for shipping which totals £453 — around $692 Australian dollars at the time of writing.
Other legitimate sites that will ship the Galaxy Nexus to Australia are SG Best and Unlocked Mobiles.

The repressive U.S. state apparatus that defends the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie over the multinational working class is doing everything in its power to keep the angry masses from coming out in the streets to reject Donald Trump — the new face of global capitalism — including Jan. 20, the day he is inaugurated.
Besides the police, Department of Homeland Security, FBI, CIA and more, the media play a big role in this apparatus. The mainstream press have historically and politically never been on the side of heroic resistance by the workers and the most oppressed because they have been controlled by big business interests.
If there were 5,000, 500 or even 50 activists marching on the socialist government in Havana, Cuba, demanding a capitalist system, you can bet your life that the bourgeois press would provide day-to-day coverage, interviewing activists and featuring their demands widely. This would be mainly because an attack against Cuba serves the interests of people like Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
As it stands, the bourgeois press were unwilling even to tell the general public that J20 Resist was selling affordable bus tickets to Washington, D.C. The press coverage on J20 organizing is consciously vague and sparse, drumming up acrimony against the protesters before the march even begins by painting pictures of resistance against Trump in D.C. as being potentially violent and pointless. The state is planning to shut down D.C. on J20 to keep out anti-Trump activists but not pro-Trump supporters.
Using repression to stop resistance
This reflects the media's overall strategy of silence toward the brutal murders of young Black and Brown people by police and the horrific brutality experienced by Indigenous activists at the hands of both cops and mercenaries at Standing Rock. The U.S. has more than 9,000 nuclear warheads in its arsenal to threaten the world and the most people in its prisons.
The ruling class has decided, correctly, that if the entire country and the rest of the world knew what was really happening in the heart of the empire, they would not stand for it much longer. Most bourgeois journalists would quite simply be out of a job.
While the media yawn at the mass resistance or blame Russia for Trump getting elected, the DHS has announced an unprecedented level of so-called “security” (aka violence baiting) around the J20 inauguration, aimed mainly at stamping out and mitigating a great potential level of resistance. This is a gross violation of the right to assemble and free speech under the U.S. Constitution.
The DHS has announced that buses will not be allowed to drop protesters off near Metro stations, not only in D.C. but in Maryland and Virginia as well. Instead, buses are supposed to drop off people near RFK Stadium, which is a 2-mile walk to the Capitol where Trump will be sworn in.
The Jan. 21 women's march in D.C., mainly targeting Trump's misogyny but also supported by Democratic Party forces, is not expected to face as much hostility and scrutiny compared to J20 when the whole world will see Trump take office. Close to 300 other J21 women's marches will take place in every U.S. state.
Notwithstanding the high level of technological surveillance being used for J20, in the long run, intimidation will prove no match for the millions of furious people in the streets who will be ready to fight back beyond J20 against the increased volume of racism, sexism and anti-immigrant hatred the Trump regime will bring.

Wireless providers in Canada are making more revenue per gigabyte of data than in any other country, according to a new report.
Telecom research firm, tefficient, released its 14th analysis of data usage across 32 countries, including Canada. It found that Canadian carriers charge the most for data, while consumers make limited use of it.
"The most expensive mobile data countries are Canada, Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic and the Netherlands and — as a consequence — mobile users in these countries are using very little mobile data," the company said in its report.
In countries where unlimited or very generous mobile data plans are available, the company found that usage is higher.
In Finland, where half of users have unlimited data at some of the least expensive prices, average usage is the highest, the report said. A Finnish operator, DNA, has the highest average usage in the world, at 9.9 gigabytes per month.
The industry group that represents wireless providers in Canada, the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association, argues that prices for data in this country are competitive.
It points to a recent report by the CRTC that shows the cost of a package that includes between 2 GB and 5 GB per month is $46.47. That's less than the United states at $50.68 and Japan at $51.81. However, the same coverage in Italy is available for about a third of the Canadian price ($14.35), and similarly in France ($14.98), Australia ($15.57), and the U.K. ($17.61).
The CWTA also pointed to the quality of wireless service in Canada — saying things like 4G/LTE networks increases usage and value for consumers.
"What we find when looking at the available data is that usage is more directly correlated to network quality," said Marc Choma, vice-president of communications for the CWTA.
Data caps discourage usage
Advocacy group OpenMedia says tefficient's findings line up with their own.
"When people pay more for data, they use less of it because they're worried they're going over their data cap and incur these crazy, huge overage fees," said Katy Anderson with Open Media, who has helped campaign to end data caps.
"Once you lift those data caps we see that people use the internet in such creative and neat ways, and they're not self-censoring themselves," said Anderson.
Anderson suggests more competition between providers in Canada would help bring down prices and ease data limits.
Gentleness is part of Dr. Kjetland's nature. A 49-year-old stepmother of five, she watches like a mother over the girls in her study. She ordered that extra rooms be built where they can cry if they test positive for H.I.V. She tries to make sure the boys in their schools never realize she chooses only sexually active girls. And she has KFC delivered, since it is a treat for girls who often have only cornmeal mush to eat for days on end.
Though trained in Norway, she has spent most of her life in Africa, growing up in Tanzania as the eldest of a missionary couple's six children, attending prep school in South Africa, and, after college and medical school in Norway, doing graduate work in Malawi and Zimbabwe.
An estimated 200 million Africans have had schistosomiasis. Although it is rarely fatal, the bleeding it causes in children can lead to anemia, stunted growth and learning problems. It is caused by tiny worms that live in freshwater snails and emerge with pointed heads that can penetrate the skin of people collecting water or washing clothes.
Once inside, the worms mate, with the female living in a cleft in the male's body “like a hot dog in a bun,” Dr. Kjetland said. Most nest in the urinary tract — bloody urine is the classic symptom — but a portion end up in the vagina, creating “sandy patches” of damaged tissue and calcified eggs.
Studies by Dr. Kjetland in Zimbabwe and South Africa and by Dr. Jennifer A. Downs of Weill Cornell Medical College in Tanzania have shown that women with the patches are about three times as likely as their neighbors to be infected with H.I.V.
A gold standard study to prove the connection would be both impractical and unethical: Researchers would have to divide hundreds of infant girls into two groups, give half deworming drugs and half placebos, wait until they were perhaps 20 years old, and see how many had H.I.V. No ethics board would approve placebos under those conditions.
With its coffers empty and its financial moves restricted by U.S. sanctions, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government is facing a nightmarish scenario with the approach of Halloween, when a series of debt payments totaling more than $3.5 billion are due.
Analysts said the government will do everything possible to make the payments, even if it means further cuts in already reduced food imports, which would deepen shortages in a country where a majority of people cannot get three meals a day.
But a default cannot be ruled out because of the precarious state of the country's finances, the low level of reserves and the reluctance of strategic allies like Russia and China to continue lending money to Venezuela.
The Venezuelan government faces a string of small payments due this month, such as the $28 million owned by the state-owned Caracas electricity company.

“The truly hellish week will come around Halloween, the 27th, when they basically have to pay $1 billion and then Nov. 2, when they will have to pay another $1.2 billion,” said Russ Dallen, managing partner at Caracas Capital.
Holders of Venezuelan bonds already face an “existential crisis” because of doubts about the government's ability to pay the $3.526 billion required over the next six weeks, added Antonio De La Cruz, executive director of the Inter American Trends consultancy.
Standard & Poor and Fitch already rank Venezuela as a country “with a high probability of default” in the next six months, because it lost most of its access to international credits as a result of sanctions imposed by the Trump administration that ban the sale of Venezuelan bonds in the United States.
De La Cruz predicted the government will do everything possible to avoid a default this year because Maduro and his aides are convinced that they will not be able to remain in power if they default.
“They need to push this off to 2018,” De La Cruz said. “For 2018, they expect a recovery in the price of oil and a drop in the debt burden, compared to what it was this year.”
Those two factors could generate an additional $11 billion cushion for the government and give it much more room for maneuvering.
De La Cruz said he would not be surprised to see Maduro make further cuts in imports, currently already at just over 20 percent of the $60 billion mark in 2012.
The cuts have already pushed millions of Venezuelans to the edge of famine, in a country where domestic production collapsed under the weight of a government long hostile to the private sector.
But the government could also decide to suspend all imports of food and medicine, De La Cruz added.
“They have demonstrated that they do not care about the well being of the people if it risks their hold on power,” he said.
The government has averted default in recent months because of timely loans from the Russian government, which so far has always seemed ready to provide the millions of dollars needed by its foundering Latin American ally.
But Dallen said he was not sure whether the Russians would be willing to come to the rescue again.
“The Russians are not very happy,” Dallen said, noting a report in June that Venezuela had failed to make a $1 billion payment due to Moscow.
One billion dollars may not look like much in the United States, but it's a lot for Russia, said Dallen, who often consults with Washington officials on Venezuelan affairs.
The Russians may well be approaching the point of concluding that continuing to invest in Venezuela is too risky, he added.
Hedwig and the Angry Inch Has Raised $400K for LGBT Youth
The Broadway musical has made another major donation as part of its charitable partnership with the Hetrick-Martin Institute.
Hedwig likes kids?
Producers of Hedwig and the Angry Inch on Broadway have announced another major donation as part of its charitable partnership with Hetrick-Martin Institute, "the nation's oldest and largest organization helping gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and questioning youth to reach their full potential."
The $200,000 donation brings the total raised by the show for HMI to $400,000 in less than a year.
Since its first performance on March 29, 2014, the musical has donated a portion from each ticket sale to HMI, home of the Harvey Milk High School, a New York City public transfer school where at-risk youth can learn without fear of physical or emotional attacks.
Hedwig's relationship with Hetrick-Martin Institute began with the 2003 tribute album Wig in a Box: Songs From and Inspired by Hedwig and the Angry Inch, which benefited HMI, and the 2006 film Follow My Voice, a documentary about the Harvey Milk High School and the making of Wig in a Box.
"Hetrick-Martin Institute has always been a part of Hedwig's DNA and I'm thrilled HMI is able to join Hedwig on her journey to Broadway," wrote producer David Binder in a previous statement. "Our cast, creative team, and my fellow producers have been overwhelming in their support of this initiative benefiting this inspiring and incredibly important organization."
Michael C. Hall stars in the Tony-winning musical as Hedwig, a fictional East German rock singer living as a female after botched gender-reassignment surgery, through Sunday. Hall took over the role from Andrew Rannells, who had replaced Tony winner Neil Patrick Harris.
John Cameron Mitchell, who created and starred in the original off-Broadway production of Hedwig, will return to the role beginning January 21 for an eight-week limited engagement.
The Broadway premiere of Mitchell and Stephen Trask's 1998 cult rock musical, which won the Tony for Best Revival of a Musical, officially opened April 22, 2014, at the Belasco Theatre and has recouped its investment. The original cast recording is now available.

On October 17th, 2016, the real Julian Assange was removed from the Ecuador Embassy in London and traffic camera photos posted at http://reddit.com/r/whereisassange prove it. The world has seen these CIA kidnappings before. They are called renditions. details provided in below links). At the same time Julian was cut off from the internet and Wikileaks was compromised. Since then, Wikileaks has been operated jointly by the CIA/NSA as part of their Operation Mockingbird project - to be a honeypot trap to identify government leakers and potential whistle blowers. (About Project Mockingbird: http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKmockingbird.htm)
But scrutiny from 1.2 million Twitter accounts and 17,000 redditors at Where is Assange forced them to create the Pamela Anderson ruse and most recently this recent interview with Sean Hannity.
BUT There is still no VERIFIABLE proof of life people. Radio and video interviews mean absolutely squat. We now have 3rd generation real-time voice duplication technology and RGB video technology used by Disney and the CIA. People have posted examples of it. See http://cereproc.com and listen to the celebrity voices that have been duplicated. The professional version of this software with double the sampling rate is used by the CIA. It will fool your own spouse friends. In fact a faked telephone call using this technology was used to put Julian's mom at rest to keep her calm and preventing her fromspeaking to the media.
Even live radio and video interviews can still be spoofed. Only if Hannity himself visited face to face with Julian and asked for a cutting of his hair, a drop of blood, or a oral swab for DNA comparison, his fingerprints, and a random handwriting sample, could we have indisputable proofof life. Now you know why the Hannity interview was not done live in London at the Ecuador embassy.
The coup of WIkileaks is thus far the CIA's greatest accomplishment in this century and they will spend millions to keep up the facade.
Do you remember when Snowden said Osama Bin Laden is still alive and Jim Stone agreed with him. People scoffed at them, except Ron Kessler - the author who wrote SECRETS OF THE FBI. Kessler got the FBI director to admit on record that the fingerprints of the Osama they dumped in the sea did not match his official fingerprints. Welcome to the world of spyware and craftwork. It is a grand game of deception, and right now we are all being deceived with this Sean Hannity and Pam Anderson ruse.
If you still doubt what technology can do, go to Disneyworld and watch the "Walt Disney interview" that Disney & Pixar tecnichians made with Walt Disney for their 50th anniversary a couple of years back and you will ask "How does Walt Disney age so well?" In reality, Walt died over 25 years ago and he has been fabricated with technology that you can try first hand at the OP link.
Here is another example of how technology can fool people so easily: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2773135/Has-Julian-Assange-broke...
BTW... Do you think the real Julian Assange would stop releasing the promised leaks of John Kerry, Huma Abedin, The Clinton Foundation, pizzagate, and the "Treason files" he said were onthe way? And the Ecuador government said on October 17th that the internet cut was a "temporary arrangement" made to avoid influenecing the U.S. elections. Fair enough. But the elctions have been over for a month already. Why has the internet connection not been restored? Because Julian is no longer a guest at the embassy.
After 911 we were all fooled with the fake Bin Laden video tape produced by the CIA but it took more than two years for people to realize that was not the real Bin Laden in the tape - remember (the ear lobes did not match and NSA analyst Jim Stone leaked the news). Do not be duped yet again.
JULIAN ASSANGE WAS RENDERED ON OCTOBER 17th, 2016. There are 39 items of evidence at whereisassange sub reddit. Look at the timeline after you read this and understand that a media black out is in place. http://yournewswire.com/julian-assange-extradited-guantanamo-express/
And the reason Julian was so rudely snatched away before the elections is because he was about to reveal the biggest government crime in history friends: http://www.opnlttr.com/letter/julian-assange-wikileaks-was-about-expose-...
Two whistle-blowers (Kurt Sonnefeld and Bruce Gorcyca) have been exiled to hide this and a third, presidential aide John Wheeler (also a veteran SEC investigator) was murdered less than 2 months after recording a call with Hillary Clinton about this subject. See this about the bizarre murder of FBI informant John Wheeler. https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/4hmck6/first_of_si...
BTW... Gorcyca was also an FBI informant but says the FBI did not want to hear about Saudis connected to 911 even after his lawyer had this letter and audio video tapes delivered to the FBI Director within one week of 911 by FedEx (FedEx archives confirms the package was delivered)
https://bruceslawsocietycomplaint.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/img121.jpg https://bruceslawsocietycomplaint.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/img122.jpg
Take note of the names listed at the bottom of page two. The source for this letter is from two court files on Canada and New York Eastern District Federal Court in case no. C37836 in Ontario Court of Appeals and in a Habeas Corpus motion filed by Bruce Gorcyca before Judge Jack Weinstein back in 2007, and an official Law Society complaint against a lawyer named William Gilmour.

Here is the Kurt Sonnefeld corroboration: http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/murder-suspect-kurt-sonnenfeld-ext...
Still not convinced? Try these and the go apologize to the truthers we all mocked ten years ago. They were trying to tell us the truth! The Saudi press themselves along with 27 retired CIA agents and former German Defense Minister agree with Senator Bob Graham that 811 was indeed and inside job, and Julian Assange was only days away of proving it through emails of Huma Abedin. http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2016/05/22/saudi-press-u-s-blew-up-wo...

We have all just been victimized by greatest CENSORSHIP tactic in American history. 1984 book author George Orwell must be spinning in his grave at 1,000 rpm right now.
Schultz is a former second-round pick of the Anaheim Ducks and has the type of potential that makes scouts drool. When teams get a player with Schultz's skill they tend to hold tight. But this summer Schultz could hit unrestricted free agency before playing his first NHL game.
Thanks to a loophole in the CBA , the young defenceman can become an unrestricted free agent this summer, as he is a college player yet to sign an NHL contract four years after being drafted. All Schultz has to do is walk away from his senior year at Wisconsin and he will be able to choose where he plays in 2012-13.
The Ducks have until shortly after the draft to sign Schultz. If they do not, which in all likelihood they won't, Schultz can talk with any team in the league, although he can't officially sign a deal until July 1st.
Blake Wheeler went through a similar situation in 2008 after the Phoenix Coyotes failed to sign him, despite taking him fifth overall in 2004, and the Boston Bruins were the benefactors.
Location will be key in the upcoming negotiations. Schultz can now choose where he plays hockey. Instead of having the option of signing with one team, Schultz can choose between 30.
TSN's Darren Dreger has stated that every single team will have interest in Schultz, which is unsurprising because he isn't like most NCAA free agents; he's a former second-round pick and a highly touted prospect. Hockey Prospectus ranked him 10th in their most recent prospect rankings and had this to say about him:
“Schultz looks filthy good every shift he takes for Wisconsin and he clearly doesn't belong in college anymore. His ability to make plays at both ends and control the game is pretty high end .”
He has been compared favourably to Jake Gardiner, but is believed
Pronman , an independent scout who writes for ESPN, says to possess slightly better offensive and defensive ability. He is a tremendous skater and has good offensive instincts. He sees the ice very well and knows when to jump into the play. Corey, an independent scout who writes for ESPN, says he projects as a top-pairing defenceman
“Justin, his ability to quarterback the power play and get his shot through either with his velocity, his accuracy or he has the ability to take a little bit off of it, what we call a smart shot, that is the right shot at the right time[...] I think this year his ability to control the game and all aspects with and without the puck may have separated him a little bit , and the fact that he has that unbelievable work ethic and competitiveness that goes along with that skill: That makes him special.”
Schultz is a two-time WCHA Defensive Player of the Year and led all NCAA defenceman in scoring this season with 16 goals and 44 points.
, this should translate to about 40 points over an entire season in the NHL. Of course, there will likely be an adjustment period for Schultz before he starts putting up those numbers, just like Jake Gardiner had before putting up offensive numbers with the Leafs during the second half of his rookie season. However, Behind the Net would have also predicted Gardiner to finish his first season in the NHL with 33 points in 82 games, which is exactly the rate he was scoring, so 40 points may not be an unreasonable expectation for Schultz. Schultz has scored at over a point-per-game pace in his last two seasons at Wisconsin, and according to Behind the Net , this should translate to about 40 points over an entire season in the NHL. Of course, there will likely be an adjustment period for Schultz before he starts putting up those numbers, just like Jake Gardiner had before putting up offensive numbers with the Leafs during the second half of his rookie season. However, Behind the Net would have also predicted Gardiner to finish his first season in the NHL with 33 points in 82 games, which is exactly the rate he was scoring, so 40 pointsan unreasonable expectation for Schultz.
Plus, as if that wasn't attractive enough, after completing his entry-level deal, Schultz will be a restricted free agent, despite already having hit unrestricted free agency at such a young age. Schultz won't become an unrestricted free agent until he turns 27 in 2017. That means he will be under team control for four years.
Oilers . The fit with Edmonton would be great, as it is a young, dynamic team, and Schultz would get a lot of playing time on a relatively thin back-end. At this point it is pure speculation as to where Schultz will land. On TSN's The Quiz segment, Bob McKenzie stated he thought Schultz would sign with the Edmonton. The fit with Edmonton would be great, as it is a young, dynamic team, and Schultz would get a lot of playing time on a relatively thin back-end.
Schultz would be a good fit with the Oilers and they would improve tremendously if they could sign him, but Edmonton has a very poor track record of signing desirable free agents. If money is equal between teams players rarely ever sign in Edmonton. To put it bluntly, Edmonton just isn't a nice city to live in. It gets wickedly cold and there isn't very much to do outside of watch/play hockey. That's why Edmonton's focus has always been building through the draft. Schultz fits the mold of the young, highly talented, and controllable player they would draft, but because this is a UFA signing, I'm not sure Edmonton is a legitimate front-runner.
Some have also suggested Schultz may want to sign in Vancouver because he is originally from West Kelowna , B.C. It's important to note, however, that people said Wheeler became a free agent because he wanted to sign with his hometown Minnesota Wild, and he ended up in Boston. People are sometimes too quick to make a connection between a player's hometown and where they will sign, when usually this doesn't happen.
The connection to Toronto is interesting. Schultz was initially a second-round pick by Brian Burke when he was still GM of the Ducks, so there is a familiarity there. Plus, when Burke traded Francois Beauchemin to the Ducks he was initially pressing for Schultz coming back the other way. It was only after being rebuked that he settled on Jake Gardiner, which has worked out nicely as a consolation prize. Accordingly, you can be sure Burke will press hard for Schultz, especially because the defence has been a disaster during his tenure in Toronto.
Burke already has a solid track record of signing some of the most sought-after atypical free agents. He signed Tyler Bozak , who was one of the most hyped college free agents at the time, and Jonas Gustavsson , who was a player with a long line of suitors as he was recognized as the best goalie not playing in the NHL.
Another thing working in the Maple Leafs favour is that they already have Schultz's former Wisconsin teammate, Jake Gardiner. Apparently the two are quite good friends and Gardiner may be able to convince him that Toronto is a good place to play.
One thing working against the Leafs is that they have a crowded blueline , at least at the moment. If Schultz is looking to step in right away Edmonton is probably a better fit. However, Gardiner was down on the Leafs depth chart heading into the season, and the Leafs scratched Cody Franson and put Keith Aulie in the minors to make room for Gardiner after an excellent camp. Burke can cite this as a reason why a full depth chart shouldn't scare Schultz away from Toronto.
More importantly, after a year in which the team gave up a ton of goals, the blueline is probably in for an overhaul this summer, which would open up a spot for Schultz. Right now, the three defenceman most likely to start the season for Toronto are Dion Phaneuf , John-Michael Liles (because he just signed an extension), and Gardiner. There are no real guarantees apart from those three, and even Gardiner could see his name dangled in trade talks if the Leafs are serious about obtaining a No. 1 centre. Burke will try anything possible to rid himself of Mike Komisarek, while Luke Schenn , Cody Franson , and Carl Gunnarsson could all be potential trade bait as well.
At this point, no one really knows where Schultz will sign, and anyone who says he is leaning one way is just making an educated guess. It's highly probable that every team will make an offer to Schultz, although some teams will pursue him more doggedly than others. What is known, however, is that whoever lands Justin Schultz is getting one hell of a steal .
JustinBut like Wheeler before him, Schultz isn't becoming an unrestricted free agent for money. Schultz must still sign an entry-level deal, which means there will be no real financial bidding war between teams. The maximum contract Schultz can sign is for two years at $925,000 a year with a $92,500 signing bonus. Schultz will undoubtedly have performance bonuses worked into his contract as well, so the max he can earn per season is $3.725 million.Wisconsin men's hockey head coach Mike Eaves had a lot of positives to say about Schultz in an interview with The Badger Herald Teams are getting a rare chance to add a second-round pick, already developed—what essentially amounts to a high-quality, NHL-ready prospect—and it won't cost a single asset from their team. It will only cost money.In the same segment of, Aaron Ward said Schultz would end up with Detroit and Marc Crawford said Toronto.
The president of the Baltimore police union on Thursday said that criminals have become "empowered" following the recent unrest and that, with six officers charged in Freddie Gray's death, city police are more "afraid" of being arrested than shot on duty.
Gray, 25, died a week after suffering a severed spinal cord and other injuries in police custody. His death led to more than a week of protests and later rioting, that prompted a citywide curfew and the deployment of the National Guard.
"The criminals are taking advantage of the situation in Baltimore since the unrest," said Gene Ryan, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3. "Criminals feel empowered now. There is no respect. Police are under siege in every quarter. They are more afraid of going to jail for doing their jobs properly than they are of getting shot on duty."
The union released the statement on Twitter a day after the officers charged in Gray's death filed a motion to have the trial moved out of Baltimore. Police commissioner Anthony W. Batts apologized to the union Monday night for putting officers in harm's way.
Ryan said Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, who charged the six officers, had "essentially overturned" Illinois v. Wardlow, a 2000 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. In that case, it was ruled that two Chicago police officers who chased a man in a known drug area and found a handgun in his bag did not violate the fourth amendment.
Mosby declined to comment on the union president's claims.
"I refuse to litigate this case through the media," she said in a statement from her spokeswoman. "We want to ensure we are able to conduct a fair and impartial process for all parties involved."
Three officers were originally charged with false imprisonment, a charge that was later removed. All six were charged with reckless endangerment in a grand jury indictment.

Migrants and refugees stand in line in freezing temperatures to receive food as they wait to cross the border from Greece to Macedonia near Idomeni on Jan. 21. (Sakis Mitrolidis/AFP/Getty Images)
The back door to Europe may be closing.
A historic wave of migrants fleeing war and poverty crossed into Western Europe last year from the Middle East and beyond, with most taking a precarious route via Greece then onward through the Balkans. While the onset of winter has slowed the tide of newcomers, more than 2,000 a day are still arriving.
Yet from the Greece-Macedonia border to Austria and Germany and northward to Denmark and Sweden, a domino effect is taking shape as nations in Europe suddenly move to keep more migrants out. It happens as Europe's plan to manage a humanitarian crisis remains in disarray and a surge of new migrants is expected as soon as March.
Increasingly, nations are taking matters into their own hands, putting up policies aimed at cutting the migrant flow and weeding out all but those most at risk from war. This is taking place amid rising security fears in Europe after the terrorist attacks in Paris by assailants that included militants who disguised themselves as migrants, as well as hundreds of sexual assaults in Cologne, Germany, on New Year's Eve in which asylum seekers are among the suspects.
“We are in a period of unprecedented anti-migrant, anti-foreign sentiment, in which everybody sort of retreats in their own circle and says, ‘No one can come in,' ” said William Lacy Swing, director general of the International Organization for Migration.
Advocates of stricter controls insist national steps are the only way to curb new arrivals in the face of Europe's failure to manage the crisis. Countries across the region have said that many of the migrants who arrived last year — as well as many of those coming now — are not genuine asylum seekers and have no legal right to stay.
[Along the migrant trail, pressure grows to close Europe's open borders]
Now, countries are taking steps unilaterally to prevent migrants from arriving. Alarmed by the vast numbers of arrivals, Sweden and Denmark imposed fresh controls this month on what were once open borders. In an effort to reduce the number of arriving migrants, Sweden — the nation that last year received more asylum seekers per capita than any other in Europe — is barring entry to travelers entering without proper documents.
On Tuesday, Macedonia — the key entry point for migrants leaving Greece and traveling to the rest of the European Union — shut down its southern border. That move came after a decision in November to grant transit only to Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis. Macedonia briefly reopened its border Thursday, but it limited passage to a few hundred nationals from those three war-torn nations who also pledged to seek asylum only in Austria or Germany.
The border was quickly closed again, however, amid fears that Macedonia might soon begin allowing only families and women to pass. Mersiha Smailovic, spokeswoman for the pro-refugee group Legis, based in Skopje, said Macedonian authorities told her organization Thursday that “single men” would not be allowed in — a policy she said would force thousands of male asylum seekers to hire smugglers or would leave them stranded in Greece.
“This is against the Geneva [Conventions] and Macedonian law,” she said. “We might see concentration camps [in Greece] with only single young men, like in the Bosnian War or World War II.”
On Thursday, aid workers said that Greek officials on the Macedonian border were canvassing thousands of waiting migrants about their destinations and nationalities. Officials from Doctors Without Borders warned that the new restrictive policies could lead to a repeat of last spring's humanitarian crisis, before Macedonia began granting migrants temporary transit visas.

“People are confused,” said Gemma Gillie, who is working with Doctors Without Borders on the Greece-Macedonia border. “There is definitely a tense atmosphere because some people, including many children, have now been waiting for days. . . . It is a strange mix of fear and exhaustion. It is very cold.”
[German chancellor pledges crackdown on criminal asylum seekers]
Still, migrants continue to attempt the crossing from Turkey — a journey made more perilous in the winter by frigid Aegean waters. On Friday, at least 45 people, including 17 children, drowned after two boats capsized near Greek islands, rescue officials said.
Indefinite controls
Stricter guidelines have also been instituted in Germany, the nation whose open-door policy made it by far the single largest destination for migrants last year. German authorities are still letting in thousands of migrants each week, but they have begun blocking a number in the low three figures each day. They are refusing entry, for instance, to anyone who wants to claim asylum in European countries farther north or those who admit to fleeing their homelands for economic reasons.
At the same time, Chancellor Angela Merkel, the architect of Germany's open-door policy, is under increasing pressure to do an about-face. On Tuesday, 44 lawmakers from her center-right coalition demanded she take further steps to curb new entries. It happened as critics said that any country that did not take such steps would be the one left with unwanted migrants on its doorstep.
“One country after the other is turning away from the open-border policy,” said Stephan Mayer, a national lawmaker from the Christian Social Union, Merkel's coalition partner. “Germany also needs to change directions as quickly as possible when it comes to its refugee policy.”
On Thursday, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière said special controls on the Austrian border — initially meant to be temporary — would remain in place indefinitely.
“We will send back people who do not have valid entry documents and do not apply for asylum in Germany,” de Maizière told German radio.
Neighboring Austria, meanwhile, is in the midst of an even tougher crackdown. Starting Friday, Vienna says it will block migrants who are not seeking to make immediate asylum claims in either Austria or Germany.
Interior Ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundböck said that Austria would not base its decisions on migrants' nationalities. But Austrian police officials said they have standing orders to allow only Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis to travel through Austrian territory. Migrants from other nations would need to apply for immediate asylum in Austria or they will be forced to go back to Slovenia.
This week, Austria is set to complete a 2.3-mile fence at a key migrant entry point on its border with Slovenia. Austrian officials on Wednesday also announced new caps on asylum seekers, but they characterized these more than “guidelines” than as firm figures.
[The big thing missing from Europe's solution to the refugee crisis? Refugees.]
Failing scheme
The measures come at a time when Europe is trying, and failing, to create a working system to manage the migrant crisis, with leaders scrambling for a solution ahead of a planned summit in February and before an expected surge in arrivals this spring.
Facing opposition from a bevy of nations, Europe's scheme to legally bring in migrants thus far has failed. Out of an intended total of 160,000 asylum seekers, the European Union has legally relocated 331. E.U. officials are still pressing for a system that compels even nations highly resistant to migrants — including Hungary and Poland — to accept them.
At the same time, a plan to create new “hot spot” zones, or large processing centers, in entry nations Greece and Italy is behind schedule and plagued by political infighting. Greece and Italy have balked at the notion that asylum seekers might need to wait out application processing within their territories.
“We have six to eight weeks” to solve the problem, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told a panel in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday.

Today's coverage from Post correspondents around the world
Turkish military forces deployed in northern Iraq for a year may be attacked by the Iraqi army if they intervene in the battle to liberate Islamic State-held Mosul, Iraqi officials and commanders of Shia militias told Middle East Eye.
Turkey has deployed hundreds of troops armed with heavy weaponry to the Iraqi town of Bashiqa, 12 kilometres northeast of Mosul, the largest Iraqi city held by IS.
Baghdad has protested several times against the troop deployment and has demanded their immediate withdrawal from Iraqi territory – a request that has fallen on deaf ears.
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said on Thursday that no one has the right to object to the Turkish military presence in Iraq. He stressed that the troops are not an occupying force, adding: "No one has the right to object Turkey's presence in Iraq when the country is fragmented that much.
"It is obvious that the regional administration in northern Iraq and the Barzani administration had asked for [Turkey's] support and sought help from Turkish troops, especially for training their local forces to rescue Mosul," he said, referring to the Kurdish Regional Government.
The presence of Turkish forces is welcomed by most Iraqi Kurdish and Sunni factions, for whom Turkey balances the Iranian presence in Iraq, politicians and analysts told MEE.
The Shia-led central Iraqi government and Shia militias think that Turkey has deployed its troops outside Mosul to "provide the required facilities for IS fighters and get a foothold inside Mosul, under the pretext of protecting the Sunnis," a senior Shia militia commander told MEE on condition of anonymity.
'Regional war'
As the launch of the operation to liberate Mosul approaches, tensions between the two sides have escalated.
Last week, the Turkish parliament approved a proposal to extend the presence of Turkish forces in Iraq for another year.
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi responded late on Tuesday by warning of a “regional war” if Turkish forces were to militarily intervene in Mosul.
"The Iraqi government seeks to make clear that there is absolutely no role for Turkish forces in the Iraqi sphere,” a senior Iraqi security official told MEE on condition of anonymity.
"Any movement or intervention by Turkish forces (deployed in Iraq) during the military operations (to re-take Mosul), would be faced with a very strong response," the official added.
Iraqi officials interviewed by MEE said that the Iraqi government is trying to deal with these "occupation forces" through political and diplomatic channels.
Iraq's foreign ministry summoned the Turkish ambassador to Baghdad on Wednesday to deliver a strong rebuke.
On Thursday, Iraq requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council "to discuss the Turkish takeover of Iraqi territory and interfering in its internal affairs,” a statement issued by the Iraqi foreign ministry read.
"We are still working on this with the international community, but if ongoing US-led international efforts fail to convince or force Turkey to withdraw its troops from Iraq, then all options will be on the table - including the military one," the senior Iraqi security official said.
Iraqi security forces are being backed by both a US-led international coalition and by the Iraqi-state sponsored coalition of mainly Shia militias known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces – established by the government in June 2014 to regain territory lost to IS.
Iraq has clawed back more than 70 percent of the territory it lost to IS two years ago, which amounted to a third of Iraq's total territory at the time.
'Occupation force'
Several prominent Shia militias, including Badr, Asaib Ahl al-Haq and Kattaib Hezbollah-Iraq, represent the core of the Popular Mobilisation Forces.
They have threatened to target the Turkish forces if they "insist on staying in Bashiqa or extend their presence in Mosul".
"The presence of these troops (on Iraqi territory) is illegal and against the will of the Iraqi government, parliament and people,” Ahmad al-Assadi, the spokesman for the Popular Mobilisation Forces, told MEE.
“We consider them an occupation force and we will deal with them on this basis,” he said. "As long as they are seen as occupiers, we have a right to adopt all available means to deal with the occupiers.”
Assadi confirmed to MEE that "attacking" the Turkish forces is one of the options being considered by Iraqi forces to deal with the Turkish presence.
Mosul is Iraq's second-biggest city in terms of population and is the most culturally diverse - home to many of Iraq's religious and ethnic minorities, including Christians, Yazidis, Shia Turkmen, Shia Shabak, and Kurds - until it was captured by IS militants in June 2014.
IS and its sympathisers in Mosul and other Iraqi cities have killed, displaced, and taken captive members of minorities in these areas and taken their property, viewing them as polytheists.
The successful liberation of Mosul would be the Iraqi army's greatest victory since it collapsed in dramatic fashion in summer 2014.
It would also end the "IS legend" in Iraq, analysts said.
"Liberating Mosul would be a moral rather than a military achievement for the Iraqi army, which needs to remove this setback from its records," Abdulwahid Tuama, an independent Iraqi political analyst, told MEE.
An archaeological dig is currently underway at Malcolm X's former home in Roxbury. Malcolm X, the famed civil rights activist, lived on Dale Street with his half-sister, Ella Little-Collins in the 1940s.
The dig will last for two weeks, hoping to unearth artifacts before the Collins family begins to restore the historic home.

Interview Highlights
On the focus of the dig
Joseph Bagley: Because we've got such a short time to be on the site — we're only going to be here for two weeks — we're trying to focus all of our energy on finding as much as we can of things that will tell us the story of the property.
We're working with Rodnell Collins who owns the house and grew up with Malcolm in the house about places on the property where he and his family did things — like picnicked or where they had their rabbits and various parts of the property that they used — but then we're also using the radar to see if there are things underground ... So we're using the radar and the oral history to pick the best spots to focus all of our energy for next week which is when we actually do the below ground testing.
On what they've found so far
We've done a little bit removal of soil ... We found pieces of Ella's China set that she had for the family. There's actually a hutch still in the house that would have held all the family's dishes. And we're finding pieces of that. And we found a toy that Rodnell grew up with that he was using in the yard. ... We found a penny from 1952 which is when the family would have been living there, and Malcolm would have been listing the property as his home address.
We're finding some really interesting things, but then we're also finding some really bizarre things, like we just found a piece of ceramic from the 1740s. We're not sure why it's there. It could be from the farm that was here well before the property got developed. It could be that Ella collected antiques. We're still working on some of the details.
On how the site varies from the other Boston-area landmarks
Normally, on the sites that we've been doing, they've been a lot older, there's no way around that ... [We] very rarely have the opportunity as archaeologists to work with people who were alive during the time that we are interested in studying. So it's almost like we get kind of a behind-the-scenes tour of our own historic sites when we have the family members there. We're able to take the combination of the oral history from Rodnell and his family, the written records that we have through the census and the deed records and the stuff that we have about Malcolm that's very widely written, and we can also add the artifacts to that. So we can kind of do a three-part historical view of this house.
And the other reason why we're doing it is, it's now or never. If we don't do this dig, the site will be gone, so in this case we can't afford to wait until Malcolm becomes a more, even further back in time historical figure, like we would on Paul Revere's house or John Hancock's properties. We just can't afford to wait.
... We have done a fairly in-depth analysis of the whole storyline of this property, because we could end up finding things from all periods of occupation, and we kind of have to treat each of those as significant even if we know the house is important because it's Malcolm X's house, we're looking at the entire history of the property, because when you do archaeology you can't avoid finding other time periods.

The Boston Globe: Malcolm X's Former Home Gets A Closer Look
"Bagley said the home, which has remained in the family and is now owned by Malcolm X's nephew, Rodnell Collins, is largely unchanged since the 1940s. And since Collins, 71, lived in the home as a boy, he can serve as a guide on where it would be best to look."

"The designation offers preservationists and city officials hope they can raise enough money — and attention — to fix up the home and turn it into housing for graduate students of African-American studies or similar fields."

Water levels on the River Don in north east Scotland reached their highest levels in 45 years during a night of severe floods caused by heavy rain.
Almost 70 properties were evacuated, including the 86 residents of three care homes in Aberdeen.
The River Ythan also burst its banks, with flow levels breaking previous records at Ellon.
All Aberdeenshire residents affected by flooding have now returned home or found alternative accommodation.
And rest centres in the area have been stood down.
Environment agency Sepa has now lifted most flood warnings but warned vigilance for the next 48 hours.
The first minister chaired a further meeting of the Scottish government's resilience committee and Nicola Sturgeon said the floods had had a "devastating impact" on many communities across eastern Scotland.
Emergency response
On Thursday night, Aberdeenshire Council said it was dealing with an escalating emergency response as the rivers Dee and Ythan burst their banks.
Some 38 properties in Port Elphinstone, near Inverurie, and 18 homes in Ellon were evacuated.
At first light, as conditions eased, dozens of people were being cared for at rest centres.
By Friday afternoon, Aberdeen City Council said it had switched its anti-flooding efforts to Culter, where the burn burst its banks and 12 residents from the Millside were evacuated from their homes.
A spokeswoman said: "The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency has suggested that river levels in the city will not rise any further and will start to decrease gradually over the course of the day... However, residents in the Granholm and Culter areas are advised to remain extra vigilant over the next 48 hours."

Police Scotland declared a "major incident" overnight.
Aberdeenshire Council said it faced an "escalating emergency response" and had a "very challenging night".
BBC correspondent Kevin Keane said residents in their 80s were among those evacuated in Port Elphinstone.
He said some had been led to ambulances to keep warm while waiting for rescue boats, as "dozens" of homes flooded.

An emergency rest centre became inaccessible because of flood water, and rescue efforts were also hampered by freezing temperatures and snow. The area was also affected by a power cut.
At Methlick, a bus was half-submerged by floodwater after becoming stranded. Stagecoach said there were no passengers on board at the time and the driver was able to get off safely.
'Tremendous spirit'
David Barrack runs a hotel in Inverurie which escaped the flooding and has offered free rooms to people affected.
He said: "We are full now and we've got people in the reception area and people in the lounge area.
"The bar is busy so it's quite a social event actually. There's tremendous spirit."
One woman who was forced to leave her home in Inverurie said she saw the water rising onto the pavement outside and realised she had to grab as much as she could and "get out".
She told the BBC: "My brother looked through the letterbox this morning and said the house had water in it. So I'm just now emptying what I can.
"I've got two kids - they were panicking as well. We spent the evening last night looking for sandbags. There was a two hour wait for getting them in Inverurie last night. We had no chance."

Shelley Douglas, in Kintore, told BBC Scotland the community spirit was strong.
She said: "It just hasn't let up. It finally stopped raining a couple of hours ago but the community has pulled together.
"They have been absolutely amazing - getting sandbags and even using pillow cases as sandbags. Not just in Kintore, but from Kemnay and Inverurie and surrounding areas as well."
Travel warning
Ch Supt Campbell Thomson, divisional commander for the North East Division of Police Scotland, said: "A major incident was declared due to the severity of the warnings in place and the potential for serious impact on communities.
"A number of roads throughout the region remain closed and I want to remind the public of the need to travel with extreme caution. With freezing temperatures expected, conditions will be hazardous and you should only travel if essential."
He added: "I want to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of emergency services and partners and indeed the community in the way they have responded to the prolonged adverse weather which is some of the worst conditions we have seen for many years."
The flooding followed December being the wettest month for the UK in more than a century.
Richard Brown, head of hydrology for Sepa, said water levels around the River Don were "pretty exceptional".
He told BBC Scotland: "We have had a gauging station up at Alford for the last 42 years and it has exceeded anything we have ever recorded."

Hello!
Thanks for all the questions you've sent over regarding last week's EULA post. It's a lively topic.
A group of Mojangstas met this morning to discuss the most common questions we received over the weekend. The following post is the result of that discussion.
Though we're happy to clarify, most of these points were mentioned in last week's explanation of the EULA. Please give it a read before diving into this more detailed Q+A.
Are any servers exempt to the EULA?
No. It affects all servers and players equally.
Do server hosts have a grace period to implement changes to their servers?
Yes. All servers must comply with the EULA by August 1st, 2014.
Can I charge for access to my server?
Yes. How players join a server is up to you. Single entrance fees or subscriptions are both allowed.
How often am I allowed to charge players to access my server?
You can charge players as regularly as you like. You can even charge for timed access if you think it's the best way to monetise your server.
What counts as a server? Are proxies one big server, or lots of smaller ones?
A server is something a user connects to with their client. The user is on a different server when they leave one and manually join another (in the multiplayer screen). Virtual servers and proxies make no difference; to the client it's the same server.
Can I charge access to a specific part of my server, such as a minigame or world?
No, you cannot charge for any part of a server. Only the access. Once on a server, all players must have the same gameplay privileges. You may make a different server which features “premium” areas, and charge for access to that server instead, but the benefits cannot carry between servers.
So can I charge for my minigames or mods?
Yes, so long as all players on your server have access to the features.
Can I offer a limited trial period for all users?
Yes. So long as both trial and paying users have access to the same gameplay features during the trial, we're cool with it.
Can I give paying users priority access to my server?
Yes, but you cannot restrict gameplay elements to specific users.
Does the EULA still apply for access to user-created mods?
Yes. It doesn't make a difference who made the mods, or how they were implemented onto your server. All mods require Minecraft to run. You are not allowed to charge for Minecraft features which affect gameplay.
What do you mean by “hard currency” compared to “soft currency”?
Hard currency is real money or anything that can be converted into real money, including Bitcoins. Soft currency is available in-game only, and has no real-world value. The restrictions in the EULA only apply to hard currency; you may unlock things in-game with soft currency.
Can I sell “kits” for hard currency if I provide a balanced alternative for non-paying users?
If the “kits” contain gameplay-affecting features they are not allowed. Gameplay balance is not relevant to the EULA. If the items included in the kit are purely cosmetic, you can charge real money/hard currency.
My server features a currency that you can earn through gameplay, but which can also be bought for hard currency. Is that OK?
Soft currencies that are earned in-game are fine, but you cannot sell in-game currency for hard currency. Hybrid/dual currency systems are not allowed.
Can I sell boosters, which provide faster gold gain, XP, or other in-game resources for hard currency?
No - boosters, item generators, and all other features that affect gameplay are not allowed.
So how do I make real money from selling cosmetic items?
You can sell cosmetic items for hard currency directly or allow players to fund an “account” specific to your server. It's up to the host of the server to decide how this works. Remember that capes are the exception to this rule - you are not allowed to give them away or sell them.
Can I sell ranks on my server?
Yes. Ranks are allowed so long as any perks gained are cosmetic. Coloured names, prefixes, special hats etc. are fine.
Can users purchase something that affects the entire server, such as a temporary XP boost?
Yes, but everyone who can access the server must be able to use the feature, regardless of whether they purchased it or not.
Can I award all players with a gameplay feature if I reach a donation goal within a time period?
Yes, so long as all players receive the benefit regardless of who donated then it's OK.
Can I charge for access to server commands?
Yes, as long as their effects are purely cosmetic. Commands that affect gameplay, such as a command to fly, cannot be sold for hard currency.
If all players get access to a feature such as a plot of land, can I sell access to multiple plots for hard currency?
No - that would be a gameplay affecting change, so it's not allowed. All player who access your server must have the same gameplay features offered to them. The same rule applies to items, such as potions.
How should servers deal with users who have already spent hard currency on features that affect gameplay?
Users may keep the perks they've paid for on the condition that the same perks are available to other players on the server (directly or purchasable using soft currency). It's up to the server host to decide how to compensate users for previous transactions.
Phew. That was a long one. Thanks for reading everybody!

A Florida man celebrating the Fourth of July in Maine with family, died when he tried to launch a firework off the top of his head, Maine State Police say.
Devon Staples, 22, of Calais had been setting off fireworks with friends on Saturday night in the backyard of a friend's home, according to Stephen McCausland, a spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety.
He says Staples placed a fireworks mortar tube on his head and set it off, injuring his head. He died instantly. Officials also confirmed that drinking was indeed involved.
UPDATE: Devon's brother, Cody, who was drinking with his brother at the time of the incident, says his brother held the lighter too close to the firework and accidentally set if off.
“I was the first one who got there. There was no rushing him to the hospital. There was no Devon left when I got there,” Cody Staples said to New York Daily News. “It was a freak accident … But Devon was not the kind of person who would do something stupid. He was the kind of person who would pretend to do something stupid to make people laugh.”
Devon Staples lived in Orlando, Florida, working at Disney World as a character for guests to meet with as well as other acting roles in the park. See a photo of Devon as Gaston from Beauty and the Beast below.
“He loved it. He loved making people happy,” Cody Staples said. “Anyone who would want to give a tribute to Devon should go out and do something nice for someone. Show some love to someone you don't know. That kid was all about showing people love.”
McCausland says Staples' death marks Maine's first fireworks fatality since the state legalized fireworks several years ago.
Bizarre deaths and crimes:
With a little over a week before Team USA reconvenes for its second installment of training camp, Managing Director Jerry Colangelo and Head Coach Mike Krzyzewski announced sixteen finalists for the 2014 USA Men's World Cup roster and Sacramento's DeMarcus Cousins found his name on the list.
Following an impressive performance in the team's exhibition this past Friday, No. 36 will resume 2014 FIBA World Cup preparations on Aug. 14 in Chicago, Ill.
“All the coaches were really pleased with DeMarcus and how he played,” said Krzyzewski during Saturday's media teleconference. “His attitude [has been] tremendous. He wouldn't keep coming back to be a part of this and be on a U.S. Team if it didn't mean something to him. We recognized that even before he started practice – the fact he was there, committed and ready to go in good shape.”
The Kings big man is one of four players battling for the starting center spot, but Cousins' energy and effort last week already seems to have paid dividends.
Whether he was boxing-out on defense, exploding for a rebound or attacking his defender, the 6-foot-11 center left a lasting impression.
“DeMarcus had a really good week, an outstanding scrimmage [and he was the] leading rebounder,” said Coach K. “He gives us a big that's different than Anthony Davis. We are looking at that big position – the five – separate from all the others.”
Looking to separate himself from the pack, DMC is using his distinct combination of size, strength and speed to his advantage.
“[He] gives us a low-post presence, which gives our team a little bit of a different look,” stated the U.S. National Team sixth-year head coach. “And he can pass out of the post, so he made a huge impact on all of us during the week, but especially at the scrimmage.”
In nearly 26 minutes of action, Cousins tallied 11 points from the floor, including a 7-for-8 clip from the free throw line. He also added two steals and 11 rebounds – four on the offensive end.
As World Cup play grows closer, the Kings star looks to continue his solid performance at the team's upcoming training camp.

- Marci Solway got up to a horrible sight. She looked out her window to see a lifeless body in the field across the way from her town home where they are building Habitat for Humanity homes.
Authorities say the man in the field had jumped from the Colorado Street Bridge. Solway says she was "beyond shocked because the city put temporary barriers up" to stop jumpers. But, sometime early Monday in the wee hours, that's exactly what happened.
Officials with the city of Pasadena were upset. They said the chain link was used as a temporary measure. William Boyer with the city said, “It's a terrible thing to know that people are doing this and we want to try and prevent this because at the end of the day it's something that needs to stop.”
In just the last few months four men and three women (one was a 16-year-old) perished. Fire officials say most were in their 20s and 30s… one in their 60s
Boyer says, "It's a tragic loss of life and we take it very seriously. We want to be able to prevent people from using the bridge in this way.”
This past weekend's work to construct barriers was step one to make the bridge safe. Some say what's been done so far is more of a visual message to people who want to jump.
He didn't want to speak on camera, but the public works director - who was very upset about this latest death - says the safety measures happening on this iconic bridge are a work in progress. That there are plans to improve what they've started… more barriers. Fencing that is more permanent.
That's what Marci Solway would like to see. Maybe security guards on the bridge and, stop making it a public walkway.
It is that. We found Gail Whaley and her daughter Veronica from Sacramento. They were on a LALALand tour… checking out places shown in the famous movie. The Colorado Street Bridge was one of them. They were shocked to hear what happened today about the latest death and only went halfway across the bridge because it seemed too sad to celebrate the bridge.
Which brings us back to Marci Solway. This is very tough for her. She had an extended family member who died after jumping off a building and her own daughter and her kids were killed in a car wreck.
Says Solway, "every time I see another body it is just… the flashbacks. The thoughts of what I went through… that morning… the phone call… everything just flashes back inside your body with all that horrible stuff that I have survived."
The city says the work will continue on the bridge.

Look at that guy over there. Are those... Spam chips covered with cheese and jalapeños he's dipping into his guacamole? OMG, what a loser. NOBODY eats plain Spamchos these days.
Let's face it: If you're eating regular old Spamchos, if you can't even be bothered to replace those chips made of deep fried chopped-and-formed spiced ham with something meatier, you may as well be chowing down on oatmeal while sipping on prune juice, gramps.
Spamchos? Spamchos?!? First off, let's talk filler here. Spam is not pure meat, and anything that is not pure meat is extraneous, am I right? Non-meat has one purpose and one purpose alone: For topping meat, and even then, it's only acceptable if that non-meat topping is a) composed at least 50% of pure fat, b) related to onions, or c) is some form of hot sauce.
And that brings me to the stuff packed in with those fillers that you call "meat." Let me clarify for you: pork is not meat. Pork is not even the fish of the land-animal world. If something holds a GB value on the RGB color codes chart of 30 or more and an R value less than 100, it may as well be grouped in with all those other vegetables like quinoa and broccoli and chicken. Give me crimson red death on my platter or let me starve.
I can see you now, cowering in that hunched-over, pale, anemic position that is the mark of the under-fatted. As a part-time vegan, I know the feeling. I get it every time I haven't had a medium-rare burger for more than three hours. I get those kryptonite chills whenever I'm within throwing distance of a block of tofu. I understand your struggle.
How can I make my nachos meatier than with Spam?, you ask. Never fear! I present to you: STEAK-CHOS, nachos in their ultimate, meatiest, beefiest, non-gendered-but-taking-on-characteristics-of-stereotypical-but-outdated-male form.
Here's how to do it.
Step 1: Cook Your Steak
Start with good steak. I used inch-and-a-half Prime ribeyes here, generously seasoned with salt and pepper. My initial thought was to grill the steaks, but I ended up preferring the more delicate, refined, and elegant results you get by searing the steaks on a half inch plate of solid red hot steel, and elegance and refinement are what I'm all about here.
Step 1b: Be Me
Important note: This recipe will not work without a reversible Baking Steel griddle pan, a product that is currently only available in prototype form and only at my home. There are no substitutions possible. I know this makes it a little difficult for some folks to follow this recipe, but my best piece of advice is to just try harder to be me. Not to be like me, mind you, but to actually be me. That is the only way you'll be able to get identical results at your my home.
Step 2: Sear From Both Sides
You thought that one piece of inaccessible equipment was enough? Everybody knows that you need to use at least two hyper-specialized, Kickstarter-funded tools in order for meat to even be considered edible these days. I tried various combinations of the many expensive and limited-quantity high tech cooking tools in my kitchen, including a combination of the sous-vide cooker and the Thermomix (the steak came out too warm and soupy, offering no textural contrast with the cheese sauce), and one that I tried to cook by inserting two Thermapen Instant-Read Digital Thermometers at once (it came out at a very, very precise and accurate room temperature).
The best combo in the end was the Baking Steel and Searzall, a neat little device whose main purpose is to make a standard propane torch look really really cool and to draw attention to you while you work in the kitchen, so you can nonchalantly say things like, "It's just a little Kickstarter thing I backed a while back. I mean, I totally forgot it was even coming." Or, "Oh this? It's only invented by Dave Arnold, the guy who brought sous vide to New York. He's like Wylie Dufresne's brother-in-law or something. You know him. The spherical Pastrami gel guy."
This is the kind of stuff that, if you invite the right friends over to dinner, they'll start Instagramming about how awesome your steak tastes before they even taste it.
Step 3: Let it Rest
Go for perfectly cooked steak that is well-rested is juicy, succulent, savory, moist, and tender. Perfectly cooked steak that hasn't been rested for at least 23% but no more than 23.25% of its total cooking time will be impossibly dry, insipid, and tough. The choice is yours.
Step 4: Add Your Cheese Sauce
There is only one acceptable cheese sauce for steaks so glorious as this, and it is this one. All other cheese sauces are just imitating.
Step 5: Add Your Salsa
We're edging dangerously close to vegetable territory here. All I can say is if your salsa doesn't burn holes into your floor like xenomorph acid blood, then it isn't hot enough to be worthy of a dish like this.
Step 6: Add Your Guacamole
Yes, it's green. Yes, it's made with plants. But avocados were also named by the Aztecs, a group of dudes and dudettes so tough that Cortez had to resort to biological warfare just to bring 'em down. Moreover, it wasn't just named by them, but the Nahuatl word for avocado, ahuácatl, literally means balls, and yes, I mean the kind that hang between my legs. Avocados are also essentially green butter that grow on trees. I think we can make a pass here.
Finish it all off with a drizzle of Mexican cream, some cotija cheese, some chopped scallions, onions, and cilantro, and a few thin slices of radish for the vitamins.
Step 7: Serve
I like to serve a big platter of these during the game alongside a roll of single-ply toilet paper. They make perfect finger full-hand food, ideal for snacking or staving off hunger in between real, more substantial meals.
What's that? Is that the voice of doubters and naysayers I hear claiming that this magnificent creation is nothing but an unrefined assault on the palate with no sophistication, soul, or nuance? Pshaw!
I present to you absolute, irrefutable proof that this dish is not just sophisticated, but it is in fact an artisan dish with heritage, history, time, and sense of place. A dish with meaning as deep as the wrinkles on the faded black-and-white photo of the face of an octogenarian holding a weathered wooden bowl filled with freshly picked heirloom shell beans.
You simply can't argue with the two-handed food cradle, especially not when those hands have been Photoshopped to bring out their blemishes and they are housing something as warm, wet, and juicy as that steakcho.
Sill don't buy it? Try a little taste of this.
I rest my case.

The Munich Art Hoard: Hitler's Dealer and His Secret Legacy. By Catherine Hickley. Thames & Hudson; 272 pages; £19.95.

THE Nazis would willingly have destroyed, much as Islamic State (IS) does now, everything they regarded as Entartete Kunst, or “degenerate art”. This included many early 20th-century masterpieces, including “Femme Assise” by Henri Matisse (pictured), that were seized from museums and Jewish collectors and sold for foreign currency, which the Nazi regime needed, just as IS does, to finance its war machine.
Hildebrand Gurlitt became a facilitator of this process. Intelligent, with a well-trained eye and an appreciation of art that he inherited from his father, he enjoyed both the trust of prominent Jews and the confidence of Hitler's ideologues. Gurlitt was himself a quarter Jewish, a small taint to his Aryan-ness that the Nazis were willing to overlook in order to take advantage of his connections in the art world.
Gurlitt was one of only four German dealers licensed to buy and sell on behalf of Hitler's regime. He was a conduit by which despised “degenerate art” could be sold. He bought art cheaply from Jews fleeing from Germany. He purchased for the Führer's projected art museum in Linz and also built up a big collection of his own. In short, Gurlitt saved much art, but he dealt in it while its rightful owners perished; he said he helped Jews, but he also profited massively from their misfortune.
This complex, shadowy story, and the subsequent fate of the art that Gurlitt handled, is painstakingly told in Catherine Hickley's comprehensive narrative, “The Munich Art Hoard”. She does not linger long on issues of morality, but meticulously lays out the spidery network of ties, lies, pressures and fears that helped Gurlitt save his own skin and amass (and ultimately safeguard) a huge collection. When the hoard finally emerged in 2013 from the shuttered residences of his mild-mannered and socially autistic son, Cornelius, the discovery shocked the art world and raised a cloud of legal and ethical dilemmas. The reclusive Cornelius, who had thitherto felt his pathological solitude strangely comforted by his possession of the secret cache of art, found himself become an international cause célèbre.
There are passages in Ms Hickley's account which display all the excitement of the best investigative journalism. But journalism it remains. The big issues which the story raises are all left unresolved, which is a pity. But perhaps the greatest pity of all is that while lawyers, bureaucrats and art historians continue to deliberate, several hundred works of art—many of the highest order and by artists as prominent as Monet, Manet, Courbet, Chagall and Munch—languish unseen in a vault in Munich. Arguments over legal repossessions will inevitably mean that many of them may not be seen again for decades. This is perhaps their only opportunity to be displayed all together. The German authorities have many responsibilities to bear. But the most easily discharged of all would be to let the world have the opportunity meanwhile to view this unseen art—raising public awareness thereby of the sheer scale of what happened in Nazi Germany and reminding people that looting and trafficking of art works still happens today.
Democratic presidential candidate's campaign says Martin Shkreli is a ‘poster boy for greed' and Turing Pharmaceutical CEO calls the senator a ‘demagogue'
Bernie Sanders has rejected a political donation from Martin Shkreli, the drug company boss who tried to rise the price of an Aids and cancer drug by 5,455%.
Turing boss Martin Shkreli says Daraprim price drop 'might curtail research for lethal diseases' Read more
“We are not keeping the money from this poster boy for drug company greed,” said the Democratic presidential hopeful's spokesman Michael Briggs.
Shkreli's $2,700 donation – the maximum individual contribution allowed – will be handed over to the Whitman-Walker health clinic in Washington, which specialises in treating HIV/Aids patients in the LGBT community.
The Turing Pharmaceutical CEO, who had announced an increase in the price of parasitic infection drug Daraprim to $750 a pill from $13.50 a pill, said he was “furious” that Sanders has publicly rejected his money without discussing his side of the story on drug pricing.
Shkreli, 32, who made the donation last month, told the Boston Globe that he had made the donation in order to secure a private meeting with Sanders, a Vermont senator. “I think it's cheap to use one person's action as a platform without kind of talking to that person,” Shkreli said. “He'll take my money, but he won't engage with me for five minutes to understand this issue better.”
He said that if given the chance he would like to ask Sanders if he understood that drug companies sometimes need to charge high prices in order to pay for life-saving pharmaceutical developments.
“Is he willing to sort of accept that there is a tradeoff, that to take risks for innovation, companies have to invest lots of money and they need some kind of return for that, and what does he think that should look like?” Shkreli said. “And quite frankly, what I'm worried [about] is that he doesn't have an answer for that, that he's appealing to the masses, that he's just kind of talking out of his rear end so that he gets some votes.”
Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) Damn @BernieSanders is my boy with that Kosovo reference. Gets my full endorsement. I did donate to him...
Shkreli, who is chief executive of drug company Turing, made public his donation to Sanders during the Democratic debate earlier this week, when he tweeted: “ Damn @BernieSanders is my boy with that Kosovo reference. Gets my full endorsement. I did donate to him…”
During the debate, Sanders, the main rival to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, continued his fight against the drug industry saying: “I would lump Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry at the top of my list of people who do not like me.”
Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) My work here is done. You can find me at the corner of "no comment" and "keep my name out of your mouth".
When Shkreli became aware that Sanders had rejected his donation, he said: “Instead of having an intelligent discussion on healthcare Bernie Sanders would rather hold his hands over his ears and be a demagogue.”
Sanders is not the only presidential candidate to have poured scorn of Shkreli. Clinton accused him of price gouging and Republican presidential poll leader Donald Trump reportedly said he looked like a “spoiled brat”.
This is a story about how Donald Trump made a pass at me. And about what that does and does not mean as he runs for president.
In the early months of 1987, I was a 26-year-old reporter at the New York Times and I went to a party at the newly opened Wollman Rink in Central Park. The rink had been rebuilt with great fanfare by Trump, who, remarkably, accomplished in four months what the city had been trying to do for nine years.
I had interviewed Trump once for an article and was somehow invited to this event, which I attended with my now husband. I introduced him to Trump, we all chatted briefly, and then Bruce went off to get some hot chocolate or somesuch. After he'd walked away, Trump said there would be an even better afterparty and I was welcome to join him, but only if I came alone.
That memory has surfaced periodically over the past few months as the Trump nomination has gone from unimaginable to unstoppable. I kept it mostly to myself for nearly all of that time, even as I wrote about Trump's relationships with the women who worked with and for him over the years, and even as my article concluded — to my own surprise, frankly — that Trump had a record of promoting women to high-level jobs within his organization and of treating them (for better or worse) just like he treated the men. In retrospect, I think perhaps I should have disclosed that encounter when the story was published, but at the time, I thought of it as just one long-ago data point.
This weekend, when the New York Times ran its front-page story about similar memories of dozens of other women, I posted a brief recap of my own experience on my Facebook page. My point — my single encounter was part of a trend. By the next day, that Times story had come under fire because the woman in its lead anecdote said she'd been misrepresented, and I came to see my own encounter as one bit of pushback against Trump's Twitter claims that everything in the Times article was ancient history, irrelevant, or a lie.
What then does Trump's behavior — in and out of the workplace — mean for this election?
Let's start with the indisputable fact that Trump objectifies women. I'm not sure why we are even debating that anymore. It is clear that looks matter to him and that his own virility is important to his sense of who he is. This was evident well before the Times story — from years of Trump commenting on which women were a 10 and which ones were hot enough for him to sleep with; from years of insults about women's looks, everyone from Rosie O'Donnell to Carly Fiorina; from his own reassurances on the campaign trail that his genitalia were of acceptable size.
And it is also undeniably true that Trump has proudly employed women in positions of power over the decades. Back in October, I wrote about the triumvirate of women who ran major pieces of the Trump Organization in the 1980s, and of his boasts back then that he gave women authority in an industry that did not. His pride extends forward to the present, where he claims there are more women in executive positions in his company today than men.

Bill O'Reilly continues to be the elephant in the room over at Fox News, driving away advertisers, bellowing at people, and, occasionally, taking a giant dump on the things the network finds precious. Like its relationship with former anchor and rising star Megyn Kelly, for instance, who departed Fox back in January in order to take a job at NBC. Now, The New York Times reports that the ongoing unpleasantness of sharing a network with O'Reilly's piles of shit was one of the reasons for her move.
The Times received information from a number of anonymous sources saying Kelly sent an unhappy email about O'Reilly's conduct last year, in the wake of the sexual harassment scandal that ousted CEO Roger Ailes from the company. The two network stars took very different tacks on the matter; Kelly wrote a book that contained a chapter describing sexual harassment at Fox and an incident in which Ailes harassed her, while O'Reilly—no stranger to these kinds of claims—loudly demanded that everyone involved keep quiet, declaring Fox “a good place to work” when asked about Kelly's book.

His insistence on silence—and public implications, both on his show, and an appearance on Good Morning, America, that Kelly shouldn't have opened up about the Ailes incident—apparently pissed her off but good, inciting the Kelly File star to send an e-mail to newly installed co-presidents Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy calling out O'Reilly's “bad form.”
The Times doesn't have the actual text of the email, but it was apparently pretty scathing; among other things, Kelly noted that Settlin' Bill O'Reilly is quite possibly the last man on Earth who should be opening his mouth about sexual harassment claims. She also questioned whether Fox's culture toward women—and the blind loyalty that allowed Ailes' harassment to linger for so long—had actually changed in the aftermath of the former CEO's departure.
Shortly after Kelly sent the e-mail, one of her producers learned that O'Reilly intended to double down on his call for keeping quiet on an episode of The O'Reilly Factor, and asked the company's presidents to curtail the host's comments. They didn't, and O'Reilly ended up uttering some words that have turned out to be prophetic for Kelly's time at Fox: “If you don't like what's happening in the workplace, go to human resources or leave.”
The first official performance numbers of the AMD Radeon R9 Nano graphics card have been leaked by Videocardz. The benchmarks show the Radeon R9 Nano pitted against the GeForce GTX 970 Mini which it manages to outperform in all the gaming titles. The Radeon R9 Nano going to be the latest graphics card, featuring AMD's Fiji GPU core and HBM architecture in a compact Mini-ITX design.

AMD Radeon R9 Performance Shows Fastest Mini-ITX Graphics Card Ever
The AMD Radeon R9 Nano is based on the full fat Fiji GPU core. The design is by no means cut down and its amazing how the Fiji GPU runs so well on a design this compact. Based on the 28nm HPX process, the Radeon R9 Nano features 64 compute units which have 64 stream processors per CU, these round up to a total of 4096 stream processors which is the same core count featured on the flagship R9 Fury X graphics card. The card comes with 256 texture mapping units and 64 raster operation units. While the Radeon R9 Fury X has a compote performance of 8.6 TFlops with its 1050 MHz engine clock, the Radeon R9 Nano comes with a total compute performance of 8.19 TFlops with its 1000 MHz engine clock.
The 1000 MHz clock speed for the Radeon R9 Nano is quite impressive indeed as this package as a whole is 175 Watts that is 100W less than the Radeon R9 Fury X (275W). The Radeon R9 Nano is designed to feature greater performance efficiency numbers compared to both Radeon R9 290X and the Radeon R9 Fury X which it achieves with ease. Now here's the scene, the Radeon R9 Nano has a total board power that is limited to 175W, pumped through a single 8-Pin connector. The GPU isn't necessarily working at 1000 MHz all the time, the core clock can be optimized based on the needs of applications and games. The Radeon R9 Nano seems to be the fastest and most perfect Mini-ITX graphics card with a compact design and a thermal solution that should provide even better stability and temperatures than the Radeon R9 290X graphics card as mentioned in the slides.
As for performance numbers, the Radeon R9 Nano turned out to be faster in all the gaming titles compared to the GeForce GTX 970 Mini which is currently the fastest Mini-ITX offering in the market. This is kind of expected since the Fiji GPU has a lot of performance packed inside its hood and it rivals the GM200 in performance than the GM204 GPU core which the GeForce GTX 970 and GeForce GTX 980 is based on. This shows that the card is actually faster than the two GM204 products that NVIDIA has to offer but also AMD's own Radeon R9 390 and 390X graphics card. I believe that the card will be very close to the Radeon R9 Fury (Fiji Pro) in terms of overall performance but that is something we would have to confirm when actual reviews make their way on the net.
Some performance results were also published by AMD in their Hot Chips presentation shows that the Radeon R9 Nano will deliver 33 FPS compared to 30.5 FPS (Radeon R9 290X), while the Radeon R9 Fury X blisters past 40 FPS at an exact FPS rate of 42. The benchmarks were obtained at 4K resolution so its quite obvious that AMD Fiji based parts will have higher performance due to higher bandwidth (512 GB/s). The performance per watt with these results was insane with Hawaii taken at reference at 1.0% while the Fury X has 1.25x and the R9 Nano at 1.9x (up to 2.0x) times more energy efficient compared to Radeon R9 290X which is insane. Still, the performance is amazing from a card that measures just 6 inches and we hope to learn more about the Radeon R9 Nano in the upcoming days.

Republican senators were in a bind.
Conservative groups that work to defeat ideologically impure GOP incumbents were demanding a vote against the budget compromise Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) hatched with Democrats. But, with a January deadline looming, voting down the compromise was essentially voting for another government shutdown. How, then, to justify voting no?
They couldn't credibly say the deal had too much spending: It cut the deficit and didn't raise taxes. And they couldn't say it hurt the military: It added $22 billion to the Pentagon budget for 2014.
Instead, they singled out a small provision — a $6 billion cut to military pensions over 10 years — and proclaimed it an all-out assault on our brave men and women in uniform.
“I certainly appreciate the hard work that went into this agreement but it is absolutely wrong to take from our military retirees, those who have sacrificed the most,” Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) said with indignation at a Tuesday morning news conference she organized with veterans groups.

Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) was equally aghast that the Ryan plan would “penalize and treat differently the brave men and women who . . . chose a military career.”
And Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is fighting off a primary challenge, was coarse: “Of all the people we could've picked on to screw, how could we have arrived here?”
Their outrage was suspicious. The cut they condemned is a 1-percentage-point reduction in cost-of-living increases for military pensions for those who retire young, often in their 40s and usually to begin second careers. And the need to restrain military benefits is undisputed: Overall payments to military retirees and survivors were $52 billion last year, and personnel costs, now half of the Pentagon's budget, will soon crowd out everything else if current trends persist.
But the gambit gave Republicans an excuse to oppose Ryan's compromise. In a key vote Tuesday, 33 of 45 Senate Republicans — 73 percent — voted to block a final vote. That wasn't enough to kill the agreement, but it was a complete flip from what happened five days earlier in the House, where 73 percent of Republicans voted in favor of the deal.
In part the difference was because Ryan has less sway over Senate Republicans and because of partisan bitterness over the recent filibuster skirmish. But a bigger factor may have been the extra time conservative groups had to rally opposition, and lawmakers had to devise a cover story for their nays.
Whatever the cause, last week's House vote already looks more like a bipartisan blip than the beginning of a new era of cooperation. On Tuesday, most Senate Republicans returned to the reflexive opposition that has characterized the past five years.
Among the 33 Republicans voting against the compromise were the party's leaders (Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and John Cornyn of Texas, who both face conservative primary challenges) and aspiring candidates for the presidential nomination (Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas).

Fortunately there were a dozen grown-ups on the Republican side Tuesday (more than enough to ensure passage), including elder statesman Orrin Hatch (Utah), budget geek Rob Portman (Ohio) and the iconoclastic John McCain (Ariz.).
After casting his vote to advance the budget deal, McCain had a heated exchange on the floor with Ayotte and Wicker, who just minutes earlier had stood before the TV cameras calling the Ryan bill an attack on those in uniform.
Ayotte alleged that a sergeant first class retiring at age 40 with 20 years of service would lose nearly $72,000. She also claimed, even though the cuts are for regular pensions, that those on disability pensions would be hurt by the deal. Graham, in his turn at the microphones, predicted that outrage would have been greater if the agreement cut cost-of-living increases for Social Security retirees.
But military pensioners — about 17 percent of personnel serve long enough to qualify — also get Social Security benefits. And though they deservedly receive better benefits than civilians, the generous payouts are causing budgetary havoc for the armed forces. The $6 billion cut over 10 years barely begins to address the problem — yet it was the justification used more than any other by the 33 Senate Republicans who with their votes Tuesday were willing to risk another government shutdown.
“This budget's probably going to pass,” Graham lamented, “because everybody's hell-bent to get out of town and not shut down the government. . . . We're in a big hurry around here to show you how functional we are.”
And that's such a bad thing?

01:21 The Truth About Tornadoes and Big Cities The Weather Channel's Dave Malkoff says big cities are no stranger to tornadoes.
At a Glance Two people were killed by a possible tornado in southern Georgia early Sunday morning.
Four people were killed by a tornado in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Saturday morning.
Homes and buildings were damaged or destroyed in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia and Texas Saturday.
Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency following the storms.
At least 6 people have died as an outbreak of severe storms and tornadoes spread across the South Saturday and Sunday morning.
In southern Georgia, two people were killed by a possible tornado early Sunday morning, officials from the Brooks County Sheriff's Office confirmed. Both victims were in the same home in Barney , which was displaced onto Highway 122, according to WALB.
Tornadoes and severe storms damaged homes and buildings in Georgia, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi after multiple rounds of storms fired up Saturday afternoon into Saturday evening and Sunday morning.
There were more than 200 reports of severe weather and more than two dozen reports of tornadoes so far this weekend as of early Sunday morning in an ongoing multi-day tornado and severe weather outbreak.
On Saturday afternoon, Forrest County Coroner Butch Benedict announced the identities of the four victims: Earnest Perkins, 58; Cleveland Madison, 20; David Wayne McCoy, 47 and Simona Cox, 72.
Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency during a Saturday afternoon press conference.
(MORE: Tornado Outbreak Underway in the Deep South, Gulf Coast )
Many survivors, like Darryl McMorris, told stories of the tornado's horrifying path of destruction. He told the Associated Press that he held onto his daughters as the twister destroyed their house, wall by wall – one of which fell on top of them. They all survived, but their house is a total loss, the report added.
"Is God mad at us?" her daughter asked.
At least 50 people were treated for injuries at area hospitals, Mississippi Emergency Management Agency spokesman Greg Flynn told the AP. Insured damages are likely to top $200 million in Hattiesburg alone, Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney said.
"You've got so many buildings that are for all practical purposes totally destroyed," Andy Case, a disaster recovery specialist with the Department of Insurance, told the AP.
The city also tweeted Saturday morning that Hattiesburg firefighters and police went door-to-door to rescue tornado victims , and Mayor Johnny DuPree signed an emergency declaration for the city of 46,000 people in the southern part of Mississippi.
Louisiana
The Bossier Parish Sheriff's Office said that two dozen homes were damaged near Plain Dealing, Louisiana; five of those homes sustained 'heavy damage' . There were no injuries reported. They did not say whether the damage was caused by a tornado or non-tornadic winds, but the National Weather Service will survey the damage at a later time to make that final decision.
Ten to 15 homes were damaged or destroyed in Natchitoches Parish by reported tornadoes and storms, the Natchitoches Parish Sheriff's Office said. A few injuries were also associated with the storms, but none were considered life-threatening.
According to the Sheriff's Department, a man in Point Place, Louisiana “was sucked out of his brick home through the front door and thrown in his front yard.”
Texas
Reported tornadoes damaged at least 8 homes in Scottsville, Texas, late Saturday afternoon. KTAL reports that the entire area is without power as crews work to clear downed power lines and trees. Luckily, no one was injured.
“This used to be my house,” Scottsville resident Earnest Marshall told the news station. “The house shifted so covered my head and waited and it just got tore up.”
Mississippi
Mississippi was once again hit by strong storms overnight Saturday with new reports of damage in Lauderdale County. WTOK reports that at least 6 homes in the Lauderdale Community suffered serious damage and that at least one person was injured after severe storms tore through the area.
The state's Emergency Management Agency said the tornado damaged buildings in Forrest, Lamar and Perry counties Saturday morning. Search and rescue teams were dispatched to help emergency management officials in the Hattiesburg area. Interstate 59 north of Hattiesburg was closed due to debris, and cleanup of the area is expected to take several weeks.
South of downtown Hattiesburg, Edna Smith was sleeping when the twister took much of the roof off her brick home, she told the AP. A survivor of Hurricane Katrina, Smith had lived in the home since she moved from New Orleans in 2005.
"It woke me up and half the roof was gone," Smith told the AP while surveying the damage.
