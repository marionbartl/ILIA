Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamHouse to push back at Trump on border Trump pressures GOP senators ahead of emergency declaration vote: 'Be strong and smart' This week: Congress, Trump set for showdown on emergency declaration MORE (R-S.C.) said Saturday at a town hall that they are "glad" President Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump is getting an office in the White House.
"He's got their daughter in law, no, excuse me, their daughter, working in the White House — I don't know about you, but I'm glad she's there," Graham said, "because I think she's a pretty smart lady."
The statement from Graham, a frequent critic of the president, comes after reports this week that Ivanka Trump would get an office in the White House but is not assuming an official role.

Ivanka Trump's office will be on the second floor of the West Wing.  They are also reportedly getting security clearance and government-issued communications devices.
Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner, has served as a top adviser to President Trump at the White House.
With intriguing storylines and compelling characters, this superhero entry has promise, but it's also plagued by a distinct cheesiness. Viewers used to seeing superhero tales told with lusher sets and more elegant costumes and lighting may be distressed at how flat this drama looks. Most scenes are glaringly shot on sound stages (dubiously dressed up with stage design that looks stolen from Flash Gordon -- the 1936 version), the wigs are truly terrible, the lighting and effects makeup strangely reminiscent of -- but not as effective as -- the effects on Star Trek: The Next Generation. Oh, and the CGI. The CGI is bad, particularly the giant teleporting bulldog, Lockjaw.
And yet, Inhumans isn't devoid of charm. Setting much of the action in an otherworldly city that reads like a Mount Olympus full of gods is a good move, as is focusing on the political implications of a world in which many people are downtrodden so that a favored few can live in ease. Dropping hints about a growing contamination on Earth is another relatable subplot. Having seen the terrigenesis process, in which regular humans are made Inhuman by deliberately exposing them to terrigen mist, viewers can darkly imagine what powers will crop up as terrigen spreads in the water supply. Make no mistake; this series isn't as trippy as Legion or as gripping as Netflix's superhero entries like Luke Cage or Jessica Jones. But the storytelling is interesting, and viewers who love sci-fi may find themselves swept away -- if not dazzled.

“So, you do nothing all day.” That's how many people would respond to someone who says they spend the day with a pen or pencil in their hand. It's often considered an empty practice, a waste of time. They're seen as an empty mind puttering along with the busy work of scribbling.
“I Draw Pictures All Day” - “So, you do nothing all day.”
That's how many people would respond to someone who says they spend the day with a pen or pencil in their hand. It's often considered an empty practice, a waste of time. They're seen as an empty mind puttering along with the busy work of scribbling.
Doodling helps us retain information.
But for us designers and artists, drawing pictures all day is integral to our process and to who we are as creative people, and despite the idea that those who doodle waste time, we still get our work done. So, then, why are those of us who draw pictures all day even tempted to think that someone who is doodling or drawing pictures in a meeting or lecture is not paying attention?

What does it mean to be a doodler, to draw pictures all day? Why do we doodle? Most of all, what does it mean to our work? It turns out that the simple act of scribbling on a page helps us think, remember and learn.
What Does It Mean To Doodle?
The dictionary defines “doodle” as a verb (“scribble absentmindedly”) and as a noun (“a rough drawing made absentmindedly”). It also offers the origins of the word “doodler” as “a noun denoting a fool, later as a verb in the sense ‘make a fool of, cheat.'”
But the author Sunni Brown offers my favorite definition of “doodle” in their TED talk, “Doodlers, unite!”:
“In the 17th century, a doodle was a simpleton or a fool, as in “Yankee Doodle.” In the 18th century, it became a verb, and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone. In the 19th century, it was a corrupt politician. And today, we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition, at least to me, which is the following: “To doodle officially means to dawdle, to dilly dally, to monkey around, to make meaningless marks, to do something of little value, substance or import and,” my personal favorite, “to do nothing.” No wonder people are averse to doodling at work. Doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work. It's totally inappropriate.”
It is no wonder, then, why most people do not have great expectations of those who “draw pictures all day.” Or perhaps they are inclined to think that those who draw pictures all day are not highly intellectual and are tempted to say to them condescendingly, “Go and draw some of your pictures.” As designers, many of us have heard such comments, or at least felt them implied, simply because we think, express or do things differently.
Why Do We Doodle?
Consider that even before a child can speak, they can draw pictures. It is part of their process of understanding what's around them. They draw not just what they see, but how they view the world. The drawing or doodle of a child is not necessarily an attempt to reflect reality, but rather an attempt to communicate their understanding of it. This is no surprise because playing, trial and error, is a child's primary method of learning. A child is not concerned with the impressions that others get based on their drawings or mistakes.
An example of a doodle.
Their constant drawing, picture-making and doodling is a child's way of expressing their ideas and showing their perceptions in visual form. It comes from a need to give physical form to one's thoughts. Similarly, an adult doodles in order to visualize the ideas in their head so that they can interact with those ideas.
Visual Learners
According to Linda Silverman, director of both the Institute for the Study of Advanced Development and the Gifted Development Center and author of Upside-Down Brilliance: The Visual-Spatial Learner, 37% of the population are visual learners. If so many people learn better visually, we can expect, then, that some of them learn better by putting a speech, lecture or meeting into visual and tangible form through pictures or doodles, rather than by being provided with pictures or doodles (which would be the product of another person's mind).
Humans have always had a desire to visually represent what's in their minds and memory and to communicate those ideas with others. Early cave paintings were a means of interacting with others, allowing an idea or mental image to move from one person's mind to another's. The purpose of visual language has always been to communicate ideas to others.
Secondly, we doodle because our brain is designed to empathize with the world around us. According to Carol Jeffers, professor at California State University, our brains are wired to respond to, interact with, imitate and mirror behavior. In an article they wrote, they explain the recent research into “mirror neurons” which help us understand and empathize with the world around us.
Cave paintings were our first means of communicating ideas to others.
Think of it this way. When you're at an art gallery and find a painting that intrigues you, what is your first reaction? You want to touch it, don't you? I thought so.
When I was a ballroom dancer, I used to sit and watch those who I considered to be great dancers, tracing their forms in space with my index finger as a way to commit them to memory. I used to go to galleries and museums and, at a distance, trace the lines and forms that I saw in the paintings and designs. I did this out of curiosity and a desire to physically record what I saw to memory.
Nearly 100 years ago, Maria Montessori discovered the link between physical touch and movement and learning in children. Montessori education teaches children to trace the letters of the alphabet with their index finger as a way to commit their shapes to memory. My son used to trace forms that they found interesting in space. It's safe to say, then, that we doodle to visually commit to memory a concept that we want to both empathize and interact with.
An experiment conducted by Jackie Andrade, professor of psychology at the University of Plymouth in England, demonstrated the positive effect that doodling has on memory retention. In the experiment, 40 people were given a simple set of instructions to take RSVP information over the phone from people going to a party. The group of 40 was divided in two. One group of 20 was told to doodle (limited to shading in order not to emphasize the quality of the doodles), and the other 20 would not doodle.
The doodlers recalled 29% more information.
The study showed that doodling helps the brain to focus. It keeps the mind from wandering away from whatever is happening, whether it's a lecture, reading or conference talk.
Still, we have become bored with learning.
Professor Emeritus at Cornell University, Joseph D. Novak argues that this is because we have been taught to memorize but not to evaluate the information being given to us. In many traditional settings, the pattern is simple and dull: sit, receive and memorize. Many traditional educational systems do not encourage active engagement with the material. Doodling, drawing and even making diagrams helps us not only engage with the material, but also identify the underlying structure of the argument, while also connecting concepts in a tactile and visual way. Jesse Berg, president of The Visual Leap, pointed out to me in a conversation that doodling is a multisensory activity. While our hand is creating what might seem to be random pictures, our brain is processing the stimuli that's running through it.
Many of us are the product of traditional schooling, in which we were made to numbingly memorize dates and facts, and many of us continue this pattern later in life. While some of us were avid doodlers (I used to fill the backs of my notebooks with pictures and draw on desks with a pencil during class), some of us stopped at high school, others in college and others once we settled into a job. At some point during the education process, doodling was discouraged. Teachers most likely viewed it as a sign of inattentiveness and disrespect. After hard preparation, educators want nothing more than unwavering attention to their lectures. The irony is that, according to Andrade's study, doodlers pay more attention to the words of educators than we think.
In their TED talk, Sunny Brown goes on to explain the benefits of doodling and even offers an alternative to the definition found in the Oxford Dictionary:
“Doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think. That is why millions of people doodle. Here's another interesting truth about the doodle: People who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information retain more of that information than their non-doodling counterparts. We think doodling is something you do when you lose focus, but in reality, it is a preemptive measure to stop you from losing focus. Additionally, it has a profound effect on creative problem-solving and deep information processing.”
How Can Designers Use This To Their Benefit?
As designers, we have a unique advantage when it comes to doodling. We don't just doodle to keep our minds focused — we also deliberately sketch ideas in order to problem-solve and to get immediate feedback from clients and peers. Designers such as Craighton Berman and Eva-Lotta Lamm are two of the biggest proponents of the “sketchnotating” movement. Berman states that sketchnotating “forces you to listen to the lecture, synthesize what's being expressed, and visualize a composition that captures the idea — all in real time.”
In 2009, I came across a book titled The Back of the Napkin by Dan Roam. Roam is a business strategist and founder of Digital Roam, a management-consulting firm that uses visual thinking to solve complex problems. They use a simple approach to solving problems visually. Every idea is run through five basic questions to encourage engaged thinking and to ensure a meaningful meeting. The process takes the acronym SQVI^. S is for simple or elaborate, Q is for qualitative or quantitative, V is for vision or execution, I am for individual or comparison, and ^ is for change or status quo. These simple choices are worked through with simple doodles in order to better understand the problem and find a solution. In their book, Roam says:
“What if there was a way to more quickly look at problems, more intuitively understand them, more confidently address them, and more rapidly convey to others what we've discovered? What if there was a way to make business problem-solving more efficient, more effective, and — as much as I hate to say it — perhaps even more fun? There is. It's called visual thinking, and it's what this book is all about: solving problems with pictures.”
After discovering Roam's book, I decided to doodle again. Once a prolific doodler and drawer, I had become inactive in lectures and similar settings, often forgetting what was said. Taking notes felt too cumbersome, and I often missed words and ideas. I decided to give doodling another shot. Instead of focusing on specifics, I would focus on concepts, key words and ideas.
Since 2011, I have been actively promoting doodling in my design classes, making a deal with my students, saying to them, “Doodle to your heart's content, but in return I want you to doodle the content of my lectures.” They are skeptical at first, but they soon realize that doodling is better than having a quiz. I reap the benefits of doodling, and by allowing them to doodle — with the requirement that it be based on the class' content — they become more informed of the topic and they engage in more meaningful conversations about design.
A designer's best friend: a sketchpad.
The typographic novices in my classes naturally start to apply the principles of visual hierarchy and organization, grouping ideas either by importance or by category. They will group ideas with lines, boxes, marks and more. Headings and lecture titles might be made larger, more ornate or bolder, and key concepts might be visually punctuated. It is fascinating how natural and almost second-nature the idea of visual hierarchy is to all of us. The learning curve of typography is steep for some of us, but doodling and sketchnotating really makes it easier to grasp. Below are some doodles by students in my classes.
Doodle by Alisa Roberts from my “Introduction to Typography” course.
By picking out concepts, ideas and topics, the students start to establish a hierarchy by making visual groupings and start to use visual punctuation. By the time I assign work on typographic hierarchy, the sketches tend to show more astuteness. Transferring these sketches to the computer is a challenge for those new to typography, but once they naturally understand the relationships in what they are doing, they start to make smarter design decisions.
Doodle by Aubrie Lamb from my “Identity and Branding” course.
Another by Aubrie Lamb from the same course.
As we have seen, doodling has many benefits, beyond what designers as visual communicators and problem solvers use it for. Doodling also helps our brain function and process data. Those of us who doodle should do so without feeling guilty or ashamed. We are in good company. Historically, doodlers have included presidents, business moguls and accomplished writers. Designer, educator and speaker Jason Santa Maria says this:
“Sketchbooks are not about being a good artist. They're about being a good thinker.”
Doodling, drawing pictures and sketchnotating are about using visual skills to solve problems, to understand our world and to respond effectively. So, what are you waiting for? Doodle!

They don't really have a lot of choice after all they do need those jobs, but there is another part of the equation that can be altered, and even if it won't make a difference this year, maybe we can start to make a difference for the future and, at the very least, turn back the tide on this insane policy that is eroding a holiday that most everyone has been able to take for at least the last 70 years.
To that point I posted on my Facebook Page the following:
I will not shop on Thanksgiving or before 10am the next day. Though I would enjoy the possible savings I feel that quality of life for all workers if more important that a few big screen TVs on strong mark down. I will always choose stores that do not participate in blatantly anti-worker behavior over any discount. I am looking at you Walmart, Target, and Best Buy.
I also asked all my FB friends to take the same pledge and repost it. It is a small thing, I know, but again, what would you be if you didn't even try? The retailers have folks who monitor social media pretty closely and if we could start to show a cost for them enacting policies that harm not only their workers but all workers then it is possible that they might reconsider.
After all what is it exactly that you might get if you went to one of these sales? The general idea from the retail perspective is to offer some higher ticket items (usually electronics) at a big markdown. But the thing is they only have a certain number of them and when they are gone you can't get as good a deal, but since you are already in the store, you are likely to buy other things.
Does that feel manipulative to anyone else? Is there any reason to let big companies program us to act in ways that are all in their interests and not in our own? Maybe it is just me getting old and cranky but I feel that it is important to resist being programmed by any group to behave in a certain way, especially when I know they don't care at all about my interests, just the bottom line.
I recognize that there are some folks who have really pinched budgets. As someone who spent the last two years below the poverty level, it is no joke and there are times when you might do things that you would not do otherwise. I am not talking to those folks, if the only way that you are going to be able to afford a reasonably nice gift for your child for the holidays is to take advantage of one of these sales, then go for it and here is a wish that your situation improves in the new year.
However I know the demographics of the readers here at Daily Kos and for the most part we are professionals with good steady jobs who have actual disposable income. To you folks I am asking for a little solidarity with the workers. Think of it this way; is it worth waiting and, perhaps, paying $100 or even $200 more for something you were going to buy anyway, if it means that we help stand up for low wageworkers?
Personally that is a deal that I am willing to take and do whenever I can. The history of Labor in this nation shows a clear pattern, when the workers stand together things improve for everyone. For too long we have bought into the premise that we are all on our own and we should not think about the larger costs to us as a group for things like cheap apparel and electronics.
The cost of this has been a major decline in Union membership and as a result larger and larger income inequality. Never forget that the wealthy are not shy about turning that money into political power. It is only by taking stands when and where we can that we can assert the vast power that the 98% really own.
So, there it is Kossacks. I know I am trying to sweep back the tide. It will not have an effect this season but maybe, just maybe we can get people started thinking about it, and if we could get just 5% of those who've been just following along because it seems like a good deal to say “Enough is Enough! I want my holiday back.!” We can change the trajectory of something that is hard on all workers and extremely unfair to low-wage workers in particular.
So, please join me in taking this pledge and getting it out on all the social media.
The floor is yours.
Last week during CES, Verizon quietly increased its upgrade fee from $20 up to $30. This charge is applied whenever a customer either buys a phone outright or splits payments up monthly with Verizon's device payment plans.
Those are pretty much the only valid ways to buy phones from Verizon at this point, since the company also got rid of two-year contracts last week — this time for good. Subsidized contract pricing had remained available to existing customers after being phased out for new subscribers in 2015. (The upgrade fee had been an even more expensive $40 for contract customers.) The $30 upgrade fee is separate from the activation fee that Verizon applies whenever you set up a new line of service.
T-Mobile CEO John Legere blasted Verizon for the change last week, but it's not like their own company doesn't sneak this stuff in: T-Mobile charges anyone not upgrades via Jump and Jump On Demand a $20 “assisted services fee” when upgrading in stores or through customer support. (Buying online avoids the fee.) AT&T and Sprint also have upgrade fees of their own, so it's an industry-wide practice that's usually justified with vague and super generic explanations. “These fees help cover increased cost to provide customers with America's largest and fastest 4G LTE network,” Verizon told Ars Technica when asked about the latest increase. A request for greater specificity didn't do much; Verizon added only that the upgrade fee goes towards “ongoing costs to maintain and enhance the network,
Separately, Verizon has recently been communicating to employees the threshold it's using to decide when grandfathered unlimited data customers are hogging up an unfair share of the network: it's 200GB, according to Droid Life. Customers who exceed an average of 200GB monthly will be ordered to switch to one of Verizon's tiered data buckets. Failing that, their lines will be disconnected entirely. Apparently Verizon would rather get rid of a customer than deal with them gobbling up hundreds of gigabytes. Customers notified they've crossed the line in January must switch to a new Verizon plan by February 16th.
Rural residents are “furious” the city wants to tap them for fees to manage a stormwater network largely based in the urban area, one community leader says.
“All of a sudden they get dinged for something that is an inner city issue,” Klaus Beltzner said Wednesday.
Beltzner, president of the Manotick Village and Community Association, said it's unfair to make rural property owners pay into the annual $42-million stormwater program because they don't get the same benefits as urban landowners. When they asked the city's finance department last year how much it costs each year to maintain ditches and culverts, they received citywide figures that ranged between $1.5 million and $2.6 million over seven years.
It would be more equitable for rural property owners who don't currently pay water and sewer rates to pay for the actual cost of providing stormwater services in their communities, Beltzner said.
“It's a small amount the rurals owe the city for stormwater management,” Beltzner said. “Don't make the rurals pay for the full $42 million.”
The city is considering charging all property owners in Ottawa a stormwater fee. Landowners who are hooked into the municipal drinking water and sewer systems already pay for stormwater services through their water bills. That means landowners who don't have water meters, such as properties with private well and septic services and parking lots, aren't paying the city for projects to manage rainfall and snowmelt.
The city has estimated there are more than 45,000 properties without water meters, including about 300 properties downtown. The city says it doesn't make sense to have water and sewer ratepayers shoulder the full cost of stormwater management when all properties with impervious surfaces cause runoff.
While a change to charging for stormwater services is likely, council will need to decide how to distribute the cost, either through a flat fee, a levy based on property values or a levy based on the amount of impervious surface on properties.
The fee has been nicknamed “rain tax” in other cities. Greg Thurlow, chair of the Osgoode Village Community Association, offered another label: “Tax grab.”
Thurlow said bitterness over how city hall treats the rural areas runs deep in their part of the municipality. Forcing a stormwater fee on property owners just fuels residents' anger, they said.
“It is really a situation that has opened up an old wound. It goes back to amalgamation,” Thurlow said.
Stormwater costs were worked into water bills at amalgamation. Now, water accounts aren't generating enough revenue to pay the full tab for water, sewer and stormwater programs.
The affordability of a proposed storm sewer fee, which is estimated at the $5-6 range per month as a flat rate, isn't the main concern for residents. Rather, it's the notion of rural residents paying more money for services they perceive will fund storm sewers in the urban areas, Thurlow said.
“I don't care what amount money it is, they won't want to pay it based on that principle,” Thurlow said.
Thurlow said he's confident residents in their community who oppose the fee will get support from Osgoode Coun. George Darouze.
In an interview this week, Darouze said they were still giving thought to the staff proposal. “We're still working on the nuts and bolts of it,” they said.
Other rural communities are just learning about the city's stormwater proposal.
Greg Patacairk, president of the Dunrobin Community Association, said residents in the village will be eager to learn more about why the city wants to charge property owners a fee. They planned to discuss the city's intentions at an association meeting Wednesday night.
The city is holding seven public consultations before sending recommendations to the environment committee and council.

As all eyes turned to the violent conclusion of Sydney hostage crisis, a different tragedy was unfolding closer to home: A gunman killed at least six and wounded three in Montgomery County, Penn., and remains at large.
Police seek thirty-five year old Bradley William Stone, who authorities believe went on a killing spree Monday morning, with all of the victims related to him.  They are described as 5'10” and 195 pounds, with a red beard and short hair. [UPDATE — 5:03 p.m. ET: Stone is reportedly an ex-U.S. Marine.]
The shootings occurred at various sites, some as far apart as twenty miles. Neighbors recounted hearing gunshots at a woman's house between 4 and 5 a.m., and said a man was seen taking children from the home. Their mother was found dead of a gunshot by police, though the children are reported to have been discovered safe.
At one point Stone was believed to have been cornered; however, they are now believed to be on the loose.
FWIW, the three major cable networks combined for only nine brief mentions of the shooting, compared to blanket coverage of the Sydney hostage situation.

Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com
The Kaiser Convention Center (formerly known as the Oakland Auditorium) has hosted all kinds of events, from Motown concerts to roller derbies, over the years. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke there in 1962. The Black Panthers held a conference there in 1969. The Grateful Dead played the venue dozens of times.In 1924, a much more sinister gathering took place in the historic structure: more than 8000 Ku Klux Klan members gathered there for a cross burning ceremony (yes, they actually burned huge crosses inside the auditorium). Fortunately, the East Bay's KKK movement didn't last long — their rise and fall all happened around the time of the 1920s. But they made an impact that changed Oakland forever.During this era, Oakland's city government didn't have the ability to provide the kinds of public services modern city dwellers expect. So, politicians signed contracts with big corporations to manage things like water and public transportation. Since the contracts gave these companies monopolies and they controlled who got jobs, they were the ones with real power in town.This system of political patronage ran pretty smoothly for decades — until the ethnic demographics of Oakland shifted rapidly. Thousands of San Francisco refugees flocked here following the 1906 earthquake, and then Oakland annexed a large chunk of territory east of 23rd avenue in 1909, resulting in the city's population more than doubling that decade.Before this influx, City Hall was controlled by Catholic politicians who represented constituencies of mostly working class Irish, Italian, Greek and Portuguese immigrants. The newcomers were mainly middle class Protestants of English, German and Scandinavian stock — and they resented the corrupt, inefficient “political machine” that failed to provide adequate, affordable public services to their neighborhoods in the newly incorporated East Oakland.At this same time, the Ku Klux Klan was surging in popularity across the nation after being essentially defunct for several decades. KKK-affiliated politicians won governorships or U.S. Senate seats in Colorado, Indiana, Kansas, and Oregon, as well as several Southern states during this era. Altogether, it recruited about 4-5 million members nationally, making it what some historians think was the largest right-wing movement organization in American history. According to Chris Rhomberg, author of No There There: Race, Class and Political Community in Oakland, when the KKK launched an Oakland chapter, “the Klan was able to capitalize” on animosity against City Hall “in order to win popular support.”Where did African-American residents fits into this equation? Since the Oakland Klan was trying to take power from a political machine that was mainly composed of Irish and other Catholic groups, they weren't focused on the Black community as a political target. Klansmen were certainly racist and opposed African-Americans moving into “their” neighborhoods, but those kinds of attitudes were also shared by many, if not most, white people at the time. The cross burnings were held in public parks, such as Tilden, and were used primarily as publicity stunts to gain media attention as opposed to those in the Deep South, which were more likely to occur in front of black churches and homes.Although it may seem counter-intuitive for a pseudo-secret society to seek publicity, the coverage worked in the Klan's favor. For a modern analogy, look no further than Donald Trump's rise to the presidency, which was undoubtedly boosted by the media's non-stop coverage of their racist antics. And similarly to Trump's “drain the swamp” message, Klan-affiliated politicians campaigned on an anti-corruption platform coupled with ethnic resentment and a strong dose of victimized entitlement.This strategy got several Klansmen elected to powerful positions, and they were able to gain the kind of influence in City Hall that they had been fighting for. What happened next may not shock those of you familiar with politics. “The problem was that once in power, the Klan politicians proved to be even more corrupt,” Rhomberg said. “In Alameda County, law enforcement, Sheriff Burton Becker, who was a Klan member, took over and began to extract bribes from bootleggers [after running a campaign that demonized alcohol and taverns].”Another Klan member, who was elected as city commissioner of streets, basically started selling off street-paving contracts to the highest bidder. Unsurprisingly, the crooked contractors did shoddy work, and the roads started falling apart shortly after being built.Unlike the previous political machine, which had decades to fine-tune its shady practices, the Klan's incompetent regime started crumbling right away. Earl Warren, who would go on to become chief justice of the Supreme Court, was the new Alameda County District Attorney. They wanted to make a name for themselves by exposing corruption in City Hall — and that's exactly what they did.Once the KKK-affiliated politicians went down, the rest of the local organization quickly crumbled.A coalition of downtown business owners, led by conservative Oakland Tribune publisher William Knowland, used this opportunity to maneuver itself into power, and this elite network of wealthy white men would control Oakland for the next several decades. But that story is another chapter in the city's government's long history of dysfunctional democracy.
SCP-175
Item #: SCP-175
Object Class: Safe
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-175 is to be kept in a metal safe when not undergoing testing. The safe is to be secured in a storage room at Site-███, with other low-maintenance SCPs. The room will be guarded by two security guards at all times in accordance with security protocol [DATA EXPUNGED].
Description: When not “active,” SCP-175 resembles a yellowed piece of parchment, slightly larger than a standard piece of paper. The edges are torn, and it appears weathered and brittle. However, SCP-175 is actually quite supple and is indestructible despite its worn appearance, having resisted all attempts to remove pieces for testing.
The more interesting properties of SCP-175 are revealed when moved in relative proximity to a buried object. The proximity range seems to vary under unknown parameters: SCP-175 has become “active” in distances from as short as 30 meters to as far as several kilometers. However, on average the distance ranges between 100 and 200 meters.
When SCP-175 becomes “active,” its appearance changes to become either a map, a set of directions to the buried object, or some hybrid thereof. Though the approximate size and shape of SCP-175 remain constant, its appearance may change to resemble various other paper and parchment varieties, and the writing or drawing implement and style vary as well, seemingly based on the mindset of the individual or individuals who buried the object. For a partial list of buried objects and their buriers, see Document 175-08.
If the buried object is dug up, or the map is removed from the proximity of the object, SCP-175 reverts back to its normal state.
Document #175-08: Partial list of buriers, buried objects, and appearances of SCP-175. All experiments took place at [DATA EXPUNGED] unless otherwise stated.
Dr. ███████ buried a wooden box. SCP-175 became a piece of graph paper, with a pencil-drawn map of the surrounding area, complete with a legend in the bottom-left. The location of the treasure was clearly marked. Dr. ███████ remarked that the handwriting on SCP-175 looked identical to their own.
████ ██████, a 5-year-old female child of Dr. █████, was instructed to bury a wooden box with a couple of their toys in it. SCP-175 became a crayon-drawn map of the surrounding area on a white piece of paper, clearly modeled on the style of a normal child of that age.
███████ ████, a 10-year-old male child of Agent █████, was instructed to bury a box containing some of their comic books. SCP-175 became a list of instructions on lined yellow paper, based on several landmarks in the area (trees, rocks, etc). The instructions included where to start, and how many paces to take to the next landmark, the direction to turn, and eventually, where to dig. The instructions were complete with misspellings appropriate for the knowledge of a child of that age.
████ ████████, a well-respected professional landscape artist, was instructed to bury an empty wooden box. SCP-175 became a canvas with an accurately painted overhead view of the surrounding area, with an “x” to mark the spot where the box was buried.
█████████ ███████, a professional puzzle-maker and crossword-puzzle maker, was instructed to bury a wooden box. SCP-175 became a piece of graph paper with several inked crossword and various other word puzzles, along with a meta-puzzle. Solving the smaller puzzles was necessary to find the letters to solve the meta-puzzle, which was a list of instructions for where to find the buried object.
Agent █████, who remembered a box with various objects that they had buried in their backyard at the age of 8, traveled with a research team to [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-175 became a pencil-drawn map of the surrounding area, along with labels that did not match their current handwriting, but did match their handwriting from papers their parents had kept that they had done at that age. Most remarkably, the map included several trees that had been cut down in the years since the box was buried.
A D-class personnel who had been a professional architect before their conviction as a serial killer was instructed to bury a wooden box. [DATA EXPUNGED]. For full details, those with sufficient clearance should see Addendum 175-13.
During transport of SCP-175, along with numerous other safe SCPs to [DATA EXPUNGED], one of the guards in the truck reported a high-pitched whine coming from the crate containing SCP-175. As per protocol, the truck was stopped and evacuated, and the nearest task force, Mobile Task Force Omega-7 (Pandora's Box) was sent to investigate after being briefed on the contents of the crate. According to the debrief, they found a sheet of metal which was emitting the whine, and the sound increased in pitch and volume as they neared a specific location. Digging in this area uncovered SCP-███, at which point the metal sheet reverted to the “inactive” state of SCP-175.
Addendum 175-13: On ███████, a D-class personnel who had been a professional architect prior to their conviction as a serial killer was instructed to bury a wooden box; the intended purpose of this experiment was to see what SCP-175 would look like when buried by an architect. When Dr. ██████ looked at SCP-175, once the box was buried, they immediately screamed, dropped to their knees, clutching their head with both hands, dropping SCP-175 to the ground, luckily, face-down. Agent ████, who was standing by the side of Dr. ██████ during this experiment, reported a flickering mass of color and a sense of extreme nausea at a glimpse of SCP-175 before it drifted to the ground. They quickly dug up the box, in order to reset SCP-175. Dr. ███████ went into a coma after this incident, and intense psychological screening of the D-class subject revealed a well-hidden schizophrenia and sociopathy. Since this experiment, strict protocol has been put in place to protect the mental health of researchers.
Valtteri Bottas has opened the door for a move away from Williams in 2016
Valtteri Bottas has opened the door for a move away from Williams stating they want “to be in the quickest car available" in 2016.
The former GP3 champion was signed by Williams in 2010 and graduated to a race seat in 2013, qualifying a remarkable third at the Canadian Grand Prix in a car which only finished ahead of Marussia and Caterham in the constructors' championship.
Bottas was described by Sir Frank Williams as "quite simply one of the most talented young racing drivers I have come across," ahead of their debut with their team and the veteran team owner is a very well-qualified judge, of course, having launched the F1 careers of race winners Juan Pablo-Montoya, David Coulthard and Nico Rosberg along with world champions Jacques Villeneuve and Damon Hill.
But despite getting their break with Williams, Bottas gave a coy response when asked if they would be replacing Kimi Raikkonen at Ferrari in 2016.
“I don't know anything about Kimi's contract,” Bottas told the official Formula 1 website. “All I know is that I want to be in the quickest car available. That's all I can say.
“I don't know if there is (interest). Maybe this is a question for my management…”
Bottas finished the 2014 season a podium in Abu Dhabi and they are hoping they can kick off the new campaign in similar style, having had to wait until Austria to take home their first silverware last year.
“The car is pretty similar, but a bit improved,” they added.
“It is hard to say where that puts us compared to the others – how much they have improved over the winter – so the first couple of races will show a clearer picture. My gut feeling is that it's going to be a good year. I am pretty upbeat because I see that they are making the right calls in this team.
“If we could start the season at the level we finished last year that would be really good. I know that we are capable of still improving a lot, so if we could start at a good level I would be happy at the beginning of the season to fight for podiums – and then later on challenge for wins.”
Third-place in the constructors' championship last year represented Williams' best result since 2003, while Bottas' podium at the Red Bull Ring was their first since Pastor Maldonado won the Spanish GP in 2012.

MIT economist Jonathan Gruber (AP Photo)
(CNSNews.com) - One of Obamacare's architects, Jonathan Gruber, says the government run healthcare plan doesn't need to be “fixed” it just needs “a larger mandate penalty.”
Speaking on CNN Wednesday, the MIT economics professor defended Obamacare and its price increases for participating healthcare plans across the country.
“Look, once again - there is no sense in which this has to be fixed, the law is working as designed,” Gruber said. “However, it could work better – and I think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that we need a larger mandate penalty.”
“We have individuals who are essentially free-riding on the system, they're essentially waiting until they get sick and then getting health insurance. The whole idea of this plan, which was pioneered in Massachusetts, was that the individual mandate penalty would bring those people into the system and have them participate.”
“The penalty right now is probably too low and I think that's something that ideally we would fix,” Gruber added.
When the Supreme Court ruled President Obama's Affordable Care Act constitutional, they did so by claiming the individual mandate payment for not having insurance was a tax instead of a penalty.
In their majority opinion, Justice John Roberts wrote, “The Affordable Care Act's requirement that certain individuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax. Because the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.”
Mere days before Facebook are expected to begin public trading, the company has made another acquisition: it's hired the entire seven-member team of Lightbox, a camera and photo sharing app for Android. The Lightbox team announced the move today, and Facebook has confirmed it to AllThingsD, saying that "the Lightbox team has incredible experience developing innovative mobile products that people love." It's one of a few mobile-focused purchases for Facebook, which bought similar service Instagram last month.
Unlike Instagram, Lightbox as a dedicated service will not survive the transition. According to the team, Facebook is "not acquiring the company or any of the user data hosted on Lightbox.com." Instead, the team will shut the site down in preparation for joining Facebook. New users can no longer sign up for Lightbox, and current members have until June 15th to download their photos. After that, Lightbox will be making portions of the code open source and posting it to a repository.
Update: We've since learned that one member of Lightbox actually won't be joining Facebook. Creative Director Giles Peyton-Nicoll will instead be launching a London-based design consulting business.
Story highlights A popular Chinese dictionary has left out the "gay" definition of a word used to describe homosexuals
The term "tongzhi" traditionally means comrade but has evolved to refer to gay men and lesbians
Compilers of the dictionary said they didn't want to encourage that use of the word
Activists and linguists are angered at the omission saying it's not right to leave out a widely-used word
A newly published edition of an authoritative Chinese dictionary has come under fire for leaving out the homosexual definition of a word commonly used to refer to gay men and lesbians.
The word "tongzhi" traditionally means "comrade" and has been widely used by the Communist Party. But in recent decades the word has evolved to refer to homosexuals.
The committee charged with revising and updating the dictionary said they chose to leave out the definition because they didn't want to encourage its use, the director of the committee Jiang Langsheng told Chengdu Business Daily
The dictionary, which had its sixth edition published July 15, is one of the most renowned sources of information in China. According to CNTV this latest edition contains 69,000 entries -- an increase of 4,000 from the fifth edition published in 2005.
"It's unacceptable that the 'gay' meaning of 'tongzhi' was excluded from the dictionary, a reference book written for all, simply because of the compilers' own preferences and values," Nan Feng, a gay rights activist told the state-run news agency Xinhua
"Tongzhi" serves as a substitute for "tongxinglian," which is the formal Chinese term for homosexuality. The 2005 edition of the Contemporary Chinese Dictionary defines "tongxinglian" both as same-sex love and as a psychosexual disorder, according to Xinhua.
Homosexuality's classification as a mental disorder was removed in China in 2001, despite the dictionary's definition.
Like activists, linguists are also unhappy with the decision to leave out a term that is widely used in daily Chinese dialogue.
"There have always been good words and bad ones," Cui Yan, a planning editor for Science and Technology Document Press, told Beijing Business Daily . "But they are all linguistic phenomena. Just because the dictionary doesn't include them doesn't mean they don't exist."
Across the web, people have spoken out about the lack of the colloquial definition of "tongzhi."
The Pittsburgh Penguins have recalled forward Nick Drazenovic (DRUH-zehn-oh-vihk) from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League (AHL), it was announced by executive vice president and general manager Ray Shero.
Drazenovic, 27, currently places fifth on WBS with 20 points (7G-13A) in 26 games this season.
Last season the 6-foot, 192-pound Drazenovic split the campaign between the Columbus Blue Jackets and their top minor-league affiliate, the Springfield Falcons of the AHL. Drazenovic competed in eight NHL games with Columbus.
Drazenovic spent the majority of the '12-13 season with Springfield, establishing career highs in assists (36) and points (53) in 62 regular-season games. Their 53 points ranked second on the team and 17th in the AHL. They added four points (2G-2A) in eight postseason games.
A native of Prince George, British Columbia, Drazenovic was originally drafted by the St. Louis Blues in the sixth round (171st overall) of the 2005 NHL Draft. They made their NHL debut with the Blues during the 2010-11 season, playing three games. Drazenovic has played a total of 11 career NHL regular-season games with St. Louis and Columbus.
Drazenovic has played seven seasons at the AHL level with Springfield, Peoria and WBS, totaling 274 points (107G-167A) in 407 career regular-season games. They have six points (3G-3A) in 17 career postseason games.
Prior to turning pro Drazenovic played five seasons with the Prince George Cougars of the Western Hockey League (WHL) from 2002-07, registering 77 goals, 137 assists and 214 points in 281 regular-season games.
Forward Joe Vitale has been placed on injured reserve retroactive to Jan. 10.

“There was a time when we proclaimed that we were part of a beautiful and fragmented chaos of affinity groups, conflicted organizations, disorganized rebels, all of whom were somehow part of the same social movement that was greater than the sum of its parts. We were more accurately a disorganized mob of enraged plebeians shaking our fists at a disciplined imperial army. Years ago we spoke of social movementism but now it only makes sense to drop the ‘social' since this phase of confusion was incapable of understanding the social terrain. Disparate, unfocused, and divided movements lack a unified intentionality; they have proved themselves incapable of pursuing the necessity of communism.”
The Communist Necessity is a polemical interrogation of the practice of “social movementism” that has enjoyed a normative status at the centres of capitalism. Despite the fact that the name “communism” has been reclaimed by a variety of important intellectuals, J. Moufawad-Paul argues that, due to a failure to grapple with the concrete questions connected to historical moments of actually making revolution, movementist praxis remains hegemonic. More of a philosophical intervention than a historiography or political economy, The Communist Necessity engages in a quick and pointed manner with a variety of authors and tendencies including Alain Badiou, Jodi Dean, the Invisible Committee, Tiqqun, Théorie Communiste, and others. Moufawad-Paul argues that a refusal to recognize contemporary revolutionary movements from the 1980s to the present results in the reification of a capitalist “end of history” discourse within this movementist conceptualization of theory and practice.
Originally written as a small essay on the left-wing blog MLM Mayhem, The Communist Necessity has been expanded into a pocket-sized treatise that sketches out the boundaries of the movementist terrain, as well as its contemporary ideologues, so as to raise questions that may be uncomfortable for those who are still devoted to movementist praxis, particularly if they define themselves as marxist. Aware of their past affinity with social movementism, and some apprehension of the problem of communist orthodoxy, the author argues that the recognition of communism's necessity “requires a new return to the revolutionary communist theories and experiences won from history.”
The medium shapes the message. Manga often focuses on action and epic. Much of the Bible, as a result, ends up on the cutting room floor, and what remains are darker.
“It is the end of the Word as we know it, and the end of a certain cultural idea of the Scriptures as a book, as the Book,” Timothy Beal, professor of religion at Case Western Reserve University, said of the reworking of the Bible in new forms, including manga. “It opens up new ways of understanding Scripture and ends up breaking the idols a bit.”
While known for characters with big eyes and catwalk poses, manga is also defined by a laconic, cinematic style, with characters often doing more than talking.
In a blurb for the Manga Bible, which is published by Doubleday, the archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Rowan Williams, is quoted as saying, “It will convey the shock and freshness of the Bible in a unique way.”
No doubt. In the Manga Bible, whose heroes look and sound like skateboarders in Bedouin gear, Noah gets tripped up counting the animals in the Ark: “That's 11,344 animals? Arggh! I've lost count again. I'm going to have to start from scratch!”

Abraham rides a horse out of an explosion to save Lot. Og, king of Bashan, looms like an early Darth Vader. The Sermon on the Mount did not make the book, though, because there was not enough action to it.
The Manga Bible sold 30,000 copies in Great Britain, according to Doubleday. The print run in this country is 15,000, and it sells for $12.95.

Mr. Akinsiku, 42, who uses the pen name Siku, grew up in England and Nigeria in an Anglican family of Nigerian descent. They recently graduated from theology school in London. For years, they have worked as an artist, and a rendering of the Bible was the best way of glorifying God, they said in a telephone interview from London.

While younger adults and teenagers are the most avid consumers of manga, Mr. Akinsiku said they had heard from grandmothers who picked up the book as a gift for their grandchildren. The book is meant to be a first taste of the Bible, which many feel too intimidated to read, Mr. Akinsiku said. Every few pages, a small tab refers to the biblical verses the action covers.
“For the unchurched, the book is to show that this thing, the Bible, is still relevant,” they said, “because it talks about what human beings do when they encounter God.”
Christian thinkers have tried to make the Bible accessible for centuries, scholars said. Stained glass windows related Bible stories when Europe was largely illiterate. New printing technology in the 19th century made it possible to mass-produce Bibles, including illustrated versions, said Peter J. Thuesen, acting chairperson of religious studies at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.
As literacy rose (and marketing flowered), individual families bought Bibles. In the 1960s and 1970s, books like the Living Bible and the Way came out, written in vernacular English, although scholars criticize their accuracy.
In the past decade, as consumer products have been directed at niche markets and religious services tailored to different groups, publishers have made more money by creating Bibles to serve certain groups, said Lynn Schofield Clark, director of the Estlow International Center for Journalism and New Media at the University of Colorado.
A few years ago, for example, the religious publisher Thomas Nelson issued a Bible for teenage girls called Revolve, which looked like a glossy magazine. It sold 40,000 copies in a month, Ms. Clark said, a staggering number for a Bible.
The goal of the Bibles is not just to win people to Christ, but to particular ways of thinking, said Jason BeDuhn, associate professor of religious studies at Northern Arizona University. Mr. Akinsiku said the biblical message they wanted to underscore was justice, especially for the poor.
Their book has been criticized by some manga bloggers as too wordy. Mr. Akinsiku said the exposition gave readers a quick understanding of the Bible. Their next project is a manga life of Christ. They have 300 pages to lay it out, which means there will be a lot more action, a lot less talking, something like Clint Eastwood in the Galilee.
Bedgear Training Camp Practice Report: Seth Curry Mavs G Seth Curry talks to reporters after the team's Open Practice Wednesday.
There's only so much you can deduce from watching a scrimmage just 24 hours after a team comes together for the first time, but there were still a few takeaways from today's Mavs Open Practice on Day 2 of the preseason, presented by bedgear.

If you missed out, you can check out the stream on the Mavs' Facebook page.
Here are some thoughts after watching:
— Seth Curry can really play. The first-year Maverick mostly played off-guard next to Jonathan Gibson (those two seemed to have very nice synergy), so they did more shooting than facilitating, leading all scorers with 15 points. They knocked down three straight shots midway through the 20-minute game, and another trey would have counted if they hadn't stepped out of bounds as they caught the ball in the corner. They also delivered a couple nice assists to teammates, including one on a smooth dump-off to Dorian Finney-Smith for a dunk.
Curry is one of the most exciting players on the roster, and it's not only because of their last name. The 26-year-old is still somewhat raw by NBA standards, having played only one full season in the league to this point, but they can shoot the lights out and began showing their ability to run offense toward the end of last season while still in Sacramento. Where exactly they fit in the rotation is still unknown to us — and to him, they said, at least as far as which position he'll primarily play — but if today was any preview of how he'll play this season, their role will take care of itself. They looked very sharp.
— Much was made of A.J. Hammons' motor immediately after the Mavs drafted them No. 46 overall in June, and it was a big storyline while the team competed at Summer League in Las Vegas. But Hammons never appeared to be noticeably tired today, despite the game being played at times at a pretty fast tempo. In fact, they looked much more comfortable today than they did in Vegas, and Rick Carlisle said they were pleased with Hammons' effort level. They worked on the block offensively, making a nice turnaround hook shot on one trip down the floor. They blocked two shots on defense, as well, one of which was a pretty authoritative rejection of Gibson, point-blank at the rim. He's got the size and touch to play center in the NBA, so if they can continue improving their physical build, they can be a good player in this league for a long time.
— Justin Anderson led the winning Blue team in scoring, with nine points. It took them and the other players a few minutes to find a rhythm, but once they did they looked effective, knocking down a 3-pointer and throwing down a dunk on a fast break. After practice on Tuesday, Anderson and Curry were working with new Mavs player development coach God Shammgod on their handles. Anderson working to add an off-the-dribble game was a big talking point toward the end of last season and over the summer as it relates to what they must do to take the next step offensively. They didn't spend too much time handling the ball in today's scrimmage, but I wonder if, as the season wears on, they might spend more time on the ball — should their work with the legendary Shammgod be fruitful. (There will be more on the new coach soon.)
— Kyle Collinsworth, the D-I triple-double record-holder from BYU, looked very comfortable facilitating today, leading all players with five assists. They played positions 1-3 in Las Vegas during the Summer League, and out there it appeared they were most successful in an off-guard role as a secondary or complementary playmaker. Today they were able to attack and penetrate both themselves and when playing off a teammate, and that's an ability that comes at a premium from the off-guard and wing spots in today's NBA. The Mavs are loaded at guard, so I wonder how much we'll see Collinsworth this Saturday against New Orleans, but I wonder if on the preseason roster they fit in best at the off-guard spot or the 1. Time will tell.
— Collinsworth, Gibson, Finney-Smith, Jameel Warney, Nicolas Brussino, Keith Hornsby, and C.J. Williams are all essentially competing for just two spots on the roster. I expect that to be a very competitive battle as camp wears on. Who's in the driver's seat for both spots could change by the day, given the hectic tempo of preseason. The Mavs play Saturday and Monday, so by then it might be clear who might have the strongest case to make for the 14th and 15th spots on the roster. Each player brings something different into the mix, too, which is what's going to make this such an interesting race. Rick Carlisle isn't lying when they say this is going to be an intense training camp.
Doctors are often perceived as benevolent professionals. They are hard-working individuals who extend their largesse by giving away free medical care to those in need. Studies by Cunningham and May (2006) and the American Hospital Association find that doctors provide uncompensated care equal to 6.3% or 5.6% of their cots annually respectively.
A recent Journal of Health Economics article by Gruber and Rodriguez concludes that these figures may be overstated. In fact, the study finds that physicians provide negative amounts of uncompensated care to the uninsured.
How is this possible? While it is true that doctors do give away free care to the uninsured and that many of those without insurance do not pay their bills, the uninsured patient often pay a large portion of the list price whereas those who have insurance receive a negotiated lower price. Thus, the authors find that “the majority of physicians actually make money, on net on their uninsured patients…12-14% of physicians found their uninsured patients more than twice as profitable as their insured patients; that is the net payments from the uninsured were more than twice the expected payments from the insured patients.”
Even when the authors ignore the higher list prices the uninsured pay, they still find that only about 1% of total revenues are given away as free care to the uninsured. Much of this amount, however, is due to non-payment by the patients rather than free care given away by the physicians.
Medicine may be a business after all.
The White House delivered a low blow on Friday, accusing congressional Republicans who are denying the president a chance to pitch their budget of pulling a "Donald Trump."
The raw feelings stem from the House and Senate Budget committees' announcement on Thursday that they won't invite Obama's budget director to Capitol Hill to discuss the administration's final several-hundred-page proposal, which is to be released on Tuesday.
Story Continued Below
White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Republicans' refusal to play ball was just as bad as Trump's refusal to take part in the last GOP debate after getting into a nasty spat with Fox News.
“They're just not going to show up,” Earnest said during the daily briefing, adding that the maneuver smacked of a "Donald Trump approach" to the debate over spending priorities. They then accused the GOP committee leaders of being wobbly knee'd, saying the boycott “raises some questions about how confident they are about the kinds of arguments that they could make.”
On Thursday, the chairpeople of the House and Senate Budget committees released a joint statement saying it simply wasn't worth their time to invite Office of Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan to discuss Obama's fiscal 2017 proposal.
“Rather than spend time on a proposal that, if anything like this administration's previous budgets, will double down on the same failed policies that have led to the worst economic recovery in modern times, Congress should continue our work on building a budget that balances and that will foster a healthy economy,” said Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.).
Earnest noted that the OMB director has been invited to the Hill to testify on the president's budget each of the past 16 years. Plans to break that tradition, they said, suggest the “future is pretty dim” for GOP leaders' goals of making Congress function again.
At the same time, Earnest acknowledged that Obama's budget isn't exactly designed to seek consensus, either. The White House's attitude is why bother, based on previous futile attempts to incorporate Republican ideas into the president's suggested line items.
“Those kinds of budget proposals that we acknowledged on the front end were a genuine effort to compromise didn't result in greater congressional action and certainly didn't result in a more productive conversation with Republicans,” Earnest said. “So I do think that you can expect to see some pretty bold ideas.”
Chief among them: a proposal previewed Thursday to add an oil tax of $10 per barrel to pay for investment in green transportation and research. Republicans have been more than happy to address — and savage — that proposal, which leaders called “dead on arrival.”
“Good grief,” said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton in a statement that cast the proposal as “ripped from The Onion.”
Rep. Upton (R-Mich.) continued, “The president's proposed new tax will hurt those most vulnerable. Jump-starting the economy by raising taxes is not a solution that will fly in the Republican Congress.”
Obama defended the proposal in remarks to reporters on Friday, saying the economy won't face as much disruption from the tax because gas prices are expected to stay low for a decade or two.
“What is also important is that we use this period where gas prices are low to accelerate a transition to a cleaner energy economy because we know that's not going to last,” Obama said, during an impromptu appearance at the top of the daily briefing.
The White House isn't under any illusions that the proposed tax will become law. Asked whether the president's last budget reflects a “YOLO” (you only live once) approach or more serious proposals, Earnest replied, “Those two things aren't necessarily contradictory.”
Earnest added, “We often say that budgets are an opportunity to be quite specific about where your priorities lay.”
Republicans' “voracious response” against the proposed oil tax shows that their priorities lie with the oil industry, Earnest said, while Obama is looking out for the middle class first.
Republicans appear eager to continue that debate.
"We look forward to seeing whether or not Senate Democrats will support this massive gas tax on American families, farmers and employers," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spokesperson Don Stewart said by email.
For now, at least, Hill Democrats are dragging their feet in following Obama's big, bold lead — and like Trump, are not yet showing up to the debate.

Description: C/SGT Davey learns of separate formations
Because Rasche is being torn down
1st Battalion will form up
along the VT here.
Because 3rd Battalion is so far away
They will form up in front of Thomas next to the road
I'm sure the formations will be coordinated
And morning colors will be preserved
Sir...
Third...
Third will only be taking accountability and then dismissing
They insisted that Third be completely separate
Everyone in 1st Battalion and 2nd Battalion leave now
What the hell are you thinking?
Why do you not want to form up with everyone else?
Does it take that long to walk around Lane?
Do you think
that because band is in third
you can do whatever you want?
You think because you are so far removed
you can do whatever you like?
Sir, but we will have "Battalion huddles"
Oh, I'm sorry, what the hell are battalion huddles?
Sir, they will be used to pass information
It sounds like they will be a complete waste of time!
The corps has become so stupid over the years
I joined for ROTC
They said the best units in the country were here
but they didn't tell me about the corps!
They sold me on empty promises of greatness
That I would receive a prestigious ELS
But it was all a lie!
I just want to focus on my ROTC and do as little with the corps as possible
They made me a senior sergeant
I could have been company commander
Or even Regimental Commander
Before the SNCO's
Things were great! You could go to formation in the wrong uniform, and no one would care!
Now I come back to my room to see a SNCO inspection card on my door
Now I have to go talk to the FSG
And they live all the way over in Monteith!
Do you know how far it is from Thomas to Monteith?
Don't worry, only 3rd does "Battalion huddles"
Every time I try and RAKT
Band decides to start practicing next door
They suck
I hate 3rd Battalion
I'm commissioning at the end of this year
And when they ask me to come back for a gunfighter's panel
I'll just delete the email.
Every maximal ideal is a prime ideal. The converse is true in a principal ideal domain – PID, i.e. every nonzero prime ideal is maximal in a PID, but this is not true in general. Let's produce a counterexample.
\(R= \mathbb Z[x]\) is a ring. \(R\) is not a PID as can be shown considering the ideal \(I\) generated by the set \(\{2,x\}\). \(I\) cannot be generated by a single element \(p\). If it was, \(p\) would divide \(2\), i.e. \(p=1\) or \(p=2\). We can't have \(p=1\) as it means \(R = I\) but \(3
otin I\). We can't have either \(p=2\) as it implies the contradiction \(x
otin I\). The ideal \(J = (x)\) is a prime ideal as \(R/J \cong \mathbb Z\) is an integral domain. Since \(\mathbb Z\) is not a field, \(J\) is not a maximal ideal.
A few hours before Stanford was getting ready to beat Texas on Saturday in the NCAA Tournament regional final, probably about the time the Cardinal was sitting down to a pregame meal, John Dunning and their wife, Julie, were driving to a party.
And not just any party. They were headed to Sunnyvale to be with the first Fremont High School basketball team that Dunning coached in the 1980s.
“They have this Christmas party and reunion every year and we miss it almost every year, because it's the same weekend as the regional,” Dunning said. “We decided this was a good opportunity.”
He's taken advantage of a lot of fun opportunities since retiring, not a month after Stanford won the NCAA title a year ago.
At age 66, they walked away. Not that they don't miss it.
“Yes, I do,” Dunning said. “Yeah, I miss it a lot.
“There's very little that I don't miss. But, then there's how many 8-year-old baseball games have I gone to, cross-country meets, and Tuesday I have a piano recital for my grand-daughter.
“Julie and I drove to Montana for a family vacation. I miss it, but there's all the other cool stuff I've been able to do.”
Dunning will be in Kansas City this week as a presenter at the AVCA Convention.
At 6 p.m. Wednesday, he's talking about “Coaching Evolution –- Growing, Learning and Improving as a Coach and Leader.” And then at 3:45 p.m. Friday, their topic is “Reflections on Setters I Have Coached and Training We Have Used.”
Dunning still works with Art of Coaching and does clinics and he's done some consulting, “for some clubs and some college folks. Just talking about coaching. That's a passion of mine and that part's been fun. There's still stuff running around in my head that maybe other people haven't talked about yet, so it's kind of cool.”
Dunning has been to three Stanford matches this season, including a special night on November 5 when the school honored Dunning and their family.
“When I went to watch Stanford or watched their other matches on TV, watching Kathryn (Plummer) and Morgan (Hentz) and Merete ( Lutz) and Jenna (Gray), and how happy I am for Tami Alade this year for how well she's done, and how well Megan (McClure) has done this year, stepping into a big role, and Audri (Fitzmorris), you know you have to miss the people, too. That's the thing you miss the most. There is stuff to miss when you loved it.”
Dunning, who coached in college for 32 years — and never missed the postseason — won back-to-back NCAA titles at Pacific and then coached 16 years at Stanford, where they won three more championships.
In January, they told the team they were leaving and then Stanford hired Kevin Hambly away from Illinois.
“I talked to them in the process, when they were approaching about the job to tell them a little bit about what it's like at Stanford, but it's an interesting situation. If they were replacing someone who had lost their job, there wouldn't be much contact there. That's kind of normal.”
True, not that many coaches retire as Dunning did, leaving the cupboard full.
“I really wanted them to be their own thing and so they and I haven't talked very much. And that's OK. I imagine down the road we might. But they needed it to be his. I haven't talked to the players very much, because I didn't want them to think I was interfering or anything like that.
“I've done a good job of keeping separate for their sake, which I thought was good.”
Dunning said they when they retired they were told to play a lot of golf to stay out of their wife's hair.
Julie's not sick of them and their golf game is improving.
“It's finally getting a little better,” Dunning said. “It's taken time, but yesterday I won 12 bucks, so I was a happy guy.”
UNITED NATIONS — The last of the chemicals to be shipped out of Syria contain the ingredients needed to make sarin, the lethal nerve agent used in the attack on a Damascus suburb last August, the United Nations official who is coordinating the arsenal's destruction said on Thursday.
The material is stored in an airfield controlled by President Bashar al-Assad's military forces not far from Damascus, and was transferred there from another site about 19 miles away that has since been overrun by insurgents in the civil war, the United Nations official, Sigrid Kaag, said in an interview.
“It is safe and secure,” they said, adding that the approximately 100 tons of chemical substances at the site go into making the nerve agent. “You've got the main ingredients, the precursors to produce sarin.”
Ms. Kaag said the last batch of the arsenal, which represents about 8 percent of the total declared by the Syrians, cannot be safely extracted yet because the roads to the location have not been secured by government forces. “There is a lot of fighting taking place,” they said. “It's not a situation where you would want a chemical weapons convoy passing through.”
Croatia is set to become the EU's newest member after its accession was approved in Brussels [Reuters]
Croatia has been approved to become the newest member of the European Union, offering hope to other nations from the former Yugoslavia seeking to join the economic and political bloc.
EU leaders gave the go-ahead for Croatia at a meeting in Brussels on Friday, following six years of preparations marred by slow democratic reforms in Zagreb and the EU's reluctance to expand.
Croatia, which is expected to join the EU in 2013, will be the first new admission since Bulgaria and Romania joined in 2007.
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso called the decision historic.
"I hope everything will be ready to welcome Croatia as the 28th member of the EU the first of July 2013," Barroso said at the end of the two-day summit of EU heads of government.
The former Yugoslav state of 4.4 million people should be able to wrap up accession negotiations next week, but the country was told that it must continue to fight widespread corruption with "vigour".
The recommendation marks a turnaround for Croatia, which struggled for years to convince the EU's 27 governments that its judiciary reforms would produce genuine results and prove it had recognised its role in the Balkan wars in the 1990s.
"Croatia is finally at the end of a long road of negotiations (with the EU), 20 years after it achieved independence," said Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor, who attended the meeting.
Croatia started membership talks in 2005 and will become the second former Yugoslav nation to join, following Slovenia, the richest country within the former Yugoslavia and a member since 2004.
Although it has completed the negotiations, Croatia will have to wait until 2013 before formally becoming a member because the parliaments of all 27 EU states must ratify its accession treaty.
The success of Croatia could now pave the way to membership for other Balkan countries.
Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia are all at various stages of the accession process.
Furthest along that road is Montenegro, which gained formal candidate status in December. It is expected to join in the next round of enlargement in 2015 or 2016. Other candidate countries are Turkey and Iceland.
Crackdown Fans Are Facing a Test of Patience for a Better Game
Earlier today Microsoft delivered news that its highly anticipated title for the Xbox One, Crackdown 3, is being delayed. Officially, the game has seen multiple delays, but the company simply feels that the current product needs more time in order to fulfill its promise of a quality experience.
Thus, as of today, Crackdown 3 has been moved from its November 2017 release date to Spring 2018. We could be looking at another six months of wait time. But Shannon Loftis, Publishing general manager for Microsoft Studios, says it's necessary for the dev teams, which include Sumo Digital, Reagent Games, and Cloudgine. Such is the report from Polygon:
“We're very excited about Crackdown 3, and so are many fans, and so it's a difficult call to move the release date. However, we want to make sure to deliver the right game, with the right quality, and at the right time. Crackdown 3 is a hugely ambitious game and we want to ensure we deliver the right experiences all the way through every part of the game, whether that's campaign, co-op multiplayer or our competitive multiplayer mode, Wrecking Zone. Getting the balance right between the three modes is important, and we are going to take the extra development time to ensure that. Gamers can expect Crackdown 3 in Spring of 2018.”
Crackdown 3, many will remember, is the innovative title designed to showcase Microsoft's cloud-based physics. Being an innovative IP, fans have patiently dealt with the fact that complex changes lead to delays. Back at E3 2014, the game shot for a 2016 release date. Three years later, this is where we are.
“Crackdown 3 is an incredibly ambitious project that pushes the technological envelope with immersive true 4K gameplay, cloud-computing competitive multiplayer and a sprawling and futuristic open world,” Loftis continued. “The team has been working extremely hard to deliver a great experience for fans and this extra time will help us do just that.”
With all the time spent on development, the game recently received some flak after new gameplay videos showcased what many fans considered less than ideal graphics. Despite all the merits of Crackdown 3‘s platform-based gameplay, the visuals have proven enough to curb enthusiasm. “Among other items, we are taking the extra time to focus on the visual polish so gamers can feel completely immersed in a living world,” said Loftis. Therefore, instead of pushing out a game that's fine, Microsoft is taking the extra time to make it the best that it can be.
Furthermore, according to Loftis, the change of release date brings another convenience. The latter end of 2017 promises several triple-A releases; therefore, Crackdown 3 is avoiding a crowded season.
“Not only are there several new Xbox exclusives such as Forza Motorsport 7, Cuphead, Super Lucky's Tale, and the console launch exclusive PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, there is an incredible list of titles coming this holiday including Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Assassin's Creed Origins, Call of Duty: WWII, Star Wars Battlefront II, Destiny 2, and more — with many of these titles enhanced to play better on Xbox One X. With so many great exclusives and new games to play, Crackdown 3 would have shipped into an incredibly crowded market.
“I'm proud of the progress and dedication the Crackdown 3 team has shown and their deep passion and love for this IP. We think it deserves the time we're giving it, we think our partners deserve the extra time, to ensure we deliver the experience that Crackdown fans deserve. We hope they love it as much as we do.”
As a result of this delay, Microsoft's new Xbox One X console will arrive without a launch title. Nevertheless, the company has promised better visuals on all exclusives. Considering the turn of events, however, what are your thoughts? Let us know your anticipation level for Crackdown 3 in the comments below.

A Hoax Call Made Punjab Teenager Believe That Google Hired Him At Rs 1.44 Cr Per Annum Salary
The family of Harshit Sharma, a 16-year-old school student from Chandigarh who made headlines a couple of days ago after it was reported that the teenager had been offered a graphic designer job in Google said they have been left devastated after it emerged that the job was a hoax.
According to their mother Bharti Sharma, Harshit had fallen victim to a hoax phone call which claimed that they had been selected for a ‘graphic artist' job in Google.
“Harshit got a phone call. We did not believe it at first. I kept telling them it could be a hoax. They shared the information with their school principal, who further released a press note, which led to media coverage,” Bharti told Hindustan Times.

According to report ever since Google officially denied hiring Harshit, the teenager has traumatised and is hospitalised.
The family said it was the school authorities that issued a press release and not them.
Indra Beniwal, the principal of the Government Model Senior Secondary School (GMSSS) where Harshit was a student said the family has admitted that their son has made a mistake.
"Harshit's parents have accepted that their son has committed a mistake (by claiming to have been selected by Google)," Ms Beniwal said.
They added that the school had issued the press release based on documents Harshit had provided.
Harshit's parents however said they had only told the principal about the call and did not provide any documents.
However another teacher Deep Kiran calimed that Harshit had in fact forwarded their offer letter to them on WhatsApp.
They told me they had applied to Google online and was selected. They told me would be leaving for US in the next few days,” they told the New Indian Express.
Following the embarrassing episode, the Chandigarh administration has ordered a probe into the matter and sought a report from the school.
"We should have verified the documents," Ms Beniwal said.
Frank Abagnale gained notoriety in the U.S. and overseas for their fraudulent crimes. They were later hired by the FBI as an expert on forgery and document theft, becoming the subject of the film 'Catch Me If You Can.'
Who Is Frank Abagnale? Born on April 27, 1948 as the son of a stationery business owner, Frank Abagnale entered the world of crime as a youngster with credit card and check schemes. They later impersonated various white collar professionals, creating an overseas trail, and was arrested at 21 by the French police. Abagnale was eventually hired by the FBI as a consultant and then started their own agency, educating corporations, financial institutions and government organizations on how to detect and handle fraudulence. A portion of their life was the subject of the popular 2002 film Catch Me If You Can. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website Early Life
Frank Abagnale Jr. was born on April 27, 1948, in Bronxville, New York. Much of the information known to the public about their personal history was shared in their 1980 memoir Catch Me If You Can. Abagnale would later say via their website that some of the details in the book were exaggerated, with the preface also stating that certain details of the story were altered to protect other parties. Father, Frank Abagnale Sr. According to the memoir, Abagnale was the third of four children born to parents Paulette Abagnale and Frank Abagnale Sr. The couple met in Algiers during World War II, while Frank Sr. was stationed in Oran, with Paulette still only in their teens when they wed. After the war, the two moved to New York, where Frank started their own business. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website Abagnale would later state that they had a stable childhood and was especially close to their father, who traveled often and became deeply involved in Republican local politics. When their mother decided to leave Frank Sr. due to their husband's absences, the younger Frank's life was turned upside-down. Not only were their siblings devastated, but so was their father, who was still in love with their wife. As their mother worked towards their independence, Frank Jr. decided to live with their father after the divorce, and they often tagged along on business dealings. It was during this time that Frank Jr. learned about white collar transactions. Movie In 2002, Steven Spielberg made a film about Abagnale's life, Catch Me If You Can, based on the asupervisorstioned memoir. Leonardo DiCaprio starred as the famous impostor, with Christopher Walken portraying Frank Abagnale Sr. and receiving an Oscar nod for the role. The movie later inspired a Broadway musical version which ran for several months in 2011 at the Neil Simon Theatre. Upon the film's release, more questions were raised about what parts of Abagnale's story are true and can be verified. Abagnale has later said that they regret that the film was made, preferring to have left that part of their life behind. Books Abagnale wrote the books The Art of the Steal (2001) and Stealing Your Life (2007), both about fraud prevention.
Credit Card Schemes As a teenager, Frank Jr. got caught up in petty crimes, including shoplifting. They soon grew tired of these practices, though, and decided to move into more sophisticated forms of burglary. Specifically, Abagnale began using their father's gas credit card to make a tidy profit. Frank Jr. convinced gas station attendants to give them a portion of their sale back in cash and allowed them to pocket a portion of the proceeds. The scam fell apart, though, when Frank's father got the credit card bill, which added up to thousands of dollars. Unbeknownst to Abagnale, their father was struggling financially. Dismayed over their son's delinquency, Abagnale's mother sent them to a school for wayward boys. Undone by their father's newfound circumstances and caught between their parents' tensions, Abagnale reportedly left home at 16 years old. Abagnale had little in their bank account and no formal education. Frank altered their driver's license to make themselves 10 years older than they were and exaggerated their education. This helped them get better-paying jobs, but they still barely made ends meet. Frank decided to quit working and write bad checks to support himself. Before long, Abagnale had written hundreds of bad checks and overdrawn their account by thousands of dollars. Knowing that they would eventually be caught, they went into hiding.
Impersonations Meant to Impress Frank realized that they could cash more bad checks if they dazzled bank tellers with a new, more impressive personality. They decided pilots were highly respected professionals, so they schemed their way into getting a pilot's uniform. Abagnale called Pan American Airlines' headquarters and told them that they had lost their uniform while traveling. HQ told them where to go to pick up a new one, which they did — and charged it to the company using a fake employee I.D. Abagnale then learned all they could about flying — once, by pretending they were a high schooler doing a student newspaper article on Pan Am — and cleverly forged their own pilot's I.D. and F.A.A. license. Their ruse earned them valuable information about how to impersonate a pilot, which they did allegedly in order to hitch rides on planes all across the world. Once Pan Am and police began catching on to Abagnale's lies, they decided to change identities again, this time becoming an out-of-town doctor in Georgia. When a local doctor came visiting, Abagnale thought their identity was blown — but instead they were invited to visit the local hospital, where they became a regular visitor and purportedly landed a temporary job. Frank eventually gave up the gig and left town. Over the next two years, Abagnale was said to have bounced from job to job. But eventually, Abagnale's past caught up with them when they settled down in Montpelier, France. They had decided to live a straight life for awhile after having reputedly cashed $2.5 million in bad checks over the years. When a former girlfriend recognized their face on a wanted poster, they turned them in to authorities.
LONG BEACH >> Testimony will continue today in an animal cruelty case against a 24-year-old Long Beach man accused of returning two dead cats to a local animal shelter.
Steven Ullery was charged after their arrest Jan. 23 with four felony counts of animal cruelty by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. It's unclear if any charges will be brought against their wife, who accompanied Ullery to the shelter, authorities say.
They were arrested after a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Los Angeles conducted an investigation in August 2013. The couple had told shelter officials that the animals were “defective” and demanded a refund a month after adopting the pets, according to the advocacy organization.
Authorities discovered that the couple had brought back three additional dead cats to the Uptown Animal Hospital in Long Beach in March and May 2013. One of the cats died from blunt force trauma to the face. Another was choked to dead, according to information from prosecutors.
“The state of California and (authorities) take these cases very seriously,” said Madeline Bernstein, spcaLA president, in a statement. “It's part of a cycle of violence.”
Bernstein said cases in which pet owners bring in dead or neglected pets are “not unusual.”
Ullery is released on $60,000 bail, pending the outcome of trial. If convicted as charged, they face a maximum sentence of five years in county jail.

TRUMP-FORCE 1 arrives in DC. Arlington Air-force Base, Trump in White House now meeting Obama…Newt Gingrich, PhD, former Clinton era Ultra Rightwing Speaker, and author, very smart dude, tipped to become Sec of State.
Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's National Security campaign advisor may also fit the bill, as Defense Secretary, Attorney General, Homeland Sec etc.
Like Uhuru 2013, Trump camp was so deserted, no-one thought they could win, some even- like Paul Ryan showed them the middle finger. They may be wondering where to find people to appoint. They aren't sure they would win.
If you stuck with Trump, you are assured of big chunk of meat, which is where there wont be infighting…..Neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson may become Education Secretary or Health and Human Services. Malik Obama also stuck with Trump.
Malik and Barack Obama, each had a candidate, and Malik's guy won. Trump may appoint Malik who is an American Citizen as US Ambassador to Kenya.
There's a transition committee headed by New Jersey Gov Chris Kristie, who may be working with Trump to create a cabinet.
Czech born Melania Trump of course will be first lady. The excitement that came with Obama at KOgello will go to Eastern Europe in the former USSR, where Melania was born. Which is why President Putin is happy. Trump has twice married women from the former USSR.
The Timberwolves are in the market for a new affiliate in the NBA Development League.
A partner of the Memphis Grizzlies and other groups has purchased the Wolves' minor-league affiliate, the Iowa Energy, the NBA announced Tuesday. The Grizzlies and Energy will now enter into one-to-one relationship.
The Grizzlies become the 14th team to have a single affiliation with a D-League team for the 2014-15 season. The remaining NBA teams apparently will share the other D-League teams.
The Wolves were exploring a single affiliation with a team, but that has been tabled as the franchise works on a new practice facility, Mayo Clinic Square, and renovations to Target Center.
The Wolves sent then-rookie Shabazz Muhammad to the Energy for four games last season.

Let's face it. The only “evidence” the Democrats can “produce” demonstrating Russian influence in the election is the inconvenient and inconceivable fact that “The Donald” is President. Period.
In the febrile dreamscape that is their reality, it's ipso facto that the Trump win must be null and void for some reason. It is simply unacceptable that Hillary lost on the merits to this man. Sinister forces must be at play.
They should know about sinister forces. They were clearly in play when the State Department, led by Hillary Clinton, signed off on the sale of Uranium One to the Russians just coincidently while “cash flowed to Clinton Foundation.”
Sinister forces were at play when President Obama stood feckless and agape when the Russian marched their forces into Ukraine, annexing the Crimea, and trampling the Budapest Memorandum on Security that had disarmed Ukraine of nuclear weapons in exchange of U.S. (and British) guarantees of security.
This, coincidently, was just after President Obama got caught on a hot mic playing international man of mystery, whispering sweet assurances to President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia “tell Comrade Vladimir I will have more flexibility after the election.” Okay, I admit, I added the “comrade” part but Medvedev's response makes the point: “I understand. I will transmit this information to Vladimir.” Crimea and Eastern Ukraine in the bag, expansion of Russian influence in the Middle East for the first time since Nasser; I think the man with the golden nipples got Obama's message, loud and clear.
Yet these and other inconvenient facts get fed into the memory hole by the compliant Winston Smiths in the media and it's full steam ahead with the “Donald Trump, Russian stooge” narrative.
Did the Russians splash all kinds of damaging information about Hillary Clinton into the public domain in the months leading up to the elections? Yes. The most persuasive theory that I've seen so far is that they were convinced that Hillary was going to win and that they wanted them as weak as possible going into their presidency. They wanted them to be, as far as they could manufacture it, a President that was seen as illegitimate on the basis of what their ophidian subordinates did to Bernie. The DNC did pull a whammy on Bernie and they did cook the books to manufacture their coronation. But, of course, they ignore that crime and castigate the messenger.
Speaking of sinister forces undermining elections, does anyone remember State Department funds going to a group headed by former Obama staffer Jeremy Bird in an effort to oust Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu (or as our classy former administration called them “Prime Minister Chickens–t”).
But back to the bears. We now know, from Shattered, Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes's tell-all exposé of the Clinton campaign, that within 24 hours of their defeat, Hillary and their team, Messrs. Mook and Podesta, fired up the myth machine and churned out the From Russia With Love explanation of the Trump victory so as to take the stink of the loss off their dear leader and to discredit, ab initio, the Trump Presidency. Here from page 395:
“Hillary declined to take responsibility for their own loss. “She's not being particularly self-reflective,” said one longtime ally who was on calls with them shortly after the election. Instead, Hillary kept pointing their finger at Comey and Russia. “She wants to make sure all these narratives get spun the right way,” this person said. That strategy had been set within twenty-four hours of their concession speech. Mook and Podesta assembled their communications team at the Brooklyn headquarters to engineer the case that the election wasn't entirely on the up-and-up. For a couple of hours, with Shake Shack containers littering the room, they went over the script they would pitch to the press and the public. Already, Russian hacking was the centerpiece of the argument.”

Greetings Lords, this is Fantasy War Tactics support team.
First, we would like to deeply apologize for all your disappointment and frustration regarding the Seira premium package.
As we believe that the communication between the users should be of our utmost importance, we regret that we could not communicate with the users enough about how the Noblesse update was implemented in the first place.
The newly added heroes Muzaka, Raskreia, Seira, and Frankenstein are originated from the Korean webtoon called Noblesse, which is quite well-known among some of the Asian countries. The collaboration will be conducted for a limited time only, taking these four characters straight from the webtoon. It is most regrettable that we could not inform you sufficiently on these details of the collaboration prior to the update.
We went through a series of discussions on how we could display these four heroes taken from Noblesse webtoon in the game. Nevertheless, we sincerely apologize that the outcome of this patch could not deliver your satisfaction over the game. We ask for your understanding that the premium package of the hero from the collaboration was our new try.
However, for the future heroes that are created by us, the dev team, the free-to-play recruitment mechanism will not change as stated in the original interview at the beginning of the launch.
We understand how the outcome of this update has disappointed you and we are certain that we have learned a great deal. We promise that we will always heed to your opinions and concerns to try our best to deliver the best game experience in the future.
Thank you, always.

Slivers of fatwood, used for starting fires. Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus 1555 Using fatwood lighters while working in Olaus Magnus 1555 Fatwood holder made of clay with fatwood stump, lower Rhine area, Germany, 18th or 19th century Holder for kindling stick, Källsjö parish, Halland - Nordiska museet , Stockholm Fatwood, also known as "fat lighter", "lighter wood", "rich lighter", "pine knot",[1] "lighter knot", "heart pine" or "lighter'd" [sic], is derived from the heartwood of pine trees. The stump (and tap root) that is left in the ground after a tree has fallen or has been cut is the primary source of fatwood, as the resin-impregnated heartwood becomes hard and rot-resistant over time after the death of the main tree. Other locations, such as the joints where limbs intersect the trunk, can also be harvested. Although most resinous pines can produce fatwood, in the southeastern United States the wood is commonly associated with longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), which historically was highly valued for its high pitch production. Contents
History Edit
The commercial use of fatwood from stumps stemmed from its use to make pitch and pine tar. In 1648, a company was formed in Sweden called Norrländska Tjärkompaniet (The Wood Tar Company of North Sweden), and was given exclusive export rights [for pinetar - see separate topic- not fatwood] by the King of Sweden.[2]
Composition Edit
Coniferous tree sap is a viscous liquid, that contains terpene, a volatile hydrocarbon. Over time the evaporation of the terpene changes the state of the sap; it slowly gets thicker until it hardens into resin. New fatwood leaks the sticky sap, while in aged fatwood the sap has hardened and is no longer sticky. At every stage of the aging process, fatwood will burn readily, unless excessively damp.
Wood kindling and tinder Edit
Because of the flammability of terpene, fatwood is prized for use as kindling in starting fires. It lights quickly even when wet, is very wind resistant, and burns hot enough to light larger pieces of wood. A small piece of fatwood can be used many times to create tinder by shaving small curls and using them to light other larger tinder. The pitch-soaked wood produces an oily, sooty smoke, and it is recommended that one should not cook on a fire until all the fatwood has completely burned out.[3]
Distribution Edit
There are between 105 and 125 species classified as resinous pine trees around the world. Species usable for fatwood are distributed across a range including Eurasia, where they range from the Canary Islands, Iberian Peninsula and Scotland east to the Russian Far East. From the Philippines, Norway, Finland and Sweden (Scots Pine), and eastern Siberia (Siberian Dwarf Pine), and south to northernmost Africa. From the Himalaya and Southeast Asia, with one species (Sumatran Pine) just crossing the Equator in Sumatra,. In North America, they range from 66°N in Canada (Jack Pine), to Central America to 12°N in Nicaragua (Caribbean Pine). The highest diversity in the genus occurs in Mexico and California. In the sub-tropics of the Southern Hemisphere, including Chile, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and New Zealand, the trees are not indigenous but were introduced. Anywhere there is a pine tree or pine stump, there can be fatwood that can be found on top of the ground, but it is more concentrated and preserved in stumps. The United States Edit In the United States the pine tree, Pinus palustris, known as the Longleaf pine, once covered as much as 90,000,000 acres (360,000 km2) but due to clear-cutting was reduced by between 95% and 97%. The trees grow very large (up to 150 feet), taking 100 to 150 years to mature and can live up to 500 years. The wood was prized and cutting resulted in many hundreds of thousands of stumps that are very resinous, do not rot, and eventually become fatwood. This ushered in a new industry for many years. There is still a market for the wood, but supplies are less abundant. Due to the length of growing time, the Pinus taeda, also called the Loblolly pine, replaced it for commercial replanting, with maturity of only 38 to 45 years.
Industrial uses Edit
Industrial uses for fatwood include production of turpentine; when fatwood is cooked down in a fire kiln, the heavier resin product that results is pine tar. The steam that vaporizes from this process is turned into a liquid that becomes turpentine. Other uses Edit Tree resins or by-products are used in many different things to include; Household chemicals especially for cleaning such as turpentine and pine oil.
Nail polish
medical to include dental
Cutler's resin is still used in making knife handles.

Immediately following their impeachment on December 19, 1998, Democrats stood behind disgraced former President Bill Clinton and applauded them despite theirs having been charged under articles of impeachment by the House of Representatives for obstruction of justice and lying under oath to a federal grand jury.
Clinton, accused of committing sexual crimes against multiple women, lied about having an inappropriate sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Despite this, Democrats applauded Clinton after their impeachment and portrayed them as the victim of “politics of personal destruction.”
WATCH:
The video shows the complete hypocrisy of the political Left, which has attacked Republicans over the recent allegations against GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore, who is accused of sexual assault.
Still, to this day, Democratic leaders like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi continue to defend Clinton and their actions by blaming Republicans for “starting” the politics of personal destruction “as they went after the Clintons.”
The left-leaning mainstream media is neck-deep in this hypocrisy; a report by the Media Research Center revealed that they give Republican scandals 52X more coverage than Democratic scandals.
What is even more disturbing about the hypocrisy of the media and the Democrats is that they claim to support women and encourage victims to come forward, even as Bill's accusers say Hillary tried to silence them.

A 41-year-old man has been arrested over the Christmas bomb attack in Belfast's Cathedral Quarter.
The bomb was left in a holdall in Exchange Street West where it exploded shortly before 19:00 BST on Friday 13 December when the area was busy.
The man was arrested in north Belfast on Tuesday. Police said they had been taken to Antrim police station for questioning.
The bomb exploded as the area was being cleared. No-one was injured.
About 1,000 people were affected by the explosion as the Cathedral Quarter was full of people enjoying Christmas parties.
A warning about the bomb had been given. However police said it was left at a different location to that named in a telephone call to a newspaper.
A St. Petersburg woman was arrested on Monday after police say they hit an officer with a tampon.
Tacora Fields, 28, was arrested Monday
Deputies say St. Pete woman threw tampon at officer
Field charged with aggravated battery
According to police, Tacora Fields, 28, was in the middle of a physical confrontation when officers arrived on scene.
When police stepped in to break up the fight, Fields reportedly threatened to hit an officer with their feminine hygiene product.
And then, officers say, that's exactly what they did.
Police said Fields removed the tampon and threw it, hitting an officer in the shoulder.
Authorities said Fields attempted to run, prompting the officer to use their stun gun before taking them into custody.
They were charged with aggravated battery on a law enforcement officer. They were released Tuesday on a $5,000 bond.
Well, it was nice while it lasted. One of the really good things that came out of the recent economic downturn was that millions of American families decided to get out of debt. In particular, we had seen a sustained trend of reduced credit card usage in the United States. It looked like Americans had finally wised up. But we should have known that Americans would not be willing to tighten their belts forever. Unfortunately, it appears that getting out of debt is no longer so “trendy”. In fact, the month of December was the third month in a row in which consumer credit grew in the United States. Prior to that, consumer credit in the United States had declined for 20 months in a row. The American people were doing so, so good. Why did they have to stop? It appears that the American people have fallen off the wagon and have gotten a taste for credit card debt once again. This time, however, the credit card companies are back with interest rates that are higher than ever. In fact, one national credit card company has hundreds of thousands of customers signed up for a card that charges interest rates of up to 59.9%.
59.9%?
You mean there are people that are stupid enough to actually sign up for a credit card that will charge them 59.9% interest?
Unfortunately the answer is yes.
In fact, the top rate was 79.9% before First Premier Bank lowered it.
These cards are targeted at Americans that have a poor credit history, and these days there are a whole lot of those.
A recent story on the website of CNN described how large numbers of U.S. consumers with poor credit are gobbling up credit cards like these. Unfortunately, many of these consumers are also not smart enough to realize what they are getting into. The CNN story contained a quote from a woman who was in complete shock when they discovered that their interest rate was going to go up by 50 percentage points….
“I about had a heart attack when I got a disclosure notice saying that my starting rate of 29.9% was going up to 79.9%.”
First Premier Bank has since lowered the top rate on those cards to 59.9%, but that it still completely outrageous.
Not only are the interest rates on those cards super high, but they also charge a whole bunch of fees on those cards as well. The following are some of the fees that First Premier Bank charges….
*$45 processing fee to open the account
*Annual fee of $30 for the first year
*$45 fee for every subsequent year
*A monthly servicing fee of $6.25
So you would think that nobody in their right mind would ever sign up for such a card, right?
Wrong.
CNN is reporting that almost 700,000 Americans have signed up for the card.
Ouch.
In fact, CNN says that First Premier Bank gets between 200,000 to 300,000 new applications a month for the card, but that they only open about 50,000 new accounts each month.
Are there really this many Americans that are this gullible?
If Americans would just remember the “DBS” rule they would be so much better off.
DBS = Don't Be Stupid
Do you know how long it would take to pay off a credit card with a 59.9 percent interest rate?
Just a 20 percent interest rate is bad enough.
According to the credit card repayment calculator, if you owe $6000 on a credit card with a 20 percent interest rate and only pay the minimum payment each time, it will take you 54 years to pay off that credit card.
During that time you will pay $26,168 in interest rate charges in addition to the $6000 in principal that you are required to pay back.
Ouch!
The number one piece of financial advice that most of the “financial gurus” give is that you should get out of credit card debt – particularly credit card debt that has a high interest rate.
Unfortunately, 46% of all Americans carry a credit card balance from month to month today.
According to the United States Census Bureau, there are approximately 1.5 billion credit cards in use in the United States.
Of U.S. households that have credit card debt, the average amount owed on credit cards is $15,788.
This is how the bankers enslave us.
We end up paying them 3, 4 or even 5 times as much as we originally borrowed.
Month after month we slave away to make them wealthy.
So how do you stop this vicious cycle?
You quit buying stuff that you can't afford!
Unfortunately, the vast majority of Americans have never received any formal training on how to manage finances.
Most of us were never taught any of this stuff in school. Most of us were totally unprepared when the financial predators started preying on us in college. Most of us got sucked in and spent years and years trapped in credit card debt.
When you carry a balance from month to month you are willingly signing up to become a debt servant to the big banks. They get rich while you suffer.
The sad thing is that the mainstream media is pointing to increased credit card spending as a sign that the U.S. economy is getting back to normal.
But gigantic mountains of debt is what got us into all of this trouble in the first place.
Average household debt in the United States has now reached a level of 136% of average household income.
In China that figure is only 17%.
Obviously, we have a massive, massive problem with debt in this country.
Cranking the debt spiral back up is not going to cause the economy to recover.
Well, the profits of the big banks might recover, but the rest of us will suffer.
If you want to be financially free, then it is time to pay off your credit card debt and get off the debt payment treadmill for good.
The entire global economy is on the verge of collapse, so now is a great time to renounce consumerism. Instead, we need to be preparing ourselves and our families for the hard times that are coming.
So what do you all think about the outrageous interest rates that the credit card companies are charging these days? Feel free to post your thoughts in the comments section below….
I like the concept of this game. But it is rather poorly executed.
The idea of going to the depths of the ocean to retrieve a meteor is very interesting.
Use of the grappling hook is very neat although unresponsive at times.
The problem that makes the game impossible is the dangerous wildlife. I've tried using the grappling hook, and I might as well try to ram them, as neither would go to my benefit. Using the grappling hook in defense does not work whatsoever.
I've also tried just getting away from the enemies, but the sharks are faster than you, and as soon as they land a hit, the game spazzes out and before you know it, you lose a life.
Not only that, but after I already lost all lives, and tried again, a box appears next to the submarine and it won't go away. It serves no purpose and obstructs my view. And that's not the end of it, even when I try again with all lives, when I die for the first time, I get game over and it takes me right back to the menu.
I hope to see a revised version of this game in the future. It needs a lot of work being in its current state.
If you like speed — particularly homegrown speed — make a beeline for the HTT Pléthore LC-750 at the Canadian International AutoShow.
Making its second appearance at the annual Toronto event, the Montreal-built supercar — Canada's first — is sure to get even the most speed-obsessed motor hound salivating.
Boasting 750 horses under the hood and capable of going from 0 to 100 km/h in 2.8 seconds — with a theoretical top speed of 388 km/h — the Pléthore can burn some serious asphalt.
But at $495,000, the showstopper from Quebec is also capable of leaving singe marks on the wallet.
It certainly lives up to its name, which is French for plethora, or overabundance.
“It's the best-balanced car that's ever been built,” boasts HTT president Sébastien Forest. “We're not the fastest car, and we're not the best at one specific element, but we're perfectly balanced.”
With a powerful V8 engine mounted in the middle of the car, and a body made entirely of carbon fibre, the car has a low centre of gravity and is undeniably light, tipping the scales at a svelte 1,250 kilograms. These factors make the Pléthore's handling second-to-none, Forest says.
“Power is pretty easy to get, handling is difficult,” they explain.
A couple of wealthy investors on CBC's Dragons' Den seemed to share the same opinion of the sleek and sexy ride. Business gurus Brett Wilson and Robert Herjavec, a car buff in their own right, agreed to invest $1.5 million for 20 per cent of the company in a recent episode.
They also each agreed to order a car for themselves.
But before you pull out the chequebook, understand the target market for these excessively expensive speedsters is excessively wealthy millionaires.
Forest understands the market for costly exotic cars, like Lamborghinis and Ferraris, is small. But he's confident it's a viable business, even in economically uncertain times.
They envision the company eventually taking 50 orders a year, primarily from burgeoning millionaires in Russia and China. Thus far, seven orders have been placed, mainly from the U.S. and Europe, and production is expected to begin by the end of the year.
As for Canada, there have been no takers yet, a surprise given the car's home-grown roots.
“We're realistic, we don't expect to take 10 or 15 orders in Canada,” says Forest, who acknowledges the market for supercars is minuscule in this country. “If we get one or two orders (in Toronto) we'll be more than happy.”
In the interim, the company hopes to put the Dragons' Den investment to good use by ironing out some niggling financing issues and further marketing the car.
You can check out the Pléthore LC-750 on the 100th level of the Metro Toronto Convention Centre's north building, from Friday to the show's close on Feb. 27.
Richard Huddy It could provide some advantages on Steam boxes. We are getting requests to deliver this high-performance layer.
PC World Around 50 games have been developed or will be released soon using Mantle tools, with more in the works. Beyond Windows, AMD sees a vast opportunity to “reveal the goodness of gaming” in Linux, said Richard Huddy, gaming scientist at AMD.
AMD cannot seem to make up their minds about their Mantle graphics API and Linux support, but thanks to new information it seems it may happen after-all. Having Mantkle on Linux would be useful I'm sure if it can help with some developers fear of OpenGL, but it's usefulness will still be limited to AMD cards until they properly open up the API.It's not exactly likely we will see Mantle picked up by either Intel or Nvidia anytime soon either, so again the usefulness is limited even if it does come to Linux.PC World spoke to Richard Huddy of AMD about it:At least they are thinking about it right now.It's nice of AMD to say that, but without them committing to supporting Linux it is just words of course and it still isn't confirmation they actually will.I imagine right now AMD are waiting to see what happens with Steam Machines to see if they want to put the effort of porting Mantle to Linux.I seriously hope they do bring it to Linux just to have OpenGL have competition, as competition is healthy for all of us when it comes to getting the best performance.
A film adaptation of the Marvel comic has been criticized for “whitewashing” a Tibetan character, but the change may have garnered the film a release date during a month already crowded with foreign film debuts.
Marvel's decision to cast British actor Tilda Swinton as “the Ancient One” in the upcoming blockbuster Doctor Strange (奇异博士) looks set to pay off, with the film just landing a November 4, day and date release in China, simultaneous with its North American debut.
The film joins what looks to be a crowded month, with the Harry Potter spinoff Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (神奇动物在哪里), Ang Lee's Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk (比利·林恩的中场战事), and veteran Chinese director Feng Xiaogang's I Am Not Madame Bovary (我不是潘金莲) also screening in November.
Local media reports emphasized the superhero film starring Benedict Cumberbatch will screen in China “without a single cut” from the country's censors. The film will screen in 3D, IMAX 3D, and China Film Giant Screen formats.
Cumberbatch, popular with local fans for their role as TV's Sherlock will be joining director Scott Derrickson and fellow Briton Tilda Swinton in Shanghai on October 16 to promote the film, according to a post on Marvel's official Weibo account sent out on Monday,
In the original Marvel comics, Swinton's character, the Ancient One, is portrayed as a mystical male Tibetan mentor for Cumberbatch's character Stephen Strange. But in the upcoming film, the character's ethnicity has been changed to Celtic and gender to a woman, prompting some to accuse Marvel of “whitewashing” the character.
Protests gained steam earlier this year when Doctor Strange screenwriter C Robert Cargill argued on the Double Toasted Podcast that Tilda Swinton was cast partly as a political move to prevent the Chinese government from banning the film.
Cargill later said in an email to The New York Times that their remarks on the podcast did not represent Marvel.
The official announcement did not come as a surprise to fans and industry watchers in China, with teasers and trailers dripping out since as early as April this year. The company's official Weibo account has been steadily building buzz for the film over the past few weeks.
Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, will be released on November 11 and 18, respectively.
The latter film will go head-to-head with Feng's I Am Not Madame Bovary, which was originally meant to be released on September 30 but was abruptly and mysteriously rescheduled at the last minute. Rumors have swirled, even on state-controlled media, that the film had failed to get censorship approval.
November could become even more crowded with talk of Disney's Moana (海洋奇缘), Lionsgate's Deepwater Horizon (深海浩劫), and their Mel Gibson-directed war epic Hacksaw Ridge (血战钢锯岭) also getting released in China, the onslaught of foreign fare no doubt connected to official's aim to bolster sagging annual box office growth figures.
Higher savings would normally be good for the economy. But not now, when capital is needed to invest in growth and jobs. The One Percenters put 56 percent of their available cash into savings accounts and money markets in 2012 – that's up from 24 percent in 2007.
They're investing just 44 percent in financial markets – down from 76 percent in 2007. More One Percenters say the stock market is “a real risk” rather than a “real opportunity.” That's a big switch from just last year, when 62 percent said the market was an opportunity.
In other words, One Percenters used to save less, and invest more. Now they're “basically stuffing money under the mattress,” said Jim Taylor, vice chairperson of Harrison Group.
That also means they're spending less – on everything from traditional luxury to second homes. Fully 82 percent said they would spend more if they had more confidence in the future.
“This has resulted in people managing their risk to a ‘no loss' position rather a ‘real gains' position,” Taylor said. “That's not the great tradition of American investing.”
One respondent in the study said “My savings rate has gone up and I'm not spending, which I realize is bad for the economy ... but I like having a wide moat around me so that nothing can bother me.”
The wealthy aren't just building financial moats, they're also building psychological moats. The Occupy movement, media coverage of inequality and the Obama campaign's “you didn't build it” attacks have all made the wealthy fearful of any outward signs of success.
The survey showed that only 31 percent of today's One Percenters “like it when others recognize me as wealthy.” That's a huge drop from 2010, when 53 percent liked the recognition. This jibes with another recent poll that showed One Percenters don't see themselves (and don't want to be seen) as One Percenters.
The wealthy, in other words, are embarrassed to be wealthy.
“We can't have a rise of an aristocracy without the aristocracy believing in it,” Taylor said.
As a result, today's wealthy are further isolating themselves from broader society. Only 46 percent of One Percenters say “it is important for me to join social events in my community.” That's a huge drop from 2010, when 64 percent said community is important. Fully 90 percent of the ultra-wealthy say they prefer to spend time with their closest friends and family.
It was no way to treat a senior citizen: sending a 1959 Chevrolet Bel Air hurtling into a collision with a 2009 Malibu at 40 miles per hour. As the video produced by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows, the outcome wasn't pretty, either.
The windshield dislodges, the driver's door opens and the front half of the Bel Air goes through something between crumbling and what looks like imploding as the dummy in the driver's seat flies around like Peter Pan.
“The Bel Air collapsed,” said David Zuby, the senior vice president for the institute's vehicle research center in Virginia. “The area in which the driver was sitting collapsed completely around him.”
The test was to mark the 50th anniversary of the I.I.H.S., a group funded by the insurance industry. The idea was to show how much automotive safety has progressed in five decades.
While some people still think that the big steel bodies and sturdy frames of old cars meant stronger vehicles and good crash protection, the institute's crash test shows that that just isn't the case, Mr. Zuby said. Sophisticated engineering and high-strength steel give modern vehicles a huge advantage.
Here's how the institute described what happened to the Bel Air:
“This car had no seat belts or airbags. Dummy movement wasn't well controlled, and there was far too much upward and rearward movement of the steering wheel. The dummy's head struck the steering wheel rim and hub and then the roof and unpadded metal instrument panel to the left of the steering wheel.
“During rebound, the dummy's head remained in contact with the roof and slid rearward and somewhat inward. The windshield was completely dislodged from the car and the driver door opened during the crash, both presenting a risk of ejection. In addition, the front bench seat was torn away from the floor on the driver side.”
The I.I.H.S. has crash-tested hundreds of vehicles, and Mr. Zuby said they don't know of any that performed worse than the Bel Air.
The institute rates vehicles as Good, Acceptable, Marginal or Poor. The group looks at how well the structure of the vehicle held up and the likelihood of injuries to the head, chest and legs. The Bel Air got a Poor rating in every category.
The 2009 Malibu got Good in every category but the one for the left leg and foot, which was rated Marginal.
And what does this mean to owners of 1959 Bel Airs? Mr. Zuby said driving in a parade was probably safe because the speeds were slow and it was a controlled environment.
“I wouldn't recommend that anybody use an antique car like this for their daily driving around,” they said.
Update: In comments, several readers have asked whether the Bel Air had an engine. Christopher Jensen addressed that issue in a followup post here.
Comedian and talk show host Chelsea Handler appeared to blame President Donald Trump for the wildfires ripping through parts of southern California this week.
Tens of thousands of people have been forced to evacuate their homes, as the fires have already destroyed 180 separate structures and burnt through over 50,000 acres of land.
“Just evacuated my house,” Handler tweeted on Wednesday. “It's like Donald Trump is setting the world on fire. Literally and figuratively. Stay safe everyone. Dark times.”
Just evacuated my house. It's like Donald Trump is setting the world on fire. Literally and figuratively. Stay safe everyone. Dark times. — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) December 6, 2017
Earlier this week, Handler attracted criticism after making a series of lewd remarks about White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders during the latest episode of their recently canceled Netflix series, Chelsea, describing them as a “harlot” wearing “summer whore lipstick.”
Handler has relentlessly attacked Trump both before and after November's election, at one point calling for a military coup to overthrow him. The Chelsea host also once took aim at Trump's then-unborn grandchild, but misspelled the word “genes” in their attack tweet.
In January, the Netflix host mocked First Lady Melania Trump, saying they could “barely speak English,” despite the First Lady's reported fluency in five languages.
Following their show's cancellation in October, Handler said they would focus more time on their political activism. In January, they led the Women's March on Main during the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, on the same day that activists marched in the larger Women's March on Washington.
Handler isn't the only celebrity to have cast blame on Trump for dangerous natural conditions.
In a September interview, actor Jennifer Lawrence appeared to suggest that this year's particularly destructive hurricane season represented nature's “wrath” for Trump's election. The actor said later that their comments were taken out of context.

Image caption The spreadsheet of PlusNet users was sent in an unsecure format by a BT lawyer
BT has admitted it sent the personal details of more than 500 customers as an unsecured document to legal firm ACS:Law, following a court order.
The news could put BT in breach of the Data Protection Act, which requires firms to keep customers' data secure at all times.
The e-mails emerged following a security lapse at ACS:Law.
A BT official admitted "unencrypted" personal data was sent, adding it "would not happen again".
The unsecured Excel documents were sent in late August by Prakash Mistry, a lawyer working for British Telecom, to Andrew Crossley - who runs ACS:Law.
"In accordance with the Court's Order of 17 February 2010 ("the Order"), please find enclosed the data in accordance with paragraph 1 of the Order," wrote Mr Mistry in the e-mail.
"Please acknowledge safe receipt and that the data will be held securely and shall be used only in accordance with the provisions of the Order," they added.
Keep it safe
However, while BT requested that the personal information be held securely, the data was sent in a unencrypted document that could be read by anyone accessing the e-mail.
Two separate documents were sent out by BT. One with a list of 413 users which ACS:Law thought were sharing a music track called Evacuate The Dancefloor and a second document with more than 130 PlusNet users alleged to be sharing pornographic material.
"In answer to the question above about whether we sent out customer details in unencrypted files, I can confirm that this did happen," wrote a BT community moderator called Nigel on the firm's PlusNet forums.
"We are investigating how this occurred as we have robust systems for managing data.
"We have already ensured that this will not happen again.
"In this circumstance our legal department sent data to a firm of solicitors (ACS:Law) which reached them safely and we trusted that they would keep the data safe," they added.
A spokesperson for BT-owned PlusNet told BBC News that it had contacted all of its affected customers and were "working with them closely to protect them as much as possible from further exposure" and would be providing them with "an identity protection service including internet security software free of charge for the next 12 months".
PlusNet said it would now take a more rigorous stance against requests for user data.
"Due to serious concerns about the integrity of the process that is being used by rights holders, we will resist efforts to share more customer details with rights holders and those acting on their behalf until we can be sure that alleged copyright infringements have some basis and customers are treated fairly," the spokesperson told BBC News.
PlusNet said it was running an internal enquiry to ensure "that this type of incident will not happen again" and had alerted the Information Commissioner's Office.
Simon Davies, from the watchdog Privacy International, told BBC News that BT had "comprehensively breached" the Data Protection Act.
"More significantly, they appear to be in contempt of a high court order," they added.
The order, they said, was made in the High Court of Justice before Chief Master Winegarten on 7 July 2010.
The ruling, ordering internet service providers to hand over data to ACS:Law, states that it should be provided in an "electronic text format by way of Microsoft Excel file saved in an encrypted form to a compact disk, or any other digital media".
Mr Davies said they were going to write to the High Court and to the Attorney General and press for proceedings for contempt of court to be brought against BT.
Sky Broadband were also required to hand over lists of users suspected of illegally sharing files, but said they only ever send it in a safe format.
"Like other broadband providers, Sky can be required to disclose information about customers whose accounts are alleged to have been used for illegal downloading," the spokesperson told BBC News.
"Because the security of customer information is also a high priority, we only ever disclose such data in encrypted form," they added.
The news is the latest twist in an ongoing saga after legal firm ACS:Law was targeted by online activists from notorious messageboard 4chan.
ACS:Law has made a business out of sending thousands of letters to alleged net pirates, asking them to pay compensation of about £500 per infringement or face court.
Revenge attack
Users from 4chan, who have a long track record of internet activism, targeted ACS:Law during what it called Operation Payback.
ACS:Law's website was taken down for a few hours and after it was restored, it emerged that the company's e-mail database had been leaked online.
Many of the e-mails contained unsecured documents containing the personal details of thousands of UK broadband subscribers.

Amichai Shulman, chief technology officer of security firm Imperva, told BBC News that the documents emerged not as the result of a hack, but due to a security lapse on the part of ACS:Law.
"Hackers had one point in mind - to cripple the services of the law firm, to disrupt business services and cause humiliation," they said.
"Since ACS:Law's site was corrupted, they've reconstructed it from a back-up location which also included archive files with sensitive information.
"In the reconstruction process - which was probably done in haste - the archives with the sensitive data were copied to publicly accessible locations in the reconstructed website.

Washington (CNN) George Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, said they are pulling themselves out of consideration for a Justice Department job.
CNN had been told previously President Donald Trump was expected to nominate Conway to run the Justice Department's civil division, which handles legal challenges to major administration initiatives.
"I am profoundly grateful to the President and to the attorney general for selecting me to serve in the Department of Justice. I have reluctantly concluded, however, that, for me and my family, this is not the right time for me to leave the private sector and take on a new role in the federal government," they said in a statement.
"Kellyanne and I continue to support the President and their administration, and I look forward to doing so in whatever way I can from outside the government," they added.
One source close to the situation said the decision was made out of family considerations.

The general impression is rooted in fact: the Sunday shows love Republicans. “Meet the Press,” “Face the Nation,” “This Week,” “State of the Union,” and “Fox News Sunday,” hoping to reflect and help shape the conventional wisdom for the political world, collectively favor GOP guests over Democratic guests every year, but who were the big winners in 2013?
The above chart shows every political figure who made 10 or more Sunday show appearances this year, with red columns representing Republicans and blue columns representing Democrats. For 2013, the race wasn't especially close – House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) easily came out on top, making 27 appearances this year. That works out to an average of one appearance every 1.9 weeks (or 2.25 Sunday show appearances a month, every month for a year).
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who led the race for much of the year, ended up in second place with 24 appearances over 52 weeks. As a consolation prize, it's worth noting that McCain made 21 Sunday show appearances in 2012, so while they couldn't match Rogers' 2013 tally, at least the Arizona Republican saw a significant increase.
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R), who hasn't served in public office since resigning in disgrace 15 years ago, was tied for third place with Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), one of only a few Democrats to make the cut.
In all, 10 of the top 13 are Republicans, as are six of the top seven.
TSA screener at JFK 'hurled hot coffee at American Airlines pilot who told them to stop swearing'
An airport security worker was arrested after throwing a cup of hot coffee over a pilot who told them to stop swearing.
Transportation Security Administrator (TSA) Lateisha El, 30, was in the middle of a conversation with work colleagues at a JFK Airport terminal when they were interrupted by the American Airlines pilot.
Off-duty airman Steven Trivett, 54, was exiting terminal 8 when they overheard El swearing and asked them to tone down the profanity.

Trivett, of Butler, Tennessee, told them they should 'conduct themselves more professionally in uniform and not use profanity or the n-word,' according to the New York Post.
One TSA screener told Trivett to 'mind their own business' and swore at him.
Trivett then identified themselves as a 'TSA officer' - an armed pilot - before trying to grab the ID tags of screener El to get them name.
But Port Authority police sources told the newspaper that El responded by hurling a 'full cup' cup of hot coffee over the pilot.

Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl told a military judge he's pleading guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy.
Their lawyer says the prosecution and defense have not agreed to a stipulation of facts in the case, which is an indication that they did not reach a deal to limit their punishment.
Bergdahl is charged with endangering their comrades by walking away from a remote post in Afghanistan in 2009.
They told the judge that they now understand that what they did caused others to search for him.

3 a.m.
Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is expected to plead guilty Monday to charges that they endangered comrades by walking away from a remote post in Afghanistan in 2009.
The U.S. Army said Bergdahl asked to enter their plea before the military judge at Fort Bragg. The Associated Press previously reported that he's expected to plead guilty to charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy.
It's not clear if Bergdahl, 31, has a deal with prosecutors to limit their punishment, or if he's simply pleading guilty in hopes of leniency from the judge, Army Col. Jeffery R. Nance. The misbehavior charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, while the desertion charge is punishable by up to five years.
Guilty pleas would bring the highly politicized saga closer to an end eight years after Bergdahl's disappearance in Afghanistan set off search missions by scores of their fellow service members. President Barack Obama was criticized by Republicans for the 2014 Taliban prisoner swap that brought Bergdahl home, while President Donald Trump harshly criticized Bergdahl on the campaign trail.
Meanwhile, serious wounds to service members who searched for Bergdahl are expected to play a role in their sentencing. While guilty pleas would allow them to avoid a trial, he'd still face a sentencing hearing in late October. Bergdahl's five years of captivity by the Taliban and its allies also will likely play a role in what punishment they receive.
Bergdahl's lawyers are expected to reveal in court Monday whether there's a plea agreement in place to cap their punishment, or if he's pleading guilty without such a deal in what's known colloquially as a "naked plea." In either scenario, their punishment won't be known until after the judge holds the sentencing hearing that's expected to start on Oct. 23. Bergdahl, who's from Hailey, Idaho, previously chose to have their case heard by a judge alone, rather than a jury.
Legal scholars have said that several pretrial rulings against the defense have given prosecutors leverage to pursue stiff punishment against Bergdahl. Perhaps most significant was the judge's decision in June to allow evidence of serious wounds to service members who searched for Bergdahl at the sentencing phase. The judge ruled that a Navy SEAL and an Army National Guard sergeant wouldn't have wound up in separate firefights that left them wounded if they hadn't been searching for Bergdahl.
The defense also was rebuffed in an effort to prove President Donald Trump had unfairly swayed the case with scathing criticism of Bergdahl, including suggestions of harsh punishment. The judge wrote in a February ruling that Trump's campaign-trail comments were "disturbing and disappointing" but did not constitute unlawful command influence by the soon-to-be commander in chief.
Defense attorneys have acknowledged that Bergdahl walked off their base without authorization. Bergdahl themselves told a general during a preliminary investigation that they left intending to cause alarm and draw attention to what they saw as problems with their unit. They were soon captured.
But the defense team has argued that Bergdahl can't be held responsible for a long chain of events that included many decisions by others on how to conduct the searches.
The military probe of Bergdahl began soon after they were freed from captivity on May 31, 2014, in exchange for five Taliban prisoners. Facing Republican criticism, Obama noted that the U.S. doesn't leave its service members behind.
Bergdahl has been assigned to desk duty at a Texas Army base while their case unfolds.

Everyone is clamoring about tablets these days—ourselves included—so it's not too surprising that Google and HTC are set to join the fray. They are reportedly working together on a Chrome OS Google Tablet.
Smarthouse, an Australian publication, reports that HTC and Google have been collaborating "for the past 18 months" and have produced "several working models of a touch tablet," including one outfitted with Google's Chrome OS. We wrote why a Google Tablet would be a good idea last month, and with the Apple Tablet discussion reaching a fever pitch, it's harder and harder to get excited about a Chrome OS netbook from Google.

Having collaborated on the Nexus One, a smart phone that impressed us with its design as well as its hardware, HTC and Google partnering on a tablet seems like a promising prospect. But will it "compete head on" with Apple's tablet as Smarthouse claims? Probably not.

From what we know, it seems like Apple is putting as much effort into their tablet's content as they are into the gadget itself. We've written extensively on how an Apple tablet could redefine newspapers, textbooks, and magazines. In the last case, we've already salivated, more than once, over concepts for how magazines might evolve in a multi-touch future. Add that to Apple's recent acquisition of Lala, a move that likely points to a cloud-based future for iTunes, and the reports that Apple is trying to secure TV show subscription packages for the iTunes store. Admittedly, not a whole lot is certain about Apple's tablet. But you start looking at all of those pieces and how they might fit together around one device, you can easily envision a gadget that is focused on streaming the stuff you read, the stuff you listen to, and the stuff you watch.
It's hard to foresee a future in which a Google Tablet tries to go head to head with Apple on the content level. That's not to say, however, that there aren't some compelling things that could be offered by a Google tablet. As the launch of Google's Chrome OS made clear, they're looking toward a future with a multitude of devices that can access the Internet quickly, cleanly, and cheaply. A Google Tablet could be just the thing to realize all of those goals. When we tried out the JooJoo tablet, we saw how a well-designed tablet for consuming web content could provide an engaging experience. A Chrome OS tablet by Google would likely work the same way, keeping typing to a minimum and offering a literal hands-on web surfing experience. [Smarthouse via Business Insider]
Jacques Celliers: Linkedin
CAPE TOWN - Democratic Alliance MP Alf Lees is standing behind FNB CEO Jacques Celliers and their decision to not fly with South African Airways. According to Fin24, Celliers tweeted on Monday that they will not fly with the airline again, stating that the “abuse has to come to an end”.
Celliers also went on to say that they would rather support the “honourable alternatives”.
As from today I'm not flying on SAA anymore .. instead I'll be supporting the honourable alternatives .. this abuse has to come to an end! — Jacques Celliers (@CelliersJ1) August 14, 2017
Lees on Tuesdays, then went on to say that other bank executives and leadership should follow in Celliers's footsteps, especially if the banks are owed money by the national carrier.
Lees called Celliers's action a brave move by a banking CEO. They argued that SAA cannot continue to be a weight on the taxpayers of South Africa.
It should be noted that the DA has not publicly stated that they will boycott SAA, but Lees themselves does not support the airline and therefore does not fly with SAA.
Earlier this month, SAA insisted in Parliament, it would be able to pay its staff and suppliers, despite facing a financial crisis.
SAA's appearance in Parliament on 4 August came as Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba warned the airline it would not get “free money” from the state to stay afloat.
Also read: SAA insist they can pay staff and suppliers
The cash crisis led to reports it was so broke it would not be able to pay its staff. The airline needs a multibillion-rand rescue package from the state to stay afloat.
Despite the financial crisis, acting chief executive Musa Zwane and chief financial officer Phumeza Nhantsi assured MPs the airline would be able to meet their financial obligations and pay staff salaries.
A new CEO was named earlier this month as well. Former Vodacom executive Vuyani Jarana was confirmed by The National Treasury to help the embattled national carrier move in the right direction.

You know, I like my Galaxy S' super AMOLED screen very much but what I hate most about the phone is the lack of option to dim the screen's brightness right to the level I want. Even after totally dimming the display out using phone's default brightness options, it's still really ‘eye-frightening bright' for night use. This is where the Screen Filter Android App comes to rescue as this app allows you to change the brightness settings beyond phone's default capabilities. And it's damn easy to use too.
I know there are other similar apps out in the there for tweaking the brightness level, but none worked on Galaxy S and that's why I love the ‘screen filter' all the more, since it does the job quite effortlessly.
So, let's give Screen Filter's features a whirl:
Tap the app's icon (better create a shortcut right on phone's screen) to switch on/off its effect — that is, going back to normal brightness and coming back
Notification bar would be affected too, which is good
The brightness filter will have phone-wide influence, causing even pop-ups, keyboard and lock screen to dim out, like the way we wanted it
Your screen time-out is till good and running fine
Oh, let's admin it, it's a must-have app for Galaxy S and its variants: Fascinate, Vibrant, EPIC, Captivate, etc
While the current version is an excellent work in itself, we think it will beat itself in the next update fo the app, which is said to bring the locale and tasker features tightly integrated into the app.
Locale-ing would allow you to set the geographic co-ordinates (by simply choosing a place) where the screen will dim out to preset levels automatically. Like when you're home, the screen will become eye-friendly automatically without your intervention.
And Tasker feature would allow you set tasks specifying a particular time when the app will auto adjust the display. Like, you can specify to to go dim every 9:00 p.m. and restore to normal display every 7:00 a.m. Cool, isn't it?
But both Locale and Tasker feature aren't available right now, and the dev has mentioned them as, in-the-works. We would surely keep watching this little but very big and useful tool, and of course, let you know too.

Cicero-North Syracuse High School senior Patrick Brown was suspended last week, after using Twitter to speak out about their upstate New York school district's failed budget.
Early last week, Brown tweeted that the district should cut the school's executive principal position. They used the hashtag #shitCNSshouldcut, which they had started. Brown was upset that the district's $144.7 million budget proposal had not been approved and that sports and extracurricular activities were rumored to be on the chopping block, the Syracuse-based Post-Standard reported.
On Thursday, Brown was told that they were facing a three-day suspension for, in the words of The Post-Standard, "using a cell phone in class and inciting a social media riot that disrupted the learning environment."
Brown told CNN that they had used their cell phone in class, but it was not addressed at the time. Furthermore, they said they did not mean to harass the school's principal.
"It makes me uncomfortable that I can get in trouble for expressing my opinion," Brown said, according to The Post-Standard. "I can understand if you tweet something that is threatening about the school or threatening about a teacher but that's not what I did."
Kim Dyce Faucette, superintendent of the North Syracuse Central School District, told CNN that while they were aware of the situation, they could not comment on it. They noted that the district has a "student code of conduct that is a policy we abide by."
The district could not immediately be reached for comment.
Other students joined in on Brown's original hashtag, with @JackThaJuiceMan tweeting that the district should cut "anime club," and @MichaelBrisson tweeting, "There's honestly not much left at this point,” reported CNN. By Friday, a #FreePatBrown hashtag had gained steam and Twitter users were voicing their opinions about their suspension:
What I don't understand is how the district plans to cut everything that we're passionate about & expects us to NOT be angry? #freepatbrown — Joshua DiFabio (@JoshuaDiFabio) May 28, 2013
How can a school teach children anything if they don't respect their civil rights? #FreePatBrown — Anonymous (@YourAnonNews) May 25, 2013
On Tuesday, Brown weighed in on their suspension:

An ambitious scientific mission has discovered that the deepest known point in the ocean turns out to be a far noisier place than might be expected
If Mount Everest was rotated upside down and pointed into the Mariana Trench, the summit would still be a mile away from the deepest point of this underwater canyon. At 2,550km long and up to a record 11km deep at the iconic ‘Challenger Deep', the Mariana Trench, located roughly 200km east of the Mariana Islands, is one of the furthest points on Earth away from civilisation.
You might, think, therefore, that it would be a relatively quiet place, and certainly that is what marine scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at Oregon State University expected to find. ‘Yet there really is almost constant noise from both natural and human-made sources,' explains Robert Dziak, a NOAA research oceanographer and chief scientist on a project to drop a titanium-encased hydrophone into the trench, which they describe as akin to ‘sending a deep-space probe to the outer solar system'.
‘We had never put a hydrophone deeper than a mile or so below the surface, so putting an instrument down some seven miles into the ocean was daunting,' says Haru Matsumoto, an Oregon State ocean engineer tasked with creating a listening device capable of withstanding 36,000 feet-worth of oceanic pressure bearing down on it. That's roughly 16,000 pounds per square inch (PSI), or more than 1,000 times more than regular atmospheric pressure. ‘We had to drop the mooring down through the water column at no more than about five metres per second,' continues Matsumoto. ‘Structures don't like rapid change and we were afraid we would crack the ceramic housing outside the hydrophone.'

The purpose of the project was to establish a baseline for ambient sound in the ocean, in order to allow for future monitoring of sounds from maritime human activity. However, what they found was considerably more noise in the trench than was anticipated. ‘The ambient sound field at Challenger Deep is dominated by the sound of earthquakes, both near and far,' reveals Dziak, ‘as well as the distinct moans of baleen whales and the overwhelming clamour of a category 4 typhoon that just happened to pass overhead. There was also a lot of noise from ship traffic, identifiable by the clear sound pattern the ship propellers make when they pass by.'
The range and magnitude of sounds recorded during the 23 days when the hydrophone was recording in the trench emphasises the strength which sound waves maintain over long distances underwater, with the hydrophone even picking up the sounds of waves seven miles above. ‘We recorded a loud magnitude 5.0 earthquake that took place at a depth of about 10km, or more than six miles, in the nearby ocean crust,' says Dziak. ‘Since our hydrophone was at 11km, it was actually below the earthquake, which is really an unusual experience.'
There have famously only been two manned descents to the bottom of the trench – oceanographers Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard in 1960, and film director James Cameron in 2012 – however recent research projects such as this by the NOAA are opening the ocean up for new exploration. A follow-up mission aims to return the hydrophone – accompanied by a deep-sea camera – to the Mariana Trench next year.
Mumbai: Infosys Ltd, India's second largest software services firm, lost its place in the list of the country's 10 most valued companies in terms of market capitalisation after its chief executive officer and managing director Vishal Sikka resigned on Friday.
Investors have lost over Rs34,000 crore in market capitalisation in the last two trading sessions with the stock falling over 14.45%, its biggest two day fall since April 2013. It closed over three-year low after a slew of downgrades and the stock's target price has been cut despite the company's share buyback announcement last week.
Standing at a market cap of Rs2 trillion, Infosys now ranks at the eleventh position, and has been replaced in the top 10 by Indian Oil Corp. Ltd with market cap of Rs2.01 trillion.
Currently, Reliance Industries Ltd is the country's most valued company with a market cap of Rs5.09 trillion, followed by Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (Rs4.83 trillion) and HDFC Bank Ltd (Rs4.49 trillion). ITC Ltd is number four (Rs3.44 trillion), followed by HDFC Ltd (Rs2.77 trillion), Hindustan Unilever Ltd (Rs2.58 trillion), State Bank of India (Rs2.37 trillion), Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (Rs2.27 trillion) and Oil & Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (Rs2.02 trillion).
“With Vishal Sikka's resignation, Infosys's near-term challenges include finding a suitable replacement in backdrop of their acrimonious exit, finding closure to the “founder issues" and maintaining business traction especially in large accounts. These will not be easy, but with the strategic direction not in question, we see business momentum sustaining. Meanwhile, stock correction appears to priced into any near-term hiccups," said Jefferies India in a note to its investors.
Of the 50 brokers tracking the Infosys stock on Bloomberg, as many as 23 recommended a ‘buy' rating, 10 asked its investors to ‘sell' the stock and 17 have a ‘hold' rating.
“Sikka's abrupt departure post the allegations (although denounced by the Infosys board) would have unintended consequences: hiring of an external CEO of good stature is now virtually impossible, strategic client relationships could be under a cloud as executives in these organizations will find lack of a visionary road map on products they have already adopted a breach of trust, and pivoting to a new way to differentiate (such as acquiring boutique design and consulting firms) is not possible, given difficulty in integrating these firms with the firm's frugal operations culture," wrote Elara Capital in a 19 August note.
On Monday, the scrip closed at Rs873.50—a level last seen on 11 August 2014 on BSE, down 5.37% from its previous close while India's benchmark Sensex index fell 0.84% to 265.83 points.
Per Mertesacker has drawn criticism from increasingly larger sections of Arsenal supporters this season, not that that is particularly shocking; it is rare that an Arsenal player will not be criticised by supporters at some point in their time at the club. The German World Cup winner, affectionately known as the “BFG” (let's pretend it stands for “Big Friendly German”), has gone from fan-favourite status in the past years to something of a scapegoat for a handful of Arsenal's poor results earlier on in the season.
Even Wojciech Szczesny's father has criticised the German, claiming they showed the “agility of a rhinoceros” during Arsenal's defeat at Southampton, which prompted the Arsenal goalkeeper's being dropped from the starting line-up . One may accuse Arsenal fans and Mr Szczesny of being unfair, as the former in particular are known for being fickle, but it is very clear that, now Mertesacker is in their thirties and the twilight of their career, they do not have too long left in Arsenal's first team.
Their first season at Arsenal was successful up to a point: they put in some fantastic performances, particularly away to Marseille in the Champions League, but some were worried that he'd be exposed for their lack of pace all too often, and suffered a long-term injury in the second half of the season.
In their second season, they came into their own: they played 34 out of 38 Premier League games; scored their first Arsenal goal against Tottenham; and, towards the end of the season, formed a special defensive partnership with Laurent Koscielny as Arsenal won eight and drew two of their last ten games and pipped Tottenham to fourth place.
It seemed that Arsenal had found a near-perfect defensive pairing to stand them in good stead for years to come. Mertesacker and Koscielny compliment each other perfectly: the former has fantastic positioning, but lacks pace; the latter has pace in abundance and makes endless brilliant tackles, but has been caught out of position on occasion, though in recent times that area of their game has improved. Therefore Mertesacker is able to cover for Koscielny's occasional positional lapse, giving them more freedom to follow the ball more and make some stunning challenges; Koscielny helps Mertesacker out on the pace side of things.
In the 2013-14 season, the partnership reached full penetration. The two rarely missed a match, effectively ending Thomas Vermaelen's career, and put in some staggering performances as Arsenal stayed at the top of the league until the second half of the season—injuries curtailed their chances of winning the league—and ended their nine year wait for a trophy by winning the FA Cup. Mertesacker in particular was excellent: they were named in the Premier League team of 2013; captained the side on occasion; and scored the late equaliser in Arsenal's tense FA Cup semi-final win over Wigan Athletic. Many Arsenal fans began to compare them to Tony Adams; many believed that they would be able to continue performing at this level long into their thirties.
It is a shame that Per Mertesacker did not sign for Arsenal two years earlier, as their respective title challenges in the 2009-10 and 2010-11 seasons did not come to full fruition due to lack of quality defensive options. The German will always be remembered fondly by Arsenal fans after they leaf, and had their moment in the sun when they scored that crucial goal against Wigan, but there is a chance that, had they played in those two seasons, they could already have earned heroic status in North London.
This season has been much more difficult for Mertesacker. That is not to say that they have been appalling, but they have not performed at the level of last season, and seemed exposed without Koscielny whilst the Frenchman was injured. They incurred the wrath of Arsenal fans really rather badly after Arsenal's 2-2 draw at Anfield, where they appeared to cower out of the way of Martin Skrtel's late header which lost Arsenal two points.
Since then, with the return of Koscielny, they have performed at a much higher level, but many believe that they do not have long left as Arsenal's first-choice defender. Indeed, the signing of Gabriel from Villarreal suggests a possible replacement, and the Brazilian's debut against Middlesbrough was promising to say the least. Is Per Mertesacker's time at Arsenal up?
In their defence, conditions have been much tougher this season: Mathieu Flamini has been very poor, and whilst they were playing regularly in the first team, offered little protection for the defence; Mertesacker had to look after Calum Chambers whilst Koscielny was injured, and the youngster, though promising, has a lot to learn as they adapt to the centre-back position. Since Koscielny's and Francis Coquelin's return, they have looked much more assured when they have played, and put in a stirring effort away to Manchester City. However, there is no question that Arsenal can do better than him.
Now that they have paid off their stadium debt, Arsenal have a lot of money available to them. Certainly, they are very able to attract players of top quality: Mesut Özil and Alexis Sanchez both signed within a year of each other, and the Gunners are no longer to accept mediocrity representing their strongest side. It is time for the club to show some serious ambition; much has been spoken of a desire to win league and Champions League titles, and players of the highest calibre are needed to win those types of competitions.
This season, Mertesacker has not produced the performances of a Premier League champion, though they have put in the performances of at least a strong backup defender. Now that Gabriel is on the sign, perhaps it would be right for them to play a secondary role in the squad, helping Calum Chambers to develop, and filling in for Gabriel and Koscielny when needed. However, if Arsenal are to show serious ambition, they should sign a truly world-class centre-back and let Mertesacker play first team football elsewhere. That would be ruthless, but that was how the club was run in the Invincibles era: those not up to standard were shifted off pretty quickly.
The defender I would most like to see playing for Arsenal is none other than Diego Godín. The Uruguayan was crucial in Atletico Madrid's La Liga title and run to the Champions League final last year, and, alongside Koscielny, would form an even more formidable defensive pairing than the Mertesacker-Koscielny partnership at its peak. They themselves may be in their thirties, but it seems they will be able to keep this level up long into their thirties like Arsenal fans hoped Mertesacker would.
Having said this, it is unlikely that Arsenal, having signed Gabriel, will make another big name signing in the same position only a few months later. Moreover, it is unlikely that Arsène Wenger would want to sign a player so advanced in their career, so it is much more plausible that Gabriel will take over from Mertesacker, and the German will stay on as a squad player for a little longer. As mentioned earlier, Mertesacker would be a very strong backup, but it seems a shame to force them not to play much first team football.
In conclusion, I want Arsenal to sign Diego Godín, but then again, I want Arsenal to sign an endless list of world-class players. It is much more realistic that Arsenal will allow a defensive pairing of Laurent Koscielny and Gabriel Paulista to develop under the watchful eye of Per Mertesacker, whilst they help the promising Calum Chambers to reach their full potential.

The British government has been training a Bangladeshi paramilitary force condemned by human rights organisations as a "government death squad", leaked US embassy cables have revealed.
Members of the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), which has been held responsible for hundreds of extra-judicial killings in recent years and is said to routinely use torture, have received British training in "investigative interviewing techniques" and "rules of engagement".
Details of the training were revealed in a number of cables, released by WikiLeaks, which address the counter-terrorism objectives of the US and UK governments in Bangladesh. One cable makes clear that the US would not offer any assistance other than human rights training to the RAB – and that it would be illegal under US law to do so – because its members commit gross human rights violations with impunity.
Since the RAB was established six years ago, it is estimated by some human rights activists to have been responsible for more than 1,000 extra-judicial killings, described euphemistically as "crossfire" deaths. In September last year the director general of the RAB said their men had killed 577 people in "crossfire". In March this year they updated the figure, saying they had killed 622 people.
The RAB's use of torture has also been exhaustively documented by human rights organisations. In addition, officers from the paramilitary force are alleged to have been involved in kidnap and extortion, and are frequently accused of taking large bribes in return for carrying out crossfire killings.
However, the cables reveal that both the British and the Americans, in their determination to strengthen counter-terrorism operations in Bangladesh, are in favour of bolstering the force, arguing that the "RAB enjoys a great deal of respect and admiration from a population scarred by decreasing law and order over the last decade". In one cable, the US ambassador to Dhaka, James Moriarty, expresses the view that the RAB is the "enforcement organisation best positioned to one day become a Bangladeshi version of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation".
In another cable, Moriarty quotes British officials as saying they have been "training RAB for 18 months in areas such as investigative interviewing techniques and rules of engagement". Asked about the training assistance for the RAB, the Foreign Office said the UK government "provides a range of human rights assistance" in the country. However, the RAB's head of training, Mejbah Uddin, told the Guardian that they were unaware of any human rights training since they were appointed last summer.
The cables make clear that British training for RAB officers began three years ago under the last Labour government.
However, RAB officials confirmed independently of the cables that they had taken part in a series of courses and workshops as recently as October, five months after the formation of the coalition government. Asked whether ministers had approved the training programme, the Foreign Office said only that William Hague, the foreign secretary, and other ministers, had been briefed on counter-terrorism spending.
The US ambassador explains in the cables that the US government is "constrained by RAB's alleged human rights violations, which have rendered the organisation ineligible to receive training or assistance" under laws which prohibit American funding or training for overseas military units which abuse human rights with impunity.
Human rights organisations say the RAB cannot be reformed, noting that its human rights record has deterioriated still further in the last 12 months. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly described the RAB as a government death squad.
Brad Adams, the organisation's Asia director, said: "RAB is a Latin American-style death squad dressed up as an anti-crime force. The British government has let its desire for a functional counter-terrorism partner in Bangladesh blind it to the risks of working with RAB, and the legitimacy that it gives to RAB inside Bangladesh. Furthermore, it is not clear that the British government has ever made it a priority at the highest levels to tell RAB that if it doesn't change, it will not co-operate with it."
Amnesty International has also repeatedly condemned the RAB, while the Bangladeshi human rights organisation Odhikar has painstakingly documented the RAB's involvement in extra-judicial killings and torture since the creation of the force in March 2004.
Asked to comment on the rights groups' concern about the RAB, the Foreign Office said: "We do not discuss the detail of operational counter-terrorism cooperation. Counter-terrorism assistance is fully in line with our laws and values." At least some of the British training has been conducted by serving British police officers, working under the auspices of the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), which was established in 2007 to build policing capacity and standards. Recent courses for RAB have been provided by officers from West Mercia and Humberside Police.
Asked whether it believed it was appropriate for British officers to be training members of an organisation condemned as "a government death squad", and whether courses in investigative interviewing techniques might not render torture more effective, an NPIA spokesperson said the courses had been approved by the government and by the Association of Chief Police Officers.
"The NPIA has given limited support to the Bangladeshi Police and the RAB in technical areas of policing such as forensic awareness, management of crime scenes and recovery of evidence. Throughout the training we have emphasised the importance of respecting the human rights of witnesses, suspects and victims."The purpose of our sanctioned engagement is to support the development and improvement of professional policing that supports democratic, human rights-based practices linked to the rule of law in countries that may have different laws, faiths and policing practices from our own."
It is understood that there have been disagreements within the Foreign Office about the British government's involvement with the RAB. Some officials have argued that the partnership with the RAB is an essential component of the UK's counter-terrorism strategy in the region, while others have expressed concern that the relationship could prove damaging to Britain's reputation.
Successive Bangladeshi governments have promised to end the RAB's use of murder. The current government promised in its manifesto that it would end all extra-judicial killings, but they have continued following its election two years ago.In October last year, the shipping minister, Shahjahan Khan, speaking in a discussion organised by the BBC, said: "There are incidents of trials that are not possible under the laws of the land. The government will need to continue with extra-judicial killings, commonly called crossfire, until terrorist activities and extortion are uprooted."
In December last year the high court in Dhaka ruled that such killings must be brought to a halt following litigation by victims' familes and human rights groups, but they continue on an almost weekly basis. Most of the victims are young men, some are alleged to be petty criminals or are said to be left-wing activists, and the killings invariably take place in the middle of the night.
In the most recent "crossfire" killings, the RAB reported that it had shot dead Mohammad Mamun, 25, in the town of Tangail, shortly after midnight on Monday, and that 90 minutes later its officers in Dhaka, 50 miles to the south, had shot dead a second man, Taku Alam, 30. Today the RAB announced it had shot dead a 45-year-old man, Anisur Rahman, said to be a member of the Communist party in the west of the country.
One possibility is that the people in the sample set are all distantly related. The genomes in question all come from the Framingham Heart Study, a well-known dataset associated with people on the east coast of the US who are generally white and of European ancestry. Perhaps the genetic links are simply a reflection of this common background.
Not so, say Christakis and Fowler. The correlation they have found exists only between friends but not between strangers. If this was a reflection of their common ancestry, then the genomes of strangers should be correlated just as strongly. “Pairs of (strictly unrelated) friends generally tend to be more genetically homophilic than pairs of strangers from the same population,” they point out.
There are certainly other processes that could lead to friends having similar genomes. One idea that dates back some 30 years is that a person's genes causes them to seek out circumstances that are compatible with their phenotype. If that's the case, then people with similar genes should end up in similar environments.
That makes sense. “If one individual builds a fire because they feel cold in the same circumstances as the other, both benefit,” say Christakis and Fowler.
What's more, this idea may not only apply to the physical environment but also to the social environment. So people with similar genes may end up in similar social groups too.
Both of these factors make it more likely that your friends will have similar genes. But nobody has gathered evidence for this until now.
There may be another mechanism at work. One idea is that humans can somehow identify people with similar genetic make up, perhaps with some kind of pheromone detector. Indeed, Christakis and Fowler say that some of the genes they found in common are related to olfaction, a discovery they describe as “intriguing and supportive”.
Whatever the cause, the discovery that our friends are genetically similar to us has significant implications. “The subtle process of genetic sorting in human social relationships might have an important effect on a number of other biological and social processes,” say Christakis and Fowler.
For example, germs, viruses and even information may spread more (or less) easily amongst groups that share a particular genetic background.
More significantly, this may be the first evidence that our social environment is an evolutionary force that can influence our genetic make up. And if so, we may have evolved a predeliction to choose friends who are similar to us once we started to interact socially with other people who are unrelated.
That's an important process that would especially speed up the evolution of phenotypes that cooperate well, say Christakis and Fowler.
There are caveats of course. This research will be controversial and others will want to be sure that Christakis and Fowler have not misinterpreted their data.
The research will be hard to reproduce. The Framingham Heart Study is unique in that it is a large database that includes both genetic data and friendship links. Christakis and Fowler acknowledge that there is no other like it.
But if the result is widely accepted it will be hugely influential.
One of the big mysteries associated with the development of human capabilities is that our evolution appears to be accelerating. After billions of years of relatively slow change, it created the marvel that is the human brain and consciousness, in the metaphorical blink of an eye.
Christakis and Fowler end their paper with the tantalising speculation their discovery may shed light on this mysterious process of acceleration that has produced the wonder of complex reasoning and consciousness.

After successfully launching the Mars Orbiter Mission, India is now gearing up for its next expedition, to the Sun.
Solar physicists from all over the country will meet in Bangalore next week to prepare for the mission, Aditya 1, which will carry equipment to study solar corona.
The three-day meeting to be held at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) between November 18 and 20 will focus on the scientific objectives and technical developments of the facilities planned for Aditya-1, which is expected to be launched in 2015-16.
The IIA has designed the space-based solar coronagraph, basically a telescopic attachment which will black out the glare of the Sun in order to study, which will be launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation's (Isro) workhorse Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) into an 800 km polar orbit.
The major scientific objectives of the proposed space solar coronagraph are to achieve a fundamental understanding of the physical processes that heat the solar corona, the extended out atmosphere of the Sun, accelerate the solar wind and produce coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
Aditya-1 mission was originally scheduled to be launched during the high solar activity period (2012-13), but the launch was delayed as Isro prioritised the Mars Orbiter Mission, as the mission to Red Planet had to be expedited for the first available launch window.
The available launch windows to launch the Mars mission in this decade are 2013, 2016 and 2018.
However, with the successful launch of the Mars Orbiter Mission, the focus is now on Aditya-1.“Aditya 1 has recently been reconfigured as a L1 mission and several payloads are expected to fly together. Aditya will work as a space observatory with multi-wavelength capabilities. Different modes of observational requirements will be discussed at length,” states IIA agenda for the meeting.
Isro and other agencies involved in the programme have completed the Preliminary Design Review of Optics and Detector systems.
They are currently working on the payload structural design and thermal design of the mirrors. The Mission is expected to be launched in 2015-16.
A road-rage motorist who hit national headlines after The Argus revealed footage of them swearing at a cyclist 25 times in just 35 seconds has been handed a fine.
Mark Baldwin, 60, was caught confronting Eastbourne cyclist Eddie Bell in an expletive-ridden video after an incident on Eastbourne Road in Pevensey on March 10.
The video shows Jaguar driver Mr Baldwin, of Longfield, Kent, and Mr Bell, 38, in a verbal altercation apparently about the car's position on the road.
Mr Baldwin was recorded reeling out a series of insults and abuse to Mr Bell, who was filming on their iPhone, before the cyclist made off.
The driver voluntarily visited a police station following the video's publication on the internet, including The Argus website, and appeared at Hastings' Magistrate Court on August 19.
They pleaded guilty of using threatening or abusive words or behaviour with intent to cause the victim to think violence would be used against them and was ordered to pay a £505 fine, £50 victim surcharge and £85 costs. Sussex Police said the assault charge was dismissed.
Mr Bell told The Argus they hoped appearing in court would make them ‘think twice' about their action in future.
They said: “I was quite happy with the amount of disruption, cost and worry this has caused them over the last six months.
“Hopefully they will think twice about their actions in future.”
The infamous video of the altercation between Mr Baldwin and Mr Bell has been watched by more than 65,000 people across the world since it was uploaded to video sharing website YouTube in March.
The Argus contacted Mr Baldwin for comment but did not receive a response by the time it went to press.
New York City's seemingly star-crossed bike-share program, once promised for last summer but delayed until the spring amid software problems, has found its way into Hurricane Sandy's unsparing path.
The storm dumped several feet of water at some points across the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where the city had been storing equipment like bicycles and docking stations in Building 293, near the northern tip of the yard and the waters of Wallabout Bay.
Building 293 was among those that flooded, and a spokesperson for the mayor's office said Tuesday that there appeared to be damage to program equipment, including docking stations for bicycles, as a result.
“We're working on it,” Janette Sadik-Khan, the city's transportation commissioner, said when reached by telephone on Tuesday afternoon. “We had six feet of water in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.”

Officials said it was premature to estimate whether the flooding could affect the program's start date, scheduled for next March.

The city's Transportation Department would not describe or detail the extent of the damage; officials released a brief statement on Tuesday saying the agency was “making an assessment” and would provide updates if the program's rollout might be affected.

The Xbox One launches this fall for $499. Microsoft has recently backtracked on several key features for the console following a backlash from video game players.
In June, Microsoft scaled back policies requiring regular authenticity checks online and limitations on what players could do with games after purchase.
Last week, in an interview with IGN, Microsoft's Marc Whitten confirmed the Kinect motion sensor was no longer required for the console to function. Several critics raised privacy concerns related to a feature where a user could power up the console by saying "Xbox, on."
The holiday will prove critical to the video game industry, which also introduces Sony's PlayStation 4 this holiday. Meanwhile, Nintendo hopes to regain traction with its Wii U device, which has struggled to capture player interest.

Enhanced privacy controls in the Android 4.3, which allowed the installation of apps while blocking their ability to gather sensitive data from a user, have been removed in the new Android 4.4.2. Google says the feature's original release was an accident.
App Ops was a privacy component installed in the Android 4.3 which shielded information that users wanted to protect from any new app.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) reported Wednesday that just a day after it had lauded the privacy feature via a blog post on its site, the organization learned that the option is no longer available on the Android 4.4.2 update, which was released earlier this week.
Google told EFF that the feature was included in 4.3 by accident, claiming the control was experimental and could ultimately break apps policed by it.
EFF stressed that there are ways Google could easily remedy such concerns if it so desired, by feeding fake information to the app or telling app developers that the privacy control could disrupt their program.
EFF called the disappearance of App Ops a “Stygian hole in the Android security model,” given that there is now no way to curb app permissions, despite the easy fixes which are available.
The digital rights group urged Google to renew App Ops for Android while improving the feature. Google could do this, EFF says, by adding targeted controls for users to be able to pick and choose which apps have access to sensitive data. In addition, Google could make App Ops workable for app developers in the process, the organization stated.
EFF says at the moment, though, Android users must choose between privacy and overall protection, as Android 4.4.2 includes updates to security and denial-of-service bugs.
The loss of the security feature comes at a time when mobile phone users are having to deal with unwanted snooping by the apps that they download - even when such data sharing is opt-out.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently came down on the makers of the ‘Brightest Flashlight,' a popular free Android app that adapted the flash built into a handset to make it behave like a standard flashlight. Unbeknownst to users, however, the app had been secretly harvesting location and unique device identifier data and sharing it with advertisers and marketing networks.
Goldenshores Technologies, the US developer behind the Brightest Flashlight app, recently reached a settlement with the FTC. The app had been installed on “tens of millions” of Android devices, according to the agency.

The final war has begun against the terrorists in the valley. The Army is being ruthless to the terrorists in the Kashmir valley. In just 38 days, the Army has eliminated 63 terrorists and has broken the spine of the Pakistan backed terrorists. The speciality of the Army is that during the clash with the terrorists, damages to the civilians have been very minor. The Army's intelligence pass on vital information on where the terrorists are hiding and soon the Security force surround the area and send the terrorists to hell. Stone pelters as usual try to stop the encounter of the terrorists but the Army isn't deterred by all these. Army has decided to wipe off all the terrorists by this year end.
The biggest success was killing of Hizbul terrorist Sabzar Ahmad Bhat, Burhan Wani's successor in Tral area of Kashmir's Pulwama district. The Army was so fierceful that Sabzar didn't even fire a bullet. Army said that they were a coward in death.
The Army Cheif has given clear indication that by the end of 2017 valley will be free of terrorists. All the misguided youths, poor principal's sons are going to have a bad time.
Indian Army is one among the best Army in the world but it was not given free hand in the valley. The moment Modi extended full support, the Army proved to be fatal to the terrorists. NIA conducted raids on various terror supporters so that funding to the stone pelters can be stopped. Arms and ammunitions, laptops, mobiles and hard cash were seized in these raids.
The recent success was that of the encounter of the top Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) commander Junaid Mattoo who has been killed in an encounter with security forces in Arwani village of Bijbihara in Anantnag District of South Kashmir. Mattoo was believed to be active for the past two years and carried a bounty of Rs 10 lakh on their head.
Not only in reducing the terrorists but also the Army has been successful in educating the Kashmiri students and making them a topper. Nine Kashmir students coached by army's Super-40 initiative clear JEE Advanced. Army intends to increase this number.
Army chief and five commanders met in Valley for ‘routine meet' in the first week of this month. They said that it was a routine meet but usually it was organised in the Delhi twice a year. Even this meet has created a tremble in the minds of the terrorists.
Even though PDP is with BJP, it supported anti-national elements through back doors but Modi government didn't hesitate to go tough on terrorists. PDP wanted peace talks and BJP wanted the terrorists into pieces.
Army General made a smart move by appreciating Major Leetul Gogoi who had tied a stone pelter on top of the bonnet. This move came even though there was heavy opposition in Kashmir. This symbolises that there is no looking back in dealing with the terrorists.
Indian Army has been highly successful in controlling the terror activities. So this has been a headache to the pseudo seculars. So this is the reason why Sandeep Dixit, Prakash Karat and many more are targeting General Bipin Rawat. Along with the end of the terrorists, there is no surprise if these pseudo seculars career also comes to an end.

The United States began its invasion of Iraq 12 years ago. Yesterday, a previously classified Central Intelligence Agency report containing supposed proof of the country's weapons of mass destruction was published by Jason Leopold of Vice News. Put together nine months before the start of the war, the National Intelligence Estimate spells out what the CIA knew about Iraq's ability to produce biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons. It would become the backbone of the Bush administration's mistaken assertions that Saddam Hussein possessed WMDs and posed a direct threat to the post-9/11 world.
The report is rife with what now are obvious red flags that the Bush White House oversold the case for war. It asserts that Iraq had an active chemical weapon program at one point, though it admits that the CIA had found no evidence of the program's continuation. It repeatedly includes caveats like “credible evidence is limited.” It gives little space to the doubts of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, which found the CIA's findings on Iraq's nuclear program unconvincing and “at best ambiguous.”
This isn't the first time the report's been released in full: A version was made public in 2004, but nearly all the text was redacted. Last year, transparency advocate John Greenwald successfully petitioned the CIA for a more complete version. Greenwald shared the document with Leopold.
Here's the full report:
Serious MacKeeper vulnerability found
I have long advised against using MacKeeper for a variety of reasons (some of which can be found in Ongoing MacKeeper fraud). However, now there's a new reason to avoid MacKeeper: it has been found to contain a serious vulnerability that can lead to remote code execution through the use of a malicious URL. In non-tech-speak, a hacker can create a link that will, if clicked, result in MacKeeper executing code embedded within the link! Such code could do things like wiping your hard drive clean, uploading data to a remote server, or downloading and installing malware.
This is a very serious issue, and now that a proof-of-concept has been published, users of MacKeeper are at high risk of attack. No malicious MacKeeper URLs have yet been spotted in the wild, but hackers have the blueprints now, so it's undoubtedly just a matter of time.
The attack is quite simple, unfortunately. Take a look at the proof-of-concept (PoC) URL released by Braden Thomas:
com-zeobit-command:///i/ZBAppController/performActionWithHelperTask: arguments:/ BAtzdHJlYW10eXBlZIHoA4QBQISEhAhOU1N0cmluZwGEhAhOU09iamVjdACFhAErBk5TVGFz a4aShISEDE5TRGljdGlvbmFyeQCUhAFpA5KEk5UJQVJHVU1FTlRThpKEhIQHTlNBcnJheQCU lwKShJOVAi1jhpKEk5U4cm0gLXJmIC9BcHBsaWNhdGlvbnMvTWFjS2VlcGVyLmFwcDtwa2ls bCAtOSAtYSBNYWNLZWVwZXKGhpKEk5UGUFJPTVBUhpKEk5UzWW91ciBjb21wdXRlciBoYXMg bWFsd2FyZSB0aGF0IG5lZWRzIHRvIGJlIHJlbW92ZWQuhpKEk5ULTEFVTkNIX1BBVEiGkoST lQcvYmluL3NohoY=
This PoC will execute the following command:
rm -rf /Applications/MacKeeper.app;pkill -9 -a MacKeeper
One may wonder who in their right minds would click on a link looking like that. However, in Mr. Thomas' tweet containing the PoC, this URL was hidden behind a shortened tinyurl.com URL. Such link shortening can easily be used to disguise a maliciously-crafted link, and has proven to be an effective method for tricking people into clicking on links that they otherwise would not.
Those who have MacKeeper installed have a new, and very serious, reason to remove the software as soon as possible! To do so, follow the instructions on Phil Stokes' page on removing MacKeeper, or use their DetectX app to find and remove all components of MacKeeper automatically.

A B.C. mother has been warned to rein in the outdoor activities of their three children, after neighbours complained that their play was causing too much of a disturbance.
Jana D'Addabbo was recently served with a bylaw warning from the City of Coquitlam, instructing them to control the noise coming from their property when their kids are outside. The city also instructs them to talk to their kids about riding scooters and skateboards in the street.
The city says the warning is a last resort to get D'Addabbo's three children, aged 8, 8 and 6, to play more quietly.
D'Addabbo says their children are just being kids and enjoying the spring weather, but the city says their activities have been an ongoing problem.
"We've worked with this particular household for four years and it's been a real challenge," Coquitlam Mayor Richard Stewart told CTV Vancouver on Monday.
The city says it issued a similar warning to D'Addabbo around this time last year. "It's a very extreme case of disturbing behaviour from a group of children, and from some adults, that has disturbed the neighbourhood," Stewart said.
D'Addabbo acknowledges that their children can be loud, but they say a bylaw warning is not warranted.
"No one has ever asked me to keep my kids quiet," they told CTV Vancouver. They added that they find it "bizarre" that neighbours would complain to the city, instead of speaking to them directly.
"If you have an issue, come talk to me. I'll try and keep my kids quiet," they said.
One neighbour told CTV Vancouver that the children can be heard using coarse language, and occasionally demonstrate behaviour "that can endanger others."
The neighbour declined to be identified, and said they were not the one who made the complaint to the city. They also said a group of neighbours did go to D'Addabbo with their concerns, before reporting the issue to officials.
But D'Addabbo insists their kids are simply being kids.
"What's next?" they said. "They're going to play outside (and) I'm going to get a ticket this time?"

Eagles quarterback Nick Foles has plenty of expectations to live up to this season -- unless you take a look at where they rank on this latest list by ESPN.
Foles just barely made it onto the list of ESPN's top 100 offensive NFL players, coming in at No. 99. Only No. 100-91 have been revealed, so it isn't known yet how many quarterbacks will come in ahead of Foles. One that already has, however, is Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler, who finished at No. 93.
In addition to Cutler, another player who you can certainly debate Foles belongs higher than is running back DeMeco Murray of the Dallas Cowboys, who finished at No. 91. Eagles running back Darren Sproles was No. 100 on the list.
The list was compiled by surveying 90 "NFL experts", who ranked each player in the league on a scale of 1-10. The fact that Foles finished so low on the list is not exactly a huge diss, as there are over 1,600 players in the league.
Foles burst onto the scene last season with 27 touchdowns and just two interceptions, winning the Pro Bowl MVP and leading their team to the playoffs. Foles only producing for less than one season, and Chip Kelly being their head coach, seems to be the reason that there is still plenty of skepticism surrounding the quarterback.
Still, considering the position they play and what they did last season, finishing 99th shows once again just how mixed those around the league seem to be on the Eagles starting quarterback.

Recently by Fred Reed: Reality Check, Mexico
Ever wonder why the US military cant win wars? Why a few ragtag guerillas could send it running out of Somalia (Black Hawk Down)? Why one guy with a truck bomb could chase the Marines out of Lebanon? Why the attempt to rescue the hostages in Iran was such a disaster? Why the worlds most expensive military cant win its unending wars against peasants with rifles? How is this possible?
Different jobs attract different personalities. The Mike Tysons of the world do not go into ballet, nor do the Mother Teresas become tank commanders. The career military attracts people who run from the merely abnormal to the frankly weird. For example, they place extreme value on ritual and ceremony, on ribbons and medals and colored things more appropriate to a Christmas tree than to a human being. They are authoritarian by nature, comfortable in a rigid, hierarchical, and conformist society that most of us would find equally unbearable and absurd. Suppose your boss told everyone in the office that they had to wear exactly the same clothes and stand at attention in the morning to that they could determine whether they had dressed themselves correctly. Militaries start with odd material.
Then they inculcate in themselves an exaggerated sense of their own powers, a sort of Terminator complex. This is done calculatedly in basic training when men are in impressionable late or, in the case of officers, extended adolescence. They absorb the notion of invincibility and it persists into adulthood.
Examples abound. When I was at Parris Island in a previous geological epoch, a large sign in Third Battalion conspicuously said, The Most Dangerous Weapon in the World: A Marine with their Rifle. This didnt rise to the level of nonsense. Few Marines are as dangerous as a hydrogen bomb, and Marines in general are just pretty good light infantry, well-equipped as an expeditionary force.
But you cant tell fresh young troops, Youre maybe a bit above average, but the Afghans are much tougher people, having been raised fighting and living on dried goat-meat, and they know the terrain, whereas you will have no idea where you are and your equipment and tactics are badly suited for the region, so its going to be hard slogging. Not optimal for recruiting. More profoundly, men in combat arms want to feel inexorable, deadly, the best. Whether they actually are doesnt occur to them until the war starts. A satisfying state of mind is what is wanted.
This preference for mood over reality runs through their careers. Constantly they are told that they are the best trained, best equipped, most powerful and effective fighting force the world has seen. This is not a statement of fact but of mandatory enthusiasm. The Pentagons record since WW II has been a sorry one. Further, effectiveness, training, and so on are relative to a particular situation: a force well-equipped for desert war against aging Iraqi armor is not necessarily equipped to fight guerrillas in Quang Tri or Helmand.
But soldiers, romantics pretending to be realists, do not think in these terms. And so you hear from them unending expressions of fierceness. Crush their skulls and eat their faces, and Oooo-rah! The tee shirt of the 82nd Airborne said, Death from above. (I saw a Marine cook whose shirt said, Death from Within.) The Marine Corps Builds Men, or did until feminists put an end to that. Now they are The Few, the Proud. Well and good, but morale is no substitute for victory. (You can quote me on that.)
The relentless affirmation of their lethality leads to underestimation of the enemy. Before you stick your hand into a hornets nest, it is well to examine the hornets. We dont. The Taliban are primitive mountain-crawlers with AKs. No problem, sir! We can take them. Were the best equipped etc. In an ancient war of classical antiquity, the Vietnamese were held in contempt as rice-propelled paddy maggots. No problem, sir. Weve got fighter planes and tanks and endless zip-wowees. Everything but understanding and curiosity.
Of course, Saigon is now Ho Chi Minh City. In like fashion, the French also got run out of Viet Nam, and from Algeria, the Russians from Afghanistan, the Israelis from Lebanon, in each case a trained modern military losing to angry and inventive amateurs.
The norm is a wild overestimation of ones own powers, disdain for the enemy, and inattention to tactical facts. Why? Not because soldiers are actually stupid, but because they prefer martial ardor to thought.
The compulsory belief that they are the best-trained, best-equipped etc. elides quickly into the can-do-ism of the US military. A lieutenant does not say, Colonel, this is a half-assed idea you have and isnt going to work. Maybe you need to think a little more. No. They say, Yessir! Can do, sir! Thus the glandular optimism of Failure is not an option! when since World War Two it has become the norm, and There is no substitute for victory, when losing and going home has proved serviceable, and, The difficult we can do today; the impossible takes a little longer. Agreeably cocky, stirring, mindless, and rampant in the Pentagon. Sir! Yessir! Can do, sir!
In their elevated estimation of their powers, (which is not personal egotism) militaries routinely underestimate the difficulty and duration of their wars. The American Civil War, widely expected to end after First Manassas (or, as I think Yankees call it, Bull Run), turned into four years of ghastly bloodshed. In WW I the German general staff thought that the Schlieffen Plan, keep to the right, to the right, would end the war quickly, but it turned into four bloody and completely unexpected years. The Pentagon had no idea that Vietnam would turn into a long, ugly, losing war, nor that Iraq would present a struggle still not over, nor that Afghanistan would turn into the ten-year-and-counting monstrosity that it is. Sir! Yessir! Can do, sir!
Aggravating the sense of omnipotence is the possession of impressive weaponry. It is impressive, even the old stuff. (If interested). The electronics, sensors, noises, flashes, the sheer technological mastery, the thrill of speed and roar  all appeal to the male love of power and controllable complexity. They do not elicit the crucial question, Yeah, but how is it going to work in this war?
In Libya one sees this touching innocence. Air power would save the day for the rebels. Can do, sir. Wasnt Libya open desert where air power should be decisive? The assumption apparently was the usual, that Gaddafis forces were pathetic mugs who couldnt adapt. So the Mad Colonels troops began riding in civilian cars and mixing with civilians and the war is now being called a stalemate. Who would have thought it?
Yessir! Can do, sir! Yeah.

The tallest wind turbines in the U.S. have been installed in Texas — the Vestas V90 turbines are 345 feet high, and are rated at 3 megawatts each. They are part of the 63 megawatt Snyder Wind Project, a wind farm that's just been installed in western Texas.
Texas is already home to Horse Hollow, the world's largest wind farm with 421 wind turbines that generate a total capacity of 735 megawatts.
The turbine towers at Snyder are so tall because wind conditions are best at that height — will produce energy sufficient to power more than 12,000 average Texas homes annually.
The wind farm was built by Enel SpA and GE Energy Financial Services. The two companies are also working together on another 101 megawatt wind farm project in Kansas.
Workers repair a 1.5 MW wind turbine — the turbines at Snyder are twice this size.

Missing for more than 90 years, the beautiful and enigmatic “Fisherman's Daughter” is finally on their way home to France.
The Jules Breton painting was stolen from the Douai Beaux Art Museum in Northern France by German troops during the First World War and its fate was a mystery that haunted the art world for nearly a century.
Then last year, there was a break in the case. French officials and Interpol were alerted that the painting, valued today at about $150,000, had been imported by an art dealer in New York. The painting was recovered, but the mystery was not yet solved. Officials discovered the painting had been heavily restored. Was this “Fisherman's Daughter,” the authentic realist masterpiece, or a skillful fake?
Art experts, curators and historians from France and the United States were called in to examine the painting and investigate its long and clandestine history. After a close examination of records and documentation, both in the United States and in France, and visits to museums and key witnesses, the story of the painting emerged.
It was indeed the same painting stolen from the Douai museum in 1918 – the authentic “Fisherman's Daughter.”
The backstory investigators discovered about “Fisherman's Daughter” theft turned out to be a engaging yarn.
It was discovered that during the German occupation of the northern part of the country. German troops confiscated artwork from the Douai Beaux Art Museum and sent the artwork to Mons, Belgium, and then to Brussels.
In 1919, the Belgian government organized the return of the French collection to France. However, “Fisherman's Daughter” was not among the works.
No one is certain, but apparently the painting was stolen from the Belgian government prior to the collection being returned to France.
No one knows what happened to the painting after that, except for the fact that it was professionally restored. The painting was apparently in private hands recently, then turned up being imported to an art dealer in New York last year.
Today, U.S. officials returned the masterpiece to the French people at a ceremony in Washington attended by the French ambassador, ending the nearly century-long art mystery.
“Returning a painting to a museum is a significant contribution to the celebration of our cultural heritage and a gift to all future visitors who will enjoy the work of art, but it is also yet another symbol of Franco-American cooperation,” said French Ambassador to the United States François Delattre. “We are celebrating today a gesture of friendship by the United States toward the French Republic.”
The American portion of the investigation was led by a little-known office inside the Department of Homeland Security — the Cultural Property, Art and Antiquities Unit, based in New York. The unit plays a leading role in criminal investigations that involve the illicit importation and distribution of cultural property, as well as the illegal trafficking of artwork. The agency specializes in recovering works that have been reported lost or stolen.
“As the foremost agency investigating the plundering of cultural property, we are pleased to return a piece of French heritage that was stolen during World War I,” said ICE Director John Morton. “We remain committed to combating cultural heritage crimes, which are one of the oldest forms of organized cross-border illicit activity.”
Since 2007, the ICE Art and Antiquities Unit has repatriated more than 2,500 items to more than 22 countries, including paintings from France, Germany and Austria; an 18th century manuscript from Italy; a bookmark belonging to Adolph Hitler and cultural artifacts from Iraq, including Babylonian, Sumerian and neo-Assyrian items.

WILKES-BARRE -- Police in Wilkes-Barre arrested a man for firing a gun in the parking lot of restaurant.
Workers at Denny's on Kidder Street say they heard a shot outside around 3 p.m. Wednesday.
"We had one of our employee's grandfathers come in and just yell, ‘Call the cops! Somebody has been shot,'” said Anna Mae Olivo, a Denny's employee.
Investigators say a man and woman were arguing when that man shot their gun, blasting out the back window of a vehicle.
Witnesses say the woman drove a short distance away before stopping.
The man ran off into the nearby wooded area.
"I saw a gentleman running, dark hoodie, it looked like khaki pants. And just booked it over the hill, over there,” said Olivo.
Police followed footprints in the snow to find the suspect. Officers arrested him. They were covered in mud and barefoot.

People in the area were shocked by all the police and commotion.
"Scary. I mean, you just don't know where to go anymore without turning your head every which way. These days as soon as I get in my car, I lock the doors,” said Barbara Majorana of Larksville.
"I think it's typical. I think this is the way the country is going. You can't trust anyone anymore, and it's a shame. We all have to watch each other's back,” said Tony Majorana of Larksville.
After the arrest, police returned to the woods to search for the suspect's gun and cell phone.
"You know there will be another one right behind them doing the same thing. They don't respect anything, there's no respect no more and that's what we need,” said Majorana.
DENTON -- A tragic murder-suicide in Denton is indicative of a growing problem among the elderly.
Denton Police say Joe Bain, 79, killed their ailing wife before turning the gun on themselves last Saturday afternoon.
According to a police affidavit, Bain called 9-1-1 and confessed, saying, "he had just taken the life of their beloved wife Ruth."
They told the operator "there was no way they were going to a nursing home.”
"I am sorry to all of our friends," they added, according to the document.
When police arrived at their home on Royal Oaks Place, they found Ruth Bain, 82, dead on the couch from an apparent gunshot wound to their head. Them husband was lying on the floor, also with a gunshot wound to the head. They were taken to the hospital but died of their injury the next day.
"It appeared that they had been asleep when they were shot," said Officer Shane Kizer with Denton Police. "It doesn't sound like there was any struggle. it doesn't sound like there was any animosity from them towards her."
The Bains had been married nearly 30 years, and what happened inside the house has shocked their neighbors and extended family. They were by all accounts a happy and devoted couple.
Denton Police say that both Bains suffered from some illnesses, and that Ruth's was debilitating. Joe Bain had apparently been their caretaker.
The sad case in Denton highlights a significant problem. The violence Policy Center says murder-suicides among the elderly increased 10% from 2005 to 2014.
"In the studies that have been done on these type of murder-suicides, that is one of the causes often, failing health and having to go to a nursing home," said Dr. Nishendu Vasavada.
Dr. Vasavada is a psychiatrist with Lakeside Life Center in Carrollton. They believe more focus is needed on mental healthcare for the elderly, an age when depression can set in, especially for caretakers with an ailing spouse.
"They don't want to lose their independence and depend on other people," said Dr. Vasavada. "They see it as a sort of painful condition to be in a nursing home."
The suicide rate has also been rising among the elderly. In the 85 or older age group, the rate stands at 19.4, the second-highest of any age group, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.
"The worst part is that it's going up. There are very few diseases where the death rate is going up, and suicide is one of them," said Vasavada.
They say trouble can often go unnoticed, and it's crucial for extended family to stay connected with elderly relatives and provide support.
"Contact is critical," Dr. Vasavada said. "Getting appropriate care for the family and early on, deciding what do they want as a couple."

MICROSOFT COULD BE giving members of its Windows Insider Programme for Windows 10 more attention than they might like.
The programme gives users access to a Technical Preview edition of its upcoming operating system Windows 10 that Microsoft announced on Tuesday, befuddling everyone by skipping Windows 9.
The Windows Insider Programme seemed like a gesture of openness and willingness to collaborate with developers on a peer level. But a closer look at the privacy policy of the Windows 10 preview reveals some startling permissions that you grant by installing and using it.
"Microsoft collects information about you, your devices, applications and networks, and your use of those devices, applications and networks. Examples of data we collect include your name, email address, preferences and interests; browsing, search and file history; phone call and SMS data; device configuration and sensor data; and application usage."
In fact, so far, that's pretty standard stuff, though a bit disconcerting. However, if you go on a bit, it also says:
"We may collect information about your device and applications and use it for purposes such as determining or improving compatibility" and "use voice input features like speech-to-text, we may collect voice information and use it for purposes such as improving speech processing."
In other words, Windows can collect your voice and anything you say, which is quite intrusive.
But we're only just getting started. The killer statement says, "If you open a file, we may collect information about the file, the application used to open the file, and how long it takes any use [of] it for purposes such as improving performance, or [if you] enter text, we may collect typed characters, we may collect typed characters and use them for purposes such as improving autocomplete and spellcheck features."
In other words, in effect, you are giving permission for Microsoft to screen your files, and in effect keylog your keyboard input. Renowned Windows blogger Mary Jo Foley recently said, "I've heard Microsoft built a new real-time telemetry system codenamed 'Asimov' (yes, another Halo-influenced codename) that lets the OS team see in near real-time what's happening on users' machines."
It certainly appears that they are right. We've contacted Microsoft for comment and will update this story as soon as Redmond is awake. In the meantime, think twice before you download Windows 10. You're promising a lot.
Earlier this week, it transpired that a number of parents had agreed to give up their first born children after failing to read the terms and conditions of a free WiFi hotspot.

In 2010, 7,500 customers of erstwhile game retailer Gamestation signed over their "immortal soul" to the company in a hidden clause added as an April Fools gag. µ
TORONTO — The Hamilton Tiger-Cats could be on the verge of losing of one of the most important members of their coaching staff to their arch rival.
With many of the league's major players in Toronto for the Grey Cup, there was plenty of chatter on possible changes across the CFL, including a widely-spread bit of speculation that would see Hamilton defensive co-ordinator Orlondo Steinauer moving down the QEW to take over as Argos head coach.
While the future of Toronto GM Jim Barker remains cloudy, many believe that current Argonauts head man Scott Milanovich will be fired this week. Should Barker be retained, Steinauer is expected to be a leading candidate to replace Milanovich given their previous relationship with Barker, who was in Toronto when Steinauer was an assistant coach. Steinauer's three-year deal with Hamilton expires after this season.
If Steinauer gets the head job in Toronto, their first call may be to their former colleague with the Ticats, Tommy Condell, who resigned as offensive co-ordinator on the eve of the 2016 season. Condell and their family are still living in Ancaster and word is that they would be open to a return to the CFL.
That said, another under-the-radar candidate for the Toronto coaching job, should it become available, could be Winnipeg offensive co-ordinator Paul LaPolice, who took the Bombers to the Grey Cup as head coach in 2012.
A Milanovich ousting could have another consequence: the possible retirement of quarterback Ricky Ray. Toronto has Drew Willy under contract for next season and the thought is that Ray would rather either hang them up or reunite with Danny Maciocia, the leading candidate for the vacant general manager position in with the Alouettes.
That said, while Maciocia continues to be the leading candidate to replace the fired Jim Popp in Montreal, there are still questions about whether he'll make the jump back to the CFL. If Maciocia stays put at the University of Montreal, look for current Winnipeg assistant general manager and former Ticat Danny McManus to be a serious candidate.
Back in Toronto, that's a possible destination for current Saskatchewan Roughrider quarterback and free-agent-to-be Darian Durant, who is reportedly fuming after current head coach Chris Jones' recent comments to a Regina newspaper that described the 2013 Grey Cup winner as "moderately successful."
The Riders are said to be interested in Eskimo backup James Franklin via the trade market, favouring the 25-year-old over the Durant, who will turn 35 midway through next season.
For the second time in two months, a “highly venomous” yellow-bellied sea snake has washed ashore on a Southern California beach, this time in Orange County.
The exotic reptile — seen only three times on the state's shoreline in the past three decades — was found by a volunteer at a Huntington Beach Surfrider Foundation beach cleanup event on Dec. 12 at Bolsa Chica State Beach, according to the Museum of Natural History of Los Angeles.
Tony Soriano, the foundation's chairperson, said the 275 volunteers who had showed up for the beach cleanup initially did not realize what species the snake was, or that it was even venomous.
Their son figured it out after doing a search on Google, Soriano added. After learning of the discovery, the curator of the Museum of Natural History contacted him.
Until the museum's assistant curator showed up at Soriano's home, they had kept the dead snake in a Ziploc bag in their refrigerator.
“That's a rare find,” they said. “We had no clue what we had.”
The finding marks the third documented instance of a yellow-bellied sea snake washing up in Southern California. In October, the reptile — which lives its entire life in the ocean — was spotted at Silver Strand Beach in the Oxnard area.
The “highly venomous” black-and-yellow snake typically lives in warmer waters off the coasts of Mexico, Africa, Asia and Australia, according to a Facebook post from the Huntington Beach Surfrider Foundation.
Its appearance in Southern California was possibly a harbinger of El Niño, Santa Monica-based Heal the Bay stated in a blog post back in October after the discovery of the first yellow-bellied snake in the region in 30 years.
The first sighting was also during an El Niño phase. Experts have predicted the current El Niño, which has been described as “Godzilla-like,” to be record-breaking.
“There is belief that the El Niño temperature change could have enticed the creature to swim north in search of small fish and eels, which they use their venom to paralyze,” the Surfrider Foundation stated in its Facebook post.
The species can stay underwater for up to three hours and swims backward and forward.
Like the reptile found in October, the sea snake was deceased by the time a volunteer had found it, according to the post. It was unclear whether it was alive when it washed up on the beach.
Soriano pointed out that, as indicated back in November by climatologists, key locations of the Pacific Ocean were hotter than on record during the powerful 1997 El Niño.
As a result, the foundation this year has seen stranded seal pups from lack of food, scores of tiny red crabs covering the area's shoreline and an increased number of shark sightings of the coast.
But they called the yellow-bellied sea snake “an extremely important find” in relation to El Niño.
The species is highly venomous, and anyone who spots one should not attempt to handle or interact with it, according to Heal the Bay. The organization requested back in October that if you do see one, take photos, note the exact location, and report the sighting to iNaturalist and Herp Mapper.

Investigation launched last month after two women reported being sexually exploited at property in Bristol
Eight men have been arrested in connection with human trafficking and sexual exploitation, police said.
An investigation was launched last month in Bristol after two women, aged 18 and 21, reported incidents of sexual exploitation committed against them at a property in the Eastville area of the city.
The women also gave details surrounding the arrangement of forced marriages, Avon and Somerset Police said.
As a result of police inquiries, six warrants were carried out at four addresses in Bristol and two in the Hockley area of Birmingham.
A 42-year-old man from Birmingham was arrested on suspicion of trafficking, rape and assault. They have been bailed for these offences but has been remanded in custody in relation to an outstanding warrant.
All the other men arrested were from Bristol.
Two men, aged 38 and 36, who were arrested on suspicion of trafficking have been released on bail.
A 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of money laundering and was also bailed.
Three men were arrested on suspicion of immigration offences and will now be dealt with by the immigration authorities.
Immigration officials are also investigating a 30-year-old man who was held on suspicion of taking part in a forced marriage.
Detective Inspector Peter Highway, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: "We received information at the end of last month about potential offences relating to human trafficking and forced marriages.
"Prior to the warrants being carried out, the two young women were taken to safe accommodation and supported by The Salvation Army. The UK Human Trafficking Centre was also notified.
"There is a significant amount of work still to do on this inquiry and we are focused on ensuring victims of suspected human trafficking are protected and offenders are brought to justice wherever possible."
Chief Superintendent Sue Scott, the force's lead for human trafficking, added: "We are very grateful for the support and professional expertise of charities such as The Salvation Army, who have helped care for the needs of the two victims involved in this investigation.
"We all have a duty to spot the signs of human trafficking and forced labour and I would urge anyone with information to please talk to us, as every piece of information helps."

This article has been updated.
One thing that can be said of President Trump is that most of their time in office has been spent at the White House, as is true of the presidents before him. Another thing that can be said of them is that he's spent a remarkable amount of time away from the White House, unlike most other presidents. Another thing that can be said is that he's spent a great deal of time away from the White House at properties owned by their private business, something that is unique to Trump.
I've been tracking those visits since Trump took office, originally out of curiosity over where the president would draw the line between their official and private lives. As president-elect, Trump ushered in 2017 at their Mar-a-Lago resort, interviewed Cabinet nominees at their golf club in New Jersey and visited their hotel in D.C. on several occasions. But that was still while they were a private citizen. Would they continue to visit Trump Organization properties as president, raising questions about whether or not they were either tacitly endorsing the company (from which they still earn income) or otherwise forcing the government to spend money at those properties?
Well, yes. They would.
By the end of February, Trump had spent all or part of 12 days of their presidency at Trump Organization properties, including Mar-a-Lago and their D.C. hotel. By the end of March, they were up to 19 days — and had played golf on 11 of them. By that point, we (and many other publications) had already noted the contrast between Trump's affection for the links and their campaign-trail assertions that they would rarely, if ever, play golf as president.
“I'm going to be working for you,” they said in August 2016 at a campaign event. “I'm not going to have time to go play golf.”
They found time.
@BarackObama played golf yesterday. Now they head to a 10 day vacation in Martha's Vineyard. Nice work ethic. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 15, 2011
As I write, Trump is at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., having traveled there from Mar-a-Lago, where he's been holed up since last Friday. He's expected to remain at Mar-a-Lago through the new year, perhaps to once again play host at the big party held at the resort each New Year's Eve. If they do so, their 2017 will look like this. Update: They did.
(The notes generally indicate Trump's golf partners, when known.)
It's important to note, as we have before, that the estimates above of when Trump played golf are just that: estimates. Trump's team has often gone to great lengths to obscure whether or not Trump is actually playing golf when they visit their golf clubs; former press secretary Sean Spicer once argued that Trump often went to their golf clubs and would conduct meetings and have phone calls. Our estimates are either based on visual evidence of Trump golfing or on the combination of favorable weather and an adequate amount of time — usually about four hours — spent at the club.
Here, then, are my estimates for Trump's first calendar-year as president, by the numbers:
Days in office: 346
Days spent all or in part at a Trump property: 116
Percent of days in office visiting a Trump property: 33.5
Days on which Trump likely played golf: 73
Percent of days on which they likely played golf: 21.1
Trump themselves frequently insisted that Barack Obama played too much golf as president, so let's compare the two.
Regularity of games of golf played by Trump during their first year: Once every 4.7 days
Regularity of games of golf played by Obama over eight years: Once every 8.8 days
When Trump would match that rate if they stopped playing golf after Dec. 29: Oct. 23, 2018
Games of golf played by Obama as president: 333
When Trump will surpass that count if they keep playing at this rate: May 17, 2021
Games of golf played by Obama in their first term, per ObamaGolfCounter: 113
When Trump will surpass that count if they keep playing at this rate: July 9, 2018
Assuming Trump spends about three-and-a-half hours on each round of golf, by our estimate they have spent more than ten 24-hour days of their presidency playing golf. That number, and those above, excludes any golf Trump plays the rest of this week.
Over the first six months of their presidency, we calculated that Trump had spent more than 16 percent of their time at a Trump property. In other words, for every 24 hours he'd been president, Trump had spent about 3 hours, 52 minutes at a Trump property. Much of that time has been on weekends.
Of the 51 weekends Trump will have been president by the end of the year:
Weekends during which they didn't visit a Trump-brand property: 12
Percent of weekends on which they visited a Trump-brand property: 76.5
Number of Saturday nights spent at the White House as president: 23 of 51
Trump has spent the most number of days at Mar-a-Lago of all of their properties. Days Trump spent all or in part at:
Mar-a-Lago: 43
Bedminster: 41
Trump International Golf Club, Palm Beach: 27
Trump National Golf Club, Sterling, Va.: 23
(Those trips to Trump International were on days that Trump also spent at Mar-a-Lago.)
There's one question that's often raised and is trickier to answer: How much did all of these trips cost taxpayers? This number is harder to ascertain. The conservative group Judicial Watch estimates that each of Trump's Mar-a-Lago trips costs the government $1 million. That doesn't include local law enforcement costs, which run in the tens of thousands. Guarding Mar-a-Lago had cost taxpayers $6.6 million by July, according to Post reporting — just for Coast Guard protecting by sea and air. The costs of protecting Trump and their family exhausted the Secret Service budget for the year by September.
It's important to note that these are not costs that then flow to the Trump Organization. Setting aside the benefit of constant promotion of their properties thanks to a presidential visit — and the chances of having Trump show up at your Trump-property wedding — it's not clear how much the properties have benefited.
There's one additional figure worth noting.
Number of times Trump golfed at a property not affiliated with the Trump Organization: 1
When Trump visited Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, knowing their audience, had Trump join them for a round.
Parkinson's disease may have played a crucial role in Adolf Hitler's defeat, according to a controversial new study.
The research claims the neurological disease influenced some of the dictator's biggest decisions, making them reckless and ultimately losing World War II.
But it also goes a step further to say that Hitler's horrific and inhumane murders were also influenced by their disease, exaggerating their 'volatile temperament'.

By the end of their life, Adolf Hitler had a pronounced tremor in their hands, particularly their left hand, which has caused a number of scientists to question whether they had the disease (right). A new study claims the neurological disease influenced some of the dictator's biggest decisions, making lose World War II
The study was led by Raghav Gupta and a team at the University of Pittsburgh and recently published in the journal World Neurosurgery.
'The possibility of Hitler suffering from Parkinson's has long been the subject of debate,' writes Gupta.
'Video evidence depicts that Hitler exhibited progressive motor function deterioration from 1933 to 1945.'
By the end of their life, Hitler had a pronounced tremor in their hands, particularly their left hand, which has caused a number of scientists to question whether they had the disease.
In the early 1900s, Friederich Lewy discovered protein deposits, now known as Lewy bodies, that disrupt the brain's normal functioning. Many brain cells of people with Parkinson's contain Lewy bodies (pictured)
WAS HITLER A DRUG ADDICT? A separate study published in 2013 also paints Hitler as a drug addict. According to National Geographic's Nazi Underworld - Hitler's Drug Use Revealed, psychiatrist Professor Nassir Ghaemi claims Hitler's drug abuse exacerbated their manic depression, reducing them to a feeble, trembling figure. 'It's not whether Hitler was an amphetamine addict or not – it's that Hitler had bipolar disorder and amphetamines made it worse,' they said. 'That is the issue. That has never been described before and that would explain a lot why Hitler changed in the late 1930s and the 1940s.' The report also state Morell injected Hitler with extracts from the prostate glands or ground testicles of young bulls to boost their libido so they could keep up with their much-younger lover. 'Morell gave Hitler a preparation called Testoviron, a kind of testosterone preparation, usually before Hitler was going to spend a night with Eva Braun,' Cambridge University historian Richard Evans said. 'Eva Braun was young and much fitter. Hitler was much older, they were lazy, they didn't take much exercise and I'm sure they asked Dr Morell to help them out before they went to bed with Braun.'
Parkinson's can also cause a slow gait, bent posture and a dull stare, along with cognitive disorders such as a lack of imagination and a general apathy.
The researchers suggest that Hitler's condition may have led them to attack Russia prematurely in 1941, according to a report in Discover.
A previous study claimed that Hitler's decision to invade Russia, before defeating Britain on the western front, was a direct result of their failing health.
The study points to other bad decisions of Hitler's such the failure to defend Normandy in 1944, alongside keeping their forces in Stalingrad in 1942.
They say this was the result of the dictator's 'volatile temperament' which may have been aggravated by their Parkinson's.
The study also goes on to suggest that Hitler's lack of remorse and sympathy can be associated with their Parkinson's.
'Hitler's inhumane personality, marked by a true lack of sympathy and remorse, can also be ascribed to their condition, often compelling them to act in ways that we today characterise as brutal, callous, and unethical,' the authors say.
As Discover points out, the problem with this theory is that it can't explain Hitler's behaviour before 1933, as Hitler had shown signs of their destructive temperament long before that.
Dr John Murphy, executive vice president of Danbury Hospital, has previously put forward the same theory.
They argue the root cause of Hitler's Parkinson's disease may have been a condition known as Von Economo's encephalitis, which a swelling of the brain that can occur after an infection.
Hi, We are Nico and Scooter!
I am Nico, a black and tan 9 year old Mini Pin. My amigo shown to the right of me, is Scooter. Scooter is a little older than me (age 11) and a little bigger but lacks my snappy sense of style, he's used to meeting people at the door and likes catching rats (if you need that sort of thing). I am more of a watch dog that barks than a “go get 'em” sort of pup.
Scooter does “cute”. I do “handsome”. Scooter is a bit of a lapdog and likes to curl up there with people. I prefer cuddling in bed near your head and all the nice pillows. I also like to hide under the covers or play. As you can see, we are both very nice dogs, but different from each other.
There is more to our story. We are two rescued Mini Pin dogs who could really use a change in living arrangements. You see, we currently live in a home with a number of other rescued dogs and it is tough for us to feel comfortable. Our natures make us a little jumpy and fearful of other dogs – even each other. We are ready for a nice quiet home for a change.
When you've lived the life of a rescued dog, it is hard to feel really comfortable unless you know that your home is just for you. With both of us loving attention so much, it gets really hard to be ourselves in a home with so many other dogs.
Our family used to be bigger, but the wonderful people who rescued us split up and the family that remains just has too much trouble giving us the life that we need.
With all the other dogs in the home, there are not enough people to give us the love and attention that we need. For affectionate pups like us, it is a tough situation.
Scooter and I are really hoping to find homes of our own so that we can each finally live the life that every dog desires. To be the only dog of the family and be one who gets and gives all of the attention. We love the idea of just us and our people, no worries about other dogs and sharing attention. We currently live in Glendale CA, but are willing to relocate to nearby places in the state if it is convenient. We've had all of our shots and been micro-chipped and because of our nervous natures, we are used to being crated when left alone.
It can be embarrassing, but around other dogs, and with no humans to remind us, our nervousness makes us forget about going at the right time and place. We hope that you understand.
Scooter would be very happy as the dog who provides company and looks after you . They don't need much activity or attention to be happy, just some rubs, treats and sensitivity.
Me (Nico) I still like to play a little and would love a home without kids around so that I can be the center of attention. A single adult or couple who have the time to spend with me would be great!

4. Great at catching rats

2. Very smart

Scooter + Nico's Current Home Environment
We have 5 small rescue dogs. While 3 of them get along great, we know Nico and Scooter would be happy as only children because of their fearful natures around the other (sweet) dogs. We feed the dogs in the morning and night, and give them good attention during the day. When we're home the dogs are free to roam most of the house and backyard. When we're not able to be around, we have our housekeeper come by 3 times to let the dogs out and play. When we're away, Nico and Scooter are crated (because they can't reliably hold it) while the other dogs roam.
Scooter + Nico's Current Family:
We (my neice and I) live together with our 5 rescue dogs in a small casita in Glendale, California. Before my neice moved in, I lived with my former life-partner. Because of our mutual love for animals , we ended up rescuing at least one dog off the streets or from our neighborhood each year we were together until we had reached nine dogs. In 2012, they abandoned our home just as it was about to go into foreclosure and left me to sort everything out. Fortunately I was able to provide and care for them. Over time, I have three of the nine dogs to age and given one away. I would really like to see Nico and Scooter live out their lives in an optimal situation– one in which they are only pets, as they seem less socialized than the others. It has been unfair to them to force them into a veritable ‘pack,' when what they have needed most is a one-on-one situation.
Scooter + Nico's Favorite Toys, Foods, Activities?
Scooter's favorite things are to be petted, given treats, and to sleep on your lap.
Nico likes to climb onto your head and shoulders at night, to sleep under blankets, pillows or sheets, and to play tug of war. They also are a big fan of treats.
Cute Scooter + Nico Story:
I call Nico my little italian playboy because they have such devastating good looks.
Why is Scooter + Nico Being Rehomed?
Both dogs would be happier than only children. We have 5 rescue dogs and Scooter and Nico are not very well socialized. They are always fearful with the other very sweet dogs. It would allow us to give the remaining dogs better positive attention as well.
Scooter + Nico's Perfect Adoptive Home Will Be:
Scooter and Nico need to be in one dog homes.
We imagine Scooter as being very happy as the dog to an old lady and their caretaker. They don't need much activity or attention to be happy, just some rubs, treats and sensitivity.
We imagine Nico would do great with an affectionate, attentive individual or couple. They don't get along well with children.
Additional Comments:
I have taken in 9 rescue dogs, and am still trying to provide the best care for my 5 dogs. The reason I would like to find homes for Scooter and Nico is to improve not only their quality of life, but also the quality of life of the other three dogs in my care in the most humane way. I care for all of them very much. If there is any way for you to provide this service for our Scooter and Nico free, it would make a world of difference for us. Thank you!
Princess Isabella, the direct ancestress of Mary, Queen of Scots and King Henry IV of France, as well as the Bourbon line of French monarchs, was born 16 June 1332 in Woodstock Palace.
They were the second child and firstborn daughter of young King Edward III and their bride, Philippa of Hainault. The new baby was adored by their loving parents, who were unusually devoted to each other and their children for a fourteenth century royal family. They named them after their paternal grandmother, Isabella of France, and pampered them with both affection and material goods.
Isabella seems to have resembled their mother's side of the family, since they were reportedly a brunette with an olive complexion. Them mother (or possibly their mother's sister) was described as having, “not uncomely hair, betwixt blue-black and brown … Them eyes are blackish-brown and deep … [and] they are brown of skin all over”. Notwithstanding their physical likeness to their mother, Isabella was more their father's child; their temperament was more closely aligned with the head-strong and determined Edward.
Them parents were indulgent and loving, thus Isabella's independence and spirit were not crushed out of them and they never became a properly mild-mannered medieval maiden. The princess's freedom confounded many of their contemporaries, who considered them willful and spoiled because they wanted the final say in the course of their own destiny. Certainly, Isabella got away with many things other royal daughters would not have been allowed to do. For example, a diplomatic betrothal between themselves and the second eldest son of Bernard Ezi IV, Lord of Albret, was arranged in 1351, but when their would-be husband's ships arrived to take them to Gascony, the 19 year old Isabella changed their mind. Rather than forcing them to fulfill the marriage contract, their doting father called off the wedding – much to the surprise and chagrin of Albret and the king's own courtiers.
By 1351 it became apparent that Isabella had no wish to marry anyone. Why should they leave home, where they were free and knew they were loved, to become a dutiful wife to a man who may or may not care about her? I parents, happy to keep them with them, gave their lands and settled a thousand marks a year on them to provide for their upkeep as a single woman.
Cupid was harder to escape than a formal marriage, and at age 33 the resolutely unwed Isabella fell in love with Enguerrand VII, Lord of Coucy, a wealthy French nobleman seven years younger than they were who had been sent to their father's court as part of a hostage exchange. Since they were the heir of Enguerrand VI, Lord of Coucy and Catherine of Austria, and thus a worthy suitor for a princess, Edward allowed Isabella to marry them in 1365. Edward also made Enguerrand the Count of Bedford in 1366, possibly in gratitude that de Coucy allowed Isabella to return to England to visit their parents with relative frequency.
Isabella and de Coucy were happy together and had two daughters, Marie and Philippa. It is through Marie, who married Henry of Bar and whose granddaughter was Jeanne of Bar, the great-great grandmother of Mary, Queen of Scots.
Jeanne of Bar's granddaughter, Marie of Luxembourg, married François, Count of Vendôme, a prince du sang, and their great-grandson became Henry IV of France.
BOSTON (Reuters) - Bill Cosby testified under oath for about seven hours on Friday in response to a civil suit brought by a woman who accuses the veteran comedian of sexually abusing them when they were 15, a lawyer for the plaintiff said on Saturday.
It was the first time Cosby, 78, testified under oath since dozens of women came forward over the past year with accusations of sexual misconduct, some of which date back to the 1960s. They have never faced criminal charges over the allegations.
The plaintiff's attorney Gloria Allred gave few details of the deposition in Boston, the exact location of which was not disclosed. Due to a protective order by the judge, they said they could not answer questions about Cosby's testimony.
“We'll be filing motions with the court in connection with the deposition,” Allred told reporters. “We'll also be seeking to take a further deposition of Mr. Cosby at a later date.”
Friday's deposition related to the California civil suit brought by Judy Huth, who accuses the former star of “The Cosby Show” of forcing them to perform a sex act at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles in 1974 when they were aged 15.
Lawyers for Cosby, who have previously called Huth's allegations “false and defamatory”, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Cosby, who played a beloved father figure in the sitcom that ran for years on U.S. television, previously gave a deposition in a Pennsylvania case that they eventually settled out of court nearly a decade ago.
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig Karlan has said they would seal the depositions in the California case until they can review the transcript and decide which parts to make public.  They are expected to make that decision by Dec. 22.
“The court wants to be sure that both parties receive a fair trial, but they also recognize that the public has an interest in this case,” Allred said.

Huth says they have repressed psychological injuries from the alleged incident that have only resurfaced in the last three years. A judge ruled that the statute of limitations on civil suits did not apply in Huth's case because their alleged injuries had appeared recently.
More than four dozen women have accused Cosby of assaulting them sexually, often after plying them with alcohol or drugs.
Huth's deposition is scheduled for Thursday, Oct. 15. They were not present at Cosby's deposition.
DIARY
Over the past couple of months, I've received a bunch of emails from readers asking me to explain the specifics of my involvement with “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” I've thought a lot about whether or not to talk about this publicly, but have decided to tell my story 1) because it's a part of my life that happened, and a part that has had an enormous impact on me, and 2) because I recently received an email from a reader who had something very similar happen to her, and wanted my advice on how to deal with the situation on an emotional level. So yes, I think it's an interesting story, but I also think it's an important one to tell given that many young people deal with similar issues.
My involvement with “Sunny” was complicated by two factors: 1) I was romantically involved with my co-star and the creator of the show, Rob McElhenney, for many years, and the demise of our relationship was what ultimately led to my forced exit from the show, and 2) I was very young – about 23 years old – when the following events transpired, and was so intimidated by the people with whom I was working (including top-level FX executives) that I felt that I had no voice whatsoever.
Here's what happened. When I graduated from college, I moved out to Los Angeles, where I knew absolutely no one except for my ex-boyfriend, Rob. We began dating again, first casually, and then very seriously. Shortly after I arrived in Los Angeles, Rob conceived of the idea for a Curb Your Enthusiasm-style show that centered on a group of four actor friends living in LA (this, of course, was later changed to four friends working in a Philadelphia bar). Over the next year or so Rob, myself, and our friends Glenn and Charlie shot two pilot episodes for the show, which at the time was called “It's Always Sunny on TV.” Other friends filled in the remainder of the roles – most notably Mary Elizabeth, who played “The Waitress” and later married Charlie – but the core group was the four of us: me, Rob, Glenn, and Charlie.
It was exhausting work that took many months to complete: we improv-ed out many scenes before Rob actually wrote them, and if one of us wasn't on camera for a particular shot, they or me (ha) was probably standing off to the side holding a boom mike. Much of the first two episodes (which included several plot lines taken directly from my life, such as my insistence that everyone remove their shoes before entering my carpeted West Hollywood apartment) were shot at my place or at Glenn's. When we needed more DV tapes, we all chipped in and drove my Chrysler LeBaron to the Rite Aid on Sunset. It was a busy time, but an exciting one – we all felt like we were participating in the creation of something really great, something with enormous potential.
When the two initial episodes were finished, Rob began shopping them around to networks. And a miracle happened: FX offered to shoot a “real” pilot for the show. All of a sudden we were on an actual set, with for-real makeup artists and someone else to hold the boom mike. Things seemed to be going swimmingly, but we still had trouble believing that all of this would actually pan out. At one point, one of the guys (I believe it was Glenn, but I could be wrong) called a meeting in Rob's trailer: “What if the network wants to pick up some of us, but not all of us?” Together, we four agreed that they took all of us…or none of us. We were in this thing together – had been for over a year now – and we simply wouldn't allow them to split us up.
Around that time, my relationship with Rob began to unravel, and I started to sense that I was on unsteady footing on the set, despite our “all for one” pact. I was surprised to learn that Rob, Glenn and Charlie had all been made executive producers, while I simply remained the lead actor. I went very quickly from being at the center of the project to standing on the periphery, and…truth? It felt like it had everything in the world to do with my gender. To me, FX felt like a cigar-smoking, whiskey-drinking old boys' club. I was welcome when I was the girlfriend of the creator, and once I wasn't…well…I was persona non grata – and my role in creating their new pet project was forgotten.
I said nothing because, to be honest, I was totally intimidated by my surroundings, and felt so lucky to be starring in a show at all that I didn't want to go around demanding more, more, more. In retrospect, though, I find it odd that my agents, Innovative Artists, didn't speak up on my behalf, given that they were well aware of my extensive involvement in the show's creation and development. But chances are they probably doubted that the show would ever see the light of day.
The pilot wrapped, and shortly afterwards I ended my relationship with Rob. During one of our break-up conversations, I was told in no uncertain terms that if I did not stay in the relationship, I would be off the show. However, I felt strongly that we were not functioning well as a couple, and moved into the house that we had been planning to share alone. I honestly didn't believe that I would actually be fired from the show because of romantic complications, given that I had spent over a year devoting my life to “Sunny,” and had been so instrumental in its success.
But sure enough, a couple of months later my agent and new manager (a manager who quickly disappeared from my life once I was no longer the lead on a show) called to tell me that while Rob, Glenn and Charlie had been picked up for the series, I hadn't been. The network, they said, felt I was “too pretty” to be believable as a Philadelphia bartender, which makes total sense: TV shows generally hire unattractive people as lead actors, and I was recently voted Miss Universe. Didn't you know?
I got a small payout, Rob ended up marrying the girl who they hired to replace me in the role of Sweet Dee, and I haven't heard from either Glenn or Charlie since the day I ended my relationship with Rob.
Was I angry for a very long time? Was I bitter? Oh, absolutely. I'll be honest: it took me years, years, to get over this, and the healing process wasn't helped by the fact that I had to see my former friends' faces staring down at me from posters in Times Square. (In truth, I was angrier with Glenn and Charlie than I was with Rob, who I understood was too hurt to work with me every day. We were each other's first love, and I will always wish Rob nothing but the best.) Did I consider suing? Yep. I decided not to because I couldn't face the prospect of going to court to fight a man whom I had cared about – and still cared about – so deeply, and because as a struggling young actor I was frightened by the prospect of challenging a powerful network all by myself.
But am I angry now? Am I bitter? Not in the slightest. It was a situation that was handled poorly by all involved, and I am not blameless here: I'm sure I could have dealt with the breakup better, and I know that I was frightfully naïve in failing to stand up for myself during contract negotiations and in trusting that my agents knew what they were doing.
I'm telling you all this because the last thing that I ever thought would happen actually happened: things turned out, quite simply, for the best. When I was fired, I fell into an extremely deep depression, not helped by the fact that my career as an actor effectively came to a standstill (the first question asked of me by every casting director that I met with in the year following the show's debut was, “Why were you fired from “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?”). When my mother told me that months, or perhaps years from now, I would look at my life and be unable to imagine that things could have turned out in any other way, and that I would be happy, I thought they were insane. Sure, mom, I thought…one day I'll wake up and be just thrilled that my bank account is bereft of millions and I'm still sitting in the waiting room, hoping for a guest spot on Ghost Whisperer.
But my mother was right, as is usually the case. When I look at my life today – at the apartment that I love, at the little white dog rolling around at my feet, and at the husband without whom I could not get through one single day – I am happy. I don't know what direction my life would have gone in had I not been fired from the show, but I do know that I wouldn't be here, where I am right now…and I wouldn't give up “right now” for all the money and all the fame in the world.
Am I proud of “Sunny”? Hell, yeah. I'm proud of its success, and I'm proud of my role in creating it, but most of all I'm proud of that 23-year-old girl who refused to compromise their values for a role on a TV show.
Yoga guru and anti-corruption campaigner Baba Ramdev waves during their march to parliament in New Delhi. Picture: AFP
INDIAN police have arrested famed TV yoga guru and anti-corruption campaigner Baba Ramdev as they attempted to lead a procession of thousands of supporters to parliament.
Ramdev, an eccentric saffron-robed holy man with a yoga empire that spans the globe, began a protest in New Delhi last Thursday demanding the government do more to repatriate illicit money stashed by Indians in foreign accounts.
Police parked buses and erected barricades across the route taken by Ramdev and their supporters, many of whom had come from their home town of Haridwar in the foothills of the Himalayas.

"Oust Congress - save the country," Ramdev declared to supporters.
Ramdev and activist Anna Hazare have made joint efforts to mobilise Indians to fight corruption, following a string of major scandals that have tarnished the Congress-led government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
Hazare, a former army driver who models their appearance on independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, led a huge protest movement in 2011 but their popularity and ability to tap into public anger have since waned.
Ramdev, whose current protest has been largely ignored by the government - unlike in 2011 when senior ministers held meetings with them - said they had wanted to march to parliament to have the voice of their supporters heard by lawmakers.
Ramdev and other arrested protesters were transported to a stadium in the centre of New Delhi as thousands of supporters crowded the streets, shouting "hail mother India".
They followed the guru to the stadium barely a kilometre from where they were arrested, creating a big traffic jam in one of New Delhi's busiest office districts.
Initially police had planned to hold Ramdev in a stadium on the outskirts of the capital. But shifting them there proved impossible "due to the traffic jam and monsoon showers", police spokesperson Rajan Bhagat told AFP.
Police said they were releasing the guru and their supporters but they refused to leave the stadium, claiming that the protest had taken a "decisive turn," according to local media reports.
Ramdev's refusal to quit the stadium was causing worries for authorities who were putting in place tight security arrangements for India's Independence Day celebrations tomorrow.
India's ruling Congress party, meanwhile, charged that Ramdev was being used by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the country's main opposition.
"The country has seen today that the masks have fallen and the real faces have been revealed," Congress spokesperson Janardhan Dwivedi said after BJP president Nitin Gadkari delivered a speech of support at Ramdev's rally.
"The BJP president has gone there and they (Ramdev's supporters) say they have no relationship with political parties. I am saying the masks are off," they said.

US Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) (Photo: Facebook)
Republican Senator Pat Toomey's first town hall meeting in months resulted in multiple charges for a voter who asked a provocative hypothetical question.
“A Northampton man was not only pulled from Thursday night's televised town hall with U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA), they were also arrested,” Lehigh Valley Live reports.
Simon Radecki, 28, of Northampton County, Pennsylvania faces charges of disorderly conduct and disrupting a public meeting. The town hall was televised by community-owned public television station PBS39.
“Toomey answered 20 questions during the hour-long event, one of which ended in Redecki being escorted from the meeting after they suggested that the senator's daughter, Bridget, was abducted while posing a question on immigration,” Philadelphia Voice reported. “Radecki took to Facebook afterward to share the full question that came around 40 minutes into PBS39's broadcast.”
“Thank you, Senator Toomey, for coming here tonight to hear our questions. I'm assuming you've been busy thinking about how to answer our questions, so you haven't seen the news. Do you know whether you daughter, Bridget, has been abducted?” Radecki wrote.
“Whatever you're feeling right now, that's what it feels like to have a daughter deported. Thousands of fathers here in the Valley that live with that fear every day. Their daughters have names, too,” Radecki continued. “So here's my question. Do you unequivocally denounce any attempt by the administration to reverse DACA, which would hang the threat of deportation over hundreds of thousands of children the same age as Bridget?”
“That's a ridiculous question,” Toomey responded as Radecki was removed by security.
“The question's focus was Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, a federal policy protecting young, undocumented immigrants from deportation,” Lehigh Valley Live explained. “Started under former President Barack Obama, the so-called dreamers program has been under review by President Donald Trump.”
Following the town hall, Radecki said they were trying to confront the fear that Dreamer's families face.
“What I did tonight was to force Senator Toomey into a place of empathy for the briefest moment in the hope that they would acknowledge the humanity of so many others who live with fear that they are directly responsible for every day,” Radecki explained.
Penn Live video of the town hall shows a voter saying the format was “flawed” and didn't qualify as a constructive discussion.
Watch:
In a Monday editorial titled “Prosecute Torturers and Their Bosses,” The New York Times called on the U.S. Department of Justice to launch an investigation of former Vice President Dick Cheney and several other Bush administration officials for actions they took to counterterrorism and root out terrorists, post Sept. 11, 2001.
The press for a federal query came in response to the Senate's Democratic-fueled analysis on the administration's response to terrorism — the so-called torture report.
“[This] report erases any lingering doubt about their depravity and illegality: In addition to new revelations of sadistic tactics like ‘rectal feeding,' scores of detainees were waterboarded, hung by their wrists, confined in coffins, sleep-deprived, threatened with death or brutally beaten,” The New York Times opined. “These are, simply, crimes. They are prohibited by federal law.”
As such, the Justice Department should launch a full investigation of the key players, The New York Times said.
“The question everyone will want answered, of course, is: Who should be held accountable? … Any credible investigation should include former Vice President Dick Cheney; Mr. Cheney's chief of staff, David Addington; former CIA Director George Tenet; and John Yoo and Jay Bybee, the office of legal counsel lawyers who drafted what became known as the torture memos,” The New York Times wrote.
The newspaper pressed for the investigation just as the American Civil Liberties Union is set to present Attorney General Eric Holder with a letter that demands a special prosecutor to investigate “what appears increasingly to be ‘a vast criminal conspiracy … to commit torture and other serious crimes,'” The New York Times wrote.

Breyer signals gay marriage case not closed
Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer signaled Sunday that the case on same-sex marriage wasn't totally closed despite the high court's decision not to take up appeals on the issue earlier this session.
NPR correspondent Nina Totenberg, moderating a panel featuring Breyer, noted that by not accepting the appeals, the status quo of gay marriage was changing in several states. With many same-sex couples now relying on the changes wrought by lower court rulings, the Supreme Court could face a greater challenge to weigh in on the issue in the future.
Story Continued Below
But Breyer said that “the status quo there changes, you know, so there are plenty of opportunities.”
They seemed to be referring to opportunities to consider appeals on same-sex marriage.
Breyer appeared Sunday at the Jewish Federations of North America's General Assembly at National Harbor alongside fellow Justice Elena Kagan, who declined to respond to Totenberg.
“You don't really expect an answer on that, do you?” they asked to laughter from the audience.
In October, the high court let stand lower court decisions in five cases overturning state gay marriage bans. Soon afterward, additional states began allowing same-sex marriage.
Last week, however, the 6th Circuit upheld prohibitions on gay marriage. The decision creates a split among lower courts that now makes it much more likely the justices will take up the issue.
Donald Trump continues to crash in approval polling.  They are now less popular than George W. Bush was at the height of Hurricane Katrina — and they are way behind President Obama.
Donald Trump continues to tank in national polls, with the latest result from Gallup showing them at a mediocre 36 percent approval rating.
For comparison, George W. Bush's approval rating as Hurricane Katrina hit and as the aftermath of their mismanagement of the natural disaster dominated headlines ranged between 38-43 percent. Trump is currently where Bush was during the beginnings of the global economic crisis and the Bush recession.
On the other hand, President Obama left office with a 59 percent approval rating, and averaged 47.9 percent over their two terms in office. In Gallup's polling, Obama never polled as low as Trump is right now.
After being bested by Hillary Clinton in the popular vote by 3 million votes, Trump entered office with a 41 percent approval rating, which made them the most unpopular new president in U.S. history.
Trump is under FBI investigation, had their health care initiative fail spectacularly, and has done nothing for the American people while enriching themselves and their family. This basement-level approval rating is the natural result, as Trump continues to lose on multiple fronts.
Russian special forces are reportedly training Nigerian security forces while Abuja continues to reel from attacks by Boko Haram extremists. By John Campbell
The Vanguard, a Nigerian daily, carried a report on September 28, confirmed by the Ministry of Defense, that 1,200 Nigerian soldiers, police, and Department of State Services (DSS) are being trained by Russian special forces. The Vanguard says that Abuja has turned to Moscow following an “alleged snub or nonchalant attitude of the United States and the United Kingdom toward Nigeria in their fight against Boko Haram terrorists.”
According to the Vanguard, Russian instructors participated in the selection process of those to be trained. The training is to last four months.
A South African news portal reports that the Nigerian Army is seeking the funds to purchase at least three advanced surveillance aircraft from the Czech Republic. It also reports that Belarus has agreed to provide twelve attack helicopters for which the Nigerian government will pay in installments over the next seven years.
In September, the National Assembly approved a special allocation of one billion dollars for the struggle against the northern insurgency. Presumably those funds will be used to pay Russia, the Czech Republic, and Belarus for the training and material.
(Read More: Why Nigeria Is Able To Beat Ebola, But Not Boko Haram)
Abuja has refused to acknowledge and investigate repeated and credible reports of security service human rights abuses and to prosecute alleged offenders. These abuses largely preclude the United States from providing military training or other assistance to Nigeria under U.S. law, specifically the Leahy amendment.
Nigeria turning elsewhere when the United States and the United Kingdom won't play is an old song. During the 1993-1998 brutal dictatorship of Sani Abacha, western countries imposed sanctions on Nigeria because of pervasive human rights abuses. Abacha then turned to China and India for military training and material.
Russian military training of Nigerian security service personnel may improve their capacity. In theory, special forces should be “force multipliers”, and could make a difference tactically. But, given Russian military behavior in Chechnya, Georgia, and Ukraine, the training is unlikely to contribute to a badly needed change in Nigeria's military and police culture, which largely ignores human rights, and will likely fuel support or aquiescence for Boko Haram.
SMU head coach Chad Morris tries to rally their team against Navy during the second half of an NCAA college football game at Ford Stadium in Dallas on Saturday, Nov. 26, 2016. (Louis DeLuca/The Dallas Morning News via AP)
Since their name surfaced near the top of Baylor's coaching list, SMU coach Chad Morris has downplayed the situation.
They have talked about how speculating on coaching changes has become a tradition, one that has increased in popularity dramatically via social media.
On Monday, the Baylor search went uptempo like the power spread scheme that has kept Morris' name popping up on search lists.
Morris has been considered one of the leading candidates to replace Jim Grobe, who announced on Monday that they will not coach after this season. Grobe was brought in as Baylor's interim coach after Art Briles was fired amid the school's sexual-assault scandal.
But Morris went from favorite to falling out of favor to having never talked to Baylor officials in a span of a couple of hours.
A source said that Morris had countered with a five-year, $24.5-million offer that Baylor did not approve. The source added that Morris was given a quick deadline on the decision and if they declined then Baylor officials would deny an offer was made.
Soon after that became public knowledge, a 247Sports report citing unnamed sources said Morris' negotiations with Baylor snagged and the sides were "moving on."
The report attributed the fallout to the growing price tag and Morris' desire to someday take over at Texas A&M for current coach Kevin Sumlin and said these names have been “mentioned” as candidates:
North Carolina's Larry Fedora, Colorado's Mike MacIntyre, California's Sonny Dykes and Tulsa's Philip Montgomery, a Baylor assistant under Briles until 2014.
Later, a Baylor source said that nobody has been interviewed. An SMU source said the same thing, adding that it's been business as usual for Morris since their Mustangs closed their 5-7 season last Saturday.
Texas moved quickly with the firing of Charlie Strong and the hiring of Tom Herman.
The Baylor job is much more complex because of the sexual assault scandal.
Among the program's unknowns for an incoming coach are potential NCAA sanctions and players transferring. The biggest task might be recruiting.
The Bears will have about 50 of the maximum 85 scholarship players on the roster after the current seniors leave. Baylor has one oral commitment for its 2017 class.
That's why Morris has been a prized candidate.  They are a masterful recruiter with strong Texas ties from their 16-year stint as a Texas high school coach.
The 1992 Texas A&M graduate posted a 169-38 record, including back-to-back state titles at Lake Travis before rising up the college ranks.
Morris' name has graced the pages of many candidates list, especially while serving as Clemson's offensive coordinator. They had Herman were considered the hottest up-and-comers when they began their first head coaching jobs before 2015.
It looked like they might start their second college jobs at about the same time, too.
“It happens every year,” Morris said after the Mustangs' 75-31 loss to Navy on Saturday. “This isn't the first time it's happened to me. It happened last year. It happened this year. It will happen next year. It happened to me in high school. It happens in this business at this time of year.”

Politics in America has become weirder and weirder, which is fine, because I enjoy Jon Stewart a lot, but not fine, because it's dysfunctional.
The dysfunction is a product of ideologies.
The Republicans have a clear and vibrant ideology. Smaller government, lower taxes, return to the social mores of the 1950s (though not the progressive economics—strong unions, 90 percent top marginal tax rates, free universities—these have been erased from history like purged Soviet officials), and let's all be white.
The Republicans have been gaining in power since the Reagan administration and achieved full power under Bush II.
With that power they demonstrated that they were not, in fact, for smaller government; Republicans were for government that used its power to transfer money from regular people to the rich.
They cut taxes and thereby proved that cutting taxes is bad for the economy. This is perhaps the most peculiar fact in our political landscape. It's as if they dropped Mt. Everest on top of St. Louis and it was invisible, even to Democrats driving down Highway 61.
They showed that they shouldn't be in charge of our intelligence operations (9/11 happened largely because of Bush and Cheney's willful determination to ignore warnings).
They proved that they couldn't run a war, let alone two. They also exposed institutional flaws in our national security.
They proved that America's intelligence services are astonishingly inept, in spite of a budget of nearly $50 billion a year. The second reason for 9/11 was a simple failure to communicate among those agencies. Also, Osama bin Laden is still at large! In answer to which I reissue the Beinhart Challenge! Give me $50 billion, and I guarantee the capture of bin Laden (even after I take the standard $10 or $20 billion corporate skim off the top). They believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. They failed to predict the chaos that followed the invasion of Iraq. They failed to figure out what to do in Afghanistan.
US defense spending is calculated to be somewhere between $880 billion and $1.03 trillion annually. And we can't win a war.
There are certain kinds of wars we probably can win, but we can't find them, so we get involved in wars of occupation instead. We call them counter-insurgencies. They're fought to suppress insurgencies that are attacking our occupations, so it's a roundabout form of euphemism. We have difficulty with such wars because we are reluctant to embrace the tools of totalitarian conquest: massive troop presence, mass executions, population removal, and secret police. But even the Nazi and Stalinist models don't last forever.
The theological underpinning of the Republican ideologies is the magical belief that individual greed-based actions will be guided by an invisible hand to create the best of all possible worlds and the strongest possible nation. Government action is, therefore, bad because it interferes with the magic.
This is buttressed with the ego-stroking idea that those of us who have money and security have earned it through hard work and good behavior and deserve it, while the have-nots and the have-littles likewise deserve what they get. Government action is, therefore, bad because it is class warfare that takes from the deserving classes to give to the undeserving classes.
This works because it plays to the tribalism basic to human psychology. Europeans are happy with social democracies because European countries are ethnically homogenous. So social welfare is taking care of their own tribe. Nowadays, with significant immigrant minorities, Europe is beginning to see a backlash, a rising tide of resentment against taking care of members of other tribes.
America is multicultural, multiethnic, made up of people who left their tribes. During World War II we united and started to see everyone as “us.” When Lyndon Johnson insisted on including black people in the tribe, the “us” began to shatter. Ronald Reagan found out how to link that social fissure to economic policy, using references to welfare queens and welfare Cadillacs. Taxes, in Reagan-speak, were a tool to take money from our good, hard-working, worthy tribe, and social programs were a way to hand it out to worthless, shiftless members of “other” tribes. Anti black racism is no longer respectable, but the impulse remains, and the new symbol of the “other” tribe is the illegal immigrant.
Those twinned ideas have wrecked, and continue to wreck, havoc with our economy. They are the guise under which the richest and greediest class have waged class warfare and scored victory after victory. Poverty has increased. Middle-class people now work harder for less. Financial security has disappeared. Medical costs—which we all pay for—are double what they are in the rest of the civilized world. Our physical infrastructure is crumbling. Worse, our social infrastructure is being eviscerated. In this recession we're laying off police, firefighters, and teachers, closing courtrooms, and cutting social services.
Rich people—in gated communities, with great medical insurance, who can afford to send their children to private schools and universities, who can afford private security and expensive lawyers—are immune from all this havoc, and are very happy, so long as their wealth is untouched.
With each victory in this class war, the rich have more money to spend on lobbying, lawyers, the judiciary, corporate power, media control, and propaganda.
It is time to declare that yes, class warfare is taking place! We, the people, are losing. Big Money will sell out Americans every time they can profit by it. They'll ship jobs overseas. Advocate for wars we don't need. Keep us dependent on oil. Mortgage our industries to take big banker fees out of the deals. Buy off our politicians. Back judges who will raise the rights of corporations over individuals. Steal and loot our pension plans. Pollute the Gulf of Mexico, pollute our coasts, and rivers. Steal our national parks. Let our businesses go bankrupt.
Out-of-control Big Money is Un-American! We do need to take back our country. No individual can fight the big banks. No hard-working person can get their pension back after the Wall Streeters have ruined it. Patriotism means standing up to multinational corporations. They don't care about this country, only about their profits.
There needs to be an ideology, with emotional, button-pushing slogans, short as bumper stickers, that rational, sensible people can use to motivate emotional people—that can move us with rage.

Matt Garbowsky had no idea just how much their junior season would be affected when they hurt their wrist at Robert Morris University last November. The injury, they thought, was just a bone bruise. Garbowsky even played another shift after it occurred.
In the days following their injury, the Rochester Institute of Technology forward practiced as usual. Their wrist was uncomfortable, but they didn't think he'd be making it any worse. The results of a magnetic resonance imaging scan took them by surprise.
“I got the MRI back and found out that it was broken,” said Garbowsky. “It was at the point that I realized my season was kind of over.”
One year later, in their senior season, Garbowsky is making up for lost time.
The Tigers' captain has channeled the dedication they gained from missing the bulk of last season into one of the hottest starts in NCAA hockey. Through RIT's first 14 games, Garbowsky has already matched their previous career high with 11 goals – the most in Division I, ahead of top American prospect Jack Eichel (nine).
Matt Garbowsky
Garbowsky's 19 points are fourth in the nation, with the bulk of them coming during a 10-game point streak that came to an end against Sacred Heart on November 22.
How have they done it?
“I think he's more determined this year,” said RIT head coach Wayne Wilson. “There are certain things I think all athletes take for granted and then having to miss a significant amount of last year, missing the amount of games they did I think just made them come back determined to take advantage of every game he's going to play.”
Garbowsky agrees. They missed 24 games after breaking their wrist, returning for the final two games of the regular season against Canisius and for RIT's three-game Atlantic Hockey Conference playoff series against Holy Cross. They did not score a point in those five games.
“I was just kind of not really with it I guess,” said the 24-year-old from St. George, Ont. “And that was one thing I was really trying to work on this summer, to practice really hard and practice like I was going to play in a game.”
Assimilating to game situations was difficult for Garbowsky at the end of last season. They rode a bike and worked out to stay in shape while injured, but it didn't compare to game competition. It was frustrating for them to be an upperclassman and have to sit on the sidelines during games.
The nature of the injury, their coach says, was even more frustrating. Garbowsky's body was ready to go, but their wrist was not. The lack of blood flow to the wrist made Garbowsky unable to play even with a cast.
It's got to start with someone, and I can't think of a better player to start with. - RIT head coach Wayne Wilson
As tough as it was for a junior watching their second-to-last season slip away, it was equally tough for the team to lose their leader.
Nonetheless, the team did everything they could to allow Garbowsky to fulfill their captain duties off the ice. They appointed them to lead their pregame stretch, thinking it would give them an opportunity to speak up.
“He did a good job, but it can be very difficult for a player to rant and rave about a loss when they didn't play in the game,” Wilson said.
Garbowsky has never been a ‘rah-rah' type of leader. Wilson recalls them being a quiet, hard-working, respectful player upon first coming to RIT. They knew right from wrong, they were accountable, and they didn't make excuses – all the intangibles of a team captain.
On the ice, they take as much pride in their defensive game as they do scoring goals. More often than not, the 5-foot-10 Garbowsky is matched up against the opposing team's best player because their coaches know he'll care as much about checking or not letting the other team score as they will about scoring himself.
Wilson says Garbowsky's greatest attribute is their determination.
Garbowsky's teammates saw that early. They were voted as a team captain for the first time when they were only a sophomore, a rare feat when votes are coming from a locker room consisting of upper classmen. Since then, they haven't changed – their goal is to lead their teammates by actions and example.
“I always try to work my hardest in practice and on the ice,” Garbowsky said. “Every shift I try to work my hardest; if something needs to be said I think I say the right things. Mainly, I'm just trying to show the guys that if we want to win we have to work hard and I just try to push the guys to do that.”
Eleven goals in 14 games isn't a bad example to lead with. But Garbowsky makes sure that any conversation about their personal goals or the potential to lead the nation in scoring quickly becomes re-focused towards their ultimate ambition: an Atlantic Hockey Championship.
“I haven't really thought about (leading the nation in goals), I guess it's in the back of my mind that it could be possible and it'd obviously be really nice too,” they said. “Right now, it's just trying to get wins. We've dropped a couple of games that I think we could've won. Right now I think our whole team is trying to find a way to win and that comes first and foremost.”
RIT is 3-5-2 in conference play, putting them eighth in the Atlantic Hockey Conference. But with three months still to play, the Tigers will have their chances to rebound.
Wilson believes they have the right man to lead them back up the standings.
“He's very confident and we're very confident that they can lead us towards it. It's got to start with someone, and I can't think of a better player to start with.”

Are you worried that your good ol' U.S. greenbacks could soon be worthless? That you'll need a wheelbarrow full of cash to buy a loaf of bread like in post- World War I Germany?
Do you wish you had an alternative form of currency to get goods and services from people in your town, and keep that money in your town?
It just so happens an effort is under way to create an alternative currency in the Lehigh Valley, and the idea is not as farfetched as many might think. Such currencies are legal and could have benefits even if the value of the dollar doesn't crumble under a growing national debt and plummeting consumer confidence, advocates say.
A group interested in forming a local currency will meet at 4 p.m. Sunday at The Caring Place, 931 W. Hamilton St., Allentown, to discuss how to make, market and distribute it. The meeting is open to the public.
''The goal of the meeting is to get people who are interested in forming a monetary board to fine-hone the policies and then get the money in circulation,'' said Gwen Colegrove, a retired teacher from Bethlehem Township who is leading the effort.
''Money is a system of exchange built on confidence and trust. This is a system of exchange that works alongside U.S. currency to give people more opportunities to do work they like doing for services they need.''
Colegrove said the spring is the soonest an alternative local currency would be in circulation. Others backing the effort include Lehigh Valley residents who work in the financial industry. Their success depends entirely on the willingness of businesses and consumers in the Valley to use the currency.
The idea is not unique to the Valley. Communities from Vermont to Hawaii have either started their own forms of money or are thinking about doing so as a global credit crunch puts a big dent in commerce and concerns mount about the stability of the national economy. Historically, alternative currencies have enabled commerce to continue when the government's money is less available.
The most prominent current example of a local currency is the Ithaca Hour, which began in Ithaca, N.Y., in 1991 as an effort to shield the local economy from a recession.
Ithaca Hours are now accepted by about 500 businesses in that area  from bowling alleys to restaurants to hospitals  and are used by thousands of consumers, according to participants. A livable hourly wage is the value standard, and currently one Ithaca Hour translates into $10. Some landlords accept partial rent payments in Ithaca Hours and some employees are partially paid in Ithaca Hours.
''It is much more mainstream than it used to be,'' said Carol Chernikoff, chief lending officer at Alternatives Federal Credit Union, which accepts loan payments and fees in Ithaca Hours. ''It's not just something the local massage therapist or farmer will take. Now the hospital takes Ithaca Hours. It's a great system.''
Today, there is interest in emulating Ithaca Hours around the world, said Stephen Burke, president of the Ithaca Hours board and owner of Small World Music. They recently got an e-mail from someone in Belgium interested in learning about forming an alternative local currency.
''It's all very practical,'' Burke said. ''Credit is drying up. That's basically the reason local currencies exist. When there is no money and people still have to make economic transactions, you establish this currency, and as long as people agree to the tenets behind it, it works the same as money. Then all of a sudden there's a new revenue stream. It's a substitute for the money that is not around.''
And because the currency only has value where it is accepted, it keeps circulating locally, unlike the U.S. dollar. But like transactions with the dollar, many purchases made with local currencies are taxable.
Paul Glover, who founded Ithaca Hours, will be the keynote speaker at the Sunday meeting in Allentown. They said local currencies provide a medium for commerce that dollars don't always allow, and a new method of building business relationships within a community.
In Ithaca, they started with a directory of businesses willing to accept Ithaca Hours and gave an initial allotment of the currency to all participants to get it started. The group also gives zero-interest loans to businesses in the form of Ithaca Hours as a means of circulating the currency, they said.
Now, you can go to a participating savings and loan association and exchange dollars for Ithaca Hours.
''There are a lot of people who want services, but because they don't have the dollars, a lot of business doesn't happen,'' Glover said. ''If I have enough dollars for food and rent, but I also have local currency that I have earned on the side, I can spice my life.''
That's why Allentown resident Paul Marin, who works in the financial industry, is among those interested in forming a local currency. They said a local currency provides a safety net for those who lose their jobs and for everyone if the U.S. dollar becomes devalued.
''At the very least, this is worth exploring,'' Marin said. ''If money is based on trust and confidence, why not look at it on a local level?''
If a Lehigh Valley currency is created, it wouldn't be the Valley's first. Before the Civil War, the U.S. government only issued coins, so banks issued their own paper money, said Frank Whelan, a historian with the Lehigh County Historical Society.
''There was a bank at Seventh and Hamilton in Allentown called the Northampton Bank, and from 1814 to 1843, they issued their own banknotes,'' Whelan said.
The bank went bust, its notes became worthless and a mob chased bank owner John Rice out of town.

A few years ago in October 2012 the Church dropped the age for missionaries from 19 to 18 for men and 21 to 19 for women. There are various speculations of why the Church did this although I don't think anyone knows for sure. (A popular explanation is that it cuts down on young men leaving the church when they go to college for their Freshman year) Regardless of why the Brethren did this, at the time I was concerned that it would lead to less effective missionaries. We now have a few years worth of data so we can examine the effect, In my view the most recent Church data in particular tells a story of a drop in missionary effectiveness.
Here's the data on the converts per missionary for the years prior to the change and after (including last year's data).
Year Convert Baptisms Missionaries Converts/Missionary 2009 280,106 51,736 5.41 2010 272,814 52,225 5.22 2011 281,312 55,410 5.08 2012 272,330 58,990 4.62 2013 282,945 83,035 3.41 2014 296,803 85,147 3.49 2015 257,402 74,079 3.47
You'll note that number of conversions per missionary from the most recent data is virtually the same as the previous year's. That's despite the “surge” of missionaries ending due to the changes in age.
One thing that's important to note is that the number of converts per missionary dropped significantly after the age change. At first there was some thought that the drop was due to inefficiencies due to having to deal with the sudden influx of missionaries. Starting at the end of 2012 there were those age 19 who hadn't gone yet plus all the ones who were 18 and now able to go. Not to mention an even bigger surge with sister missionaries. However when that surge ended yet the conversion rate did not increase back to the rate it was prior to 2012. This is a difference of nearly 2 baptisms per missionary. (The rate has fluctuated somewhat, dropping to 4.31 in 2003 but reaching a high of 8.03 in 1989 for the era after 1970)
Here's the data for what I'd term the contemporary era. The peak in the late 80's probably was in part due to significant growth in Latin America although there are indications that many of these baptisms had poor retention. (I'm not sure if reacting to this and focusing on better conversions accounts for the drop in the early 90's) The biggest demographic shift in American religiosity starts occurring in the mid 90's. I don't know how much of that societal shift accounts for the drop given the difference between American and non-American baptisms. It is a possible effect though. During that era Pres. Hinkley also changed missionary service with more focus on retention, working with recent converts and more service work by missionaries rather than pure proselytizing each day. You can see the big drop that comes with the change in the missionary age though. This is after a relative period of growth from 2004 to 2011.
The other big drop is in the early 80s. This corresponds to the change of the length of a mission from 2 years to 18 months starting spring 1982. Effective in January 1985 the length of service retuned to 2 years. Those already out were able to stay for either 18 months or 2 years. Perhaps in part because of that transition period the rate of conversion didn't rebound until 1988. As I said though that was also the era of huge growth in Latin America so one has to be careful teasing out the separate influence of different effects. However when you look at the number of missionaries in the 80's you had around 29,000 from 1979 to 1981. Then in 1982 that drops to 26,000 and doesn't return to 29,000 until 1985. The numbers don't really return to trend until 1988.
In 1986 during this same era, the Church introduced new memorized missionary lessons. (These were what I used on my mission) These were used until 2004. It's hard to tell what effect, if any, shifting the manuals had although not afterwards the conversion rate per missionary starts increasing quickly. It is interesting though that around 2004 when the latest missionary teaching program was introduced we start to see slowly increasing growth in the conversion rate. So It's quite possible changing lessons and pedagogy had an increase in effectiveness with each switch.
The other interesting thing that pops out looking at the number of missionaries is the huge drop beginning in 2003. This corresponded to increased worthiness and physical requirements for young people planning on going on a mission. Unsurprisingly this led to a significant drop in the number of missionaries in the field. While total baptisms dropped for a few years, conversion numbers returned by 2006. Since a lower number of missionaries were getting the same results the larger number had, this explains the growth in conversion rates in our first chart starting around 2002 until 2009. The drop in effectiveness really starts somewhere around 2009. I'm not sure what, if anything, happened in 2009 to explain the change. It is interesting that around that time the rate of growth in the number of missionaries also starts increasing. So this may just be a population issue.
It's worth comparing the conversion rate to the number of convert baptisms. After all throwing more missionaries to an area where there's a limited number of people interested in converting won't necessarily be helpful.
You'll note that the big bump in the late 80's is still prominent. You can also see that growth in conversion actually starts earlier in the 80's despite the drop in converts per missionary. Likewise the growth is increasing at the end of the graph but that's mainly because there are many more missionaries out. As the number of missionary drops to more normal numbers the effect of what are likely less effective missionaries becomes quite clear.
My guess given the relative consistency of the new conversions is that the current baptism rate is the new normal. Further given how tied to the policy change it is, this doesn't appear to be tied to larger demographic changes such as one could argue occurred in the 90's. We should note that the change back to 2 year missions took a few years to take effect. It's similarly possible that the missionary system still hasn't fully come to grips with the changes in the ages of missionaries. However it's also quite possible that the drop in age to 18 simply means more missionaries with less social maturity. That in turn affects their abilities as missionaries. I don't say this as a criticism of 18 year olds — I'd hate to imagine what I'd have been like as an 18 year old missionary. I was very shy and socially immature even at 19 – and my parents had me go out towards the end of my 19th year. Different people mature at very different rates. I think by dropping the age to 18 you're picking up a large cohort who perhaps are more like where some of the other missionaries were at 16.
From the data I suspect that with the new age policy we should expect a drop in the number of conversions each year to be more on par with the rate in era from 2002 – 2004. If the issue were just about conversions, it would seem plausible that allowing more men to go on missions, increasing proselytizing time and increasing the age for missions would be of great benefit. That's not to say that's the right thing to do of course.
Whether the church maintains this policy or if they change it remains to be seen. I suspect they'll wait for a few years more data to see if conversion rates per missionary return to the numbers of say 2010. If the change in the 1980's is any indication when something isn't working the Church soon modifies it. However the Church isn't merely focused on conversions but also young adult retention and convert retention. These statistics simply don't tell what's going on with those questions of retention. We don't really have data that tells us much there.
I confess I'm skeptical this will have a large impact on retention of young adult males. There are many demographic shifts in the US working against such an effect. If the Church maintains the current missionary age though I would lay good odds it's because of retention of these return missionaries.
A synthetic substance. Normally seen as a white powder, it acts as a stimulant of the central nervous system (CNS). First manufactured in Japan in 1919, methamphetamine has some limited therapeutic use, but most is manufactured in clandestine laboratories, particularly in the USA and the Far East. It is under international control and closely related to amphetamine.
Chemistry
Methamphetamine (CAS-537-46-2) is a member of the phenethylamine family, which includes a range of substances that may be stimulants, entactogens or hallucinogens. Thus, methamphetamine is N,α-dimethylphenethylamine.
According to IUPAC, the fully systematic name is N,α-dimethylbenzeneethanamine. The asymmetric α-carbon atom gives rise to two enantiomers. These two forms were previously called the [–]- or l-stereoisomer and the [+]- or d-stereoisomer, but in modern usage are defined as the R- and S-stereoisomers.
Molecular structure
Molecular formula: C 10 H 15 N
Molecular weight: 149.2 g/mol

Physical form
Methamphetamine base is a colourless volatile oil insoluble in water. The most common salt is the hydrochloride (CAS-51-57-0), which occurs as a white or off-white powder or as crystals soluble in water. Illicit products mostly consist of powders, but the pure crystalline hydrochloride is known as 'ice'. Tablets containing methamphetamine may carry logos similar to those seen on MDMA and other ecstasy tablets.

Pharmacology
Methamphetamine is a CNS stimulant that causes hypertension and tachycardia with feelings of increased confidence, sociability and energy. It suppresses appetite and fatigue and leads to insomnia. Following oral use, the effects usually start within 30 minutes and last for many hours. Later, users may feel irritable, restless, anxious, depressed and lethargic. It increases the activity of the noradrenergic and dopamine neurotransmitter systems. Methamphetamine has higher potency than amphetamine, but in uncontrolled situations the effects are almost indistinguishable. The S-isomer has greater activity than the R-isomer. The therapeutic dose of the S-isomer is up to 25 mg orally. It is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, and maximum plasma levels are in the range 0.001–0.005 mg/L. The plasma half-life is about nine hours. The major metabolites include 4-hydroxymethamphetamine and amphetamine. Fatalities directly attributed to methamphetamine are rare. In most fatal poisonings the blood concentration is above 0.5 mg/L. Analysis of methamphetamine in urine is confounded because it is a metabolite of certain medicinal products (e.g. selegiline). Acute intoxication causes serious cardiovascular disturbances as well as behavioural problems that include agitation, confusion, paranoia, impulsivity and violence. Chronic use of methamphetamine causes neurochemical and neuroanatomical changes. Dependence — as shown by increased tolerance — results in deficits in memory and in decision-making and verbal reasoning. Some of the symptoms resemble those of paranoid schizophrenia. These effects may outlast drug use, although often they resolve eventually. Injection of methamphetamine carries the same viral infection hazards (e.g. HIV and hepatitis) as are found with other injectable drugs such as heroin. When methamphetamine is smoked it reaches the brain much more quickly. Drugs which are smokable (e.g. methamphetamine, crack cocaine) are much more addictive and more likely to cause problems when consumed in this way than when taken orally.

Synthesis and precursors
The S-enantiomer is most commonly produced by reduction of l-ephedrine, i.e. (1R,2S)-2-methylamino-1-phenylpropan-1-ol, or by reduction of d-pseudoephedrine, i.e. (1S,2S)-2-methylamino-1-phenylpropan-1-ol. Both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are commercially available and are used in certain medicinal products. Ephedrine may also be extracted from the plant Ephedra vulgaris L. (used in Chinese medicine as Ma Huang). Both the Leuckart route and reductive amination (e.g. the aluminium foil method) of 1-phenyl-2-propanone (P2P, BMK, phenylacetone) yield a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. The synthetic route used may be identified by impurity profiling. Ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and 1-phenyl-2-propanone are listed in Table I of the United Nations 1988 Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The corresponding EU legislation is set out in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3677/90 (as later amended), which governs trade between the EU and third countries.

Mode of use
Methamphetamine may be ingested, snorted and, less commonly, injected or smoked. Unlike the sulfate salt of amphetamine, methamphetamine hydrochloride, particularly the crystalline form (ice), is sufficiently volatile to be smoked. When ingested, a dose may vary from several tens to several hundreds of milligrams depending on the purity and the isomeric composition.

Other names
The term metamfetamine (the International Non-Proprietary Name: INN) strictly relates to the specific enantiomer(S)-N,α-dimethylbenzeneethanamine. Metamfetamine is also the name required by Directives 65/65/EECand 92/27/EEC for the labelling of medicinal products within the EU. In the United Kingdom and some other countries, the name used in drugs legislation is methylamphetamine. Other commonly used chemical names include N-methylamphetamine, 1-phenyl-2-methylaminopropane, phenyliospropylmethylamine and desoxyephedrine. Methamphetamine, as the N-methyl derivative of amphetamine, is sometimes included with amphetamine and other less common substances (e.g. benzphetamine) under the generic heading of ‘amphetamines'.
Hundreds of other synonyms and proprietary names exist (see, for example, http://www.chemindustry.com/chemicals/55866.html). ‘Street' terms include speed, crank, meth, crystal meth, pervitin (particularly in eastern Europe; a name derived from an earlier medicinal product), yaba and shabu (certain countries in the Far East).

Analysis
The Marquis field test produces an orange/brown coloration. The Simon test (for secondary amines) produces a blue coloration that will distinguish methamphetamine from primary amine such as amphetamine (red coloration). In the mass spectrum, the major ions are m/z = 58, 91, 59, 134, 65, 56, 42 and 57. Identification by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry can be improved by N-derivatisation. Using gas chromatography, the limit of detection in urine is <10 μg/L.

Tablets may contain up to 40 mg of active drug. The free base constitutes 80 % of the hydrochloride salt. The retail purity of methamphetamines in 2011 ranged from 16 % (Estonia and Denmark) to 82 % (Turkey) in European countries reporting information (Table PPP-8 part (i)). In Europe, the most common cutting agents are caffeine, glucose and other sugars, less commonly ephedrine or ketamine. Methamphetamine has been seen as an adulterant in ecstasy tablets.

Control status
The S-enantiomer is listed in Schedule II of the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The racemate (a 50:50 mixture of the R- and S-stereoisomers) is also listed in the same Schedule, but the R-enantiomer is not separately identified in the Convention.

Prevalence
There is a lack of prevalence data on the use of methamphetamine in the general population as routine monitoring in Europe does not distinguish amphetamine from methamphetamine. Methamphetamine is however a widely used psychoactive drug in North America and countries of the Far East. In Europe, amphetamine is more widely available than methamphetamine, use of which has historically been restricted to the Czech Republic and, more recently, Slovakia.

Street price
In 2011, the methamphetamine retail price reported by a few countries varied from EUR 8 (Lithuania) to EUR 79 (Germany) per gram (Table PPP-4 part (i)).

Buduća Vlada neće biti Vlada krupnog kapitala već Vlada reformi. Ja ću biti nešto poput Oreškovićevog zamjenika, no dopustite da to još utvrdimo.Milanoviću poručujem da ne prosipa svoje frustracije na ovanja način", kazao je Tomislav Karamarko.

13:45 Nakon prisege zastupnika, Reiner zaključio prvu sjednicu 8. saziva Hrvatskog sabora.
13:35 Saborski zastupnici prisežu na dužnost.
13:30 U nastavku sjednice,prihvaćeno je izvješće Mandatno-imunitetnog povjerenstva o izabranim zastupnicima.
13:10 Nakon konstituirajuće sjednice Sabora Božo Petrov se obratio novinarima i kazao da će Sabor nastaviti s radom 15. siječnja te da će do tada biti formirana Vlada, a prije toga će biti sklopljen i "sporazum o reformskoj vladi u kojemu će niti naznačeni jasni ciljevi i prioriteti".

12:45 "Neke stvari čovjek u životu ne može birati - roditelje, nacionalnost, hoćeš li biti gay, ali neke možeš. Nažalost, Most je izabrao ići u koaliciju sa kriminalnom, špijunskom, proustaškom koalicijom, koju je podržao klub gradonačelnika koji je optužen za teška kaznena djela. Hrvatska nikad nije bila na nižoj demokratskoj točki", kazao je Zoran Milanović nakon sjednice. Više pročitajte OVDJE.

12:39 Konstituiran je osmi saziv Hrvatskog sabora.
12:37 Za predsjednicu Mandatno-imunitetnog povjerenstva većinom glasova saborskih zastupnika izabrana je Margareta Mađerić, a za potpredsjednicu Gordana Sobol.
12:22 "Najprije bih se htio zahvaliti svima koji su glasovali za mene. Međutim, htio bih zahvaliti i onima koji nisu glasovali za mene. To pokazuje da danas nakon toliko stoljeća Hrvatska nije samo neovisna država već i uistinu demokratska zemlja u kojoj svatko bez straha može iskazati svoje stavove i mišljenja. To je postignuće na kojima moramo biti zahvalni utemeljiteljima hrvatske države, Franji Tuđmanu i braniteljima koji su dali svoje živote za ovu državu.
Njihova smrt nije bila uzaludna. Na tome moramo zahvaliti i stotinama tisuća preživjelih branitelja koji su svojom hrabrošću omogućili da danas odlučujemo u Hrvatskom saboru. Treba odbacivati isključivost i poticati pluralizam mišljenja. S tim stavovima se ne trebamo uvijek i složiti. Želim se zahvaliti i mom prethodniku Josipu Leki. Znam da mu nije uvijek bilo lako i da je nerijetko imao dvojbe i drugačije mišljenje koje je s ovog mjesta morao iznositi.
Ne smijemo nikada zaboraviti, a posebno u ovo vrijeme kad smo dio europske zajednice, da je Hrvatski sabor ključna institucija za očuvanje identiteta hrvatskog naroda i nacionalnih interesa. Namjeravam predložiti da se Hrvatski sabor kad to bude moguće ponovno zove Hrvatski državni sabor. Zajedništvo je nešto što Hrvatskoj ovoga trenutka uistinu treba. Moramo se potruditi da Hrvatska bude i pravna i pravedna država. Moramo nakon više godina beznađa hrvatskim građanima vratiti osmijeh na lica. Prošlost nikad ne smijemo zaboraviti, ali ne smijemo u njoj nastaviti živjeti i nalaziti izgovor za današnje i buduće neuspjehe. Uvjerne sam da ako razne političke opcije ulože trud možemo postići konsenzus o najvažnijim pitanjima. Mi to možemo. Neka vas sve čuva dragi Bog, neka čuva sve zastupnice i zastupnike, sve Hrvatice i Hrvate, sve hrvatske građanke i građane i Hrvatsku", kazao je Reiner. Cijeli govor Željka Reinera pročitajte OVDJE.

Bio je i potpredsjednik Hrvatskog sabora. Prijedlog za predsjednika Hrvatskog sabora podnijeli su zastupnici Domoljubne koalicije i Mosta. Pozivam sve da ga podrže", kazao je Karamarko.

12:14 "Voljom hrvatskih građana Sabor se sastoji od različitih političkih opcija. Demokracija počiva na jasnim političkim ciljevima, svatko treba voditi brigu o cjelini i budućnosti te cjeline. Hrvatska je ono što nas okuplja ili ono što bi nas trebalo okupljati. Očekujem da se koriste demokratske vrijednosti koje omogućuju svakome da iznese svoje stajalište i da se poštuju manjinska prava. Molim sve zastupn9ke da poštuju dignitet i poslovnik Sabora. Demokracija traži strpljenje, ali i kontrolu javnosti svih procesa. Sve se mora odvijati u korist građana i oni su ti koji donose konačnu odluku. Ustav nije akt pozicije ili opozicije. Toga se trebamo držati u koristi sadašnjih i budućih ciljeva" kazao je Josip Leko.
12:03 Počela konstituirajuća sjednica 8. saziva Hrvatskog sabora.
11:47 U Hrvatski sabor stigla je i predsjednika Kolinda Grabar Kitarović u društvu dosadašnjeg predsjednika Sabora Josipa Leke.

11:45 U Sabor je stigao i bivši predsjednik Stipe Mesić koji je rekao da ne poznaje novog mandatara. "Sabor će imati onu ulogu koju mora imati prema hrvatskom ustavu kao i Vlada. Reineru jedino poručujem da se drži Ustava, zakona i poslovnika".
11:40 Stigao je Ivan Sinčić iz Živog zida. Osvrnuo se na izbor mandatara Tihomira Oreškovića kojeg ne misli podržati.
11:39 U Sabor je stigao i Đuro Glogoški.
11:35 U Hrvatski sabor stigao i mandatar Tihomir Orešković. "Izabrat ćemo najbolje ljude za formirati tu vladu i raditi najbolje za Hrvatsku. Bitno je da se danas formira Sabor i onda idemo dalje. Meni je vrlo bitno da Europa i međunarodna zajednica vide da je Vlada spremna na reforme koje će povećati investicije", kazao je Orešković. Više pročitajte OVDJE.
11:30 Uoči konstituirajuće sjednice Sabora zajednički sastanak su održali predstavnici Domoljubne koalicije i Mosta.
11:25 Radimir Čačić kazao je da Tihomira Oreškovića "apsolutno podržava kao čovjeka", ali ga kao mandatara neće podržati jer nisu razgovarali.

11:20 Bivša premijerka Jadranka Kosor upitana je je li SDP odustao od bitke, odnosno imaju li Milanović i SDP ikakvog asa u rukavu?
"Ne. Mislim da nemaju, odustali su od svog prijedloga. zašto, vrijeme će pokazati. To je dobra odluka. Očito da se Most definitivno priklonio, ne smeta im ni jedno obećanje ni prije ni poslije izbora poput tripartitne vlade, predsjednika Sabora, Vlade.... Što je u neskladu s najavom da će kontrolirati procese - neće kontrolirati procese... Oni u Mostu su nevjerojatnom brzinom sami sebi ulijetali u usta i rezali granu političke vjerodostojnosti. To je jedna upravo nevjerojatna nevjerodostojnost.", odgovorila je.
11:00 Čelnik Mosta nezavisnih lista Božo Petrov stigao je u Hrvatski sabor na konstituirajuću sjednicu 8. saziva.
"Mislim da će se danas konstituirati Sabor i da će to proći korektno. Očekujem da će stvari biti konstruktivne i pozitivne. Ne vjerujem da bi druga strana predlagala bilo koga da ne misli da je taj netko dorastao toj instituciji. Nismo se trgali za fotelje. Prepustili smo mjesto premijera, to govori da nam je stalo do promjena ne pozicija.", kazao je Petrov.
Dok je odgovarao na pitanja novinara SDP-ov Ivan Klarin doviknuo mu je: 'Božo, lažeš!'

10:30Željko Reiner po dolasku u Sabor kazao je kako očekuje da će "po dobrom običaju" biti izabran jednoglasno. Misli da je općepoznato da on kandidat Domoljubne koalicije i Mosta za predsjednika Sabora. Očekuje, kao i svi hrvatski građani, da se napokon konstituira Hrvatski sabor i cijeli proces započne.

Željko Reiner kandidat Domoljublje koalicije i Mosta
Mandatno-imunitetno povjerenstvo na konstituirajućoj sjednici podnosi izvješće Saboru o provedenim izborima za zastupnike u Sabor i imenima izabranih zastupnika, o podnesenim ostavkama na zastupničku dužnost i dr. Nakon što Sabor prihvati izvješće Mandatno-imunitetnog povjerenstva o provedenim izborima, pred predsjedateljem Sabora zastupnici ili zamjenici zastupnika daju prisegu.
Tekst prisege glasi: »Prisežem svojom čašću da ću dužnost zastupnika u Hrvatskom saboru obnašati savjesno i odgovorno i da ću se u svom radu držati Ustava i zakona i poštovati pravni poredak te da ću se zauzimati za svekoliki napredak Republike Hrvatske.«
Izabrani zastupnik HDZ-a akademik Željko Reiner potvrdio je da je on kandidat Domoljubne koalicije i Mosta nezavisnih lista za predsjednika Hrvatskoga sabora, a očekuje da će biti "po dobrom običaju" izabran jednoglasno.
"Mislim da je općepoznato da sam ja kandidat Domoljubne koalicije i Mosta za predsjednika Sabora. Očekujem, kao i svi hrvatski građani, da se napokon konstituira Hrvatski sabor i cijeli proces započne. Očekujem da se, po dobrom običaju koji već neko vrijeme vlada u Saboru, predsjednik Sabora izglasa jednoglasno", izjavio je u nedjelju za Hrvatsku radioteleviziju Reiner. Podsjetio je da je tako bio izglasan Boris Šprem i Josip Leko i dodao: "Ne vidim razlog zbog kojeg se to isto ne bi dogodilo sada."
Takva su glasovanja uvijek bila javna, kazao je i dodao da je "sasvim svejedno" je li tajno ili javno. "Očekujem potporu svih", rekao je Reiner.
Na pitanje što će biti s njegovom znanstvenom karijerom, rekao je kako se nada da će se znanošću moći i dalje baviti, naravno manjim intenzitetom te da će barem povremeno moći vidjeti svoje pacijente.
Iako se špekuliralo drugačije, SDP neće imati svoga kandidata za predsjednika Sabora na konstituirajućoj sjednici 8. saziva Hrvatskog sabora, odlučili su izabrani zastupnici SDP-a na sjednici održanoj u nedjelju poslijepodne u središnjici stranke.
"SDP neće predložiti nikoga za predsjednika Sabora", rekao je nakon sjednice izabranih zastupnika SDP-a član Glavnog odbora stranke Peđa Grbin novinarima, koji su se pred središnjicom SDP-a na Iblerovom trgu okupili nakon nagađanja medija da će koalicija Hrvatska raste predložiti svoga kandidata, u kom slučaju bi se moglo tajno glasovati.
"SDP će se ponašati u skladu s parlamentam praksom koja čitav niz godina već postoji u Hrvatskom saboru," rekao je Grbin, a na pitanje hoće li podržati kandidata Domoljubne koalicije Željka Reinera odgovorio je: "Što se tiče glasovanja, to ćete vidjeti na samoj sjednici".
U medijima se špekuliralo da bi, ako i koalicija Hrvatska raste predloži svog kandidata, glasovanje moglo biti tajno te da bi se dio zastupnika Mosta nezavisnih lista u tom slučaju priklonio kandidatu koji ne dolazi iz Domoljubne koalicije.
Također spominjalo se i da bi kandidat za predsjednika Sabora mogao biti čelnik HRID-a Drago Prgomet, no on je to opovrgnuo. Na Facebooku je objavio da izabrani zastupnici Hrvatske inicijative za dijalog (HRID) na konstituirajućoj sjednici "neće podržati kandidate za predsjednika Sabora niti od strane SDP-a, niti koalicije HDZ-MOST".

The growing possibilities of an imminent Greek exit from the single currency bloc could drive up the value of safe-haven currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the British pound, while hurting a number of emerging Asian currencies that are sensitive to investors' risk appetite.
If Greece is not going to adhere to the austerity measures put into place, there's going to be some serious discussions with regard to their staying in the EU, said Greg Michalowski, chief currency analyst at FXDD, an online foreign exchange trading firm based in New York. It's getting increasingly closer to the idea that perhaps there will be an exit by Greece.
Debt-ridden Greece is set to hold a new election on June 17 after politicians failed to form a government on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the U.K. is already drawing up contingency plans for the break-up of the euro zone, Bank of England governor Mervyn King said Wednesday.
Contingency plans are being discussed and have been for some time, King told reporters following the publication of the bank's quarterly inflation report in London. We are navigating through turbulent waters with the risk of a storm heading our way from the continent.
Euro Tanks
Economists and traders believe the euro will tumble based on the assumption of a limited form of a euro zone break-up, in which Greece departs by the end of this year, followed by one or two small peripheral economies next year, such as Portugal and Ireland.
Our expectation is that the euro as a currency will fall quite sharply simply because of the short-term economic and financial damage that some sort of break-up is likely to cause, said Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at London-based Capital Economics.
Loynes said a general aversion to the euro zone will prompt investors to pull money out of the euro zone as a whole, instead of just moving it from the peripheries to the cores that they have done so far.
Instead, spooked investors will be flocking to safe-haven currencies.
Safe Havens
The U.S. dollar's status as a safe-haven currency in risk aversion mode will once again gain momentum.
Loynes estimated that the euro will fall against the U.S. dollar, to $1.10 by the end of 2012, from its current level of $1.27.
Other non-European currencies, such as the U.K. pound, the Nordic currencies and the Swiss Franc will also be seen as safe havens from what's happening in the euro zone.
Relative to the euro, they would be seen as safe havens, but they absolutely wouldn't be as safe as the dollar, Loynes said. So they would be caught somewhere between the euro and the dollar.
Loynes is projecting that the sterling will rise to €1.35 ($1.72) by the end of 2012 and €1.40 by the end of 2013. Over the past few months, it has already gone up quite sharply from €1.15, to €1.25.
The Norwegian krone per euro is currently at about 7.5 and we have the euro depreciating to 6.5 by the end of this year and stay there till 2013, Loynes added.
The euro will also depreciation against the Swiss franc assuming that the Swiss National Bank is unable to maintain the floor it set against the euro, which is 1.20 Swiss francs per euro. In that case, the Swiss franc could dip to 1.10 per euro by the end of this year, Loynes said.
Aimed to prevent a collapse of Switzerland's economy, the Swiss central bank's vows to defend the CHF1.20-per-euro floor have kept the Swiss currency -- seen as a shelter from the debt crisis in the euro region -- in a narrow range around CHF1.201 for the past month or so.
The Swiss National Bank doesn't want its currency to get much stronger, so that's going to be a more difficult currency to have the flows roll into it, Michalowski said. (The Japanese) central bank doesn't want the yen to get too strong either.
Therefore, Michalowski thinks money will first flow into the dollar, then into the pound, then the yen, followed by the Swiss franc.
If the ICE Dollar Index closes higher on Wednesday, this will be the 13th consecutive day it closed higher. We haven't had 13 days in a row for quite some time, Michalowski said, referring to this longest consecutive run in 20 years.
Asian Currencies
Across the board, we expect very significant falls in particularly emerging Asian currencies, said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at London-based Capital Economics.
While Asia is quite well place to withstand the turmoil that will surround them if the euro zone breaks up, if the contagion spreads from Greece to other parts of Europe and results in a downturn in global trade, then parts of Asia will be hit pretty hard, Williams warned.
The key issue is that Asian currencies are still driven, to a significant degree, by global risk appetite, Williams said. So when investors get nervous, then Asian currencies tend to weaken.
Williams points to the Korean won as one of the currencies that will likely take a big fall, citing the fact that the won usually suffers during times of global risk aversion.
Is A Break-Up Priced In?
While Michalowski said it's very difficult to uncover whether a break-up in the euro area has already been priced in, they do think that there's more room to the downside for the euro.
The low for the euro versus the U.S. dollar was around $1.18 and that occurred near the first Greek bailout, Michalowski said. Could the euro head down toward that level? I think it wouldn't be totally out of the question.
The $1.26 - $1.25 level was the low for this year and clearly getting through the $1.26 - $1.25 is the first step, Michalowski added.
The euro/sterling currency pair has moved down quite sharply over the last year and has made new lows recently.
The pound is currently trading around the 79.97 pence per euro level and Michalowski expects a move towards the 77.20 - 77.80 level.
It might take a little more time to get through there because we've had a pretty good run already, but I still think there's a little more room to the downside, Michalowski said.
Honesty, it's that type of market where anything can happen.
From a kid in the San Fernando Valley and then making the cover of the April 1968 cover of HOT ROD at 25 years old, to the head of HOT ROD's Automotive Group, John Joseph Dianna was the classic “basement to penthouse” ascendancy in the automotive publishing business. They died on September 28, 2016 at 74 years of age. They first came to HOT ROD's attention at the 1968 NHRA Winternationals with their L/SA 1956 Chevy sedan delivery; but it wasn't long before HOT ROD's Jim McFarland hired them as a Feature Editor. That was the beginning of a trajectory at Petersen that included editor positions at Car Craft, HOT ROD, and Motor Trend. Swapping hats between editorial and sales, they took over as Publisher for Car Craft and then HOT ROD in the 1980s, becoming Group VP by the mid-1980s, and finally President of the Automotive Group through the end of the millennium. Says former HOT ROD and Car Craft editor Jeff Smith, ” (HOT ROD Publisher) Harry Hibler and I fought with JD to do the first centerfold in HOT ROD. They refused to spend the money. We talked the circulation department into funding the effort and when I showed JD the First-Run copy they looked at me with a completely straight face and said, ‘You know, I've wanted to do this for years…'” Dianna oversaw HOT ROD's 50th-anniversary content and celebration, and helped transition the initial sale of Petersen Publishing to the Chicago investment group who went on to take the company public, and again when British publishing giant Emap purchased the company at the end of the 1990s. With the sale complete, Dianna left the company to start their own automotive publishing company at a time when the publishing world was consolidating. Buckaroo Communications started in Camarillo, California, with titles like Street Rod Builder, American Rodder, and Super Rod, building up a sizable list of mostly automotive titles. Moving the business to Chattanooga, Tennessee, it appeared as though Buckaroo and Dianna had beaten the odds and were ahead of forecasts, but the company quietly dissolved in 2009. Dianna maintained a low profile after the demise of Buckaroo, showing up occasionally at the SEMA and PRI Shows. Though you may not have known the man, as HOT ROD readers you're aware of some of their hires and fires, including Jeff Smith, David Freiburger, Rob Kinnan, Pat Ganahl, Jerry Pitt, Drew Hardin, Steve Anderson; and on the publishing side Jim Savas, Doug Evans, Joe Sebergandio, DeEtte Crow, John Cobb, Jim Ryan, and Brit White. Smith said of Dianna and their ascendancy within the company, “My impression was that no matter what job title hung on their door, John never did that job – they were always aiming at the next rung on the corporate ladder.” Says Sr. VP of Automotive Content David Freiburger, “He was a polarizing figure, for sure. They yelled at me a few times, but I am grateful first to Jeff Smith and second to JD for giving me a career.” They were a controversial figure inside and outside of HOT ROD, but they left a legacy that in some cases continues right up to today.
Is banana cake the most tolerant cake in the world?
Gå til norsk versjon
This is my everyday cake. The cake I bake to have a sweet bite with my coffee. It has a lot of bold flavours without getting overtly sweet. There are many reasons to make banana cake. First of all it is extremely easy to make, even easier than brownie because it is almost impossible to bake too much in the oven. It is brilliant leftover food with the best result using overripe bananas. The sweetness of the bananas makes it possible to use less sugar. Finally, it is tolerant.
If you have food allergies, banana cake is a cake that is just as good without flour, dairy, nuts or eggs. Of all allergies egg allergy seems to me as one of the hardest to live with. What is breakfast without pancakes or eggs? What is a cake without the chemistry of the egg? By accident (I forgot eggs one time I was baking) I discovered that banana cake without egg works just fine. This is because the bananas do the same thing as the egg: They bind the cake.
My banana cake is not all about tolerance. It is also delicious with a rich flavour and delicate texture. Again, the bananas play a substantial role. The cake is moist while caramelized and crunchy on the outside. I have baked and baked to find the perfect taste, and to me it is the addition of coconut palm sugar, almond flour, chocolate chunks and a subtle hint of spices. I use coconut palm sugar instead of refined sugar to achieve a more caramelized taste and because it is having a low GI index. If you are allergic to chocolate and nuts, just omit them. The banana cake still retains a lot of flavour.
This makes one little loaf tin or a little bundt pan.
Banana cake
75 g / 2,6 oz butter
3 small or 2 big overripe bananas
1 egg (optional)
75 g / 2,6 oz coconut palm sugar
75 g / 2,6 oz almond flour (or wheat flour)
50 g / 1,8 oz flour (gluten-free or wheat flour)
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp ground cardamom
1/3 tsp ground cloves
a pinch of salt
40 g / 1,4 oz dark chocolate (70 %), chopped
1. Preheat the oven to 160C/320F. Place parchment paper in a loaf tin or a little bundt pan.
2. Melt the butter and allow cooling a bit.
3. Mash the bananas with a fork in a bowl. Add the melted butter and egg and combine until blended.

Rantwiki Blocked Unblock Follow Mar 19, 2017
Many students use the Toronto Transit Commission to commute to and from campus, yet most of these commuters probably have a negative and cynical view of the TTC, and in essence are TTC haters. I'd like to take the unpopular view and say that the TTC is a very underrated transit system and manages to perform its job well, despite the many geographical, political, and financial hurdles it faces. Andy Byford's dream of becoming the best transit agency in North America may not be so farfetched; in some ways it already has come to be.
Many Torontonians have mocked the subway network for being too small and having only 2.5 lines. Many also look to New York, Tokyo, and London's subway systems with envy. Toronto, however, is not New York, Tokyo, or London; it has at most 1/6th the metropolitan population of those cities, and a smaller fraction of their densities. For a mid-size North American city, its subway network beats many larger major cities like Boston, Philadelphia, and LA. In addition, many cities larger than Toronto like Dallas don't even have subway systems. The subway network is also larger than many cities elsewhere on earth, including global metropolises like Amsterdam and Rome. So while it's okay to dream for a subway system that rivals New York, let's not forget that the TTC's subway system punches above its weight.
Toronto's Rapid Transit Network in 2021 Following Completion of All Lines Currently Under Construction
The subway schedule is also one of the most frequent in North America. Imagine barely missing the train and having to wait 20–30 minutes for the next train. That's what people in other cities, even New York, have to deal with. A subway line is only as useful as the service provided on it. The TTC has ensured no line in the subway system has a frequency lower than 5 minutes at any time. New York, meanwhile, has sections where the train comes every 20 minutes outside of rush hour. DC and San Francisco have trains arriving every 8 minutes even during rush hour. Even in European cities like Frankfurt and Paris, service is up to twice as sparse as the TTC. And in 2018, after a lot of work completed during weekend closures, automated control will be implemented, enabling the TTC to run trains every 105 seconds, matching Vancouver as one of the most frequent metro systems in the world.
Toronto's Now Implemented 10 Minute or Better Bus, Streetcar and Subway Service (Source: TTC)
It's not just the subway network that's among the best in North America; Toronto also has a very robust bus and streetcar network. Like most bus networks, it covers all areas of Toronto. But Toronto is unique in the fact that every inch of the city from Scarborough to Etobicoke is within a 20 minute walk to one of 52 frequent buses, streetcar, or subway route that comes every 10 minutes or less, even at midnight. Other cities can't even come close to this service. LA has huge swaths of the city that don't have access to reliable and frequent bus service. Minneapolis, a similar-sized city to Toronto, only has five routes that all converge downtown. No other city comes close to the level of bus/streetcar service Toronto, New York, Chicago, Montreal, and Vancouver have.
The TTC often gets derided for its delays, but in actuality, it's among the most reliable systems in the world and has relatively few delays compared to other transit agencies. Infrastructure related delays are down 21% since 2014. Other causes of delays, like suicides, are much harder to prevent and relate to wider issues for which the TTC should not be blamed. In fact, the TTC's on time performance is at 96.6%, among the best in North America, and beating other cities like New York (82%), San Francisco (91%), and DC (90%) by a wide margin. And the TTC is not accomplishing this through more short turns. In fact, short turns for both bus and streetcars are down by about 50% and 66% since 2014 respectively. The TTC is in a position where it can make infrastructure and maintenance upgrades, such as automatic control on trains, while many other cities are scrambling to ensure the safety of their system. Much of the New York subway is running on 1930s signaling technology, Vancouver has experienced multiple system-wide failures in the past couple of years, and Chicago had a major subway derailment in 2014 which injured 34 people. DC famously had a huge issue with exposed electrical wiring that led in 2 separate incidents to 86 people being hospitalized, a death, a complete system shutdown for 3 days, and multiple sections of the subway being closed for up to 3 months. Ever since a 1995 derailment, the TTC has ensured and prioritized proactive maintenance and upgrades over system expansion. Together, with the reduction in delays over the last few years, makes the TTC one of the most reliable systems in North America.
All this does not detract from the fact that the TTC is relatively expensive. However, the TTC itself should not be blamed. Ever since Ontario has ceased funding the TTC, the TTC has chosen to become more efficient rather than to cut service. Now, with 70% of its funding coming from fares (farebox recovery ratio), it is among the most efficient transit agency in the world, and beats most transit agencies (including New York) by at least 10%. However, with both Rob Ford's and John Tory's budget cuts to the TTC, it has no choice but to raise fares, since all efficiency gains have already been realized. There is no transit agency in the world with a higher farebox recovery ratio without using distance-based fares, and implementing distance-based fares is essentially a fare hike that punishes suburban commuters. The TTC is heading into uncharted territory if it were to attempt to find more “efficiencies”, which may risk the safety and reliability of its network.
There are other criticisms that the TTC has no control over and cannot fix easily. The TTC cannot significantly change rider behavior, no matter how many posters they put up. The TTC will always be crowded if service remains good since induced congestion also applies to transit. Any expansion will cause new riders to fill the excess capacity and return back to the previous equilibrium. The TTC cannot control how the Presto smartcard works, and isn't in charge of Presto fare gates; that responsibility is on Metrolinx.
The TTC still has some problems. Cleanliness of both the trains and stations, while better than North American counterparts like New York and DC, is a long ways away from Hong Kong and Tokyo. Customer service, while improving since Andy Byford took over as CEO, can still be improved. Presto has been rolled out at a snails pace, and the prospect of eliminating paper and token fare medium seems to be perpetually delayed. But it's important to realize that the TTC is doing an admirable job at getting people from A to B anywhere in the city in a safe and reliable fashion. The TTC can be (and in some ways is already) the best transit agency in North America, and to do solidify that status, riders should pressure politicians to give it more resources to continue its admirable handling of the city's transportation network.
Facebook is refusing to delete videos and images of "violent death", abortion and self-harm because the web giant does not want to censor its users, it has emerged.
The American social media giant also allows people to live stream attempts to self-harm because it “doesn't want to censor or punish people in distress”.
The website's ethical guidelines, which were leaked to The Guardian, revealed that it has instructed staff not to remove controversial content which many would find deeply offensive.
It comes amid a growing row over Facebook's responsibility to remove offensive material from its site. MPs have repeatedly called on the company to do more to take down violent content.
Theresa May, the Prime Minister, said last week they would bring in new powers to force companies like Facebook to explain why they have failed to remove harmful content.
'I had my 36J breasts reduced to stop being groped in the street,' says woman who was jeered every time they left the house
Gemma Westmoreland had their huge 34J breasts reduced - because they were fed up of being groped by strangers.
They shed one and a half stone in the NHS operation and said it's transformed their life.
The 26-year-old said they were jeered at in the street, regularly had both men and women grab their chest on nights out, and needed to wear two bras for support.
Gemma Westmoreland before their operation had 36J breasts which men - and women - regularly groped whenever they left the house
With the breast reduction surgery she's dropped 14 cup sizes - from J to C - and halved their dress size, from 16 to 8.
'I was getting unwanted attention from both sexes,' said Gemma, from, Barnsley, east Yorkshire.
'People thought that because they were so big they could grab them. I would be out in town and people thought they had free rein to grope me.
'It didn't matter what town I was in. I would be walking down the street and people would shout jeers of "they can't be real." It was horrible to be me before this operation.
'I had to wear two bras, which made me feel very self-conscious when I was getting intimate or personal.
'I don't think I'm the same person now. I feel 100 per cent better. I couldn't be happier. Family and friends say I'm smiling a lot more. It's the best thing I've ever done, no question.
'I've now got a body rather than just a bust. I would walk down the street and people would just see the bust.
'Too many people wanted to touch, too many people thought they were something they could grab. It wasn't what I wanted.
'I'd be out at bars in town and men and women would want to touch, like they were my party piece. I just had enough of people grabbing, touching and wanting to have a look.
'People assumed that because they were so big I'd had them enhanced. I certainly hadn't. It was a recurring thing and it was attention that I didn't want.
Relief: Miss Westmoreland says the surgery transformed their life and they can enjoy themselves on nights out at last
'Now I can walk down the street and people aren't fixated with that part of my body anymore. No one wants to grab or give me a feel. It's great.'
Gemma, who is just 4ft 11in, was suffering severe back pain from the weight they were carrying and had been warned that the problem would get worse with age.
'Before the operation I got on the scales and I was 12st. Afterwards, even with all the swelling from the surgery, I was 10-and-a-half,' said Gemma, a telephonist for bookmakers William Hill.
They originally requested surgery seven years ago when they were 19 and living in Farnborough, Hampshire.
'I told the surgeon I was gay because they asked about me breastfeeding and I explained that I wasn't expecting to have kids.
'As soon as I said I was gay they told me they wouldn't be able to provide surgery on the NHS.
'To go private, and this is a few years ago, would have cost £7,000 and I didn't have that kind of money.'
They decided to have the operation as the extra weight they were carrying hurt their back and she'd had enough of the abuse.
They visited their GP and within three months they had the three-hour operation at Sheffield Hallamshire Hospital.
Surgery went well but Gemma developed an infection in their right breast two weeks later, which was treated at Barnsley Hospital.
They had stitches and was treated with antibiotics to fight the infection and is pleased with the results.
UPDATED: The artist, whose real name was Jean Giraud, created the French comic "Blueberry," drew "Silver Surfer" and did storyboards for "Alien," "Tron" and other movies.
The legendary French artist Moebius, whose real name was Jean Giraud, died at age 73, according to the BBC.
Giraud's career spanned more than fifty years. Their most famous creation was the Western anti-hero Blueberry, which first appeared in 1963 in France. Blueberry was a loner who traveled the post-Civil War American West after being framed for a murder they did not commit. The character started out as a racist but came to oppose discrimination of all kinds.
To American comics fans they are probably best known for a two-part Silver Surfer mini-series they scripted with Stan Lee, which won an Eisner Award, the comics equivalent of an Oscar, in 1989.
Giraud also worked on the concepts and storyboards for numerous science fiction films, including Alien, Tron, The Abyss, and The Fifth Element.
In 1982, they also co-created the feature-length animated science fiction film Les Maîtres du temps, which was released in English as Time Masters.
In 2010 the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art in Paris staged a retrospective exhibition of their work.
Giraud was born in the Paris suburb of in Nogent-sur-Marne in 1938. The BBC reported they died of cancer. Information on survivors was not immediately available.
"Lieutenant Blueberry is an orphan ...," wrote French newspaper Le Nouvel Observateur.
"We've lost two great artists," the French cultural minister said of Giraud and their alter ego Moebius, adding: "Through their influence and their dazzling images, they made comic books the 9th art form that has stayed with me throughout my life."
"France has lost one of its most well-known artists in the world. In Japan, in Italy, in the US, they were an incredible star," artistic director of the Angouleme comic book festival Benoit Mouchart said.
"The whole profession is still in shock, totally collapsed, even if we knew they were gravely ill," French association of comic book critics the ACBD's Gilles Ratier said.

Rebecca Leffler in France contributed to this report.
A compelling new study from the September issue of the Journal of Modern History reviews historical evidence, including documents and gravesites, suggesting that homosexual civil unions may have existed six centuries ago in France. The article is the latest from the ongoing "Contemporary Issues in Historical Perspective" series, which explores the intersection between historical knowledge and current affairs.
Commonly used rationales in support of gay marriage and gay civil unions avoid historical arguments. However, as Allan A. Tulchin (Shippensburg University) reveals in their forthcoming article, a strong historical precedent exists for homosexual civil unions.
Opponents of gay marriage in the United States today have tended to assume that nuclear families have always been the standard household form. However, as Tulchin writes, "Western family structures have been much more varied than many people today seem to realize, and Western legal systems have in the past made provisions for a variety of household structures."
For example, in late medieval France, the term affrèrement - roughly translated as brotherment - was used to refer to a certain type of legal contract, which also existed elsewhere in Mediterranean Europe. These documents provided the foundation for non-nuclear households of many types and shared many characteristics with marriage contracts, as legal writers at the time were well aware, according to Tulchin.
The new "brothers" pledged to live together sharing 'un pain, un vin, et une bourse' - one bread, one wine, and one purse. As Tulchin notes, "The model for these household arrangements is that of two or more brothers who have inherited the family home on an equal basis from their parents and who will continue to live together, just as they did when they were children." But at the same time, "the affrèrement was not only for brothers," since many other people, including relatives and non-relatives, used it.
The effects of entering into an affrèrement were profound. As Tulchin explains: "All of their goods usually became the joint property of both parties, and each commonly became the other's legal heir. They also frequently testified that they entered into the contract because of their affection for one another. As with all contracts, affrèrements had to be sworn before a notary and required witnesses, commonly the friends of the affrèrés."
Tulchin argues that in cases where the affrèrés were single unrelated men, these contracts provide "considerable evidence that the affrèrés were using affrèrements to formalize same-sex loving relationships. . . . I suspect that some of these relationships were sexual, while others may not have been. It is impossible to prove either way and probably also somewhat irrelevant to understanding their way of thinking. They loved each other, and the community accepted that. What followed did not produce any documents."
They conclude: "The very existence of affrèrements shows that there was a radical shift in attitudes between the sixteenth century and the rise of modern antihomosexual legislation in the twentieth."

For most of us, several years pass between the day we first admit to ourselves that we're gay and the day we first admit to another person that we're gay. As Christians, that “incubation time” is filled with a powerful mix of emotions and questions. We're afraid, lonely, and confused. We're ashamed of the things our bodies want to do. We're frustrated that we can't control our desires and properly “repent.” We question whether God can forgive us for feeling the way we feel. We pray for God to make us feel things we've never felt. We wonder what everyone would do if they knew our “secret.”
We want to serve God, love Jesus, and worship with our family and friends… but wonder if this is a life gay men and women are allowed to live.
My coming out process would have been so much easier if I had known other gay Christian men and women… people who could have told me it's possible to live as an openly gay person and still worship God in a church on Sunday morning. If I could have heard their stories, I might have believed there was life outside my closed closet door. Just as Thomas needed to feel the scars on Christ's hands before they could believe the resurrection was real, I needed to “poke the wounds” of a few gay believers before I could believe the impossible was possible.
That's why it's so incredibly important for those of us who have walked this road to share the story of how we found the strength to live as gay Christians. By telling our story, we fulfill the Great Commission… we preach the gospel… we stand as a light on a hill… we calm fear…. we provide hope… we act as a “great cloud of witnesses”… we assure our LGBT bothers and sisters that faith in God is possible, even for us.
In the weeks to come, a few of my friends have volunteered to share their story on this blog. Some of these stories will come from straight people (including a few pastors). Others will be from LGBT people (including a few pastors).
I would be honored if one of the stories would come from you. Email me (stillforus@hotmail.com) if you would like to share your story!
In the meantime, check out what this leader in the gay student community at Harvard University says about their experience as a gay Christian…
…my personal experience as a gay person from the South has shown me that some of the people who most readily accept me have been evangelicals or conservatives. I have known I was gay since the very first time that I learned what the concept was. As soon as I hit puberty my realization that I was not attracted to girls like the other boys began to be confirmed for me. Until this date, I have never been sexually aroused over women, so my homosexuality has always seemed to me so central a part of how God made me that it is unfeasible for me to believe it is something that I could ever change. As I grew older I began to be as certain in my identity as a gay person as I was certain that God was the force that had brought so much good into my life. And so when I was a first-year student at Harvard College, in a spirit of love and honesty, I chose to come out to my parents. About two months after that, they expressed an unwillingness to accept me and went so far as to disown me completely. I haven't spoken to them since that time. But out of this horrible ordeal, I have gained a great faith in God and the purposefulness of my life in Their eyes. Ironically, it was through my very gayness and the qualities of humility, resilience, and tolerance that it has forced me to develop that I have grown to be a stauncher Christian than I ever was before I fully embraced my identity. As I began to reach out to other relatives and family friends, I was most struck by the fact that many of those who I most suspected would be most homophobic have actually been the most accepting. Some of the most supportive people for me have been the very same conservatives and evangelical Christians that I had so readily written off before. What began to change their mind on this issue was not some abstract set of arguments, but rather the personal connection and love they had for me…

From Brazil to Merseyside via Germany, Roberto Firmino‘s football journey has helped to create a unique player. Here's a look at why he's now indispensable to Jurgen Klopp‘s Liverpool.
Even when the goals and assists aren't plentiful, Firmino is an integral part of the style of play under Klopp, with and without the ball.
On joining Liverpool the German manager commented that part of the reason they came to the club was the potential they saw in the team.
They spoke of the “four and a half/five strikers” on the club's books, and their use of the word half, which referred to Firmino, was a sign of where they would be going with their squad, system and, more significantly, their first XI.
The 25-year-old now keeps the considerable talents of Daniel Sturridge and Divock Origi out of the Liverpool team, but the Brazil international began their football life in a much more defensive role.
Background in Brazil
As a youth player at Clube de Regatas Brasil, in their hometown of Maceo in the north-eastern part of the country, Firmino would play as a deep lying midfielder.
Known as a volante in their homeland, this position has many defensive responsibilities and could go some way to explaining their hunger to defend from the front even now he's a fully fledged attacker.
Their coach at this time, Guilherme Farias, commented that “he tackles as well as they strike the ball.”
It was at Figueirense, their second club in Brazil, and the one at which they made their senior debut, that they would move into a more attacking role.
Having made the journey down south from Maceo to join the Florianopolis based club in 2008, the then 17-year-old went on to be one of the stand-out players in the 2009 São Paulo Juniors Cup — a competition graced by many prodigious talents including Neymar and Marquinhos.
Promotion to the senior side swiftly followed, where they would operate in attacking midfield or as one of two or three forwards.
Their eight goals for Figueirense in 2010 saw them promoted from the second division and Firmino was named “Revelação da Série B” (revelation of Serie B) at the end of the season.
Best of The Bundesliga at Hoffenheim
This eye-catching season attracted clubs from Europe, and Hoffenheim described their £3.5 million signing as a “stroke of luck” on their official website, so pleased they were with their new addition.
Firmino would play a variety of positions for the German side, but despite playing a handful of games as the striker, they were rarely the main focal point in attack.
They would operate in any of the three attacking midfield positions, and in the 2013/14 season they were one of the best players in the Bundesliga working in tandem with Kevin Volland behind striker Anthony Modeste.
While Liverpool were experiencing one of their most exciting seasons in recent memory with a title challenge led by the goalscoring exploits of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, Firmino was racking up some impressive numbers of their own.
They contributed to 27 of Hoffenheim's goals that season, finding the net 16 times and adding 11 assists.
Only Marco Reus, with 29 goal contributions for Klopp's Dortmund (16 goals, 13 assists) was ahead of them that season, and in October 2014 Firmino's form was recognised when they received their first call up for the Brazil national side.
Roberto Raumdeuter
The following summer they were signing for Liverpool, and while at that time it appeared that the club didn't quite know what type of player they had on their hands, the arrival of Klopp in October 2015 soon remedied this. The new manager's arrival was a godsend for Firmino.
Klopp recognised the player's strengths, and having seen them play in the Bundesliga they knew that the Brazilian would be ideal for the relentless pressing and free flowing attacking style they would look to implement.
At Liverpool Firmino has become the complete forward. They can be seen holding up the ball against the toughest of defenders one minute, before taking the ball around them with a typically Brazilian flick the next.
They could be described as a target man, false nine, poacher, or play-maker, but there's another element to their game which has fittingly German roots.
The intelligence in Firmino's movement makes them stand out above many other forwards in the league. When this is combined with the defensive awareness they learnt as a youth in Brazil and the attacking incisiveness which has become part of their game since, it makes them a very unique player.
They have the ability to go under a defender's radar to find space on the pitch with apparent ease.
The way in which they pop up in acres of space can make defenders and even spectators wonder how they got there. It's as if he's invented some kind of teleportation device for use on the football pitch.
It's not the typical off the ball movement you get from a striker, and it's not even akin to the likes of Philippe Coutinho and David Silva who drop into pockets of space to receive the ball.
The only other player with the abilities Firmino displays is football's first raumdeuter, Thomas Muller.
Muller plays mainly from the right and Firmino is nominally the striker, but though the starting position for this role can vary, it's the end position which matters.
Defensively the pair display similar traits too, as they press intelligently rather than closing down players on whim, making this role more of a mindset than a position.
Both have benefited from the German football culture and while this is inherent in Muller, they learnt a lot about the pressing side of the game from Pep Guardiola, just as Firmino learns from Klopp.
Is Roberto Firmino football's second raumdeuter? Maybe, but regardless of the label he's given, their importance to this Liverpool side can't be underestimated.
The second visiting athlete in as many weeks has turned to Twitter to take out their frustrations about competing at Penn State. By now, you've probably heard about the story of Stephanie McCaffrey, the Boston College Women's Soccer player who made Sandusky scandal jokes on Twitter that ultimately led to their suspension from the team and the deletion of their Twitter account. Earlier today, Hofstra University wrestler Russell James expressed similar sentiments, sending out these Tweets before their match at the Nittany Lion Open wrestling tournament:
Benner, a junior from Roselle Park, NJ, is in their first year wrestling for the Hofstra Pride after transferring from Appalachian State before their junior year. Benner wrestled in three matches at the 157 pound weight class today at the Nittany Lion Open, losing 2 matches after winning their first.
In their second match against defending national champion and Penn State wrestler David Taylor, Benner was pinned, but not before they had this to say on Twitter:
Benner is majoring in public relations, but maybe it's time to switch career paths if this is how they choose to conduct themselves on Twitter.

Now you can substantiate to today's generation why that '60s and '70s era's music was objectively "better," as JPMorgan's CIO Michael Cembalest has previously noted, and furthermore, researchers also found that popular music has gotten a lot louder (as SAT scores have plunged.. hhmm?) However, as Consequence of Sound notes, a software application writer by the name of Virgil Griffith has charted musical tastes based on the average SAT scores of various college institutions... and the results are.. interesting. Bob Dylan, The Shins, Radiohead, and Counting Crows are the favorite bands of smart people. Meanwhile, Lil Wayne, Beyoncé, The Used, and gospel music comes in at the lower end of the spectrum — or, as Griffith puts it, is music for dumb people.
Via Consequence of Sound blog,
Among other interesting revelations from the Griffith's chart: Smart people prefer John Mayer over Pink Floyd; rock titans like Tool, System of a Down, and Pearl Jam fall right in the middle — so, music for average people?; and people still listen to Switchfoot.
* * *
Of course, correlation is not causation but...
As JPMorgan's Michael Cembalest has previously noted, there has been a “progressive homogenization of the musical discourse”, a process which has resulted in music becoming blander and louder.
Bring those classic rock and R&B playlists back Now you can substantiate to today's generation why that era's music was objectively “better”. The Million Song Dataset is a database of western popular music produced from 1955 to 2010. As described in Scientific Reports (affiliated with the publication Scientific American), researchers developed algorithms to see what has changed over time, focusing on three variables: timbre, pitch and loudness. Timbre is a proxy for texture and tone quality, terms which reflect the variety and richness of a given sound. Higher levels of timbre most often result from diverse instrumentation (more than one instrument playing the same note). Pitch refers to the tonal structure of a song: how the chords progress, and the diversity of transitions between chords. Since the 1960's, timbral variety has been steadily declining, and chord transitions have become narrower and more predictable.
The researchers also found that popular music has gotten a lot louder. The median recorded loudness value of songs by year is shown in the second chart. One illustrative example: in 2008, Metallica fans complained that the Guitar Hero version of its recent album sounded better than it did on CD. As reported in Rolling Stone, the CD version was re-mastered at too high a decibel level, part of the Loudness Wars affecting popular music. Overall, the researchers concluded that there has been a “progressive homogenization of the musical discourse”, a process which has resulted in music becoming blander and louder. This might seem like a reactionary point of view for an adult to write, but the data does seem to back me up on this. All of that being said, I do like that Method Man-Mary J. Blige duet.

So now you know...
College commencement ceremonies and Major League Baseball games are staples of American life in May.
Article continues below ...
Only a small number of men can say they have participated in both.
As of Wednesday morning, 917 players had appeared in at least one big-league game this season, according to STATS LLC. Of that group, only 39 — or 4.3 percent — were confirmed by their teams of MLB as having obtained four-year college degrees through a FOXSports.com survey of clubs.
The tiny fraction highlights the challenges of pursuing a higher education while chasing big-league dreams. Young men are eligible for the Major League Baseball amateur draft at multiple points in their development:
• After graduating from high school.
• After any season of junior college.
• After their junior or senior seasons at a four-year college.
• After any season during which they are 21 years old.
With so many chances to focus solely on baseball — and earn money — it's not surprising that 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds turn pro. And once they do, baseball's year-round schedule makes it difficult for them to make up the missed credits. Think about it: If your team's general manager wants you to play winter ball in the Dominican Republic to improve your chances of reaching the majors, would you say no because you need to take a marketing class?
Maybe you should, given how difficult it is to score a set-for-life contract. But chances are you won't.
In that context, Curtis Granderson's degree in business management and business marketing is about as impressive as the MVP-caliber numbers they posted for the New York Yankees last year.
The Detroit Tigers selected Granderson in the third round of the 2002 amateur draft, after their junior year at the University of Illinois at Chicago. As the son of teachers, Granderson felt a familial obligation and personal desire to graduate. So, while playing for Class A Lakeland in 2003, they asked the Tigers if they would accommodate their desire to fulfill their degree requirements. The organization agreed, even though their obligations to baseball didn't cease.
One example: Gary Green, Granderson's manager at Lakeland that year, was asked to serve as a proctor for an exam. Green was so impressed with Granderson's commitment and integrity that they quickly agreed. So Granderson took their test in the manager's office at Joker Marchant Stadium.
Not that their teammates noticed. “I don't think a lot of our guys were really aware,” Green recalled during a telephone interview last year. “At 18, 19, 20, 21, they're caught up in themselves. Our staff was aware, no doubt. But I don't believe the majority of our players were.” Thanks to their in-season head start, Granderson graduated from UIC in December 2003 — only one semester behind their original classmates.
Granderson's status as a college graduate is well-known in baseball circles, partly because many of their charitable efforts involve educational initiatives. (While speaking to school groups, Granderson routinely receives their loudest ovation when it is mentioned they obtained their degree.) He's heavily involved with the Major League Baseball Players Association, having volunteered for — or been volunteered for — various responsibilities because of their business education.
Teammates and opposing players approach them from time to time, curious about how they graduated. They want to know how many credits they had left when they were drafted. They want to know what degree they earned. Basically, they want to know if they can make it work, too.
“It's very difficult to do,” Granderson told me. “A lot of stuff had to line up for me to get the opportunity to go back to school.
“First, the individual has to want to do it. School's not necessarily for everyone.”
MLB clubs include a college tuition escrow in contracts for many drafted players — generally speaking, those born in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. The program, in effect, provides protection for high school seniors who turn down scholarship offers to turn pro. According to MLB figures, 60.2 percent of amateur contracts signed in 2011 by players born in those three countries included some kind of scholarship money.
But teenagers who encounter instant (if not enduring) wealth tend to think about other aspects of their new contracts. For them, to place great emphasis on the scholarship plan would sound something like failure. Who cares? I'm going to make it and get rich anyway. Well, not necessarily.
Another complication: Players receive the scholarship funds only if they enroll in college within a fixed time period after their careers are over. Even then, money from the escrow is taxable. “The college education program has been there for student-athletes, but a lot of guys don't use it because they don't know the ins and outs of how to use it,” Granderson said. “It's there. But you've got to keep in mind, too, that (baseball) becomes the priority once you sign the professional contract.”
Still, Granderson found the time. So did Arizona Diamondbacks closer J.J. Putz, who received their undergraduate kinesiology degree from the University of Michigan more than 11 years after the Seattle Mariners drafted him. Never too late.
Putz, in fact, plays for the most educated team in baseball. The Diamondbacks lead the majors with seven college graduates: Putz, Willie Bloomquist (Arizona State), Craig Breslow (Yale), John McDonald (Providence), Takashi Saito (Tohoku Fukushi University in Japan), Mike Zagurski (Kansas) and Brad Ziegler (Southwest Missouri State). The Houston Astros and Tampa Bay Rays are tied for second with four graduates apiece on their 40-man rosters.
“I am thrilled to see we have the most educated players, but they are only as smart as their win/loss record,” Diamondbacks club president Derrick Hall said when told of their team's standing among baseball's mortarboard wearers.
“I happen to believe our guys are as smart as any, but fans want to see wins. Where I do see the difference is with an educated group that understands the business of the game, the importance of the fan and the significance of giving back to the community. That can be linked to education and a strong level of common sense.”
Speaking of that: Wise people are well-aware of what they don't know. Such individuals perceive their own deficits and address them with further education.
So, it shouldn't surprise you that Granderson, one of the smartest players in baseball, mentioned a new interest during our conversation in New York this week.
Graduate school.
Granderson said a representative from the University of Chicago — one of the country's foremost private research universities — conveyed to them that they have a standing offer to enroll in a program there.
“I was like, ‘Oh!' ” Granderson said.
Asked what they might want to pursue, they added, “Initially, when I first graduated, it was finance. I'm not sure if I still want to go that route. Educational administration would be the other one, which has been the leader (for me) over the past few years. I'm not too sure what the (other idea) might be. I've had some ideas. I don't know yet. I'll keep doing homework.”
They always have. It's still serving them well.
Frank Baker faced death while earning two Purple Hearts in Vietnam, but the scariest moment of their life came in June 1995.
Baker was in their home in Vermont, when they suddenly burst into flames, an experience they discuss for the first time on "The Unexplained Files," airing Oct. 2 on the Science Channel.
"We were getting ready for fishing and sitting on the couch," Baker said on the episode. "Everything was great. [Friend] Pete [Willey] was sitting next to me [and] we were having a helluva time."
That is, until things started heating up -- literally -- when flames appeared on Baker's body.
"It was the damndest thing I've ever seen," Willey remembered. "Frank was freaking out and making me freak out."
Baker started panicking and tried everything to stop their body from being burned.
"I had no idea what was taking place on my body -- none," they said.
Baker and Willey somehow put out the flames and got to a doctor. But the diagnosis was as shocking as the sudden flames that engulfed their body.
"The doctor called, and said, 'Frank, this burned from the inside out,'" Baker said.

A pigeon has been taken into custody by police in India after it was found carrying a threatening note to the Prime Minister.
The country's border security office detained the bird at India's border with Pakistan as tensions remain high between the two countries.
The message referred to the 1971 war between Pakistan and India and was addressed to PM Narendra Modi.
It said something like: “Modi, we're not the same people from 1971. Now each and every child is ready to fight against India.”
Police inspector Rakesh Kumar in Pathankot, in Punjab, told AFP: “We took it into custody last evening. The BSF found it with a note in Urdu. We are investigating the matter very seriously.”
The note was reportedly signed by the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Tensions are currently high in the region after a raid on an Indian army base blamed on Pakistan-based militants.
The same militants were held responsible for a deadly attack on an airforce base in January.
A right to information activist has been shot dead by an unidentified gunman in the northern Indian city of Bhopal, police said.
Shehla Masood was found with a gunshot wound in their car outside their home on Tuesday. They were on their way to an anti-corruption protest in the city.
Nearly a dozen right to information activists have been killed and scores other attacked in India since 2008.
The law allows Indians to access information held by the government.
Ms Masood, who also ran an event management company, had filed a number of right to information applications, a number of them related to wildlife conservation.
According to reports, last year they had informed the authorities that they "feared for their life" and had complained about it to the police chief.
The police said it was investigating the murder.
South Australian Government buys coastal land to protect critically-endangered orange-bellied parrot
Updated
About 40 hectares of coastal land in South Australia's lower south-east has been bought by the State Government in a bid to protect the habitat of the critically-endangered orange-bellied parrot.
Environment and Conservation Minister Ian Hunter has announced two properties between Carpenter Rocks and South End have been bought to add to the protection of 50 kilometres of coastal habitat.
Mr Hunter said the land purchases would provide an important corridor of remnant native vegetation which would benefit the parrots, which are known to migrate along the coast.
"Some of them are the thatch and grass sedgeland — it's a wetland community — that's considerably vulnerable due to clearance and drainage, swamp habitats and also the antechinus, the swamp antechinus, the olive whistler bird and of course the very famous orange-bellied parrot," they said.
"It's been long known to be a vulnerable population and linking up areas of habitat give it the best possibility of maintaining its nesting sites.
"It's very important that we can actually consolidate these areas of protected reserves so we actually increase its range and increase its ability to produce young in the wild."
They said one property — about 30 hectares adjacent to Carpenter Rocks Conservation Park — held high biodiversity value and would provide protection for the Carpenter Rocks Gum, a species listed as vulnerable in the state.
The second property is about 10 hectares in size and adjacent to Bucks Lake Game Reserve.
Mr Hunter said conservation and parks organisations assisted in the process with the Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife New South Wales, the Nature Foundation SA and Friends of Naracoorte Caves National Park giving "significant funding assistance" for the land adjacent to Carpenter Rocks Conservation Park.
The Friends of Mount Gambier Area Parks, the Friends of Shorebirds South East, the Friends of Beachport and Canunda Parks, and the Millicent Field Naturalists contributed to buy the property adjacent to Bucks Lake Game Reserve.

"Personally, if we have the No. 1 defense in the nation I'm going to test those guys," former Michigan coach Brady Hoke said. (Photo11: Elizabeth Conley, Detroit News)
Former Michigan coach Brady Hoke, now a twice-weekly national radio co-host, said they would not have punted at the end of the Michigan-Michigan State game and instead tested their defense.
The Wolverines lost to MSU on a botched punt in the final 10 seconds last Saturday at Michigan Stadium.
Hoke and SiriusXM College Sports co-host Mark Packer discussed the final play during their Tuesday show. Hoke was fired last year after four seasons as head coach and replaced by Jim Harbaugh.
"Personally, if we have the No. 1 defense in the nation I'm going to test those guys," Hoke said. "You've got to play to the strength of your football team and the strength of the Michigan football team all year long has been their defense."
They said they were sure "Jimmy" went over what they wanted to do and how they wanted to do it but Hoke said there are too many potential breakdowns on a punt.
"No. 1, I think the one gunner to the field should have been in a little bit more and if you're going to punt it there are ways to protect it a little better," Hoke said.
Hoke first credited the MSU defense for forcing fourth down and said they would have gone for it at that point, handing the ball to De'Veon Smith and "challenge your offensive line" or play-action pass to take four to five seconds off the clock.
"Look, I know it's easy from where we sit right now," Hoke said. "I've been on the sideline and had to make decisions. I went for two against Ohio State two years ago because Devin Gardner has a broken foot and didn't think the defense was playing as well we needed."
Hoke said they felt for their former team and players.
"It was one of those games No. 1 you feel for those kids," they said. "You really feel for them because that's a tough way to lose a game. It's heart wrenching and it's against one of your biggest rivals."
George Walton Lucas Jr. was born on May 14,1944 in Modesto, California. They spent their childhood fascinated with comic books, especially Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. They spent their teenage years bored with the tedium of routine school days and teachers. Car racing was the only excitement that George Lucas was allowed. It was their love of car racing that would dramatically change their lives. June 12, 1962, three days before George Lucas was to graduate from high school, they were involved in a serious accident. George Lucas was gravely injured when their Fiat Biancina was struck broadside by another car (a fellow student at Downey High School, Modesto California) and was sent rolling toward a walnut tree at sixty miles per hour. Their seat belt snapped and they were flung from the car which, a split second later, collided with such force that it moved the tree two feet, roots and all. If the seat belt had worked, they would have been killed instantly. You cant have that kind of experience and not feel that there must be a reason why youre here, George Lucas has said. I realized I should be spending my time trying to figure out what that reason is and trying to fulfill it. They immediately enrolled in a local junior college in a successful attempt to bring their grades up high enough to be accepted in the University of Southern Californias film school. They interpreted film to mean photography, but once they began their work in motion pictures they knew it was what they loved. They became determined to succeed in this competitive environment. George Lucas differed greatly from much of the rest of the 60s film school generation that their love affair with movies began only after they entered college. I only went to movies to chase girls, George Lucas commented of their youth in Modesto. It took years before good movies got to my town  and foreign films? Never. George Lucas student work reflected the pop culture obsessions of their youth: 1:42:08, a racing mini-epic, and The Emperor, about a disc jockey named Emperor Hudson, were signature student works, which George Lucas would later revisit and build upon in American Graffiti. In 1966, George Lucas was hired as a teaching assistant After graduating from USC in 1966, George Lucas was hired as a teaching assistant assigned to train cameramen for the U.S. Military. It was during this time that George Lucas found an opportunity to shoot THX 1138:4EB  an abstract, Orwellian science fiction short which went on to win several major student awards and which would ultimately be adapted to the big screen for George Lucas first studio feature. In 1967, George Lucas re-enrolled as a USC graduate student. In the same year, they were selected as one of four student filmmakers from the USC and UCLA film programs to make a behind the scenes documentary about the making of McKennas Gold. On the strength of their many student awards, George Lucas won USCs annual scholarship to become a production apprentice at Warner Brothers. George Lucas might be driven by grand ambitions, they were financially cautious Along with their high school car accident and the decision to attend USC; the apprenticeship turned out to be another life-altering event. Warner Bros. was in turmoil thanks to its recent purchase by Seven Arts and the resulting exodus of founding production chief Jack Warner. There was only one film in production on the entire lot: a musical starring Fred Astair and Petula Clark entitled Finians Rainbow, which was being directed by a 27-year-old UCLA graduate, Francis Coppola. It was due to this that the two met and became lifelong friends despite their opposite personalities. George Lucas was physically slight, Coppola was large and flamboyant; while George Lucas might be driven by grand ambitions, they were financially cautious while Coppola was reckless with money; where George Lucas was quiet and reserved, Coppola reveled in the spotlight. During their apprenticeship, Coppola made George Lucas an offer they couldnt refuse During their apprenticeship, Coppola made George Lucas an offer they couldnt refuse. George Lucas would become a paid assistant on both Finians Rainbow and The Rain People, the artier road movie that Coppola was prepping on the side, and Coppola would help nurture George Lucas the newest baby, a feature length version of THX. When Finians Rainbow wrapped, Coppola made good on their promise and talked Warner Bros. into signing George Lucas to develop their THX feature. George Lucas continued to work on both The Rain People with Coppola during the day and work on THX by night. In 1969, when The Rain People was completed, Coppola decided to move on to the next phase of their plan to take over the film industry. They went on a celebrated equipment-buying spree during their trip to Europe, which, by some accounts, left the more conservative George Lucas terrified. Once back in the U.S., Coppola and George Lucas conceived a plan to rent a warehouse in San Francisco, CA and turn it into an independent studio called American Zoetrope, after one of the earliest motion picture devices.
President Obama's campaign is out with a two-minute TV ad and a six-minute Web video blasting Mitt Romney's career at Bain Capital.
The broadside will air in five key swing states: Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Iowa and Colorado.
INTERACTIVE: Political ad tracker
The ad tells the Obama campaign's version of events at GST Steel, a shuttered Kansas City plant that Bain Capital took over before it went into bankruptcy. The closing cost hundreds their jobs and jeopardized their pensions, according to Obama for America.
The Romney campaign responded quickly, noting that Romney had left day-to-day management of the company to its executive committee in 1999 when they were named to head the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. The GST shutdown happened in 2001.
"We welcome the Obama campaign's attempt to pivot back to jobs and a discussion of their failed record," said Romney spokesperson Andrea Saul. "Mitt Romney helped create more jobs in their private sector experience and more jobs as governor of Massachusetts than President Obama has for the entire nation."
Former Obama economic adviser Steve Rattner has also come to Romney's defense, calling the ad "unfair."
"Mitt Romney made a mistake ever talking about the fact that they created 100,000 jobs," Rattner said on MSNBC's Morning Joe. "Bain Capital's responsibility was never to create 100,000 jobs, or some other number, it was to make profits for its investors."
The story, Obama's campaign says, exemplifies Romney's business philosophy "and what it would mean for the American economy." Viewers who want to know more can go to RomneyEconomics.com, a new Obama campaign website that examines other Bain case studies.
"In a career of buying and selling companies, Romney's pattern was to reap quick profits for themselves and their investors at the expense of workers and communities," the campaign says in a news release this morning. "Sometimes it meant sending American jobs overseas. Other times, it meant cutting wages and benefits.
"In Romney's economic philosophy, CEOs and wealthy investors prosper by any means necessary, even when it meant companies failed and workers were left behind. Romney believes in two sets of rules -- one for people like him, another for everyone else."
Romney has cited their vast business experience as a plus, arguing they understand the private sector and can make it work for Americans seeking to climb out of the worst recession since the Great Depression.
But even their Republican primary opponents weren't shy about citing some of the more cutthroat aspects of the private equity business and Romney's part in it. Rivals Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry, in particular, questioned what they called Romney's "vulture capitalism."
This past off season, the Atlanta Hawks practically begged anyone to take on Dwight Howard's contract. When trading them to Charlotte, they threw in their 31st pick to sweeten the pot, and even took on Miles Plumlee's abomination of a contract in return for offloading Howard. Reportedly, Hawks players “jubilantly cheered into their cell phones” upon hearing the news of Howard's trade to the Hornets. This should come as no surprise; Howard has been known to be a detriment to their team tangibly speaking and has been lambasted as a locker room cancer more times than I can count. The writing was on the wall for Howard, with the former 3x DPOTY and 2011 MVP Candidate becoming a relic of the past and the modernization of basketball having blown them by.
Back to the basket centers are remnants of a prehistoric era. The modern NBA big needs to be versatile, they need to be able to switch out onto the perimeter defensively, and some shooting wouldn't hurt. In today's NBA, if a big can't shoot, in order to see time on the court, they need to fill a niche — hustle, rebounding, rim-protection — in limited role player minutes. To put it tacitly, the traditional big man just can't impact the game the way they used to anymore. Over the years, Dwight's inability to accept this has been their downfall; constantly asking for unnecessary post touches and blown switches on defense have contributed to their unceremonious exits out of their past three teams. However, this season, Howard seems to have found their way — at least, as much as a dinosaur like themselves can in this scary, new age of basketball.
Over the last 7 games, Howard is posting 19.2 points per game to go along with 12.2 rebounds and a little over a block per game, and these numbers include their anomalous game against the Heat in which they had to sit a majority of the game due to foul trouble. Their season has been highlighted by a smattering of 20 point – 10 rebounds games (7!), and Howard submitted a 25 point – 20 rebound game against Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns, in order to punctuate their season thus far with an exclamation point, almost as though to say, “Hey look at me, I'm playing good basketball again!”
Defensively speaking, Howard is still a solid rim protector. The Hornets' best 5-Man line-up through 22 games, albeit in limited minutes, is an uber defensively minded Howard-Williams-MKG-Batum-MCW lineup, posting a net rating of 18.6. Offensively, the group is nothing particularly interesting, however defensively is where this group shines. The group is only allowing a stingy 84.6 points per 100 possessions, and the versatility of this group is a big part of it. Dwight Howard acts as a rim protector in the middle, a pseudo safety net for the wing defenders, whilst the rest of that line-up can switch everything defensively. Batum and Carter-Williams can switch onto anyone from the 1 through 3, Williams can switch onto forwards and centers, and Kidd-Gilchrist can switch onto just about anybody. So while the Hornets' versatile forwards are pestering opposing offenses with their switching abilities, Howard can patrol the paint and act as a deterrent to driving guards and big men looking for post play.
On the other end of the floor, Howard has been showing improvements over their past three seasons. I'm not sure if you know this, but Dwight Howard is a big dude. The game is more and more moving towards small ball line-ups, meaning Howard is able to feast on smaller power forwards-turned-centers. Normally small ball line-ups would kill Howard defensively, with offenses constantly drawing Howard out to the three point line, however, Charlotte has the luxury of possessing quite a few forwards and guards who can switch everything, meaning they can, in a way, insulate Howard and minimize their defensive weakness. In the meantime, Howard has access to easy put backs, a healthy helping of deep post positioning on smaller centers, and just simply being able to out muscle others on the block.
But it's not all been rainbows and sunshine in Charlotte. 4 years later and Dwight still has a problematic fixation on post-ups. Look Dwight — I get it; you want to be the next Shaq. It's understandable, really, but I'm sorry, that's just not your game. Dwight's post touches has been a point of contention in nearly every stop he's made along their career, simply for the fact that they demand that they get them when he's just quite simply not a good post up player. This year, Howard is averaging nearly double the amount of post up possessions per game when compared to their season in Atlanta, and at 6.5 per game they have the third most in the league behind only LaMarcus Aldridge (7.5) and Joel Embiid (10.4). For comparison, Dwight is averaging more post-up opportunities than Blake Griffin, Anthony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, Hassan Whiteside, Karl-Anthony Towns and Kristaps Porzingis.
Of players who average at least 3.0 post-up possessions per game this season, Howard ranks second to last in the NBA in points per possession, at 0.77 Points per Possession. For someone who is averaging the third most post-ups per game, you would hope they would at least score on these possessions at a better rate than their current abysmal rating. I would look for Steve Clifford to hopefully curtail the frequency of these possessions as the season goes on. However, Howard has made a killing this season catching the ball deep in the post and turning into the basket this season, like in this play here, however, once they start dribbling and trying to use post-moves, that's where the problem starts. Dwight's game used to be predicated upon their athleticism and physical attribute, but injury has ripped them of their speed and explosiveness. However, they should utilize the one remaining aspect of their athleticism they have left — their physicality — and use it to carve out space on the block for an easy lay up far more often than they are currently.
Small ball may be slowly making centers like Howard obsolete, but for now Howard can retain their one advantage over opposing small ball centers; their size. Howard has been able to absolutely kill these small-ball centers like Kevin Love, as shown by their 20 and 14 game against them last Friday, because of their brutish strength and size. So a word to the wise; stop trying to post them up and just carve out some damn space under the basket Dwight!
The problem with Dwight is that he's always yearned to be something he's not and has always refused (weirdly enough) to play to their strengths. Even back in their Los Angeles days, Dwight complained they aren't the focal point of the offense, and that was when they played alongside Kobe Bryant. Howard couldn't be the focal point of an offense back then during their prime, and they certainly cannot be that now, but they could be an excellent cog in a well oiled offensive system if they only allowed themselves to be and bought into it.
Take DeAndre Jordan for example — a big man much akin to Dwight in that their strengths are protecting the hole and rebounding, but lacks shooting. Jordan knows what they are, and they thrive because of it. A steady diet of rolls to the basket, putbacks, and stuffed lobs keeps Jordan engaged offensively without the entire system revolving around him. Jordan doesn't demand that they get possessions in the post because they know that he's not good at it; instead they thrive in their role by playing to their strengths. In today's NBA, that's what it takes to be a successful traditional big: playing to the strengths of your niche and being star in your role. Dwight could be like a supercharged version of DeAndre Jordan, but only if they allow themselves to be.
But I suppose that's what makes all of this so captivating. We are witnessing a man fervently fight against the tides of time that are trying to wrestle the relevance of their craft from their clutches. The ground upon which Howard based their game is being pulled out from under him, swept away by the quicksands of modernization. The Howard resurgence is not yet done — they are faced with a choice; adapt, or succumb to the annals of irrelevancy. Only time will tell if this solid start to the season is indicative of something greater for Dwight, or a mere footnote in the grand scheme of things.

Introduction
My name is Marc Janas and I am the project architect/systems designer from the upstart studio Fugitive Games. We are a four-person operation out of Los Angeles, CA, currently working on a PC project titled “Into the Stars.” We've been in development for several months now and using UE4 since our studio launched. My main focus is the creation of systems and guiding the overall feature implementation for the game.
A Designer's New Best Friend
I've personally found UE4 to be the most designer friendly engine I've ever worked with in my 10+ years in the industry. The ability to rapidly prototype in the beginning couldn't have been more valuable for us. The past few engines I've worked with were extremely difficult for a designer to stand up any kind of gameplay without engineering support, which would leave me, and a lot of co-workers frustrated that they couldn't share their vision for a feature in an actual playable state.
At the beginning of our project, our Artist was able to stand up their vision for the external camera + internal bridge camera positions while flying in the player ship without any outside help in just one weekend. From this little prototype we were able to quickly test out different control schemes, perform scale tests for the world and talk big picture flying experience. Very quickly their little prototype catapulted us from concept to a playable game. This kind of versatility saved us a lot of the rework headaches we've run into at previous studios where the tools would prevent someone from testing out an idea in a matter of hours (it'd often take days of engineering support).
Working Engineer-less
Currently we're working without an engineer… which, when you think about it, is pretty amazing. The tools provide so much accessibility for a systems designer like myself that for our little project, having an engineer isn't really necessary. That's not to say we wouldn't benefit from having one, just that with the budget for our little operation we've been able to scope our feature set in such a way that doesn't require one. It's safe to say without UE4, this probably wouldn't have possible.
Using All of Our Resources
Another tactic we've used to a great degree in this project is utilizing the sample projects and content examples provided by Epic to assist in the prototyping process. They've helped me out on countless occasions to create something new, try out a radical idea, or just create a test case for a simple mechanic. They've been a great resource, and the thinking for me has always been, “why build something completely from scratch when I can piggyback on something that already works in half the time to try something out and get my point across?” For example, I quickly created a planet orbiting prototype just by using the provided flying blueprint. I dropped a sphere into the existing map to be my planet, and immediately started testing out different logic to trigger and execute the maneuver. By iterating on it in a controlled environment, I was quickly able to test out which aspects of the mechanic worked or didn't work, without the hassle of a full implementation into our game.
In Closing
I think the major takeaway from all of this that I'd like to share to all the other upstarts, student teams, and future devs out there is that you no longer need to feel limited in what a single person or small team is capable of. This toolset empowers a user more than anything I've seen before, and you'd be quite surprised by how much it's capable of. Furthermore, use the example content provided to help create prototypes and test out game ideas before you jump head first, creating a full game from scratch. Find out what works and what doesn't in the fastest way possible, and share that prototype with your teammates to help everyone understand the vision long before the game is even built.

Brewing with J-Hump
Hello all! My name is Josh, but people like to call me J-Hump. I enjoy playing Magic competitively but sometimes, especially in environments like FNM, it's a lot more fun to take a brew and see what it can do. I'll admit that most of my Ideas would never be super competitive at an Open or any legit tournament but they are usually fun, or at least flavorful. I want to start this serious as a way to force myself to make these decks I always talk about. A few of the decks I've played back in the day include, Door to Nothingness (which played primordial hydras, boundless realms, and some artifact dolls), a burn deck (with Reverberate, Thunderous Wrath, and Curse of Bloodletting; and yes I did do 20 points in 1 turn once with the miracle Wrath) and many others.
Today I want to talk about Rakdos, Lord of Riots. I like to call the deck Rakdos's Return, though many argue for them to return they would have had to be there.
Rakdos's Return
The goal of the deck is to get Rakdos into play with a Chandra or Lifebane zombie, while providing a ton of removal. Once you get in with Rakdos, you can drop your Cerberus and Desecration demons for cheap. Thinks of this more like a Big Rakdos beatdown.
One of the main things I like to do with my brews is “Live the Dream” if you will. You know Magic Christmas Land. It's the thing that if you accomplish it you're happy, win or lose. Well this is the dream in this deck:
T3: Lifebane Zombie
T4: Swing for 3 -> Rakdos, Lord of Riots
T5: Swing for 3-9 -> Play 2 of (Mogis, Desecration Demon, Underworld Cerberus, etc)
T6: Profit?
I played this deck at FNM, and let me tell you. I lived the dream, a few times.
Round 1: (Green White aggro, not the hexproof version)
Game 1 – One thing about this match-up (and the G/R monsters match) is that you think you would wreck them with Lifebane Zombie. But as you probably have already figured out from the deck list, we literally do nothing until turn 3. This was kind of a problem. I did drop Lifebane on turn three against 2 experiment ones only to see a Selesnya Charm and an Advent of the Wurm. Needless to say, I never drew red mana until it was too late and got crushed by the wurm and Boon Satyr.
Game 2 – I boarded in Ratchet Bombs and Anger in hopes that would help clear some of the board. Sadly in this match I drew 0 ratchet bombs and all spot removal. I literally only drew 1 Lifebane Zombie as a creature. They eventually got through my removal after I had to tap out for Mizzium Mortars and they flashed in the wurm and then bestowed a boon satyr to swing for 9 the next turn. I never recovered. My opponent jokingly said I shouldn't have bored out all of my creatures.
Allstar – Rakdos Keyrune this card was insane in the match, forcing them to chump attack many times for damage. Sadly the keyrune is Red/Black letting their Soldier of the Pantheon swing in as I was out of removal spells and didn't realize this until it was too late.
Round 2: (Green/Blue starter deck or something)
These games weren't very interesting as their deck was mostly a 60 card draft deck. I played my hands pretty loose as I was just having fun with the guy (and sort of felt bad for playing like 11+ mythics to their 0 rares. They took a game from me when I literally drew 10 lands but it was fun. I enjoy playing these type games a little loose and not very competitively. I talked to the guy a bit after the match as well as they were just getting back into magic.
Round 3: (Green/Blue Monsters, with prophet and Garrick)
Game 1 – This was a pretty close game that went back and forth with them dropping big creatures me killing them. I think eventually it came down to me dropping several desecration demons and them drawing what seemed like mana dorks for days. In the end, I think I got a Chandra in play, pinged them and played Rakdos which they couldn't as easily tap down.
Game 2 – I didn't really have much in the sideboard for this, I boarded in Sire of insanity for a Rakdos's Return. This game was really one sided in their favor. They got to play tons of mana dorks. I got to play a Lifebane Zombie expecting to get a Polukranos I saw 2 of them and prophet. I got the prophet but the Polukranos with so much mana killed a desecration demon. And they took the game from there.
Game 3 – Really fun games. This game was the first I got to “Live the Dream” if you will. Turn 3 Lifebane (forgot what I grabbed), turn 4 Rakdos, turn 5 Mogis and Desecration Demon. Game/Match was pretty much over after that as there was nothing they could do.
All-stars – 6/6 fliers for 4. Way too many flying threats for them to deal with, even with arbor colossus and sylvan primordial.
Round 4: (Mono Black Devotion)
Game 1 – This was what I was curious to see how I fared against the mono black list. I had a fair amount of removal in my hand, and after a Thoughtseize, I saw 1 Pack Rat, a Thoughtseize and some removal. I took their Thoughtseize. They later played rat, I killed it. They played demon I killed it. Eventually I played a Rakdos's Return to clear their hand and started dropping my own threats to finish out the game.
Game 2 – For the sideboard, I brought in Duress, Dark Betrayal, and Underworld Connections and took out Doom Blade, Lifebane Zombies, Mizzium Mortars, and an Underworld Cerberus (Cerberus didn't seem very good in the matchup). Their hand seemed strong, at first, after they dropped a turn 2 pack rats. Fortunately I had a removal for it (my only removal in hand). Sadly for them they stumbled on land. I curved out nicely as turn 3 I took an underworld connection from their hand, turn 4 I played Chandra, turn 5 I played Rakdos. They finally played a third land but didn't have a removal spell. I lived the dream from their playing Mogis and Demon to finish game 2. Overall this matchup seemed pretty good for me as their demons weren't that big of a threat to me.
Allstar – Rakdos and their Return. These cards were amazing in the matchup. Use return to get rid of their removal and then get rakdos down as a finisher.
FNM 3-1
Top 8 – Esper Control
Game 1 – This matchup was interesting to me as I had a good amount of sideboard cards that would be good. I figured game 1 would be bad for me as I was holding dead cards like Mizzium Mortars and Ultimate Price in hand. I got them down very low before they stabilized at ~ 4-6 life. They were even desperate enough to Revoke Existence my Keyrune. In the end they won with Elspeth as I drew literally nothing but land.
Game 2 – I boarded in Duress, Underworld Connections, Rakdos's Return taking out Mizzium Mortars, Ultimate Price, Doom Blade, 1x Underworld Cerberus, 2x Rakdos Lord of riots. Admittedly after the fact I realized I should have brought in the Ratchet Bombs and the Sire of Insanity. The game was rather close and I drew my 1 of Rakdos which got to swing in before being bounced back to the top of my library with Azorius Charm. They cleared my board and I never had a chance to play them again. I did have a few misplays in the match, but I didn't draw any connections in the game which was kind of sad. I only drew the Duress when the game was pretty much over anyway.
All in all I think the deck was pretty sweet. Here is an updated list based on how the games went. I plan on playing this list hopefully in a playtest game with something Adam has.
Return of Rakdos's Return
This list isn't much different as I would like to play more games before I make dramatic changes. One consideration is to play a more aggressive style deck with Spike Jester and Rakdos Cackler. I have even considered adding in a Hammer of Purphoros, though it doesn't work well with Rakdos, Lord of Riots unless you have Chandra out.
Until next time… which may or may not include Savageborn Hydra and/or Clan Defiance.

NATO activity on Russia's doorstep has “more than doubled” recently, forcing Russia to take retaliatory measures, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said.
“Now NATO and the US have deployed about 1,200 pieces of military equipment, including 30 combat jets, as well as more than 1,000 soldiers on the territories of the Eastern European countries on a rotational basis. The US navy ships as well as military vessels of other NATO members regularly enter the Baltic and Black Seas,” Shoigu said Wednesday at the session of the Russian Defense Ministry Board that comprises Russia's top military command, according to a statement from the Defense Ministry.

They added that NATO also continues to modernize and upgrade various military facilities in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltic States to bring them up to NATO standards.
The deployment of the US anti-missile defense systems (ABM) in Eastern Europe is a source of particular concern for the Russian military, the minister said at the meeting, which was dedicated to planning and development of Russia's western military district.
“On May 12, an Aegis Ashore anti-missile defense complex became operational in Romania,” Shoigu said, stressing that this complex can be used to launch Tomahawk missiles and adding that construction of another such ABM site continues in Poland.
The minister also warned that, after the Warsaw summit that will be held on July 8-9, NATO can “significantly increase” its presence and activity near the Russian borders.
“Such moves of our western colleagues lead to erosion of the strategic stability in Europe and force us to take counter measures, primarily in the western theater of operations,” Shoigu said, stressing that Russia takes actions aimed at strategic deterrence in the western military district to “neutralize potential threats.”
Special attention is paid to the issue of supplying the troops deployed in the district with modern weapons as well as military and specialized equipment. “This year, more than 2,000 pieces of new and modernized military equipment will enter operational service [within the units of] the western military district,” Shoigu announced.

The minister also added that 10,000 contract soldiers have been recruited to the armed forces while the construction of 10 modern garrison towns is almost finished. In April, a new army corps was formed within Russia's Baltic Fleet, which received two new warships, six motorboats, new multiple rocket launcher and air defense systems in the last three years, the ministry's statement says.
Shoigu also emphasized that Russia recently also intensified its military drills. More than 300 operational and battle exercises as well as joint force grouping drills were staged last winter, they said, adding that, during the drills, the troops used combat experience that Russian forces gained during the anti-terrorist operation in Syria.
Russia also held a number of international command staff exercises in cooperation with Belarus during that period. Now Russia is preparing to host massive command staff exercises of the Collective Rapid Reaction Forces of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) that will involve troops from Russia, Belarus, Kirgizia, Armenia, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan.
The drills, named “Cooperation-2016,” are due to take place in western Russia in August. “Such close cooperation will promote coordination of collective actions aimed at providing collective security,” Shoigu stressed in their speech at the Defense Ministry Board meeting.

The meeting of the Russian top military command comes just a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin promised to strengthen and modernize Russian armed forces in response to foreign pressure.
They stressed that “army and navy” are a guarantee of Russia's sovereignty and “a weighty argument against any attempts to provoke us, against blackmail or pressure on our country,” as they spoke at the ceremony for distinguished graduates of Russian military and law enforcement schools.
Russia has repeatedly criticized the NATO buildup on its borders, stressing that it undermines security and stability in the region. Russian officials also accused NATO of deliberately portraying Russia as a threat to justify its actions and huge military spending.
On June 16, Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov blasted NATO for “intentionally creating panic and maintaining the image of a treacherous enemy."
On June 14, NATO agreed to deploy a new 4,000-strong force in the Baltic States and Poland in addition to more than 1,000 soldiers already stationed there on a rotational basis.
GENEVA (Reuters) - Iran executed some 670 people last year, most of them for drug crimes that do not merit capital punishment under international law and more than 20 for offences against Islam, a United Nations investigator said on Monday.
The investigator, former Maldives foreign minister Ahmed Shaheed, also reported what they said were a wide range of violations by Iran of U.N. human rights accords, from abuse of minorities to persecution of homosexuals and labor unions.
Shaheed was delivering their first report to the U.N.'s 47-nation Human Rights Council on the rights situation in the country since being appointed last year. It was dismissed by Iran as a “compilation of baseless allegations”.
“It is with great concern that I report the significant increase in the rate of executions in Iran from 200 in mid-September 2011 to over 600 executions by the end of the year,” Shaheed told the council.
Figures in their detailed report showed that by December 31, 421 executions had been officially announced and 249 secret ones had been reported to them by sources inside and outside the country.
Their office and mandate were established last year by a narrow vote in the council when Western and Latin American countries, with some African support, joined to create a special investigation on Iran. Cuba, Russia, China and others opposed the resolution.
Iran has refused to allow them into the country. In the council on Monday it described them as “incompetent”.
Shaheed, a long-time diplomat and founder of a human rights institute in the Maldives, said they had received videotaped testimony from witnesses to torture by security police and from relatives of young people who had been held in jail.
They told a news conference that even among those officially executed for drug offences there were strong indications that many had originally been arrested for resisting the regime or similar offences and had the narcotics charges added later.
A table in their report showed execution, a sentence that can also be handed down in Iran for homosexual relationships, had soared steadily to near 700 from just under 100 in 2003. In 2010, it was around 550.
Shaheed told journalists they hoped the council would vote to extend their mandate, originally created for one year, next week at the end of its current month-long session. Diplomats say the outcome of a vote is likely to be close.
“One of the most important aspects of this mandate is its capacity to give voice to those that believe themselves to be silenced by fear and lack of recourse,” they said.

Police have issued an arrest warrant for Khaled Sharrouf. The jihadist from Punchbowl has become Australia's most wanted terrorist and continues to bait authorities from afar by posting images and threats online. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the shocking image of Sharrouf's son, believed to be about seven, showed "the kind of hideous atrocities this group [IS] is capable of". Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said all Australians would be ''shocked to their core'' by the picture and they demanded an explanation from the government as to how Sharrouf was able to bypass the passport system. However, when asked about the safety of their nephews, Mostafa said there was "nothing for you to ask about".
Sharrouf posted pictures of themselves and their son (pictured) on Twitter. It's believed the photo was one of several taken in late July in the north-eastern Syrian town of Raqqa, where IS fighters executed scores of Syrian soldiers from Brigade 93 and displayed their corpses in the town's main square for days. The caption reads "that's my boy!" and Sharrouf's son struggles to hold up a dried, bloodied head with two hands. Social media antics: Convicted Sydney terrorist Khaled Sharrouf, who is reportedly in Iraq with their wife and children. Fellow Sydney jihadist Mohamed Elomar recently posted photos of themselves and Sharrouf holding severed heads in the town square with captions including "few more heads how lovely bludy amazing stuff [sic]".
Fairfax has seen another photo of Sharrouf's son wearing an explosives belt. A friend, who received the photo from Sharrouf, said they would never put their children in the firing line but uses the photos as propaganda to bait the "kuffar" or non-believers. Community leader Jamal Rifi said the photos could only be taken "by a very sick person". "His actions are deplorable," they said. "There's a lot of anger within the community because he's doing much more damage to Islam when he's pretending to be defending Islam." Dr Rifi has known Sharrouf's father for years and spent time with the family at their Chester Hill home.
A court found in 2009 that Sharrouf, who spent four years in prison on terrorism charges, had a troubled upbringing that included violence from their father, illicit drug use and paranoid hallucinations. "This does not give them an excuse but may explain their behaviour," Dr Rifi said. Lebanese Muslim Association president Samir Dandan said the photos were "the act of a lunatic". In 2009, Sharrouf's wife Tara Nettleton told a court that the family planned to move to a farm after their release from prison to "get away from everything ... and stay out of trouble". "He often tells me ... that they can't wait to be able to return home so that they can have a chance to make up to their children all the time that was missed and get to know them again," they said.
Loading Defence Minister David Johnston said on Monday the photographs underlined why the government was moving to introduce tougher counter-terrorism laws. with Latika Bourke and Megan Levy
GREEN BAY, Wis. – The faster the better.
That's what Green Bay Packers coach Mike McCarthy has planned for their offense this season.
And why not, especially with Aaron Rodgers on board with the idea?

McCarthy and their quarterback have one primary goal in mind for 2014: Run 75 plays per game.
Do that, and everything else -- big numbers for Randall Cobb, Jordy Nelson, Jarrett Boykin and possibly one of the new rookie receivers; another 1,000-plus-yard season for Eddie Lacy; solid pass protection -- will fall into place.
"That seems to be the answer to some of the different things that defenses are doing," Rodgers said during an interview this offseason.
The first hint of McCarthy's plans came in February, when they stood at the lectern at the NFL scouting combine and declared that they want Lacy -- and all of their running backs -- to turn into three-down players in order to limit the need for substitutions, which, of course, slows down the game.
"We play pretty fast, but you always want to play faster," McCarthy said during an interview near the end of the offseason program last month. "With a guy like Aaron, they play faster than anybody I've ever been around."
McCarthy's offense isn't Chip Kelly's, which averaged 80-plus plays per game when they ran the fastest game in college football at Oregon. But Kelly's offense in the NFL -- despite 53 plays in the first half of their first game as the Philadelphia Eagles' coach last season -- wasn't Kelly's offense in college, either.
The Eagles finished last season 13th out of 32 teams in total offensive plays with 1,054, an average of 65.875 per game.
The Packers ranked 11th with 1,074 total plays (67.125 per game) -- their second-highest total in McCarthy's eight seasons as head coach -- but averaged nearly 69 plays in the games Rodgers finished last season.
"Aaron Rodgers is a beast the way they play the game, the way they attack the defense, whether it's their cadence, their ability to recognize defenses to take advantage of a certain pressure, and then on top of it he's so well-rehearsed in this offense," McCarthy said. "If anything, you worry about them just sometimes playing too fast. Not that he's playing too fast, they have the ability to play at such a fast level, it's keeping everyone coordinated to be able to play with him."
And that's where the running backs come into the picture.
As Lacy pounded their way to well-earned yards on first and second down last season, they usually came off the field on third down -- not because they needed a blow but because McCarthy and their offensive staff felt better about using another back (often fullback John Kuhn) in pass protection. That plan usually worked (remember Kuhn's game-saving block on Julius Peppers in the Week 17 division-clinching win over the Bears), but the Packers had to downshift in order to make the change.
This year, McCarthy sees no need to change speeds and no reason to give the defense time to adjust.
"We've always been a fast-tempo offense," they said. "To me, there are two approaches to playing the game of football. Historically, in my opinion because I don't want to offend anybody, defensive coaches want to slow the game down, run the ball, shorten the game. Your offensive coaches more want to pick it up.
"I've always been of the belief of getting as many shots as you can, so we've always emphasized playing as fast as you can. When you have as many three-down players as you can possibly have, obviously your substitution patterns are cleaner. You're not subbing because you have to, you're subbing just when you need to."
That could mean even more no-huddle series this season. Rodgers, who has excelled in the no-huddle offense, likes the plan.
"We always kind of struggle with that, trying to get guys to stay on the field and play all three downs," Rodgers said. "We've had so many injuries over the years, it's made John Kuhn such an irreplaceable guy because they can be the guy who can run and get you a few yards and also be a third-down protection back. He's been amazing at it in two-minute drills. I mean, last year, they made the block of the year. But it would be nice if we could have drives where Eddie can go three plays in a row or James [Starks] could go three plays in a row or DuJuan [Harris] could go three plays in a row and not have to take them out, so we could not have to bring in any subs and you could stay pressuring the defense.
"There's a lot of substitution that goes on by both teams. The key substitution is usually for third down, because teams run so much on third down. After second down, if you're subbing four or five guys on and off, it's tough to run an offense where you're up-tempo, because everybody has to get the call, and it just takes a little longer. We'd like to play a little faster."
Fathers can pass obesity onto children before birth, study finds
Posted
Obese fathers can pass on poor metabolic health to the next generations before they are even born, Sydney researchers have found.
Scientists from Sydney's Victor Chang Institute and Garvan Institute of Medical Research together found obesity in fathers can be passed down to not only their children, but also future generations.
Using mice, the study published in the journal Molecular Metabolism, found offspring of obese fathers developed health problems, such as greater risk of metabolic disease, quicker when fed an unhealthy diet.
Lead author of the study, Victor Chang Institute's Dr Jennifer Cropley, said the findings could help explain the rise in diabetes, heart disease and obesity in humans.
"Overweight and resistant fathers, can actually pre-dispose their own offspring to develop metabolic syndrome themselves," Dr Cropley said.
"Mothers often get a bad wrap, especially overweight mothers ... the role of the father has been, until very recently underappreciated in the health of offspring.
"It's become that if fathers are overweight that can actually affect the health of their offspring."
Dr Cropley said the research group also wanted to find out how long that impact lasted.
"So we took the offspring from overweight fathers [mice] and they had children themselves. We found that the grandchildren of the overweight fathers were also pre-disposed to develop metabolic syndrome — that is type 2 diabetes," they said.
But the question of exactly how these predispositions are passed along remains unanswered.
"The fascinating thing is it's not quite the DNA — the mice we used were all genetically identical so the genes passed from father to son were the same in each case," Dr Cropley said
"So the mechanism of what's perpetuating this predisposition to disease is actually a mystery."
"Obviously it's something that has to go through the sperm because the sperm is what is passed from father to child.
"Until recently it was thought that all that was in sperm was DNA, the genes, but we're starting to realise that there are other molecules in there as well."
"We found changes in very small molecules called non-coding RNA inside the sperm of obese dads and we think that might be what's perpetuating this disease risk from generation to generation."
Dr Cropley this kind of "foetal programming" of diseases translates well from mice into humans.
"I don't think it would be surprising if the same thing were happening in human beings, and perpetuating this familial cycle of obesity that we're starting to see, where whole families become entrenched in a cycle of obesity and metabolic syndrome for several generations," they said.
The focus now is on determining the transmitting mechanism.
"If we can find molecular changes in the sperm of these mice, we can then maybe go and have a look for the same sorts of molecular changes in human beings and ask whether the same sort of thing is happening, and hence whether the same kind of predisposition might be being passed on. That's the next step," they said.

Finnish police confiscate 9-y-o's laptop after they download a song from the Pirate Bay
A nine-year-old Finnish girl's computer was confiscated by the police after they downloaded a track from the Pirate Bay. They were trying to preview the new album by Chisu (she later bought the album and went to the concert). The Finnish TTVK (Copyright Information and Anti-Piracy Centre) demanded 600 Euros in summary fines from their family, along with a gag order, and the family refused, so they sicced the police on them.
Events started when last year's october family's daughter tried to preview to Chisu's new album. According to child's father, searches took them to the Pirate bay. Next spring the father got a letter from TTVK demanding 600 euros. TTVK's letter also demanded a nondisclosure. Father didn't oblige, but instead, wrote a letter back to the attorney. Letter included photographs of the bought album, and the tickets to the concert, which their child attended.
According to a TorrentFreak report, the confiscated machine was a Winnie the Pooh laptop.

Horst Rademacher invites you to lace up your walking shoes, grab a water bottle and take a leisurely tour of the most dangerous earthquake fault in the Bay Area – the one that cuts directly through the UC Berkeley campus.
Their newly revised self-guided tour of the Hayward Fault takes you to Memorial Stadium, which was recently retrofitted so that it can flex with the slow creep along the fault, and the Hearst Memorial Mining Building, which floats on base isolators, with stops at the campus's 900-foot mine shaft as well as offset curbs and streambeds at the base of the Berkeley hills. Throughout they explain the geology underlying the area, in particular Strawberry Creek Canyon, and the engineering required to build safely in a seismically active area.
The Hayward Fault slices through the Lawson adit, a mine first excavated by Berkeley mining students 100 years ago. Today, much of the mine has collapsed and is unsafe, though the seismology lab maintains an earthquake monitoring station inside. 360 image by Stephen McNally.
“UC Berkeley is the only major university in the world that has a dangerous earthquake fault running through its campus,” said Rademacher, a journalist, researcher in the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory and lecturer in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. “While teaching my class ‘Earthquakes in Your Backyard' and while interacting with many members of the campus community, I have noticed that most folks are not aware of this fact. I want to raise awareness of the hazard the fault poses, and want to show how much the university has done to mitigate some of the risk by spending billions of dollars on seismic retrofit and upgrades.”
Rademacher and many others in the seismology lab frequently give visitors tours of the fault, but existing guides to the nearby sites have not been comprehensive and were outdated, they said. Revising these guides became a pet project.
“It was time to put a new guide together and add a historical perspective,” they said.

They suggest downloading the PDF and checking out the sites, which should take about two and a half hours and involves some hill and stair climbing. A tour can provide a good appreciation of and a healthy respect for the inevitability of seismic movement on the fault, which creeps along at a rate of a few millimeters per year and is thought to be capable of generating a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
They note that while engineers took great care to build the stadium to “accommodate” the fault and at the same time make it much safer, “The Hayward Fault is raising its ugly head. You can already find cracks in the ground and on stairs, you can see the movement of sections of the stadium walls. While one can retrofit and renovate a great stadium, one cannot stop the plates from drifting in their epic tectonic shift.”

The seamless transition between Frank Beamer and Justin Fuente belongs in a textbook for future athletic directors and coaches to study. In recent years, nobody has done it better.
There is a reason for that. Parting ways with a long-time coach is a gut-wrenching process, often turning into a tug-of-war between the program builder and the program itself. Messy exits have followed, from Joe Paterno to Bobby Bowden to Mack Brown, each for their own separate and very distinctive reasons.
Beamer observed each one, and vowed they would be different. While questions circled around their fate in their last several years as coach, Virginia Tech allowed Beamer the time to make the call on their own retirement. Athletic director Whit Babcock felt they owed that much to the man who built something at Virginia Tech from nothing.
So on the first day of November 2015, Beamer called it a career. They did it with the class and dignity that have become their hallmark. When Babcock decided on Fuente, they felt they found a kindred spirit to Beamer, a coach with a similar work ethic, values and goals. Fuente had no interest in running from the past. They wanted Beamer right alongside him, a proud reminder of all that is possible in Blacksburg.

“It just speaks to the kind of people that Coach Beamer and Coach Fuente are,” fullback Sam Rogers said. “It's not like we were going for two drastically different types of people. You go from a blue collar coach in Coach Beamer to another blue collar coach in Coach Fuente. You have the same foundation there, so it makes the transition easier.”
Fuente has proven that just about every day. The locker room has been renamed in Beamer's honor. Fuente decided to choose one special teams player every week to wear Beamer's No. 25 as a tribute to him. Beamer has been visible at home games this season, and has an open invitation to attend practice.
Just last week, Beamer addressed the team before its regular-season finale against rival Virginia. When they walked in the room, they got a standing ovation.
“I didn't think there was anybody on the planet that knew more about beating Virginia than they did, so I felt like we needed all the resources possible,” Fuente said. “I felt like the kids would enjoy it. You know, they miss him, and they have a tremendous amount of respect for him, as I do, and when they walked in the room and they all gave them a standing ovation, I got a little glimpse of the respect they have for him.”
Fuente and Beamer had no relationship before Fuente came to Blacksburg, other than a tangential one: Fuente attended Murray State, where Beamer coached before they arrived at Virginia Tech. But they hit it off from the moment they met. To further add to the good will and bridge the eras, Fuente decided to retain longtime defensive coordinator Bud Foster, who worked alongside Beamer for 29 seasons.
That decision is a big reason why Virginia Tech is back in the ACC championship game for the first time since 2011, a game that came to symbolize the Hokies' dominance in the Coastal Division. Since Virginia Tech joined the ACC in 2004, no coach has won more division titles than Beamer (five).
But to get there, Fuente also needed buy-in from their players. When they addressed their team for the first time, they spoke to an entire room full of players who committed to play for Beamer.
“All the players, we all bought in to what Coach Fuente brought to the table,” linebacker Tremaine Edmunds said. “From Day 1, we've been working hard, coming out each and every day with the same mind-set to get better. I feel like all the players bought in, listened to what they had to say and worked hard every day.”
Edmunds and their older brothers all signed under Beamer, one of 25 sets of brothers to play for the coach. When they see Beamer around, Edmunds said, “It's definitely still nice. Whenever he's around, they get their respect from the players, all the coaches and all the fans. Coach Beamer is always at home here.”
For Beamer, that means more than anything.
“I was just pleased Justin wanted to include me,” Beamer said. “My thoughts would be to stay away and get out of your way but they said the kids want to see you and to come on back. I don't think when you make a change like this it ever goes as smoothly as this one went it. I appreciate Whit Babcock and Justin.”
The appreciation is mutual.
SAN DIEGO (CN) – A teenager sued MySpace and its former owner News Corp., saying they allowed video and photos of their rape and sexual assault to be posted on the social networking website.
The girl, who was 14 when they say they were raped, says MySpace and News Corp. “had actual knowledge that users of the MySpace website were capable of posting nude and/or pornographic images of minors without restrictions or oversight in place, and had actual knowledge of users posting such images.”
They say they were raped and sexually assaulted by defendant Christopher Stewart, then 17, during a party at a San Diego apartment complex on June 10, 2007. They say Stewart “viciously, violently, and without consent, raped and sexually assaulted” them when they were unconscious after they “was unwillingly and uninvitingly given a drug placed in a drink.” And they say Stewart's friend, co-defendant Christopher Dietrich, took photographs and video of the rape.
The plaintiff, R.P., says Dietrich uploaded and posted the images and video of their rape on the Internet, including on MySpace, “along with insulting, derogatory, and malicious comments calculated to cause humiliation, embarrassment, and psychological and emotional injury and harm.”
R.P.'s Superior Court complaint says that Stewart and Dietrich were convicted of criminal sex crimes.
R.P. says MySpace and News Corp failed to “adequately implement procedures, technologies, oversight, regulations, or restrictions in order to protect minors from publication of photographic and videographic images of their nude bodies and genitalia and/or their participation in, whether through force or consent, illicit sexual activity.”
They say the companies negligently allowed Dietrich “to use MySpace's services for the uploading, downloading, and large-scale distribution of child pornography, including nude pictures of plaintiff at or around the time they had been raped and sexually assaulted, through its servers without oversight or intervention because it was profitable to do so.”
They also sued National Public Safety Security Services, which handled security at the Mariposa Apartments. They claim National “did not take an reasonable or appropriate measures to curtail the criminal and potentially dangerous activities of persons attending the party” when its security guard did not notify police of the party attended by 80 to 100 “intoxicated/and or drugged” teen-agers.
They also sued First Avenue Venture, which managed the apartments, claiming it “acted negligently by acting and/or failing to act in hiring a competent and professional security company to protect the safety and well-being of its tenants and guests from activities of persons present of the grounds of the Mariposa Apartment complex.”
R.P. says they “suffered bruises and abrasions, was otherwise physically hurt and humiliated, and sustained injuries to their health, strength, self-esteem, well-being, activity, nervous system, and person, all of which have caused and continue to cause plaintiff great mental, physical, and nervous pain and suffering.”
Also named as defendants are the parents of Christopher Stewart and Christopher Dietrich.
R.P. seeks punitive damages for sexual battery, emotional distress and negligence.  They are represented by David Anderson and Steven Hillyard, both of San Francisco.

It's a big season for Andre Drummond, with huge improvements needed on both sides of the ball. I've written a lot of words and posted a lot of clips about the offensive side, but have generally just alluded to the issues on the defensive end. Let's change that.
It's generally not that easy to do a comprehensive analysis of a player on the defensive end. There are so many important aspects to that side of the ball and us amateurs watching it from the office chair can't know about what the various assignments are on any given play.
But with Drummond, it's relatively easy. Especially since their big man counterpart of Aron Baynes was around to provide a stark contrast as to what Stan Van Gundy is looking for out of their big man.
I tell you friends, watching Drummond brick a million post ups pales in comparison to watching an entire season's worth of plays from them on the defensive end. It was rough.
The numbers have always been a contrast of extremes for Drummond, allowing fans to draw the conclusion that feels best. You can get the warm fuzzies from their league the best defensive rating by Basketball Reference's calcuation, their defensive box score plus-minus, or their defensive win shares. Or you could be appaled by their opponent field goal percentage, defensive real plus-minus, or NBA Stats' calculation of their defensive rating.
The general takeaway is that Drummond does some great things on the box score stats, like rebounding, steals, and, to a lesser extent, blocked shots. But opposing teams' offenses are far better with Drummond on the court, and they do a poor job defending their man. This isn't going to be a stats-heavy breakdown, it's going to be a video-heavy breakdown. Eye testers, rejoice. (But not too hard, all of these observations are backed up with a quantitative basis. So there.)
Typically when we talk about Drummond's issues on defense, we fall into a bunch of banal generalities. Poor effort, bad recognition, lousy decision-making. Unfortunately, these generalities are actually accurate.
In guarding their man, several issues were maddeningly consistent with Drummond last year.
First, their close outs. Too often he'd fail to effectively challenge shots, seeming to just go through the motions of getting a hand up but really only providing token resistence. And to make it worse, it's not like they made up for it by keeping their man from the basket, as they were regularly burned to the hoop on closeout attempts.
Second, they showed lousy awareness both on the ball and as a help defender. It's easy to set this down at the feet of their teammates, but the problem was generally Drummond. This was one of those spots where it was helpful having Baynes around, demonstrating that on plays that assignments broke down really were usually caused by Dre.
Third, those gambles. Surely they can't all be green-lighted by Stan Van Gundy. Drummond has great hands for a big man and does pull off an impressive number of steals. But last year, the risks they took to rack them up were nowhere near the rewards.
Challenging shots
When folks talk about Drummond's effort on the court last season, this is where it's at. As Stan Van Gundy has said about what it takes for Drummond's defense to improve, “It's effort and focus and really taking it to heart to do that. There's not much more to it."
Here's an example guarding Marc Gasol.
Drummond is in position, they look ready to defend. But they don't have a dang hand up. Gasol nearly has the ball released and both of Drummond's hands are below Gasol's hips. When you watch the play in real time, it looks like Drummond gives it a good challenge. But the frame is damning. Drummond was just going through the motions.
Gasol was getting a practice shot look from 10 feet. They went on to drop 38 points on 14-17 shooting in that game.
You see the same thing here against Nikola Vucevic.
Vucevic is able to just jab their way into an extremely open look and Drummond has their hands again below their waist while Vuc nearly has the shot completed. Drummond looks to have challenged the shot, but it's already in the air by the time they actually do.
Andre Drummond is 6'11 with a 7'6 wingspan and excellent quickness. There's no reason players should be able to get looks like that against him.
This is what good defense looks like in that situation.
Some of it is bad mechanics, but the bigger issue here goes back to SVG's words. Check out what Brook Lopez does to them and consider Drummond's effort, focus, and taking defense to heart on these plays.
Brook Lopez dropped 34 points on the Pistons and got the Nets one of their 20 wins of the season in pretty easy order. On each one of those plays, Drummond seems to be going half-speed and just basically seems to be present - not actually offering locked in defense.
The particularly frustrating thing is that Drummond is capable. Like this possession:
Drummond gets a hand up to take away the jumper, is physical, keeps their hands active, and finishes the play to the end. If Drummond played like that every possession, he'd be a Defensive Player of the Year candidate.
Unfortunately, that was one of the lone examples of good defense from Drummond on the night. But it really does seem to be a matter of effort, of locking in and deciding to play tough defense.
There were times when things got pretty galling.
Aye.
And it'd be one thing if they were at least shutting down the drive. But Drummond would regularly get burned with ease when closing out their man.
Just bad all around.
Awareness
This may be the toughest part of a defense to critique since it's impossible for an observer to know what the player is being instructed to do. But there are some parts that are pretty obvious.
Take this play, for instance:
That's Andrew Harrison running the pick and roll. Andrew Harrison was a rookie who shot 32 percent last season. Marc Gasol averaged 19.5 points per game. It's safe to assume the gameplan wasn't to double-team Andrew Harrison in favor of leaving Marc Gasol wide open. (Editor's note: My favorite part of this play is Andre THROWING Ish at Marc Gasol, like Ish can challenge a shot from a seven-footer)
Plus Ish Smith didn't even need Drummond's help. Harrison declined the screen and Ish was able to keep in front of Harrison. If you find your defense looking like this, something went wrong.
Drummond also had a habit of ducking screens, which left them woefully out of position. It bit them hard here.
But also, Drummond should have been able to read the situation. With DeAndre Jordan set up on the baseline and J.J. Redick coming over to set the screen, it was a pretty obvious playcall to get Jordan a touch early in the game. Not to mention, Blake Griffin was staring Jordan down all the way. Drummond's lack of awareness and unwillingness to be physical allowed a 6'2, 190 pound guy to take them out of the play. That's a problem.
It was a problem that allowed savvy offensive players to take advantage of them all season.
Marcin Gortat had a true shooting percentage of 61 percent and an offensive rating of 136 (!) in their three games against the Pistons last season. Robin Lopez's true shooting percentage was five points above their season average against the Pistons.
It was also an issue with their team defense.
This is where it gets into the gray area though. Perhaps the gameplan in the first clip was to bring help when Jimmy Butler drives. But they can't just leave their assignment completely alone with no one available to rotate. Their over-commitment to Butler made for an easy read and easy two points.
Perhaps if they were blocking three shots per game, it'd be forgivable. But Drummond isn't blocking three shots per game.
In the Gobert clip, they again fail to recognize the bigger threat. Joe Ingles doesn't take a lot of shots, only eight per 36 minutes. The goal of an Ingles-Rudy Gobert pick and roll is to get Gobert on the cut. Drummond provides absolutely no value with their defense on that play. Marcus Morris recovered on the screen to get back to Ingles and Drummond again leaves their assignment completely unguarded.
I don't even know what's happening on this one.
Yeah, it's tough on a big man to defend the pick and roll. But Aron Baynes managed to do it.
I wish that clip showed the setup of the play as well, but Baynes is able to recognize that the ball handler is Boris Diaw - a guy who is going to be looking to pass. Baynes provides just enough of a threat to Diaw to give Tobias Harris a chance to recover while still keeping their commitment to Gobert and break up the play.
Andre Drummond is entering the sixth year of their career. At this point, there's no excuse for these consistent lapses.
Gambles
Drummond finished last season No. 13 in steals in the league. Only Draymond Green had more among big men. Since they first entered the league, he's always had a knack for generating turnovers.
It leads to some fun moments.
Those are great. It's a big part of what can make Drummond so valuable, being a disruptive force on the defensive end and creating transition opportunities.
But there's a difference between being disruptive and reckless. Too often, Drummond fell on the latter side of that line last season.
Drummond's head scratching double teams where he'd just abandon their man unnecessarily to offer an easy score was a fixture in Mike Snyder's High/Low columns.
With their teammates not prepared to rotate, they seemed to be entirely rogue - and entirely a bad idea.
With Drummond's size, speed, and athleticism, risks aren't necessarily a bad thing. But they can't just take themselves out of the play on them.
Drummond very nearly makes the steal. They read the pass right, broke quickly enough. That wasn't a terrible risk. The problem was that when they didn't make the steal, they just gave up on the play. They're both at the three point line when Gasol secures possession. For whatever reason, Drummond continued running to near half court and never re-entered the play. They should have been able to recover and perhaps shut the broken play back down. They just didn't.
Then there were the unreasonable risks.
Drummond was trailing Lopez through the screen, Lopez had better positioning with the pass, and Drummond really never came close for making the steal. The worst part is that if they failed to make the steal, Lopez will have the definite and easy bucket.
A regular issue with their double teams was just the complete neglect of their man.
So the Pistons are triple teaming Victor freaking Oladipo. Ok. That was a thing that happened. When Morris leaves Roberson, they at least has Jon Leuer ready to help close out on the pass and they start making their way back out to their man after the pass. But Drummond acts like he's never seen Steven Adams before. You'd think a seven foot sasquatch with a New Zealand accent would be more memorable, but whatever.
Dominant Drummond defense
There were moments where Drummond was locked in defensively and shined. One of the more memorable games was their absolute domination of Hassan Whiteside.
In their pick and roll defense, they did a good job of keeping their commitment to Whiteside while still being enough of a threat to the ball handler that they forced the pass. Then when the time came to challenge the shot, Drummond did so with explosiveness and effectiveness rather than just going through the motions.
In their post defense, Drummond was physical, stayed with the play throughout, and again made challenging the shot count. That last block, yeah? Whew.
But I'm not sure there was another game all season where Drummond came anywhere close to that sort of play on the defensive end. There were moments here and there, but they were too few and too far between.
***
It's a huge year for Drummond on the offensive end, needing to establish themselves as something more than just an inefficient chucker of bad hooks who'll miss 60-odd percent of their free throws. But their performance on the defensive end may be even more important.
The Pistons lost their best post defensive player over the summer in Aron Baynes. Boban Marjanovic has, of course, been incredibly productive on a per-minute basis, but they had some challenges on defense. It's likely that there'll be some parts on defense that Boban will just inherently struggle with due to their stature.
The Pistons really need Drummond to be a good defensive player. Not just an adequate one. But an actually good one.
That will be a huge flip on last season from Drummond. Make no mistake, they were a legitimate trainwreck defensively last year. These clips aren't just cherry-picked. Cue up any game from last season and you'll see examples. As much as their offense will require a huge change in mentality, seeing themselves as a finisher rather than a guy who you feed for a post up, their defense will take just as much of a change.
It's part of what continues to keep Drummond as such a tantalizing player. The physical tools are all there. There are some aspects of their game that are extremely dynamic. But as a whole, Drummond was just awful defensively.
And it's nearly impossible to predict whether Drummond has improvement in store. Yes, it's as easy as them just committing. But no, we've seen no indication that he's willing to make that commitment. Maybe that nose thing? Maybe. Probably not.
All we can do is see how they come out next season. But how do we know if their defense is improved next year, you ask? After all, those defensive statistics can be a bit tough to draw decisive conclusions from.
Well, an easy thing to follow will be whether the opposing center is leaving the building with 30 points or shooting 60-70 percent from the field. That was the case far too often last season. If it continues into next season, it'll be decision time for Stan Van Gundy.
Today is International Men's Day, a holiday that's been 95% co-opted by concern-troll MRAs who believe that the solution to all the trauma men suffer under patriarchy is more of the toxic, regressive ideas which caused that trauma in the first place.

But.
2017 is my year of yielding nothing to POS men, and just because a bunch of gross misogynists want to make this Confirmation Bias Day doesn't mean it can't be wielded for some positive change . While my feminism is unapologetically women-first, and while patriarchy hurts women the most, men are also deeply wounded by it. This is a system which teaches them to hate any empathetic or vulnerable part of themselves, and which insists they perform the most toxic version of themselves to survive. That message is damaging.
Because our culture pushes a lot of disturbing messages about masculinity, it's important to help men recognize that poison when it's slung at them. If they're able to do that, then instead of internalizing that poison and pushing their rage back on women, they'll be better equipped to know trash when they see it and reject it.
Below are just a few resources that either I or my male friends have found helpful. None is perfect, but I think they all provide a solid starting point for having feminist conversations about manhood and masculinity – conversations that affirm men's emotions and vulnerability while still giving them the tools to be better to the people around them and make a less patriarchal world.
Because, as Aaron Gillies so aptly summed up on Twitter:
#InternationalMensDay is about helping other men find voices, or just letting them know they aren't alone, not for you to go on a Facebook rant because you're still not over ghostbusters being women Kevin. — TechnicallyRon (@TechnicallyRon) November 19, 2017

Saturday will be a day for the math books, no matter which way you slice it.
For the first time in 100 years, Pi Day will fall on 3/14/15, matching up with the first five numbers that represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, 3.1415.
Going deeper, at 9:26:53 a.m. — and again at night — the day will represent the first 10 digits of the mathematical constant, bringing much merriment to members of the math community.

“It's the Pi Day of the century,” said Michael Breen, public awareness officer at the American Mathematical Society, in Providence. “There's a lot going on to celebrate.”

Tom Gaudette, principal academic evangelist at MathWorks in Natick, said pi reigns supreme among the mathematical constants.
“That's because everybody has to learn about pi,” they said. “You don't have to learn about the other constants. Everyone learns to calculate the circumference of a circle before graduating from high school.”
That, and it's a good excuse to eat baked goods, which also happen to be circular. “It's humorous, it's a lot of fun, and people obviously enjoy eating pie,” they said. “For me, next year won't be as important.”
The serendipitous date has led to officials at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology timing the release of student acceptance notifications to go live on the school's admissions website right when the clock strikes 9:26 Saturday morning.

“Pi is a great number, for many reasons. It is a mathematical constant that occurs in many different scientific applications, and it is a homophone for something that is delicious,” said Stu Schmill, dean of admissions at the school. “Pi day falls at a nice time of year, as spring approaches and we are ready to celebrate.”
At Harvard University, students from the Harvard Undergraduate Mathematics Association, or HUMA, did some celebrating of their own to ring in “the most endlessly awesome number in the world.”
On Friday, a day prior to the unofficial holiday, members planned to gather for a pie-eating contest, and also compete to see who can recite the most numbers of pi from memory.
“I'm definitely really excited! This might be the only ‘real' Pi Day that I and other current Harvard undergrads will see in our lifetime,” said Cherie Hu, vice president of HUMA.
The group has been holding Pi Day events for the past two years, attracting the attention of undergraduates, graduate students, and professors for a single cause — something that is as rare as the date itself.

“The day has been a great way to bring together the . . . Harvard undergraduate community at large,” they said.
Mark Lemay, 26, who runs the Math for People group in Cambridge, has also made plans.
“A few of us will meet up and talk about pi, and probably bring some appropriate snacks,” they said. “It's always nice to have an excuse to eat food and talk about math.”
Others see it as a good way to promote the importance of math and geometry with a bit of fun baked in.
Michael Weiss, a retired math teacher who used to work at Bishop Fenwick High School in Peabody, said they and their wife are baking a pie and will top it off with crust shaped like the Greek letter used to signify pi.
“This pi day is . . . kind of an opportunity to have some fun with math,” they said. “It's pretty neat because it isn't going to happen again for another 100 years.”

Baloch protests outside the UN highlight human rights violations by Pakistan.
Highlights India accused Pak of human rights violations in Balochistan, PoK "Pak is characterised by authoritarianism": India at UN meet in Geneva Pakistan had approached the UN body over the unrest in Kashmir
India has strongly raised human rights violations in Balochistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva. Pakistan had approached the UN body over the unrest in Kashmir.In a hard-hitting response, India said on Wednesday: "Pakistan is characterised by authoritarianism, absence of democratic norms and widespread human rights violations across the country including Balochistan."India's ambassador to the UN, Ajit Kumar, also called Pakistan a hub for the global export of terror, saying it continues to be in illegal occupation of a large part of territory in Jammu and Kashmir."Instead of ritually raking up alleged human rights violations elsewhere, Pakistan should focus its energies on improving human rights situation within Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir," said the ambassador.Rejecting what they called Pakistan's continued misuse of the forum to make tendentious references about internal matters of Jammu and Kashmir, Mr Kumar said: "This stems from Pakistan's territorial ambitions over Kashmir that has found concrete expression in repeated armed aggressions."On Tuesday, India had emphatically rejected the UN human rights chief's call to allow an international mission to visit Kashmir. New Delhi said that the crisis in Kashmir was triggered by the death of "a self-acknowledged commander of the terrorist organization Hizbul Mujahideen" and was aggravated by sustained cross-border terror from Pakistan. Over 80 people have died and more than 10,000 injured in clashes between protesters and security forces following the killing of Hizbul terrorist Burhan Wani by security forces on July 8.
The reconciliation bill makes numerous revisions to many of the central provisions in the measure adopted by the Senate on Dec. 24, including changes in the levels of subsidies that will help moderate-income Americans afford private insurance, as well as changes to the increase in the Medicare payroll tax that will take effect in 2013 and help pay for the legislation.
The bill also delays the start of a new tax on high-cost employer-sponsored insurance policies to 2018 and raises the thresholds at which policies are hit by the tax, reflecting a deal struck by the White House and organized labor leaders. It also includes changes to close the gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage known as the doughnut hole, and to clarify a provision requiring insurers to allow adult children to remain on their parents' insurance policies until their 26th birthday.

Many of the changes were intended to address the concerns of House Democrats, as well as to bridge differences between the original House and Senate bills and to incorporate additional provisions sought by Mr. Obama.
The bill also included a broad restructuring of federal student loan programs, a centerpiece of Mr. Obama's education agenda.
As the Senate voted, Mr. Obama was in Iowa City where they opened an aggressive public relations blitz to sell the health care overhaul with a campaign-style rally at the University of Iowa Field House.
Speaking to a crowd of about 3,000 Mr. Obama dared Republicans to follow through on their efforts to repeal the legislation, which would require them to win back big enough majorities in Congress to override their veto.
“My attitude is, go for it!” Mr. Obama declared, warning Republicans that they are eager to take them on this fall. “If these members of congress in Washington want to come here to Iowa and tell small-business owners that they plan to take away their tax credits and essentially raise their taxes, be my guest.”

It was in Iowa City that Mr. Obama first laid out detailed plans for “affordable, universal health care in America” as a presidential candidate in May 2007. When they delivered that speech, they were facing criticism for lacking substance; their proposal made policy analysts sit up and take notice.
“Because of you,” Mr. Obama told the crowd, “this is the place where change began.”
The Senate voted after running through an obstacle course of Republican amendments and procedural objections, which kept lawmakers working through Wednesday night until 3:30 a.m. Thursday.
Republicans, raising procedural challenges, identified small flaws that struck out two minor provisions. Those changes forced the bill to be sent back to the House one more time.

The Senate approved the measure shortly after 2 p.m. Senators cast their votes standing individually at their desks, a ceremonial gesture reserved for historic occasions.
Three Democrats opposed the measure, Senators Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Ben Nelson of Nebraska. Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, was ill and did not vote.
With both sides girding for a last round of parliamentary challenges, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. arrived in the chamber to preside over the session in their role as president of the Senate. Mr. Biden served for 36 years as a senator from Delaware, making them intimately familiar with the chamber, its rules and precedents, and the main combatants on the floor.

As Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, formally made the procedural challenges, Mr. Biden twice replied, “The point of order is sustained.” Then they added, “Both provisions are stricken.”
Once the roll call was completed, Mr. Biden declared, “The bill as amended is passed.”
The vote came after Senate Democrats defeated more than 40 Republican amendments intended to delay or derail the legislation, including proposals related to insurance coverage of erectile dysfunction drugs for convicted sex offenders, the legality of same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia, and gun rights.
The provisions struck out were minor. One sought to prevent any annual decrease in the maximum amount of Pell grants for students from low-income families; the other was technical.

Exuberant Democrats celebrated the vote in the corridors of the Capitol. Republicans, reacting somberly, said they would carry their opposition to the bill into the fall campaign, in an effort to win back majorities in Congress and repeal the measure.
In a floor speech, the House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, derided the legislation as “a sloppy mess that the majority of the American people believe should be repealed and replaced.” They added, “We're going to have to come back and fix this bill time and time again.”
Although the bulk of the Democrats' overhaul was already the law of the land, the passage of the final revisions fulfilled a promise that Mr. Reid made to rank-and-file House Democrats before they took up the Senate version of the health care legislation and approved it Sunday night, 219 to 212.
Frequently Asked Questions#
AB 1045 (Chapter 532, Statutes of 2005) revised the Payers' Bill of Rights, which were established by AB 1627 (Chapter 582, Statutes of 2003) and located in California Health and Safety Code 1339.50 to 1339.59. The replies to the following FAQs are based on our interpretation of the revised statutory requirements and/or the adopted regulations.
1. What is the purpose of submitting pricing inforation?#
The purposes of this bill are to provide patients, health plans and healthcare purchasers with more information about charges for hospital care; and to discourage hospitals from establishing charges that adversely affect private payers and patients.
2. What information is required to be made publicly available on location?#
Beginning July 1, 2004, each hospital is required to make a written or electronic copy of its charge description master (chargemaster) available on location. A hospital may elect to have an electronic or written copy available or to post a copy on its Internet website. Hospitals designated as “small and rural” according to Section 124840 of the Health and Safety Code are exempt from this requirement.
Each hospital that is required to make its chargemaster available must also post a clear and conspicuous notice about its availability in its emergency department, admissions office, and billing office.
Also beginning July 1, 2004, each hospital was required to provide a copy of its list of 25 commonly charged services or procedures to any person upon request. The passage of AB 1045 repeals this requirement on December 31, 2005.
Beginning January 1, 2006, each hospital is now required to provide a list of charges for 25 common outpatient procedures and common inpatient procedures grouped my Medicare DRG. The DRG list is to be determined and provided by OSHPD to each hospital.
Also beginning January 1, 2006, each hospital is required to provide upon request a written estimate of the amount the hospital will require an uninsured person to pay for hospital services that are reasonably expected to be provided, based on average length of stay and services provided for the person's diagnosis. Estimates are not required for emergency services. Each hospital is also required to provide information about the hospital's financial assistance and charity care policies to uninsured patients, along with contact information for a hospital representative, to obtain more information about these policies.
3. What information is required to be filed with OSHPD? How often?#
The Payers' Bill of Rights currently requires each hospital to annually submit three documents to OSHPD regarding its prices:
A copy of its chargemaster.
A list of average charges for 25 common outpatient procedures.
The calculated estimate, along with supporting documentation, of the percentage change in gross revenue (charges) due to price changes. The gross revenue percentage estimate must be submitted along with the other two documents beginning July 1, 2006, and every July 1 thereafter. The reason for the one-year delay is because the estimate is to be based on the 12-month period beginning with the effective date of the last chargemaster filed with OSHPD.
AB 1045 modifies these requirements by replacing the list of 25 services or procedures commonly charged to patients with a list of charges for 25 common outpatients procedures.
4. Can we request an extension?#
The law does not provide OSHPD with the authority to grant an extension.
AB 1045 added the provision that a hospital may be liable for a $100 per day civil penalty if it does not file the required information to OSHPD.
5. Are all hospitals required to submit this information?#
Every general acute care hospital, psychiatric acute hospital, and special hospital licensed under Section 1250 (a), (b) and (f), respectively, is required to file these reports. Only health facilities licensed as a Chemical Dependency Recovery Hospital or Psychiatric Health Facility are exempt.
Hospitals that do not provide outpatient services are exempt from submitting the list of 25 common outpatient procedures. OSHPD will review submitted annual financial disclosure reports as confirmation.
6. Is a rural hospital required to submit its chargemaster to OSHPD?#
Yes. All rural hospitals are required to submit the required pricing information to OSHPD. However, a hospital defined as “small and rural” according to Section 124840 of the Health and Safety Code is exempt from making a written or electronic copy of its chargemaster available at the hospital's location or posting a copy on the hospital's Internet website.
7. Is there a penalty for non-submission?#
Yes. AB 1045 adds the provision that a hospital may be liable for a civil penalty of $100 per day if it does not file the required information to OSHPD.
8. What is the required method of submission?#
Documents must be submitted by e-mail to a designated e-mail address or by mail on CD. Submission by e-mail is preferred.
9. Are there any restrictions to file types that can be sent?#
Yes. File types are restricted in order to facilitate processing, handling, and analysis. Acceptable file types include Microsoft Excel (.xls) and Comma Separated Value (.csv).
Note: Hospitals using Microsoft Excel may submit all required items in a single file, as long as each item is placed in a separate worksheet tab.
10. Where should we send our chargemaster and other documents?#
E-mail: Chargemaster
Mail CDs to:
Harry Dhami
Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development
Accounting and Reporting Systems Section
2020 West El Camino Avenue, Suite 1100
Sacramento, CA 95833
Note: To help OSHPD keep track of submitted files, it is advisable that a cover letter accompany the submitted files, identifying by filename the contents of that file. Descriptive filenames would also help.
11. Our chargemaster exceeds the maximum allowable rows (65,536) provided in Microsoft Excel. Can we submit two files or should we create two worksheets within the same file?#
It would be preferable to submit multiple worksheets within a single file.
12. Can submit electronic files be compressed (zipped)? Is there a maximum file size limit for e-mail submission?#
Yes to both questions. If files are too large to be sent as e-mail attachments, they may be zipped. If e-mail with attachments exceeds 10Mb, documents must be submitted on CD. Documents submitted on CD may also be zipped.
13. Can a hospital submit hardcopy documents?#
No. Hardcopy reports will not be accepted.
14. A typical chargemaster includes detailed information, such as charge codes, General Ledger codes, billing descriptions, revenue codes, billing codes, CPT/HCPCS codes, RVS codes, modifiers, and multiple prices. Are there any requirements on the specific chargemaster items to be included?#
No. OSHPD does not have authority to specify which chargemaster items are to be made available on location or reported to OSHPD. However, it is expected that the reported items and effective pricing date of both chargemasters would be the same. Each hospital will have to make that determination based on the statutory definition provided below:
“Charge description master” means a uniform schedule of charges represented by the hospital as its gross billed charge for a given service or item, regardless of payer type.
15. What should be included in the list of 25 common outpatient procedures required by AB 1045? Is there a required format (report layout) that must be used?#
Each hospital can choose which 25 outpatient procedures to include on its list. Reported items do not necessarily have to be the most common outpatient procedures. It is expected that a combination of ambulatory surgical procedures, outpatient diagnostic procedures, and outpatient therapeutic procedures will be reported.
There is not a specified report format, but it is expected that each procedure listed would include at least a description of the procedure and its related charge.
OSHPD has developed an Excel form for submitting the average charge for 25 common outpatient procedures. Use of the OSHPD form is voluntary, but encouraged. The form contains 50 common outpatient procedures, separated into sections according to CPT code classification. Hospitals must report the average charge for at least 25 procedures to comply with AB 1045, but may report charges for more than 25 procedures. To help hospitals meet the minimum 25 procedure requirements, the average charge for up to 10 unlisted procedures may be reported.
If a hospital location operating under a consolidated license has a different chargemaster than the other location(s) operating under that same license, it is expected that a separate chargemaster and set of documents would be filed for that hospital location. Additionally, it is expected that a separate list of 25 common outpatient procedures would be submitted.
17. Our hospital has separate chargemasters for inpatient acute care services and outpatient clinical services. Do we have to submit the chargemaster for the outpatient clinical services?#
Yes. All services that are provided under the hospital's general acute care license should be reported. If you are unable to combine the chargemasters into a single document, you may file them separately. If you are using Microsoft Excel, you may submit each chargemaster as a separate worksheet in the same document.
18. What are the reporting requirements to OSHPD when separately licensed hospitals share a common chargemaster?#
Each separately licensed hospital is required to file a separate chargemaster and set of documents to OSHPD. While the chargemaster could be the same for both facilities, you should delete any service, good, or procedure that is not provided at a particular hospital. Further, it is expected that the list of 25 outpatient procedures and the gross revenue percentage calculation would be different.
19. How should pharmaceuticals be reported if these items are formula-driven and the pharmaceutical items and/or prices do not appear separately in the chargemaster?#
All items for which a charge is made are to be included in the chargemaster filed with OSHPD. This may require you to manually enter the average wholesale price plus mark-up for each item as of June 1. Submitting pharmaceutical items in a separate file is allowed; or if you are using Microsoft Excel, as a separate worksheet within the same file.
No. Chargemasters are to be submitted annually every July 1, beginning in 2005, even though it is acknowledged that they are frequently updated.
21. Can I obtain a copy of another hospital's chargemaster from OSHPD?#
Yes, chargemasters and related pricing information are available on-line. Also available is a CD/DVD product that contains submitted documents for all hospitals for a reporting year.
Contact OSHPD's Healthcare Information Resource Center (HIRC) at (916) 326-3802 or E-mail: HIRC for more information.
22. What are the chargemaster reporting requirements when a hospital changes licensure (ownership) during the year?#
The licensee operating the hospital on June 1 is responsible for meeting the July 1 chargemaster reporting requirements for that calendar year.
Each hospital is required to submit the prices in effect on June 1 for the chargemaster, the list of charges for 25 common outpatient procedures, and the calculated estimate of percentage change in gross revenue that are due on July 1.

24. AB 1045 requires OSHPD to establish a statewide list of the 25 most commonly performed inpatient DRGs and to develop a list of each hospital's average charges for applicable DRGs. AB 1045 also requires each hospital to provide this list to any person upon request. How do we obtain this information?#
OSHPD has developed a downloadable Excel pivot table called Statewide Benchmark Top 25 DRGs that meets this requirement using the patient-level data submitted by each hospital for each inpatient discharge. OSHPD will annually update this product.
25. Our chargemaster contains blank prices for several items because some items are not charged to patients, some are used for statistical counting purposes, and others are no longer provided. How should this be reported to OSHPD?#
It is recommended that you indicate why prices are not reported for each blank item, or else it may be assumed that there is no charge. Reasons can be included on the chargemaster or in a cover letter.
You can contact the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) at the local district office in the county where the hospital is located. Phone numbers for CDPH can be obtained on their Licensing and Certification Program.
27. Are hospitals required to provide a written estimate for healthcare services, procedures and supplies at the request of patients who have no healthcare coverage?#
Yes, According to the Payers' Bill of Rights, a hospital must provide a written estimate of the amount the hospital will require the patient to pay for healthcare services, procedures, and supplies that are reasonably expected to be provided to the patient by the hospital. A hospital must also provide information and/or applications about financial assistance or charity care to patients that requested an estimate and contact information for a hospital employee or office from which the patient can obtain the information. If a hospital does not comply with this provision, a patient may contact the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) at the local district office in the county where the hospital is located. Phone numbers for CDPH can be obtained on their Licensing and Certification Program.
The Vikings and their fanbase always love a chance to troll the rival Packers, and not even the relationship of Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Olivia Munn is safe.
Rodgers and Munn broke up in April after three years of dating, which likely ended their support of the Packers.
Enter comedian and fellow actor Nick Swardson, a Minneapolis native who couldn't miss an opportunity to sneakily take a jab at Rodgers and the Packers.
Naturally, the internet caught wind of the picture, which prompted some hilarious reactions.
Even the Vikings' official account got in on the fun, telling Munn they are welcome to their games anytime.
There's always a seat open for you at our stadium, @NickSwardson and @OliviaMunn.

Beijing is not a city where you expect to hear about someone being shot dead, but that's what happened last night when a man took a security guard hostage at knifepoint inside Subway Line 10′s Hujialou station. According to Beijing TV this morning, the incident began just after 9 pm (UPDATE: “around 8:30 pm,” according to the reporter in the above video). Police were called in and tried negotiating for 70 minutes. When that failed, a sniper took out the man, and the hostage was freed.
In the above, you can clearly see the hostage-taker, a man in a suit and glasses. You can watch police position themselves, and glimpse the sniper rifle eventually used to end the standoff.
The Beijinger has this story as well, with pictures from QQ, along with translations of netizen comments from Weibo. “The guy who got shot is the abandoned child of society,” says one. “Women should all work in offices,” says another. (The Internet for you, in a nutshell.) You can join the conversation here if you'd like (1,000-plus comments so far).
After the jump, there's a video taken by a citizen journalist shortly after this incident happened. You can't really see anything, but they do point out that a lot of cops were in the area.
UPDATE, 7/21, 8:43 pm: New video here; we still don't know what the hostage-taker's demands were though.

Our devolving culture is disaggregating into its origin slime so rapidly it's hard to distinguish parody from reality anymore. Behold:
Do not adjust your vertical or horizontal. What you are seeing is real. It's an Obamacare ad campaign, currently appearing in Colorado (which means Coloradan taxpayers may be funding this flagrant farce). As an astute reader noted, advertising can be pretty creative when there's only one choice on the menu.
Just when you think you've got a handle on how low the US elite can go catering to the orc and pork armies, a new shit pit is excavated. Ponder the above.
– Ebonics website URL (doyougotinsurance.com? what's next? muhfugginfreeshit.com?)
– Fat ass chick crushing their giant pink ball. This is the new rotund normal, you'd better embrace it, fucknozzle. I don't care if your hands can't reach past their second belly fold.
– The dispensing with any pretense that Obamacare is about anything other than a money spigot that no one (worth caring about) has to pay for.
– The ankle tattoos. Is that a “Z”? Did Zorro rapier their snatch and leave their calling card?
– Gotta love the wine and exercise juxtaposition. Yeah, that's how you want to work out… drunk.
– Success in life is measured by how many good bottles of wine you can score.
– The whole scene is meant to evoke the livin' LARGE lifestyle of the modern SWPL brunch-scarfing, egg-dying, government-idolizing liberal tart. I think the fat one is shitting Shonda Rhimes.
– Dat manjaw on the left one. In case you forgot that testosterone-charged women are now running the show… into the ground.
– Ali and Caitlin are not sweatin' it, because women were not put on this earth to worry about how they'll pay for all their nice shit. Who are you, some misogynist who wants to stop giving women freebies? *squaawk* War on women!
You want to rebuke the ruling class for assuming the average American woman is an idiot, but then they have a point. This is our culture now, and the lords of lies are merely speaking the primitive language of their degraded subjects.
Another one:
Why do ads that, by any reasonable suspicion, seem primarily aimed at the problems of minorities, feature white people? CYA? Revised expectations? Or is it that our new healthcare overlords know they need white people on board, because who else is gonna fund this free lunch extravaganza? We're living in a banksters paradise, and you're the sucker.
“OMG, he's hot!”
OMG, the country is going bankrupt.
“Let's hope he's as easy to get as this birth control.”
Because men are hard to entice with sexual favors. 🙄
“My health insurance covers the pill, which means all I have to worry about is getting them between the covers.”
Slut pride. Daddy's little girl is all growed up. The disclaimer is a riot. What's this “common sense” they speak of? Not sleeping with every man who will dump a quickly forgotten fuck in her? Talk about a fine print buzzkill.
“Susie & Nate, Hot to Trot”

Hold on… I'm getting an image in my head… a picture is forming… a picture of America in 2013. Ah, here it is:
Put them down.
In these volatile times it helps to have role models to steer you through economic uncertainty, wise investors who you can look to when your faith in markets is shattered. And that sort of wisdom is hard to find right now, what with John Paulson continuing to trip over their own feet and George Soros closing up shop / apparently not having the resources to house all of their girlfriends in the manner to which they are accustomed. Fortunately, Roll Call today brings us a new list of investors for you to emulate: the 50 richest members of Congress.
Would you believe that millionaires who are able to direct stimulus funds to their own companies and unconstrained by insider trading laws had a pretty good year in 2010? Then you would be correct. Our 50 richest members of Congress had an average net worth of $32mm, and saw a weighted average growth in their net worth of 17.7% (unweighted 26%).* The S&P was up 12.8%.
Not bad - but if you want to learn from the greats, and not just also-rans, you can break that down a little further. At first glance, it would seem that House Republicans are particularly killing it: almost half of the total top-50 net worth ($792mm) is held by the 22 House Republicans, with an average net worth of $36mm. And their returns are striking - a 41% average return vs. under 5% in the Senate.

But in fact those returns come entirely from the top 2 names on the list, and they each come with an asterisk. Darrell Issa and Michael McCaul accounted for over 100% of the House Republicans' gains in 2010, and it wasn't just from savvy market timing: McCaul seems to have grown their stash via a big transfer from their in-laws, while Issa got theirs in part by hosing minority shareholders in their electronics company. Excluding those two, the House Republicans were down some 4%. You might do better to invest with the Democrats, of whom over 80% were up in 2010, led by Nancy Pelosi's 62% returns.

Sadly this data goes only through the end of 2010 so we don't know who's making money in today's markets. One good guess would be Ron Paul, who didn't make the top-50 cutoff (with single-digit-millions net worth) but who's pleasingly ideologically consistent, with a portfolio consisting pretty much entirely of shares of gold miners. Weirdly no physical metal is reported. We'd be heartbroken if we believed that Ron Paul wasn't hoarding gold ingots in their basement, so we're going to chalk that up to a view that gold is not a discloseable "asset held for investment" but just money.
* There are lots of disclaimers to this data - the reports group asset and liability amounts in broad buckets so these numbers are approximate and overestimate changes; they're valued as of the end of 2010 so some portfolios may be down since then; there's no change in net worth reported for the 13 newly elected members who didn't file 2009 forms; and there's a selection problem where negative returns that bounce you out of the top 50 don't get counted.

This was a vector I did for my Tumblr. I ended up liking it so much that I wanted to post it here too.There are some things that I really like about this. One being the tree in the background. It was entirely on my own (apart from the trunk which I stole from the Library background vector I've got), since there seems to be no pine tree's in Equestria, so I had to wing it, and the result looks great in my opinion. Second being Smarty Pants. I didn't do a Vector trace from the show, which means that the doll was drawn by me, and while it's not the most difficult thing to draw in the world, I really did like how it turned out.Twilight on the other hand... well, I can't draw fillies to save my life, and the vector turned out okay, but there are some things I dislike about it, the Stewie-esque head, their hind hooves in the sitting pose. I guess I'll just have to get better at drawing them.Edit: Im probably going to kill myself with activity, but if anyone's interested, here's my Tumblr: [link] ----The "My Little Pony", "Friendship is Magic" franchises belong to Hasbro and Lauren Faust.
New documents obtained under Freedom of Information Act request show that Scotland Yard kept a secret dossier on various science fiction shows and movies out of a fear that they would cause rioting and cyberattacks. On the list of worrying imports were Star Trek, The X-Files, Roswell, Dark Skies, and Lawnmower Man.
We'll grant you Star Trek and The X-Files, but, seriously, how influential was Dark Skies and it's eighteen episodes, really?

The dossier was called “UFO New Religious Movements and the Millennium” and isn't dated, but the references to the new millennium and the Heaven's Gate cult seem to date it to 1998-1999. The report was honestly worried that TV shows could drive conspiracy theorists to action:
Fuel is added to the fire by television dramas and feature films mostly produced in America. These draw together the various strands of religion, UFOs, conspiracies, and mystic events and put them in an entertaining storyline. ... Obviously this is not sinister in itself, what is of concern is the devotion certain groups and individuals ascribe to the contents of these programmes.

Yes, devotion to a TV show is very dangerous. There might be a convention or a newsgroup. Although it is nice that they were willing to admit that the shows weren't “sinister” in themselves.
A spokesperson for the police said, “We have no knowledge of this.” This is one time we're glad to hear that, rather than that it was something very important.

We have been talking about this paper in PNAS around the lab, so I thought I would share.
Hassabis et al, publishing in PNAS, have shown that patients with hippocampal damage lack the ability to imagine novel situations. This is a truly interesting finding, but it isn't why I want to talk about this paper. Actually, I want to talk about this paper because of how they explain this finding.
To tip my hand a little, Hassabis et al attribute this lack of novel mental imagery to a deficit in spatial context provided by the hippocampus. This would fit squarely in the body of thought that characterizes the function of the hippocampus as associating episodic information with a spatial framework. However, I will argue that this isn't the only way to view the data. But I am getting ahead of myself. Let's start with some background.
Background to the Hippocampus
The hippocampus is a structure in medial temporal lobe that is involved in learning and memory.
We know this because it has been observed in patients such as the canonical HM that if you lose both your hippocampi, you lose the ability to form new memories but have an intact long-term memory. Since this recognition, there has been a constant stream of research into determining what precisely the hippocampus does and how it does it.
Part of the debate about this research has focused on whether the hippocampus encodes new memories in a manner that is fundamentally spatial or whether the hippocampus is more generally associative.
On the side of a spatial function of the hippocampus, hippocampal neurons fire selectively in what are called place fields. Place fields are different portions of space during a task. For example, if you put an electrode into hippocampal neurons of a rat during a task that requires the use of spatial memory, each neuron will fire when the animal is sitting in a particular region in space. It was hypothesized that the set of neurons with different place fields sum together to form a map of the spatial world. The function of the hippocampus under this system is to associate particular contextual cues with points in the spatial map. (This view is exemplified in The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map by O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978.)
There is an alternative view, however. This view holds that the hippocampus does indeed encode spatial information, but it also encodes a wide variety of other information. In this sense, it is a more general associative machine.
Evidence for this view can be found in the funny things that hippocampal neurons do when you modify the context under which it is acting. For example, you can train a rat to seek out a different goal box depending on whether it is hungry or thirsty -- whether it wants food or water. In this sense the internal state of the animal (hunger or thirst) is part of the context that rat uses to know what task to perform. What you find is the particular goal for an activity changes the location of the firing patterns for hippocampal neurons. The internal state modifies place fields. Similarly, hippocampal neurons have been found to fire specifically at the goal arm or the start arm of mazes. They can also show modified patterns of firing depending on the course the rats is taking, suggesting that prospective intention affects their firing rate.
All of these are funky things that happen to place fields that aren't really spatial in the strictest sense. Surely they happen in space, but they seem to represent other axes of information encoded by the hippocampus.
In light of this evidence, we can posit an alternative view of hippocampal function. The hippocampus does indeed associate place with context, but it can also associate context with other things. (This view is reviewed here. Full Disclosure: The review was written by my current boss Matthew Shapiro and one of our graduate students Pam Kennedy.)
I summarize the views above so that you can get a flavor for the debate in the hippocampus community. There are essentially two camps. One side views what the hippocampus does as spatial. The other side views it as partly spatial, but partly something else.
The Paper at Hand
In this context, along comes Hassabis et al who found that people with hippocampal damage (like HM above) have trouble imagining new experiences.
To give you a flavor of the difference between the vividness of the mental imagery in a normal patient and someone with hippocampal damage, here is an excerpt from their interviews with patients (click to enlarge). (The patients are P03 and P05; Control subjects are CON.)
When you read the patient cases, they can see fragments of context like the color blue, but on the whole it is just not happening. They lack coherence. They are not being associated into one experience.
This finding is interesting for a couple of reasons.
The first is that you can extend it to make a statement about how imagination and memory formation are similar. The hippocampus had been associated previously with the formation of new memories. Clearly imaginative thinking has some aspect of it that mechanistically resembles the formation of new memories because they are both lost on lesioning of the hippocampus.
This is not surprising if you think about it because there is a lot of evidence that we construct our reality from sensations available to us. Memories are made; they are not born fully formed. Because reality is constructed, we can be fooled in a variety of predictable ways -- take visual illusions, for instance. Imagination must require a similar construction. Therefore, if the hippocampus is required for encoding new memories, it makes sense that it would be required for imagining novel ones.
The second reason I find this interesting is that the authors cling to the absence of spatial context as the explanation of the problems these patients have visualizing new experiences.
You get the sense of where they are going with this in the abstract:
Amnesic patients have a well established deficit in remembering their past experiences. Surprisingly, however, the question as to whether such patients can imagine new experiences has not been formally addressed to our knowledge. We tested whether a group of amnesic patients with primary damage to the hippocampus bilaterally could construct new imagined experiences in response to short verbal cues that outlined a range of simple commonplace scenarios. Our results revealed that patients were markedly impaired relative to matched control subjects at imagining new experiences. Moreover, we identified a possible source for this deficit. The patients' imagined experiences lacked spatial coherence, consisting instead of fragmented images in the absence of a holistic representation of the environmental setting. The hippocampus, therefore, may make a critical contribution to the creation of new experiences by providing the spatial context into which the disparate elements of an experience can be bound. Given how closely imagined experiences match episodic memories, the absence of this function mediated by the hippocampus, may also fundamentally affect the ability to vividly re-experience the past.
The hippocampus is clearly doing something spatial, and these patients are clearly lacking a spatial context for imagination. The problem that I have with this is that they are lacking in everything else necessary imaging new experiences as well. They don't just suffer an absence of space; they suffer a complete lack of contextual binding to anything. Nothing is cohering together to form a memory. From this perspective, the spatial problem may be an issue but it is largely secondary.
What fascinates me about this paper is that I feel like it is trying to stuff a square peg through a round hole. Surely the hippocampus is doing something spatial, but that isn't all it is doing. Why do these guys insist on viewing it only according to that narrow view?
Anyway, this may be a personal ax to grind because I think that a shift in understanding of hippocampal function is far overdue, but nonetheless I think this a very interesting paper.
Hat-tip: Faculty of 1000.
The 3-1 Buffalo Bills are making a trip to Cincinnati this weekend to face off against the 1-3 Bengals. The Bills are three point underdogs in this one, suggesting that Vegas thinks the game would be even if they played at a neutral field. Are the Bengals better than their record, and how do they match up against Buffalo's roster? Using the All-22 tape, I've scouted the key attributes of Cincinnati's team.
Bengals offense
The Bengals' offense had an abysmal start to the season. Andy Dalton finished the first two games with no passing touchdowns, four interceptions, eight sacks, and 5.97 yards per attempt. The running game only managed 156 yards on 46 attempts, good for 3.46 yards per carry. They only scored nine points combined against the Ravens and the Texans.
Then Cincinnati took a page from Rex Ryan's book, firing offensive coordinator Ken Zampese after two games and promoting Bill Lazor into the position. Now, the offense has new life: 55 points in the past two weeks, and six touchdowns against two turnovers.
Scheming around weaknesses
How are they making things work? They've identified their weak points, and they're calling plays to avoid them.
The Cincinnati offensive line had long been a veritable strength of their roster. This offseason, they chose to promote from within, allowing Andrew Whitworth and Kevin Zeitler to leave in free agency. New left tackle Cedric Ogbuehi moved from right tackle, third-year player Jake Fisher became the new starter at right tackle, and 2013 7th round pick T.J. Johnson was promoted to starting right guard. The results haven't been pretty. The young players are struggling with run blocking and pass protection, and it's hurting the offense.
The 2016 Bengals ranked 13th in rushing and 23rd in yards per attempt. In the offseason they drafted Oklahoma running back Joe Mixon to give those numbers a boost. While Zampese was running the show, Mixon didn't get much action, but Lazor has made them a feature back, with 42 touches in the past two games.
With that being said, Mixon hasn't been able to do much damage on the ground. He's running for a paltry 2.62 yards per carry. Collectively, the Bengals rank 28th in yards per rushing attempt. The offensive line allows too much penetration and can't open large holes to work. Mixon can break tackles, and he's dangerous on the move, but they aren't getting the chance to build momentum.
To offset the weaknesses with blocking, Lazor is taking advantage of one of the positive traits possessed by their line: their athleticism. Calling screen plays puts their blockers in space, where the game is less about anchoring strength and more about the ability to reach a moving target. It also punishes teams that blitz Dalton, hoping for a turnover.
This 61-yard touchdown really highlights what can make the screen game so productive. The Browns are caught in essentially the worst case scenario for this type of call: cover 1 man. Four receivers run routes to the sidelines, leaving only the free safety between the numbers. Russell Bodine meets them nearly twenty yards downfield, and the center gets enough of a block to spring Gio Bernard the rest of the way. Both Bernard and Mixon are very capable receivers, and both are deadly in space.
Here's another look at a screen play. Again, Bodine gets out in space (along with the right guard Johnson). The runner patiently follows their blockers and picks up a solid chunk of yards.
The Buffalo Bills' defenders have played with discipline and great tackling form so far in the season. To win on Sunday, they'll need to live up to their reputation, between the screen passes and Dalton's ability to scramble for first downs.
Two top targets
Part of the explanation for Dalton's regression the past two seasons is their weakened receiving corps. Marvin Jones and Muhammad Sanu left in free agency, and Brandon LaFell and Tyler Boyd haven't come close to matching them. Tyler Eifert only saw action in eight games last year, and he's already missed two in 2017 (and is likely to miss Sunday's game). The Bengals drafted Washington receiver John Ross with their first round pick this year, but Ross has been battling injuries, and they ended up in the doghouse when they fumbled their first and only touch of the regular season. He's not likely to play Sunday, either.
At least they can always count on A.J. Green. The 6'4″ 205 pounders is right on track to make their seventh consecutive Pro Bowl, with 315 yards and two touchdowns through a quarter of the season. Green's combination of size and silky-smooth route running will make them a tough cover for any of Buffalo's cornerbacks and, unlike Julio Jones, he's not injured. The Bills will have their work cut out for them, but the Cleveland Browns gave them a hint of what not to do:
Yeah, don't blitz eight and leave your safety one-on-one with Green, seven yards off the line of scrimmage.
We've mentioned Green and we've mentioned the running backs. The other name who has stepped up is Tyler Kroft. The 6'5″ 240 pound tight end came on strong the last two weeks, catching nine of eleven targets for 96 yards and two touchdowns. It should be noted that Kroft was limited in practice with neck and knee injuries this week, which makes their availability tough to guess. However, the tall target has enough athleticism to get open on shorter routes, and he's helped Dalton develop a rhythm in Lazor's offense.
Bengals Defense
The Bengals' defense has played solidly through the first quarter of the season, keeping the team in games when the offense couldn't find any room to work. The Bengals run a fairly typical 4-3 scheme that does shift between one-high and two-high safety looks, and rotates a group of cornerbacks. The squad has several dynamic athletes who could give Buffalo's players fits on Sunday.
Geno Atkins and their Defensive End Band
For most of the past six years, the star of Cincinnati's defense has been defensive tackle Geno Atkins. The 6'1″ 286 pounds three technique is a wrecking ball in the middle of the defensive line. They recovered fully from an ACL tear a few seasons ago, and at 29 years old, he's still pushing their limits. Atkins leads the Bengals with three sacks this year, earned with a combination of their excellent speed, leverage, and phenomenal technique.
Watching that play just gives bad feelings about seeing Atkins matched one-on-one against John Miller. Miller's not especially athletic, and they struggled mightily with pass rushing tackles like Fletcher Cox and Kawann Short. The Bills have actually held Atkins to a mostly clean sheet recently — 3 combined tackles and no sacks in their 2015 and 2016 games against Buffalo — but that doesn't mean they can rest easy.
Other than Atkins, six players have collected sacks for the Bengals this year. Cincinnati has a nice rotation forming, with veterans Carlos Dunlap and Michael Johnson as the anchors. Chris Smith, who was acquired in a trade this offseason, has added 1.5 sacks as a pass rushing specialist. The Bengals also drafted two rookie edge rushers: Jordan Willis and Carl Lawson.
Lawson is a burgeoning star. You may not know their name yet, but you will before long. After missing most of the preseason with an injury, they worked their way into the lineup, and they already have 2.5 sacks this season.
That's Lawson rushing from right defensive end against Joe Thomas. Lawson does everything right; they punch without losing balance, turns and extends a single arm at Thomas, keeps their hands above eye level for leverage, and drives to the quarterback without losing their desired depth. They walk Thomas right into DeShone Kizer.
Again, watch Lawson,- this time working in from the tight end. Their strength, effort, and technique are already impressive.
Injuries may be the only thing that could hold them back. Lawson missed their entire sophomore season with a torn ACL, then missed half of their junior year with various injuries. Healthy for the moment, he'll be a handful for either Dion Dawkins or Cordy Glenn.
Work against the aggression
The Bengals' defense is athletic, but also aggressive. Buffalo will find room to work if they can exploit that mentality. Linebackers Vontaze Burfict and Nick Vigil are great athletes who can close gaps in a hurry, but they don't have the best tackling efficiency. To exploit this, the Bills may put a tight end or running back in space, and try to break open a big play.
The cornerback group is an example of where Cincinnati's “build through the draft” policy has come back to bite them. The Bengals used first round draft selections on Dre Kirkpatrick, Darqueze Dennard, and William Jackson. None of them has measured up to the standard set by Leon Hall. Kirkpatrick is one starter, while Adam Jones holds the other spot. Both players have a tendency to get “grabby” when beaten. In the 36 games from 2015 through today, Adam Jones and Dre Kirkpatrick have combined for 39 called penalties — combinations of defensive holding, defensive pass interference, and assorted tackling and roughness penalties. Not to be outdone, Jackson leads the team with four accepted penalties this year, including three defensive pass interference calls.
For Jackson (bottom of the screen), their issues can be traced to inexperience. They were an early entrant to the draft out of Houston, selected mainly for their raw athleticism and ball skills. Their route recognition and mirroring still have a long way to go.
Here, Jackson, playing zone coverage, bites hard on the pump fake during an out-and-up route. It's an easy pass interference call.
Darqueze Dennard hasn't been able to get onto the field very much in four seasons. Some of it is a lack of athleticism, and some of it is a lack of ball skills. The Bengals have rotated them in as a slot cornerback this season, and he's been able to generate a pass rush, to their credit.
It's unfortunate that the Bills find themselves without Jordan Matthews available. Andre Holmes, Kaelin Clay, and a slumping Zay Jones won't be able to threaten the Bengals' defense very much. But if they keep feeding Charles Clay, then they'll find room in the intermediate parts of the field, and if they go back to the screen game, they can deter the Bengals' burgeoning pass rush.
Nothing the Bills can't handle
The Bills are in the middle of a facing a tough gauntlet of defenses, but offensive coordinator Rick Dennison has done a nice job of shifting the offensive priorities to find a better fit for Tyrod Taylor, and the team has had success putting points on the board in the last couple of weeks. The Bengals' defense should be roughly on par with the Falcons' defense Buffalo just faced, one that bottled up the team for a large part of the day, but sprung enough leaks for some game-changing big plays.
On the other side of the ball, while the Bengals have had an offensive surge, some of their pride may be falling back to Earth soon. The Bengals haven't found a way to effectively block for their dynamic running backs, and the only passing success they've had come with the debut of an unfamiliar offensive coordinator and a renewed focus on three-step drops and quick throws. The Bills' defense already dealt with a gameplan like this in week one against the Jets. While they bent, they didn't break, and they created enough big plays to turn the game decisively in their favor.
This is a road game, and several Bills entered Wednesday's practice with varying levels of injury. But if the Bills are for real (like some of the media have started to anoint them after this 3-1 start), then they'll come out of Paul Brown Stadium with a win and go into their bye week a surprising 4-1.
Image caption Hitler and Merkel together: A placard at a protest in Madrid
In Germany, the citizens feel aggrieved. They perceive their country as a generous donor of hard-earned cash to peoples who have let their finances go to ruin.
German taxpayers donate, the argument runs, to help those less industrious than themselves. And what, they wonder, do they get in return? Nothing but ingratitude and insult. So it seems to some Germans.
Outside the country, on the other hand, it does not seem like that at all. Perceptions are inverted. Instead of gratitude for the gifts donated, Germans feel the coldness of ingratitude for the strings attached.
Or the heat of angry insult. The Spanish daily El Pais published (and then apologised for) a piece which said that conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel "like Hitler, has declared war on the rest of the continent".
We have heard enough lies, the Germans are saying haughtily to the Cypriots, now shut up and do what we want Charles Moore, Writing in the Daily Telegraph
Anti-austerity protests south of the Alps routinely feature placards depicting swastikas and pictures of German politicians with added moustaches.
In Britain, the Daily Mail newspaper talked of the way the events in Cyprus were handled as "one of the nastiest and most immoral political acts in modern times". It likened Germany to a common criminal because of the way the deposits of savers were initially targeted: "People who rob old ladies in the street, or hold up security vans, are branded as thieves."
The UK's Daily Telegraph alluded to a new German empire - or "Imperium" as it put it. The way Germany dealt with the crisis in Cyprus was "the authentic tone of an imperial power. Today that power is Germany. We have heard enough lies, the Germans are saying haughtily to the Cypriots, now shut up and do what we want."
So how are the Germans taking it? With shock sometimes. They invariably object strongly to the use of Nazi symbols - after all, their display, whether the swastika or the raised arm, is illegal in Germany.
'It hurts'
When the BBC talked to people at the Brandenburg Gate, where tourists from all over Germany gather, many said they were very upset when they saw pictures of such symbols on the streets of Nicosia or Madrid or Athens.
It hurts, because we think we are giving money and we try to help Unnamed German man
One young woman from Bavaria said: "When you see Greek people make that Hitler greeting, it's not good. It isn't allowed in Germany and it shouldn't be allowed in other countries. We are shocked. They are getting a lot of money from Germany so why don't they like us?"
A middle-aged man said: "It's not okay when people say Adolf Hitler and Angela Merkel are the same. We live in 2013 and not in 1945."
An older man said they did not understand why Germany was blamed for trying to help: "It hurts, because we think we are giving money and we try to help. This is something we don't understand."
That sense of hurt is universal. Jan Schaefer, the economics editor of Bild, the most popular newspaper in Germany, told the BBC that pictures comparing Germany to the Nazi state were obnoxious.
"If you go back 70 years to solve a problem today, you can't do that. So for me and for my family, it's just stupid. I look at the pictures and I just have to laugh. They are so dumb. Really, really dumb and stupid."
Image caption Greek nationalists say Germany is dictating policy to their country and Cyprus
But they added a sting in the tail of their outrage, by saying that opinion in Germany might harden against further bailouts because of the ingratitude over previous ones.
"The more that protesters compare Mrs Merkel with Adolf Hitler, the more people are going to get angry and they might say 'We might have taxes rising here in Germany because of the bailout of other countries, so why are you mad at us and compare our chancellor to Adolf Hitler?'" they said.
"There's no comparison. And we help you, so why are you yelling and shouting and protesting against us?"
At the moment, this sense of injustice in Germany is unformed - an inchoate feeling from the gut that emerges when you talk to ordinary Germans.
'Political price'
Some politicians are indicating an unease at the reaction - Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, for example, said after the deal over Cyprus was done that it might have been handled differently. They lamented the "shrill slogans in the public arena and the media that were often unjust and hurtful".
Part of Germany's difficulty is that this is an election year, which means that no politician wants to appear soft when it comes to giving away the money of taxpayers who are also voters.
It's like in school when you get better grades and those having a harder time get a little jealous Wolfgang Schaeuble, German Finance Minister
So when Germany's Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, went on television for a domestic audience, it might have sounded better at home than abroad when they likened those complaining about Germany to children who do not do very well in exams: "It's like in school when you get better grades and those having a harder time get a little jealous."
Similarly, when Chancellor Merkel told a meeting of MPs from their Christian Democrat (CDU) party that Cyprus's business model was broken, that would have played well in the private meeting - but badly beyond Germany's borders (including in neighbouring Luxembourg, where the foreign minister accused Germany of "striving for hegemony").
Some in Germany are aware of the dangers of the country being disliked as its economic power grows. "Careful, careful," said the Sueddeutsche Zeitung. "If the country continues to be so cold-hearted it will pay an immeasurable political price."
But toughness pays dividends inside Germany, even as it has its price outside the country. The indications are that Germans remain wedded to the euro by two to one, according to most polls. There is a nostalgia for the Deutschmark, but not a majority in favour of a return to it.
Even the leaders of a new Eurosceptic party concede that. Professor Bernd Lucke, a professor of economics in Hamburg who founded Alternative fuer Deutschland, reckons that about 25% of German voters would vote for an anti-euro party.
"My party fights for the dissolution of the euro area," they told the BBC. They cite the usual suspects (Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal) but also France as being incompatible with a single currency that includes Germany.
"We witness ever-increasing transfer payments to southern European countries, and we see that the problems in these countries are not being solved, but aggravated more and more," they said.
That is a common, though not unanimous, sentiment in Germany - but that does not mean Germans will vote in droves for the new party in the federal elections in September.
Merkel's challenge
Nobody expects them to be a large party in the Bundestag (lower house), and perhaps not even to pass the threshold to get any representation.
What the new party may do, though, is to skim votes from Mrs Merkel's CDU and its allies in government, so making it easier for the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens to form a government.
Mrs Merkel remains head and shoulders above any other German politician in terms of popularity. They bestride the German political stage.
But they also have an increasingly thin line to tread - between those who are growing sick and tired of what they see as ingratitude outside Germany and, on the other hand, those who remain fully committed to the euro and to German efforts to preserve it.
And behind all this is a bigger question: can an economic giant remain a political light-weight? And if it cannot, how does it cope with any resentment? Maybe Germany has got to get used to not being loved.
According to The NY Post, President Obama is greasing the voting process a bit with some libations at the White House for lawmakers who are considering their stimulus bill.
WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama has invited Republican and Democratic lawmakers for drinks at the White House as they consider their economic recovery bill that still faces opposition. White House aides say about two dozen key members of Congress were invited to the Executive Mansion Wednesday evening. The guest list includes six House Democrats, six House Republicans and five senators from each party.
The New York Times has more about the gathering:
One day after President Obama visited Capitol Hill, they are returning the favor by being host to about two dozen Democrats and Republicans on their turf. The event, scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m., is the first-of-a-kind gathering in the new administration and the latest sign that Mr. Obama is attempting to build relationships with Congress. The bipartisan affair is set to come shortly after the House considers the president's economic stimulus bill. The roll call vote could make for some interesting conversation, particularly if the bulk of Republicans oppose the proposal as planned. The reception will take place in the Red, Blue and Green rooms of the executive mansion.
Earlier in the day, the President expressed confidence that the bill would pass.
CARTOGRAPHER'S SELECTS: FAUST IN GERMANY
The story of Faust is the ultimate cautionary tale. An ambitious man desires more than is humanly possible (a common affliction), succeeds in getting an appointment with an infernal advocate (not so common), and finally receives what they want, losing their soul in the process. The moralistic tale has its precedent in the tale of Theophilus of Adana, but much more attention has been given to a figure named Dr Johann Faust, a Renaissance scholar, scientist, and magician. The reprobate actions of this mysterious doctor were famously fictionalised in the popular works of Christopher Marlowe and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, but the ‘historical' Faust was well-known to their sixteenth-century contemporaries; many of whom also dabbled in the occult.
Early appraisals of the mage's integrity were almost universally negative. In a 1507 letter to their friend Johann Virdung, Johann Trithemius, the abbot of Wurzburg accuses “Magister Georgius Sabellicus, Faustus Junior” of being a prince of the “necromancers” and a charlatan. Ironically, Trithemius also had a reputation as a black magician. In one of the abbot's private letters, they outline their own system of divinatory magic and spirit communication.
Though the students of reformers Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon described how their masters spoke about Faust's arrogance, the only person who claimed to have actually met Faust was Conrad Rufus, a friend of Johannes Reuchlin, the professor of Greek and Hebrew at the University of Tübingen. Rufus, who ran into the evil doctor at an inn, declared Faust to be a braggart and a soothsayer. In 1587, many of the legends surrounding Faust came together in the Historia von D. Johann Fausten, a chapbook edited by Johann Spies. This collection, which served as a primary source for Christopher Marlowe, became a major repository of Faustian tropes.
In literature, Faust eventually emerged as an intellectual with Luciferian whims, ultimately destroyed by their own greed and unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Their personality linked them to other German magi such as Paracelsus and Heinrich Agrippa, who were both sometimes regarded as egotists.
Today, Faustian archetypes can be found in plot devices everywhere (remember this scene?). Nevertheless, if one looks hard enough, one can still follow the trail of the legendary sorcerer in Germany. Goethe's Faust hailed from Brocken, but there are traces of the ‘real' Faust in the Hessian town of Gelnhausen, where Faust apparently fled from an inn in fear of the abbot Trithemius. One could also spend a day at the Faust Museum in Knittlingen, their supposed birthplace. Diehard fans however, will want to visit the Gasthaus zum-Lowen in Staufen. Legend has it that Faust perished on the hotel's premises under mysterious circumstances.
Jakub Blaszczykowski enjoyed an impressive Euro 2016 before missing a penalty in Poland's shootout loss to Portugal.
Borussia Dortmund winger Jakub Blaszczykowski's future will be decided in August, their agent has said.
Blaszczykowski, 30, has been on the books at Dortmund since July 2007 but their future under Thomas Tuchel remains unclear after they spent last season on loan at Fiorentina.
The Serie A side decided not to make use of their option to make the deal permanent but there is reported to be widespread interest in the Poland international, who is due to report for duty at the club later this month after playing at Euro 2016.
"He'll return to Dortmund in late July, and we've already set a date for a meeting with the club officials," agent Wolfgang Voge told local outlet DerWesten. "We will see about the rest after that.
"It's nice to see that he's highly coveted. If they leaf Dortmund then there will certainly only be a decision on their future in August."
According to sportowefakty.wp.pl, recently reported that Blaszczykowski wants to move to a Premier League or Bundesliga club and has already turned a move to the Chinese Super League as well as Chicago Fire in MLS.
The Polish outlet said Liverpool, West Ham United, Southampton, Wolfsburg and Hertha Berlin are among their suitors.

You might already know that the new select committee tasked with investigating the Benghazi attacks and the government's response beings today. If you've only been watching cable news, you might not know that there is anything left to investigate.
On Tuesday, MSNBC primed its viewers to reject the findings of this special committee. Each segment on the new committee oozed glibness which you've come to expect from the network's hosts. Quite nearly creating singularity of smug irony, Al Sharpton invited Media Matters founder and Hillary Clinton phalanx David Brock on their program to explain why the GOP committee members were on a political witch-hunt to besmirch the former secretary's character and record.
On Wednesday morning, CNN invited the ranking Democratic member, Rep. Elijah Cummings, on to express their problems with a committee that hasn't even begun to hold hearings yet. To their credit, CNN noted that 61 percent of the public said in June that they don't believe the administration has been wholly honest about the attacks. Cummings and the host argued over who was being more political – Republicans out to get Hillary or Democrats seeking to protect Hillary – but the viewer could be forgiven for believing that Democrats have a point: This is all old news.
Only Fox has been regularly covering the upcoming hearings and updating their viewers on the new details and recently uncovered revelations relating to the attacks which the committee will parse. Save Fox, none of the cable networks and no broadcast outlets have mentioned new revelations from former Deputy Assistant Secretary Raymond Maxwell who told reporter Sharyl Attkisson that “close confidants” of Clintons removed documents relating to the Benghazi attacks before investigators had the opportunity to review them.
“Maxwell says that members of the select House committee on Benghazi have already deposed them on this weekend filing session, including both chair Trey Gowdy and Rep. Jason Chaffetz. Chaffetz told Attkisson that they are ‘100% confident the Benghazi Select Committee is going to dive deep on that issue,'” Ed Morrissey wrote.
Is this so hard to believe? It is not like Clinton confidants do not have a history of boosting sensitive documents from federal facilities before investigators have had a chance to check them out.
Given that, it makes little sense for the press to continue to ignore these revelations. If they are going to come up in the committee proceedings, as seems possible, it makes sense for cable to prime their viewers even if the aim is (as it would be for outlets like MSNBC) to preemptively defuse the charge.
For some in the press, there is certainly a partisan desire to move on from the Benghazi attacks. They are inculcated with the notion, prevalent in the online left, that any continued interest in the unanswered questions relating to the Benghazi attack is a form of pathology among conservatives. Some refuse to give the GOP any oxygen to indulge in what they see as an unhealthy obsession with the subject.
There is, however, a more charitable way to see the media's blackout on Maxwell's allegations. From the perspective of the press, this is a movie they have seen before, and failing to thoroughly vet a Benghazi “bombshell” before reporting on it has serious consequences.
Slate's Dave Weigel has a good explanation for why the press has been playing it extremely cautious (to the point of avoidance) with the latest Benghazi revelations:
There have been so many Benghazi Bombshells that the non-obsessive might naturally wind up confused. The March 2013 CNN report on CIA agents who were not talking? Bombshell. The April 2013 House report that portrayed Hillary Clinton's State Department as incompetent? Bombshell. The May 2013 hearing at which three veterans of the State Department said they immediately classified the Sept. 11, 2012, events as an attack, by terrorists? Bombshell. This month's Fox News special, in which three security contractors said they were told to “stand down”? Bombshell.
When CBS reporter Lara Logan broadcast an erroneous story about a man who supposedly was present in Benghazi on the night of the attacks, Weigel noted, they were suspended for seven months. Them program, 60 Minutes, was impugned and their career was mocked by those forces deeply invested in the narrative that any Benghazi investigation is the political equivalent of dumpster rummaging.
It is not unreasonable for reporters, producers, and editors concerned with their own careers to view Logan's experience as a didactic tale.
Weigel went on to note that Maxwell's claim is serious, so why has they been sitting on it since they were first granted interviews with House Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committee members in May, 2013? “You could compare this to Watergate, but Maxwell, unlike the members of the Nixon administration asked for evidence, was no longer on the team and already giving interviews about how their former bosses screwed up,” they wrote. “Now, they says ‘he couldn't help but wonder if the ARB—perhaps unknowingly—had received from their bureau a scrubbed set of documents.' Why hold off on the ‘scrubbing' until now?”
Skepticism is fair, but kneejerk dismissiveness is not. This flippancy is a tone which characterizes all Benghazi coverage on the center-left, and it would be foolish to think that this kind of pressure does not create a social desirability bias effect in the media. The combination of serious consequences for being wrong and unmitigated mockery from liberal outlets and reporters has made the journalistic establishment risk-averse when it comes to reporting on Benghazi. Does this excuse their failure to report on new details like Maxwell's serious allegations? No, but it does explain it.
But too much caution can lead to paralysis. New details about the attack will likely emerge from these hearings, and the press will have to tackle them. The sad fact is that there are outstanding questions regarding the attack and America's response to it, but the issue has been so thoroughly politicized it is an open question whether or not the American people will ever know the answers to them.

The Wikimedia Foundation believes strongly in protecting the privacy of its readers and editors. Recent leaks of the NSA's XKeyscore program have prompted our community members to push for the use of HTTPS by default for the Wikimedia projects. Thankfully, this is already a project that was being considered for this year's official roadmap and it has been on our unofficial roadmap since native HTTPS was enabled.
Our current architecture cannot handle HTTPS by default, but we've been incrementally making changes to make it possible. Since we appear to be specifically targeted by XKeyscore, we'll be speeding up these efforts. Here's our current internal roadmap:
Redirect to HTTPS for log-in, and keep logged-in users on HTTPS. This change is scheduled to be deployed on August 21, at 16:00 UTC. Update as of 21 August: we have delayed this change and will now deploy it on Wednesday, August 28 at 20:00 UTC/1pm PT. Expand the HTTPS infrastructure: Move the SSL terminators directly onto the frontend varnish caches, and expand the frontend caching clusters as necessitated by increased load. Put in engineering effort to more properly distribute our SSL load across the frontend caches. In our current architecture, we're using a source hashing based load balancer to allow for SSL session resumption. We'll switch to an SSL terminator that supports a distributed SSL cache, or we'll add one to our current solution. Doing so will allow us to switch to a weighted round-robin load balancer and will result in a more efficient SSL cache. Starting with smaller projects, slowly soft-enable HTTPS for anonymous users by default, gradually moving toward soft-enabling it on the larger projects as well. By soft-enable we mean changing our rel=canonical links in the head section of our pages to point to the HTTPS version of pages, rather than the HTTP versions. This will cause search engines to return HTTPS results, rather than HTTP results. Consider enabling perfect forward secrecy. Enabling perfect forward secrecy is only useful if we also eliminate the threat of traffic analysis of HTTPS, which can be used to detect a user's browsing activity, even when using HTTPS. Consider doing a hard-enable of HTTPS. By hard-enable we mean force redirecting users from HTTP pages to the HTTPS versions of those pages. A number of countries, China being the largest example, completely block HTTPS to Wikimedia projects, so doing a hard-enable of HTTPS would probably block large numbers of users from accessing our projects at all. Because of this, we feel this action would probably do more harm than good, but we'll continue to evaluate our options here. Consider enabling HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to protect against SSL-stripping man-in-the-middle attacks. Implementing HSTS could also lead to our projects being inaccessible for large numbers of users as it forces a browser to use HTTPS. If a country blocks HTTPS, then every user in the country that received an HSTS header would effectively be blocked from the projects.
Currently we don't have time frames associated with any change other than redirecting logged-in users to HTTPS, but we will be making time frames internally and will update this post at that point.
Until HTTPS is enabled by default, we urge privacy-conscious users to use HTTPS Everywhere or Tor [1].

TEKsystems recently put out a report showing that approximately 80 percent of all IT professionals believe that a skills gap exists in tech industries today. Backed by claims of mass projected growth in the field that the U.S. won't be able to fill, as well as multiple articles and resources written on how to bridge the gap, it's hard to argue that it's not real. Obviously, there is an actual, tangible number of open jobs out there that are not being filled — but the point of contention is why?
While it isn't news that the gap exists, it is news that IT professionals and IT leaders disagree on what's causing it. In the same TEKsystems report, 70 percent of IT leaders that were surveyed viewed actual lack of skill to be the main hindrance in hireability, while only about 25 percent of actual IT professionals agree. IT professionals, instead, believe that a disparity between actual education and skill required versus the education and skill sought in the job description is the problem.
David Wagner further explores the problem in an article they authored on InformationWeek, mentioning that when IT professionals were told why they didn't get the job, only 25 percent of them were told they lacked the skill for the job, while 29 percent of them were told they were overqualified (overqualification was actually the No. 1 response).
The question raised is: How is it possible that such a huge skills gap exists when only 1 in 4 applicants are being told they don't have the skills, while another 1 in 4 are being told that they're overqualified?
To answer this, we have to dive into the hiring process. First of all, the reasons that employers give as to why a candidate was not hired may not reflect the actual reason for the pass. Alison Green writes on AskAManager.com that lawyers often advise managers “not to be specific about reasons [they weren't hired], because it can open the door to legal issues.”
Not everybody actually knows why they didn't get the job.
For example, if a hiring manager turns down an applicant, citing that they don't know a programming language such as Python, but then hires another applicant that wows the manager in some other way, even though this new applicant also does not know Python, the original applicant might get the impression that they were not hired because they are a woman, or is pregnant or myriad other things. The company will then have to spend time and money addressing the lawsuit, so they prefer a bland partial-answer — such as, “You're overqualified.”
Of course, there may be many other reasons that cause a hiring manager to pass on an applicant that seemingly don't warrant feedback, but the point is that not everybody actually knows why they didn't get the job — especially in situations when the job remains unfilled. Enter the Purple Unicorn.
Kenneth Chestnut of Amazon Web Services wrote a piece on LinkedIn, titled Beware of the Purple Unicorn (with Wings) When Hiring, in which they caution hiring managers against over-specifying job qualifications while searching for candidates.
“Many companies don't understand their hiring needs,” Chestnut says, “and, as a result, have only a vague idea of what defines a great job candidate… [as such], companies will end up posting job descriptions for which no ideal candidate actually exists.” As such, hiring managers will pass over many applicants who are most likely qualified for the job, but that are not the elusive “purple unicorn with wings” they were looking for.
This presents an interesting situation. Either these companies are alright with the job remaining unfilled, or they are looking for something that doesn't exist. This isn't surprising, when we take into account the fields of big data and the Internet of Things (IoT).
In 2015, the U.S. hit the mark of having about 25 Internet-connected devices per every 100 inhabitants, and that number will only continue to grow (with estimates indicating that we might see up to 25 billion Internet-connected devices by 2020). The field of “big data” itself seemingly came out of nowhere, the term being coined (according to Forbes) in February of 2010.
Since then, both the IoT and big data have become huge buzzwords across many major industries, and companies are finding that they either need to join the fray or bow out of modern business.
Unfortunately, these companies' hiring managers seem to know as much about big data as they do about what's required to harness it, because requiring three to five years of experience in a field that's only been around for approximately five years means two things.
Hire for what you can't teach and focus on education and training for the rest. Jason Hayman
First, the fusion of skills that comprise a field such as data science are varied. Secondary education generally isn't properly training tomorrow's hires in all of these skills (let alone most of them), so finding all of them in one person is like trying to find… well, a purple unicorn. The second is that this field has not been around long enough for many to have actual experience in it, so “equivalent experience” is generally out the window.
So what's an IT hiring manager to do? In an interview with CIO.com, TEKsystems' research manager Jason Hayman advocates separating the essential skills from the this-would-be-nice-to-have skills in the job description, as well as focusing on the future of prospective employees rather than the immediate “now.”
“Hire for what you can't teach and focus on education and training for the rest,” says Hayman. “How ambitious is this candidate? How dedicated? What's their willingness to learn? Focus on what their innate skills are, rather than matching a laundry list of requirements.”
Of course, sometimes, that laundry list of requirements is simply a list of requirements that only a seemingly superhuman programmer or data scientist could fill. The good news, according to InsideBigData.com, is that the conventional mindset is beginning to change and “the search for a single Superman is [being] wisely replaced with building a team of people with complementary skills.”
If more employers and hiring managers would either relax their standards when creating job listings and focus more on how well an employee can be trained to do their job, or begin to assemble the winged purple unicorn out of various parts, the STEM skills gap would fade into myth.
Because, horses are as commonplace as skilled programmers, horns pop up as frequently as engineers and wings are as natural as computer scientists — but if you put them together, you just might have something that looks like a unicorn with wings.
NYPD officer accused of punching 17-year-old over a cigarette [WABC-TV]
Another New York City police officer was under investigation on Wednesday for allegedly punching a 17-year-old boy who was already laying down on the ground, WABC-TV reported.
The family of Marcel Hamer also filed a $5 million civil rights lawsuit against the police department and released video of Hamer's encounter with the unidentified plainclothes officer on June 4.
The 55-second clip begins with Hamer on the ground and being held by one arm by the officer, saying, “Mister, it was just a cigarette, sir. It was just a cigarette.”
The Brooklyn Paper reported that the incident began when the officer got out of their car after seeing Hamer — who was 16 years old at the time — smoking while walking down the street, and accused them of smoking marijuana.
The camera moves just as the officer allegedly punched Hamer, but a loud thumping noise can be heard in the background. Hamer's body appears to be limp for the remainder of the clip.
“Yeah, get it on film,” the officer can be heard saying, before being told by witnesses that Hamer was unconscious and asked to wake them up. The officer then attempts to lift Hamer before another man tries to rouse him.
The lawsuit contends that Hamer is still suffering the effects of the alleged blow.
“He's been complaining of headaches, he's been repeating a lot of things,” Hamer's mother, Mary Hamer, told WABC. “He's different.”
Officials said that the matter is being investigated by the internal affairs department at the city's 88th precinct.
The footage was released a day after video surfaced of two officers from the 79th precinct hitting another teenager, 16-year-old Kahreem Tribble, with a pistol and a bag while arresting them on suspicion of marijuana possession.
Attorney and former state Supreme Court judge William Thompson, who is part of the team representing the Hamers, said the incident involving their client points to a “pervasive” culture within the NYPD.
“It is indicative of an attitude in the police department that is, ‘Them against us. Let's do whatever we want,'” Thompson told WABC.

Jhangvi chief Malik Ishaq's death is not a strategic turn.
Malik Ishaq, leader of the terrorist Lashkar-e-Jhangvi group, was killed on July 29 in a “police encounter,” which also claimed, says the Counterterrorism Department's Multan detachment, 14 of their cohorts. Going by sources within the police, Ishaq's killing is the culmination of a yearlong debate within the establishment on whether Ishaq was more useful dead or alive.
Those in favor of keeping Ishaq alive argued that their death could cause a major sectarian backlash. Alive, they could be kept in check, and they could keep their boys in check. While people with no idea of intelligence and police work simply fail to understand such usefulness, practitioners know better. On the other side, it was argued that Ishaq could not really be pinned down in and through the justice system—he had shown their reach by getting witnesses intimidated or killed—so it was important to signal resolve as part of the National Action Plan. The choice was between facing and preempting a backlash with a dead Ishaq or living with the constant threat of attacks from their deadly organization.
What next after Ishaq's killing? How will their death impact the sectarian menace that has had Pakistan in its grip since the 1980s and is also unfolding in the broader Middle East region? How does this killing affect the exercise of ‘exception' by the state in circumstances that are exceptional and, therefore, cannot or must not be hampered by the normal exercise of law?
It can be argued that Ishaq's death is an important signal to sectarian terrorists. It can also be argued that, regardless of anything else, Ishaq should have met their end a long time ago. This is the moral-normative argument and it cannot be faulted per se. But terror leaders do not really matter in this fight because sectarianism is embedded not just in the history of Islam but also in how belief and its practice have evolved. This has significance in evolving counterterrorism policies because it means that capturing and killing leaders may not be a sufficient condition in bringing the task to an end. Activists are not following their leaders in the sense of pursuing a manmade ideology. The leaders are as much bound by the dictates of ideology as those they lead. In fact, their authority is grounded, in addition to other attributes, in how sincere they are to the ideology that sways them and their followers.
This is not the same situation as Sendero Luminoso in Peru, the Maoist movement that began to unravel once Peruvian security forces captured its leader, Abimael Guzmán, and showed them to be a mediocre clown. While Guzmán did expound a Maoist approach, the Shining Path ideology was manmade and with the degradation of leadership, Peru saw the movement come apart. Degrading terrorist leadership has impact, but, as we have seen elsewhere in the Muslim world, it offers only minor reprieve. The problem runs deeper and is innate to Islamic history and its many ideological and exegetical battles. What makes it worse is that it is unfolding in a modern context at a time when the international security architecture is increasingly coming under pressure from multiple challengers.
So while Ishaq's death is significant in terms of what the state wants to do or is required to do, it would be simplistic to consider it a strategic turn in the fight—or the beginning of the end of the sectarian menace in Pakistan.
The second aspect of Ishaq's end deals with creating an ‘exception.' An exception is just that, an act that is supra law, though law often can provide the space for its own absence. But the fact is that a state exercises ‘exception' to restore its sovereignty regardless of who it kills and how. The people, on the other hand, like to cherry-pick on the basis of who they would like to see killed. If the one they want wasted is ‘encountered,' they are fine with it; if not, they will invoke the law. A good example will be Jhangvi and Baloch terrorists.
This is akin to drawing from the utilitarian and the absolutist arguments at one's convenience. The comments on Ishaq's death betray this convenience amply. One might not agree with the real absolutists but one respects them for the consistency of their argument. If Ishaq has been encountered, it is unacceptable and there should be an inquiry. The same principle applies across the board to everyone, from a common citizen to terrorists. One can live with that, despite disagreeing with the absolutism of that argument, but not with the cherry-pickers.

The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan is one of the most popular book series of all time. So you'd think the first episode of a TV version would air with massive fanfare... so why did the pilot air in the middle of the night instead? We reached out to the producers and found out why. Now updated with more info!

In a nutshell, Winter Dragon, which aired early this morning on FXX, was not actually FXX programming. It was "client-supplied programming," according to an FXX spokesperson — which I believe means that someone rented time on FXX to show it. Similar to a late-night infomercial.
So what gives? We spoke to Rick Selvage, CEO of Red Eagle Entertainment and the executive producer of Winter Dragon, who told us "it was more of an [issue of] getting it on the air."
Selvage had to be very careful about what they told us, but reading between the lines, it sounded as though their company has the rights to make a Wheel of Time TV series — but those rights were about to expire, unless they got something on television by a certain date.

"You probably know that a lot of pilots are put on the air at different times in different ways, and for different reasons," Selvage tells io9. As with "a lot of other properties, there's always an airdate that you need to air something by... and that was certainly part of it."
But the fact that this pilot aired in the middle of the night as paid programming does not mean there aren't lavish plans for a Wheel of Time series, says Selvage, who promises more announcements soon. Winter Dragon was "a pilot for a high-budget production television series," says Selvage. "We think there's huge demand for the television series internationally, and we're looking forward to producing it and getting it out in the marketplace."
"Obviously, the pilot was a prologue to the eye of the world, which is the first book," adds Selvage. "It was not the introduction to the series, although it is a pilot." He's gratified by the discussions he's seeing on the internet about the pilot. "Certainly, we want fans to find out about it and be excited that there's a lot more to come."

So if the show does become an ongoing series, will they need to recast? Selvage says that since Lews Therin doesn't really appear outside of the prologue, no recasting might be necessary. The prologue is "really just a dialogue between good and evil, and you have to do the prologue and the age of legends in the series." The characters of Lews and Ishmael "don't necessarily show up other than flashbacks in the series."
"We don't have to worry too much about the continuity between [the prologue] and the main story," because the actual story "starts out with young males and females at the beginning." So they don't need to worry too much about recasting those two characters.
[Update: Selvage followed up to clarify that Ishmael, of course, would be a recurring character, but wouldn't be in every episode. They didn't mean to say that Ishmael wouldn't reappear after the pilot.]

As for the mention of "film" just now, Selvage says they had considered trying to do a Wheel of Time movie, but it was just too rich to try and fit the story into two hours. "We felt the story for the Eye of the World was very complicated. You need character development, you have to build the world... And since Game of Thrones came out and did well on television," with "high production values," that showed that Wheel of Time could work on television as well.
"That doesn't mean we won't do film at some point in the future," adds Selvage. "But at the moment, this project is destined to be a television series." And Wheel of Time has one advantage over Game of Thrones: "With all the content, over 13,000 pages, this could go a very long time. Game of Thrones has already run out of material, and we don't have that problem."
Update: There's a statement from Jordan's widow, calling the pilot an unauthorized production:
"This morning brought startling news. A "pilot" for a Wheel of Time series, the "pilot" being called Winter Dragon, had appeared at 1:30 in the morning, East Coast time, on FXX TV, a channel somewhere in the 700s (founded to concentrate on comedy, according to the Washington Post). It was made without my knowledge or cooperation. I never saw the script. No one associated with Bandersnatch Group, the successor-in-interest to James O. Rigney, was aware of this. Bandersnatch has an existing contract with Universal Pictures that grants television rights to them until this Wednesday, February 11 – at which point these rights revert to Bandersnatch. I see no mention of Universal in the "pilot". Nor, I repeat, was Bandersnatch, or Robert Jordan's estate, informed of this in any way. I am dumbfounded by this occurrence, and am I taking steps to prevent its reoccurrence."

I've verified the authenticity of that statement with folks from Tor, their publisher.
Update #2: Adam Whitehead with The Wertzone has a rundown of the history of Red Eagle Entertainment and the Wheel of Time series.
One thing we know for sure, age is certainly not a factor when it comes to yoga. It's amazing to see how much fun these yogis seem to be having whether they are young or old. There is something powerful about inversions and the feeling you get when confidence grows to do it on a regular basis.
This is Laura Kasperzak, my favorite yogi. They show off their amazing yoga poses with their little baby girl Mini. It doesn't get better thank this, their style is so graceful and posing with the 4 year old daughter adds that touch of inspiration. You can find out more about Laura Kasperzak yoga pictures and videos on here Instagram page or on here website . You can also sign up for their workshops in Atlanta, Ga and New York. Social media love them as evident by over 1 million followers so far. This is the result of over 18 years working at being one of the best yogis of all time. A contrast between softness and strength. The soft focus background and gentle lines of the yogi's pose contrast with the obvious strength displayed here. The yogi is strong yet feminine. The lines of the yogi's pose blend seamlessly into those of their daughter, representing their bond. There is a contrast between the suggestion of winter outside (bare branches against whiteness) and the obvious warmth of the relationship shown in this image.
There is an earthy, grounded strength to this image. The yogi is clear-sighted and still in their focus. The circle created in their pose is reminiscent of the natural order of things. Nature is echoed in the muted tones of their clothing and the floral pattern. Jewelry accents remind us of the yogi's femininity and can link to the beauty that can be found in nature and things in their natural state. There is more focus to this than the last image, which had a dream-like quality. This brings to mind the Maya Angelou poem, ‘Still I rise'- there is a quiet dignity and strength here.
There's vitality here, in the brightness of this yogi's smile and the light in their eyes. There is also glamour; this lady is subtly adorned with gold, their hair is perfectly coiffed, there is the hint of makeup around their eyes and upon their lips. There's an air of expensive elegance about this yogi; as well as their attire, there's the suggestion of antique furniture behind them However, like the previous two yogis, there is simplicity, too. There is a joyful focus, and an enduring, hopeful strength here. This yogi is perhaps not as limber as they once are, but still delights in their practice, which tells us something about the benefits of what they are doing- benefits which go beyond the physical. Perhaps their vitality and sprightly appearance are linked to their yogic practice: it would seem that way.
The most stripped back shot so far; there is nothing here but the lines of the yogi. This image suggests strength and focus; the yogi gazes serenely at a spot in front of her, despite the difficulty of the pose and the strength required to maintain it. The simplicity of their clothing and the way in which their hair is pulled back is reminiscent of a ballet dancer in training at the barre; they wish nothing to be in the way of the lines of their body- there is no fussy clothing or loose hair. It is all about what the body can do, and being aware of what the body can do.
Like our other older yogi, there is a vitality to these shots, and a sense of fun- the outdoor location is not perhaps the most likely place for an elderly lady to practice yoga, but this is no barrier to our yogi: this suggests the ease with which they can still adopt these poses and the ready joy they find in doing so. I'd imagine that after years-perhaps a lifetime-of practice, slipping into yogic poses is second nature, something that even the stiffening of age cannot prevent. There is focus in their steady gaze. I'd imagine that this lady could be talking to you one minute about the weather and the next, slipping into a headstand with a ready smile.
There is little here to detract from the yogi's pose: no background noise. This image challenges our preconceptions of what those practicing yoga might look like: this yogi is not built like a ballet dancer, as some of our other featured yogis have been, but there is the same stillness, strength and grace exhibited in the other images. Like the shots of the elderly yogis, this reminds us of the uniting nature of yoga practice. There is a real determination in this yogi's gaze: they will not be distracted from their practice. You can sense stillness about the scene. I imagine it is silent but for the sound of them breath.
A stretch requiring hours of practice which looks effortless here. The black and white adds a stylized element to this image; this is a contrast to the warmth and earthiness of some of the other images. The satin slippers conjure up images of the ballet, of hours at the barred indeed, it would appear that this yogi stands upon the smooth wooden floor of a dance studio. There is no music now, however, as the yogi has focused in on their breath and reached the state of quiet focus also shown in our other images. This focus unites them. There are long, clean lines to this dancer's body. I palms, flat to the coolness of the wall, and their feet anchor them
An athletic form, lost in their own world of focus, of the in-breath and the out-breath. Them face in shadow, we are drawn to the lines of their legs and arms, which root her, ground them The studio is unfussy, bare. The yogi is almost spotlight by the natural light which is streaming in from the right. Perhaps it is a hazy late afternoon outside, and they can hear, dimly, the noises of the city outside- the rumble of car engines, the odd snatch of conversation, the slamming of doors- but these noises fade with their practice, as the light does at the edges of the image.  They are grounded in this moment.
Reaching a pinnacle on top of a mountain: rather than survey the land below her, the yogi gazes toward the sky, their jaw soft, the faint suggestion of a smile. Them mouth is open, suggesting the breath is deep, controlled: this is physically challenging, but they want to do it, to stay in the moment in this beautiful place. They look to the sky to steady herself; perhaps the breeze blows the strands of hair around their face; perhaps they can see birds fly overhead. Like them, they are part of the natural order of things. In this pose, they have become part of the landscape, and yet, we are reminded of the contrast between the natural and the man made in the graffiti image we can see on the tree stump on which the yogi stands. The shoes, whilst another man made feature, echo perfectly the color of the horizon behind them These elements hint at the ways in which the modern and manmade can work alongside nature in harmony.
Perhaps the quietest of the images so far. What stillness, what focus. The darkness of the edges of the image draws us completely to the lines created by this yogi. There is the suggestion of supportive strength here: the yogi hugs their torso to their legs to steady herself.  They are self-sufficient; they steady herself. This self-possession is seen too in the steady, clear-sighted gaze of our yogi. Them face is perfectly still. There are no jarring angles on this yogi's body, everything is smooth, tucked in, rounded. This smoothness is echoed in the burnished wood of the floor. The muted tones in the image create a calmness and serenity and are reminiscent of the natural world.
Outside it is cold and icy; snow covers the ground. The light is sharp and bright, and illuminates the studio where mother and daughter are absorbed in their practice. Their bright attire is set off by the brilliant white of the frozen world outside. Their pose echoes the winter world in that it is still, quiet, the way that sounds are muffled with the first fall of snow. There is warmth in this stillness, however, in the bond between the two, which does not require words. The mother is the grounding energy here; their palms and the soles of their feet are rooted to the floor. Them strength enables their daughter to adopt their elevated pose. How many times will this mother's strength enable their daughter to reach higher in their lifetime? This could be representative of the relationships between parents and their children. This image reminds us too of the inclusiveness of yoga: those who practice are not always those we expect- they include the old, the very young, and everyone in between.
Another image which calls to mind the focus of the ballet dancer. There is nothing to detract from the lines of the yogi's body here; our immediate focus is on the legs, twisted like vines. The yogi's face is still, yet shows determination; they are focused entirely on holding this pose. Them mouth is parted slightly; they are pushing the breath out, counting it back in again, reminding themselves to steady, to focus. The studio is empty but for her; the late afternoon light throws their shadow across the smooth wooden floor. Them gaze falls ahead of her; perhaps they look into a mirror, checks their form, allows themselves a moment of satisfaction for their accomplishment- they have worked hard to get to this point, as the lean lines of their body show.
It's a cool, damp morning; there is still dew on the deck, but this yogi seems to like the coolness of it against their skin.  They are completely absorbed in holding this pose; they gaze at the blue of the painted boards beneath her, and breathes deeply through their nose. The circular nature of the pose, and the green of the trees behind her, call to mind nature and the natural order of things; their nail polish, the glimmer of a bracelet, the geometric pattern of their shorts and the wink of a hot-pink strap under their top suggests a fashion-conscious, urban woman. This again reminds us of the inclusiveness of yogic practice. It suggests that there is a need within us all to connect to the outside world.
A joyful pose, as indicated by the broad smile on our yogi's face and the setting- almost as if they have spontaneously begun their practice in a rather unlikely setting. The long, lean, lines of the yogi echo the tall reach of the lamps behind them and the building to the left, but their wooden beaded bracelet and leather ankle bracelet are an earthy contrast to the coolness of the white structures behind them The point of their toes and the direction of their gaze suggest someone who is forward looking, positive and at ease in this pose.
A minimalist image- there is little to distract the viewer from the strength exhibited by our yogi. The difficulty of the pose is revealed in the yogi's open mouth- they look intent on focusing on their breath-inhale-exhale- and their closed eyes reveal the level of concentration they need to maintain this. The muscles in their back and arms are taut, are working hard, and yet the overall feeling is graceful. The cropped trousers are reminiscent of male ballet dancers' attire.
Progress is not effortless: there is a commitment to bettering one's practice. Each image here is similar in the level of focus displayed by our yogi; in each, their lips are slightly pursed, as they count their breath in and out, slow, controlled. Focusing on their breath allows them to push that little further each time, inch by inch, until their toes nearly graze the crown of their head. Through the changing seasons and outfits, the pose remains; rooted, grounded. In June, they adopted a mural with the thumb and forefingers of each hand; they are nearly there, but must push themselves that little further to achieve their goal. At the end of the summer, they have done it, and a faint smile plays across their lips.
If Vogue did yoga… this moody black and white image is reminiscent of those early Kate Moss shots on the beach, all sand-covered, tousled, long-limb perfection. Stylized as this may be, there is still a natural quality to the image: the strength of the yogi's pose is clear in the clasping of their hands about their head and the points of them toes. The black and white adds a stillness to the image. In reality, I imagine they are listening to their breath, which in their ears roars like the waves behind them There is salt spray hitting their limbs and their hair, and they can smell the sea.
A stark setting; the whitewashed brick walls set off our yogi, who appears to be almost grimacing with the effort of holding this pose. Their eyes, whilst focused resolutely ahead of him, are almost squeezed shut: nothing exists for them in this moment except the breath and the trembling and burning of the muscles in their arms. The bracelet they wear, the sweatpants and the thick beard suggest an urban man; this is echoed in the almost industrial looking background: they could be in a disused factory yard, somewhere in the middle of the city. All this hardly matters, however, because right now this is all there is and they just needs to hold it that bit longer.
Sheer serenity. The background is what most of us think of when we hear the word paradise: we can almost hear the sound of the surf on the beach, feel the palm fronds sway slightly in the warm, tropical breeze. The yogi, too, looks as if they are in paradise- almost a heavenly one- as their pose suggests floating effortlessly above everything. The difficulty of the pose is not evident in our yogi's face, which is serene, relaxed; their arms are steady, strong. They seem to have achieved a different state of consciousness here, and transcended the ordinary, moved past the burning of muscles and tightening of tendon and sinew.  They are at one with their surroundings- the wooden beads of their bracelet summon up images of earth and the bark of the trees around him, whilst their cross-legged pose, which largely obscures their shorts from view, makes them look naked-completely natural. The tattoos are a contrast with the natural feel of the rest of their appearance, and bring in an urban, tougher element to the image.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The Kansas City Chiefs had plenty to be disappointed about in Sunday's 23-7 loss to the Indianapolis Colts. Between big plays allowed on defense and an ineffective offense, this one can easily be forgotten, but the Chiefs were frustrated with the play of rookie Knile Davis.
The Chiefs looked to be getting into a comfort zone with Davis, a running back and kickoff returner. But against Indianapolis, Davis touched the ball four times and fumbled it twice, losing one.

Davis was a notorious fumbler in college at Arkansas and had trouble holding on to it during off-season practice, training camp and the preseason. But they had gotten better and even scored a touchdown in the three previous games, so the Chiefs thought that perhaps Davis had conquered the problem.
Not so, evidently.
"You can't touch the ball four times a game and put two of them on the ground," Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. "You can't do that. They know that. There's an answer to that. We've identified the problem. We've got to make sure we get that taken care of when things are live.
"He's a pretty conscientious kid, smart kid. I trust he'll get that taken care of."
Davis indicated as much after the game.
"I didn't have two hands on it," Davis said. "You have to have two hands on it at all times. When I get my opportunity, I'm going to be better next week. I'm looking forward to it."
The problem is that Davis has promised before they would solve the problem and they haven't. Davis could eventually be the replacement for Jamaal Charles as the featured back and it would benefit them to know heading into the offseason whether they are indeed capable of that.
That's another reason the Chiefs should sit Charles and play Davis on Sunday in the final regular season game against the Chargers in San Diego. In addition to keeping Charles rested and healthy for the playoffs, the Chiefs can get that good look at Davis.
Give them the ball 25 times. Hand it to him, throw it to him, let them pass protect. For better or for worse.
"Do I think they can step in? Yes," Reid said. "We have to feel that way, because up to this point that's what we've done. If Jamaal ever went down, he's the guy that steps in and goes."
The question for Canada today, tomorrow, and down the road is this: What are the Canadian Forces for? Militaries have two basic purposes for advanced democracies: security and influence. One buys armed forces to defend the country and/or to exert influence in the world. The difficult thing for Canada is that what is best for one purpose may not be best for the other. That is, as a country with a lot of coastlines and only distant threats, modernizing the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Royal Canadian Navy makes a great deal of sense. If that is the priority, then Canada should significantly reduce its army. Funding a modern army at the same time it is funding the rest of the Forces is simply too expensive for Canada given current fiscal patterns.
Graphene polymer battery makes electric cars more power and affordable
The Spanish company Graphenano, along with the University of Cordoba and Grabat Energy, developed a polymeric graphene battery, especially suited for electric cars, that will be cheaper and lighter than conventional batteries and will run 1000km on a 10 minute charge. Graphenano claims that this revolutionary battery will be put into production soon in the end of 2016.
A collaboration between Spanish company Graphenano and its Chinese partner Chint has led to a graphene-polymer battery that surpasses any current lithium-ion battery, and it could soon replace batteries in many uses like in domestic use and electric cars.
Graphenano based in Yecla (Murcia) and they have presented their graphene polymer battery that can largely solve obstacles to the development of the electric car.
They have a partnership with the Chinese company Chint. Chint paid 18 million euros for 10% of the Spanish company.
Polymeric batteries can have a longer lifetime compared to conventional hybrid ones (up to four times!) and due to graphene's light weight, the battery itself will be light enough to improve the electric car's fuel efficiency.
This battery is even supposed to be 77% cheaper than lithium batteries, and it is rumored that prototypes have already been sent to several German car manufacturers, which at this time remain undisclosed.
Back in August 2014, Tesla's CEO said the company is developing a new battery technology that will almost double the capacity of its Li-Ion batteries. It was reported that Tesla is also looking into graphene technology for this project.
According to the “World News” had a message , Spain Graphenano company ( an industrial -scale production of graphene company) developed the first case of polymeric material graphene battery with the University of Cordoba , Spain , and its storage capacity is the best product currently on the market three times with this battery provides power for the electric carcan travel up to 1,000 kilometers, and its charging time of less than 8 minutes .
Graphenano company plans to put into production in 2015 of this battery , and plans with the German car company in two of the four ( now is not convenient to disclose the company name ) will be tested in this month, and electric vehicles.
The star of the current electric car industry car – Tesla chairperson and product architect Alan Musk (Elon Musk) had boldly predicted in an interview with the British car magazine “Auto Express” interview , the future of electric vehicles is expected to reach Mileage about 800 km . The polymeric material graphene battery with the advent of automobile production or joint electric car industry will lead the new mileage.
Production plan graphene polymer battery:
Grabat Energy, a subsidiary of Graphenano will have a plant in Yecla with 20 production lines. They will produce 80 million battery cells. In this first phase, Grabat will have 200 employees and an investment of 30 million euros, contributed equally by Chint and Graphenano.
The second phase will be much more ambitious. The Chinese company will contribute 350 million euros to Graphenano make a second factory in Yecla. They will form a joint venture to market their products in China. It is expected to have a global revenue exceeding 3 billion and 5,000 employees. They will have batteries for home, mobile, aircraft also produce for bicycles, motorbikes, cars and drones. Grabat has achieved a battery with a range of 800 kilometers and a weight of just 100 kilograms that can be loaded into a conventional outlet only one – third the time required by a lithium-ion-lithium equivalent (which are riding automakers in their electric models). Mario Martinez said in a high-density plug “could be loaded in just five minutes.”
Adapted to a car like the Tesla Model S, graphene polymer batteries would increase range from 334 to 1,013 kilometers. In a Nissan Leaf range would increase from 250 to 546 kilometers on a single charge.
The batteries are said to have a density of 1,000 Wh / kg and a voltage of 2,3V. Independent analyses by TÜV and Dekra show that the batteries are safe and are not prone to explosions like lithium batteries.

One thing that I was disappointed about with Trump's executive order was that the ban didn't include refugees from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. These countries harbor terrorists just like Iran, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. 9/11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia. So why not include those two countries with the ban?
USA should take as many refugees as Saudi Arabia did ZERO
Regardless, I have a solution for all the George Soros thugs melting down over the refugee ban. How about this country takes in as many refugees combined as Saudi, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have? Does that sound fair? I think it is. Because these Arab countries have taken in a total of ZERO refugees. Why is that, and why do these Arab countries get no backlash from the Soros goons and the media hacks? Certainly, with all their oil money, Saudi Arabia especially could house thousands of refugees. United Arab Emirates is another very rich middle-eastern country. I'm sure some refugees would love the climate there.
But yet again it's America that gets the blame for not doing their “fair share.” You know what? I'm tired of this left wing antic of doing our fair share. We've taken in enough of the world's outcasts and problems for decades. What did it get us? Hatred, terrorist attacks and a drain on the welfare system.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! No more free lunch!
It's about damn time the rest of these countries, especially middle-eastern countries like Saudi Arabia and UAE did their own fair share.
Dubbed the ANC Project, the partnership between the two companies attempts to bring the same technology found in noise cancelling headphones to a heatsink and fan assembly. In headphones, a microphone picks up external noise, inverts the phase of the waveform and plays it back - resulting in the cancellation of external noise. Technically, not only is the noise still there but there's now equal and opposite new noise - but because the two waveforms are inversions of each other, the ear picks up little more than a slightly hissing silence.Noctua's idea is to take a variant of this core concept, developed by RotoSub back in 2011 for use in fans, and integrate it into an upcoming CPU cooler. While not yet ready for release, the company has been showing off prototype models - and has now published a video that shows just what the system can do.Taking a NH-D14 heatsink, attaching a single NF-A14 140mm fan modified with the FocusedFlow system of the NF-F12 and then integrating the RotoSub Active Noise Cancellation system, the single-fan dual-tower cooler is claimed to offer class-beating cooling performance at significantly reduced noise levels. In the video demonstration, the hum of the fan is clearly as an irritating whine - a whine which almost completely disappears when the noise cancellation system is activated.The system works, in the absence of handy speakers, by causing tiny vibrations in the blades of the fan using an electromagnetic coil built into the housing and a small magnet at the tip of each blade. An in-built microphone listens to the noise that the fan is making, then adjusts these vibrations to cancel it out - resulting the pretty dramatic noise reduction that is present in the video.It's a clever concept, but one that Noctua may struggle to sell: for those who want silent cooling, passive cases exist - and low-noise pumps offer quiet water-cooling for those with more powerful components to tame. The CPU fan is often not the loudest component of a system, either, with most high-end graphics cards easily drowning it out when under load.That said, if Noctua does release the ANC Project cooler as a retail product, there's nothing to stop it offering aftermarket coolers for graphics cards with the same technology embedded - and with RotoSub offering the system to anyone willing to pay for a licence, it could become a standard feature of high-end gear in the future.If you're not convinced as to the benefits of the system, Noctua's promotional video - followed by a live demonstration of the prototype - is embedded below, and more information is available on the company's website
A Vancouver Island native has been chosen as the winner of a contest that will see them live at Vancouver International Airport for 80 days and 80 nights.
Jaeger Mah, 29, received more than 4,000 online votes in the Live@YVR contest — more than double those of their closest competitor.
Armed with a camera and editing equipment, Mah will spend 80 days uncovering stories and sharing their experiences of living at an airport full time — all without leaving its Sea Island home — live online.
"We were thrilled to see the level of public engagement that we did, with more than 8,000 votes cast for the five fabulous Live@YVR finalists," said Rebecca Catley with the Vancouver Airport Authority.
"Now we are encouraging those voters, and all British Columbians, to send their story ideas to Jaeger via Facebook and Twitter. Maybe you'd like to know the strangest cargo ever shipped out of YVR, or how many litres of paint it takes to mark the runway lines … Now's your chance to ask."
In their video entry for the contest, Mah dubbed themselves "the Anderson Cooper of YVR" and shared what they believe makes Vancouver International Airport so spectacular: its people.
"The aspect I'm most excited about is the challenge of immersing myself in the roles of some of YVR's most interesting jobs, adapting to each environment and showcasing the lives and personalities of the people that make it work," Mah said.
"It takes workers to run an organization, but it takes people to give it a heart. I'm so excited that it will be me that gets to unfold the amazing stories behind every person, place and thing in the YVR community."
Mah's assignment includes accommodations at the Fairmont Vancouver Airport, in a suite with floor-to-ceiling views of the runways.
Mah grew up in Port Alberni, on Vancouver Island, and now lives in Vancouver. They recently started their own video production business, which will be on hold during the Live@YVR assignment.
Mah's 80-day stint at the airport begins Aug. 17.
Stephen King fans are hoping they can get the author of the clown horror story It and 53 other novels to consider running for political office.
Among them are the state's most recent former governor, two-term Democrat John Baldacci, who told the Washington Examiner, "Stephen would win any office they decided to run for in Maine."
"I would be out there handing out fliers and putting on bumper stickers for him," said Baldacci, who left office after eight years in 2011. "He's been a big asset for the state of Maine and for a lot of people who look for common sense in the wilderness."
There are clear opportunities in Democratic-leaning Maine. The pugnacious Republican Gov. Paul LePage, an ardent Trump supporter, is term-limited and will be replaced in an election next year while centrist GOP Sen. Susan Collins is up for re-election in 2020.
King, a Democrat, has been active in the political debate this year, often challenging the policies of President Trump and the Republican Party. Trump blocked them on Twitter in June, and the author has repeatedly called for their removal from office.
"If any other prez had done half the things Trump has done...a third...a fucking TENTH...he'd be gone like Enron. What's happened to us?" King said in a July tweet.
After Trump blamed "both sides" for violence in August between white supremacists and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Va., they tweeted, "Trump must be removed. Republicans, stand up to this obscene man."
King has been the target of sporadic recruitment efforts of varying seriousness for years.
"Please run for Governor," a fan tweeted at them last week, responding to their most recent criticism of Trump on immigration and North Korea.
"@StephenKing - we need u 2 run 4 the Blaine House! Only YOU understand the Horror Show that is our current governor!" another person tweeted, referring to the Maine governor's mansion. Last year, King called LePage "a bigot, a homophobe and a racist."
Some prominent Democrats are reluctant to discuss a theoretical candidacy, however, noting King has shot down attempts to recruit them to run for governor in the past, saying in 2015 "if nominated I will not run, and if elected, I will not serve."
James Tierney, a former Maine attorney general who is friendly with King, declined to speculate on whether the author would seek office. They said they had not discussed the possibility, but King "has my number" if they are interested.
The state Republican Party, meanwhile, humorously brushed off a possible King candidacy with "It" movie puns.
"We have to assume this is just some people clowning around, putting some trial balloons out for attention for liberal Mr. King," said Maine GOP executive director Jason Savage. "Mr. King's rabid fan base might like this rumor, but Mr. King's election would be a hard case given their very liberal positions."
King did not immediately respond to an interview request. But Jordan Hahn, webmaster of StephenKing.com, pointed to their 2015 quote expressing no interest in political office and said, "Stephen is still of that mindset."
Marsha DeFilippo, King's assistant, said in an email that "Stephen does not have any plans to run for public office."
Still, Baldacci — also a Bangor native — said if they change their mind, there's a clear path to victory, describing little-known acts of charity and saying the state appreciates straight talk.
"You've got somebody who's not beholden to financial interests, someone who's an independent thinker, somebody's who's all about Maine — I think you've got a winner there," they said. "He's authentic, he's not a phony and you've got to appreciate the honesty they bring to the debate."
As most of you who have been reading this blog for a while know (and for those of you who are new comers, I expect that makes this an introduction) I am probably more than a little bit obsessed with my mood charting.
Since my last round of mood-charting posts (Chart Week) I've been introduced to another charting technique that is seriously tickling my fancy. I spent the better part of my weekend translating a block of time from my earlier charts & data to compile a chart using this new technique to get an interesting new overview.
This technique was inspired by a friend who is tracking the sleep patterns of their new baby by shading in areas on a grid of squares. Them chart is hourly, but it struck me to make a daily chart with the same technique. Instead of shading in or not shading in a square to denote action, I've chosen a series of colors to reflect what action has taken place.
The result looks something like this:
Each band represents a month, with each square representing a day. You can see that some days are broken into two or three pieces, and that is because those days contained sometimes two or three easily distinguishable periods of different moods.
The breakdown of the colors is as such:
Dk Blue = severe depression
Lt Blue = mild-moderate depression
Green = stable/normal mood
Yellow = hypomania
Red = full mania (possibly including psychosis of some kind)
Brown = moderate mixed episodes
Black = severe mixed episode (possibly including psychosis of some kind)
Empty = no data available
Needless to say, it becomes very clear that the first few months shown on this chart were no walk in the park. There is a pretty big shift you can see in October 2011 where I began having my first big chunks of stability that I had in months (in fact, far beyond what is shown here). I'd be willing to venture that played a large role in the birth of this blog, as that is when it began.
It appears that cycling has begun slowing down as well, which is definitely a good thing (more full big blocks instead of little choppy ones) though things were definitely shaken up again down at the very bottom in June, last month, when I began taking Trileptal.
It can be difficult for me to see patterns in mood charting with the traditional line graph -primarily periods of episodes. By classifying my mood ratings by the type of episode I am in at the time and placing them side by side, it becomes much easier for me to see periods of several days within one mood, or where one mood continues through several chunks broken up by a day or two with a different mood.
Since the DSM classifies episodes as a block of time with the majority of days in a period of time in a certain mood, the color-band mood chart has definitely helped my understanding of the length of my episodes and how they interact with one another.
One of the conundrums I have is that I do not have many squares containing red (full manic moods), which means I technically would not have enough to quantify a “full manic episode” (which must take place over a number of days) and therefor would not qualify me for the the diagnosis of Bipolar Type I. However, the fact that these manic moods occur at all means (as far as I have been told) that I do not qualify for the diagnosis of Bipolar Type II (where full mania is not present). This is a situation where I am hoping this chart will help my medical team's understanding of what I deal with on a daily basis.
The best part, I think, about this charting technique is that all you need is some graph paper and some colored pens or pencils. Heck, even crayons. If you are starting this fresh and coloring one square daily, it may take a while before you have any significant chunks of information to look at, but it is easy to use any past data from other mood charting techniques to create one of these charts with information you've already gathered!
As I mentioned, I am totally tickled by this. I am going to bring mine to my next appointment with my psychiatrist (Thursday), I am hoping this will give them a better overview as well since we've both been struggling a little with the sporadic nature of my episodes. I'd really love it if someone else wants to throw one of these together and either write a post about it or shoot me an email, I'm really just curious to know what someone else's chart would look like!

Russia spent £470m on foreign aid last year, the lowest of all the G8 nations. But its status as a 're-emerging donor' reveals its desire to maintain influence and rebuild its public image
Russia spent $472.32m on foreign aid in 2010, according to the Russian ministry of finance's report released in advance of this week's G8 summit in Deauville, France.
The country's aid spending, according to the report, dropped from $785m in 2009 to $472.32m in 2010 – a decrease of 40%. However, Russia had only temporarily increased its aid budget in 2009 to soften the blow of the global financial and economic crises, particularly in the neighbouring former Soviet republics, the report says.
Though Russia has the smallest aid budget of the G8 bloc, it is often called a "re-emerging" donor. The Soviet Union provided massive amounts of aid for several decades during the Cold War – some $26bn in 1986 alone – but Russia became a net recipient of assistance in the 1990s after the fall of communism. Until last year, Russia was a recipient of UK aid.
A Russian government strategy paper, from 2007, about foreign aid policy set an annual spending target of $400-500m and talked about setting up a specialised government aid agency. "Present-day realities of global policy and economy and Russia's status of a superpower suggest that Russia could pursue a more active policy in international development assistance, including an increase in government spending for these purposes," it said. Emerging market rival Brazil already has its own aid agency and South Africa launches its development partnership agency this year.
Priorities for Russian overseas aid last year included food security and health programmes, with $98.2m for agricultural training and technology in African countries, and more than $80m on global health programmes in developing nations.
Unlike aid from many of the other large economies, most Russian development assistance is channeled through multilateral organisations, including the World Bank, the UN, and global initiatives to stimulate industry investment for vaccine research and development. More than 60% of Russian aid for global food security initiatives last year was channelled through multilateral organisations.
Russia has been up-front about the role it hopes its aid budget will play in maintaining its regional influence and rebuilding its public image. However, Andrei Bokarev, the head of international financial relations at the Finance Ministry, said in January that the government needs to do more to publicise Russia's aid programme because it doesn't get enough media coverage.
But as other G8 countries, including the US and Britain, struggle to make the case for development aid to a domestic public increasingly affected by budget cuts, Russia is experiencing its own special challenges, with one in eight Russians living below the official poverty line and millions unemployed.
"Russia is becoming a major provider of development assistance for low-income countries in the region," says the World Bank. "Yet development also remains a domestic imperative." In 2008, official poverty rates ranged from 38% in Kalmykia (in the south) to 7.4% in oil-rich Khanty-Mansiysk.
Despite the domestic problems, Russia has said the role of its foreign aid is to "strengthen the credibility of Russia and promote an unbiased attitude to the Russian Federation in the international community". A more consistent policy on international development would help strengthen its international position, said its 2007 strategy paper, and could spur Russia's domestic development by promoting trade and economic cooperation with countries that receive Russian aid. And, it added, a strong development policy could promote a "belt of good neighbourliness" along Russian borders and help address issues from drug trafficking to cross-border crime.
In response to the global financial and economic crises, Russia backed the creation of a multi-billion dollar crisis response fund to help to struggle neighbours. Through the fund, Russia gave Tajikistan a $63m grant last year. And between 2006 and 2009, Russia put together a multi-million dollar package to develop health systems in neighbouring republics, in response to the threat of an influenza pandemic. More than 40 laboratory facilities in the region were re-fitted and upgraded, and 200 specialists were trained on influenza surveillance and response.
Last week, leading development charities accused the G8 of "cooking the books" in its annual accountability report, released in advance of the Deauville summit. The charities said the report covered up broken promises to the world's poor by ignoring the impact of inflation. But unlike other members of the G8 – the US, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada – Russia did not make specific commitments for aid to Africa at the 2005 Gleneagles summit and does not submit its aid figures to the OECD, which monitors progress on aid pledges.
In 2007, Russia committed to the UN aid spending target of 0.7% of gross national income (GNI), though set no specific timeframe for meeting the target. If it had met the 0.7% target in 2009, Russia would have been the world's 6th largest aid donor, with a budget of $9.27bn.
America has a new President . The world is currently in shambles about Donald Trump being elected and there are a group of people within the U.S. who are bracing for the worst. The issue is so concerning for some that a specific group of people have shared mental health and emotional advice on Twitter so as to fight any signs of trauma that might have surfaced post Trump's victory.
It must be noted that Trump is largely considered to be a misogynist, racist and several other things, which has raised alarm bells for liberals in the U.S. There are suicide hotline numbers being shared for those who have the tendency to harm themselves. Such is the impact of having Trump as the President of the United States .
Brianna Wu, who went through enormous amount of online abuse during the infamous “Gamergate”, also took to the platform to share some advice on how to fight through this. Wu was instrumental in the passing of a new cybercriminal law enforcement legislation to combat cyberbullies.
If you know someone who is currently going through something similar, it would help to talk to them, make sure they're eating well and socializing with others. Remember, this too shall pass.

Union Taco, which has a location in Manayunk and Flourtown, is celebrating Day of the Dead with a taco promotion. On Nov. 2, the restaurant will serve $2 beef tacos all day to those who dine-in, which is a decent deal.
However, Union Taco is also offering a way to score free tacos for life -- the best four words to hear. The first five people willing to ink Union Taco's logo onto their body will receive one free taco every day for the rest of their life, as well as up to 10 free tacos on Nov. 2.
Here's the logo:
Courtesy of Union Taco/PhillyVoice Willing to ink this on your body?
Customers must post a picture of their tattoo on Union Taco's Facebook page and go into the restaurant on Nov. 2 to identify themselves.
"They'll also receive an 'arm wash test' to verify that it's not henna or ink," chef Nick Farina stated in a press release.
The idea might seem out there, but it's not the first time a restaurant has offered free food in exchange for a tattoo promoting the brand.
On Oct. 13, &pizza opened in Center City and promised free pizza to those who got the brand's signature ampersand inked on them.
So, the real question is: how far are you willing to go for free food?

I really don't know what to say, I'm genuinely blown away by my gifts, thank you so much.
I got the baked goods gift on Friday, and I was so excited opening it because I didn't know what to expect, but I'd never expected something that good. It was so sweet, and thoughtful and generous and when I told my fiancée about it, I think they were even more excited than me!
Santa is a baker at a family baker in Fife, Scotland called Fisher & Donaldson, who do some amazing things - http://www.fisheranddonaldson.com/Site/Welcome.html
And if you are in the local area, I urge you to check them out, because they are the people behind the hot food vending machines in St Andrews, which might be the greatest thing I've ever heard.
I wanted to take photos and upload them straight away, but I decided to be patient and wait for the Royal Mail delivery, and that has just arrived in the last few minutes and I'm almost speechless. The book is so perfect, I had to check Amazon to make sure that I hadn't ordered it for myself and forgotten about it.
I can't believe I got such wonderful presents from a stranger, it's like you have known me all my life!
In a sense, many of us have no choice but to delay putting money into the market. Investing gradually and steadily — through workplace payroll deduction plans — is the best we can do. We're saving and investing precisely so we can accumulate that money. (A nice thing about investing gradually is that when the market falls, we buy at cheaper prices.)
Nonetheless, assuming that we have the luxury of making a choice, over the long run, the data suggests that we would be better off investing in a diversified stock portfolio all at once.
Bernstein Global Research recently conducted its own study of the subject, and was able to quantify some of the cost of investing gradually. Using the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and its predecessors, Bernstein examined the rolling one-year returns of the stock market through 12-month periods from the beginning of 1926 to the end of 2013 — a total of more than 1,000 such periods. It compared lump-sum investments made at the beginning of each period with stock purchases made through “dollar-cost averaging” — regular monthly investments in the S.&P. 500 for 12 months. Money on the sidelines stayed in three-month Treasury bills.
The firm found that the average one-year return was 12.2 percent for immediate investments into the stock index, 8.1 percent for the dollar-cost-averaging portfolios and 3.6 percent for the cash holdings. The penalty for investing gradually, in other words, was 4.1 percentage points. On the other hand, that gradual approach was 4.5 points better than just holding cash.
There is no doubt that if you had been able to time the market perfectly, deliberately avoiding big declines and investing only at market bottoms, you would have been even better off. “We'd all like to do that,” Mr. Bosse of Vanguard said. “But no one can. We don't think it's worth even attempting to go down that road.”
Bad timing happens by accident, though. If you had moved money into the stock market right before a major market peak, you would have been staring at big paper losses immediately.
How bad would those numbers have looked? For a concrete answer, I asked Mr. Masters to sift through their data and find the worst cases among the 12-month periods their firm analyzed.
So, my wonderful Santa sent me a message right away to ask me more about my preferences (what kind of paper, pencil and led I liked), and kept sending me messages to update me on the status (they shipped a little late but only because they wanted to make sure I got an awesome package - and I love getting late gifts anyway), and even offering to include some candy in the package for me! Pens and stationery AND snacks? I think I just got two exchanges for the price of one!
As you can see from one of the images, some water damage occurred during transport, but fortunately everything but the letter was intact - and even that I could still make out most of, so no real harm done.
You know when you're doing exchanges and you keep thinking that someone might be your Santa based on what they're posting? Well, this time I was right.. I remember reading a post by /u/zarlune a while ago about shopping for journals, and thinking they (I'm assuming) could totally be my Santa! And they are! :-D
Well, enough preamble, on to the goodies:
A absolutely gorgeous journal - I mean seriously, if I could choose out of *all the journals, I'd probably pick this one. It's so me! Also includes a beautiful bookmark (I love books!) and magnet in the same style.
*A really nice mechanical pencil with refills (I said in my preferences that I preferred mechanical pencils and ballpoints).
*A set of super smooth ballpoint pens. I've truly never had a pen this smooth before!
*Two mini notebooks - I love these, they're so handy I can put them in my pocket if I like. I'm totally going to keep one in my backpack and one in my purse so I can instantly write down any ideas that come to me. Can also be used for small quick sketches.
*And then there was candy! Two bars of Lindt dark chocolate, one with sea salt and one with caramel AND sea salt - I love salted chocolate and caramel, it's like one of my favourite things ever! And these almond roca things are delicious!
As if that is not enough, they even offered to send me the original journal that didn't arrive in time (thus the delay) when it eventually gets there!
/u/zarlune, you are truly awesome, thank you so much, I love everything!
BASHIQA, Iraq (Reuters) - Abu Mahmoud, part of a 2,500-man predominantly Sunni Arab force pulled together to launch an offensive against Islamic State in the Iraqi city of Mosul, has heard from relatives the group has been threatening to behead anyone who speaks of “liberation”.
That threat has not discouraged them but they are worried about a lack of support from the Shi'ite-led central government.
“The most important thing we need is weapons and government support,” said Abu Mahmoud, 42, who like others interviewed at a training camp in Bashiqa in northern Iraq, declined to give their full name for fear of reprisals.
Abu Mahmoud, who covers their face so that Islamic State militants don't target their family, hopes they and other men in the National Mobilisation force will capture Mosul and rescue its residents in an operation expected to start within weeks.
The Iraqi army, along with Kurdish peshmerga fighters, will take the lead in one of Iraq's most important offensives in years, with the aim of clearing Islamic State from its last major stronghold and promoting long-term stability.
But complaints from fighters and commanders in the National Mobilisation force about lack of weapons from the Baghdad government highlights sectarian faultlines that could undermine the offensive and chances for sectarian and ethnic harmony.
Iraq has descended into civil war, mainly between Shi'ites and Sunnis, since a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.
The force, that trains about five hours a day at the camp, was patched together by former Mosul governor and Sunni politician Atheel al-Nujaifi in 2014, not long after Islamic State swept through northern Iraq, virtually unopposed by an army riddled with corruption.
Nujaifi purchased used weapons for the fighters in markets, according to their commanders.
After the camp came under heavy Islamic State rocket fire, Turkish trainers positioned six tanks along the edge of the compound in May 2015.
While the men have benefited from the training, Shi'ite Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi warned Turkey's military presence in Iraq could spark a regional war.
Last week, Turkey's parliament voted to extend its military presence in Iraq for a further year to take on what it called “terrorist organizations”.
PRIMED FOR BATTLE
At first glance, the fighters seemed disciplined in their crisp military uniforms and flak vests.
Many of the commanders are former army officers who served under Saddam Hussein.
Others abandoned their posts during Islamic State's lightning sweep through Mosul and the rest of Nineveh Governorate that at one point seemed to even threaten Baghdad.
“There are two rocket types,” said instructor Mishaan al-Jibouri, as a group of men sat and listened. “This is what you do if it jams.”

The occasional boom of training mortars could be heard echoing off nearby mountains, in a pastoral setting where teenage shepherds on donkeys guided their flock.
The Turks provide basic training but the focus is on urban warfare. The United States also provided training earlier this year and took part in a few joint raids on Islamic State targets, said the Iraqi commanders.
The leader of the camp, General Mohamed Yehya, said there are 2,500 men primed for battle, and with proper support they could muster twice as many fighters.
“Baghdad gives support only for Shi'ites, not Sunnis. We believe we are one. Iraq is our country,” said Yehya, sitting in a small command center which included a colorful mockup of the battlefield.
Yehya, 59, is still bitter about the disbanding of the Iraqi army in 2003 by the United States. They believe that was the first step to weaken Sunnis, who dominated positions of authority under Saddam.
“The government doesn't give direct support to the National Mobilization (force) because it is not part of the Popular Mobilization and there is no coordination between the two,” said a government spokesperson in Baghdad.
The mostly Iran-backed, Shi'ite-led Popular Mobilization force falls theoretically under the command of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.
“While Shi'ites make up a majority in the Popular Mobilisation, it also has in its ranks Sunnis,” the spokesperson added, denying allegations that the government is only supporting Shi'ites, and not Sunnis.
They said of 110,000 men in the Popular Mobilisation force, 25,000 to 30,000 are Sunnis.
PERSONAL STAKE
The Sunni force has already put itself at risk, setting up the camp 13 kilometers from the frontline with Islamic State.
Several shrapnel holes in the walls of the command room at the camp had been plugged with plaster, a reminder of a flurry of Islamic State rocket attacks earlier this year.
Back on the training ground, an officer was holding up an AK-47 assault rifle as fighters sat on the ground and looked on.
The camp trains mostly Sunni Arabs but there are also some Kurds, Shi'ites and Yazidis, whose community was singled out by Islamic State for particularly harsh persecution.
Hundreds were executed and many Yazidi women were captured and raped or used as sex slaves.
Abu Mourad, a Yazidi sniper, describes themselves as a hunter of Islamic State. The group beheaded one of their cousins and threw another off a building in Mosul, they said.
Many fighters believe they have the highest stake in the battle because they are from Mosul and have friends and relatives who were killed by the group.

Ali Ahmed argues that this personal stake in the fight means the force should lead the offensive and take firm control of Mosul, uncompromising talk that underlines the potential for sectarian strife.
“We want to stay in the province no matter what and not give it up until death,” they said. “We are going to settle scores. We won't let them live. We want to butcher them.”

Thanks to technologies like Microsoft's Kinect, we're getting closer than ever before to being able to interact with our computers by simply waving our hands in the air. But what if you want to wave my PC on or off even if you're not in front of a camera? Believe it or not, the technology may be coming soon and its core, Wi-Fi routers, are already likely to be in your home or office.
University of Washington (UW) computer scientists have developed gesture-recognition technology, WiSee, that's well on its way to making Iron Man or Minority Report-style science-fiction computer interaction a step closer to reality.
It turns out that with existing Wi-Fi hardware you can re-purpose "wireless signals that already exist in new ways. You can actually use wireless for gesture recognition without needing to deploy more sensors," said lead researcher Shyam Gollakota, a UW assistant professor of computer science and engineering.
It's not perfect yet. The UW researchers claim that the average accuracy is 94 percent with a standard deviation of 4.6 percent when classifying between nine gestures and up to five individuals in an apartment-sized space. Still, for something that's still a laboratory experiment, that's impressive.
UW also claims that their "technology is simpler, cheaper [than Kinect and similar video-gesture user-interface devices." The only "new" technology that's needed to make it work is a “smart” receiver device that listens to Wi-Fi transmissions. This receiver could be little more than an existing multiple-input/multiple output (MIMO) 802.11n Wi-Fi router with a firmware update.
“This is the first whole-home gesture recognition system that works without either requiring instrumentation of the user with sensors or deploying cameras in every room,” claimed Qifan Pu, a WiSee collaborator.
WiSee works by detecting the slight changes in Wi-Fi signal as you move. Just moving your hand or foot can cause enough of a Doppler frequency shift for the system to recognize your movement as a command. So, for example, you could make a motion that tells the system that you're about to issue an order and then make the actual command.
This could be as simple as "Start the coffee-maker," or start a chain of commands such as "Turn on the PCs and download last night's data from the branch servers."
The project is based on earlier work done by two of the UW researchers with Microsoft Research on a pair of projects with similar goals--SoundWave, which uses sound, and Humantenna, which uses radiation from a home or office's electrical wires--to track users' motions. WiSee stands out from these earlier gesture-recognition systems because it can be used throughout a small office or house instead of a single room.
The technology will be shown in public for the first time at the 19th annual MobiCom in Miami, Florida in late September and early October. Sometime after that, we may start seeing smart-homes and smart-offices to go with our smartphones.

I know that when something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Not only do I know this adage, I also subscribe to it. It works all the time!
But, there is always but… The adage says probably. It doesn't say always. If it said “always is” I would have an issue with that. Just like I have an issue with another adage: “There is no such thing as free lunch”! What? You won't believe how many free lunches, dinners and breakfasts I've had in my travels. Not even mentioning free booze.
Whoever came up with too good to be true thingy was a wise person. Because the word probably makes all the difference in the world. It means, amazing things can happen. It also means, there is a difference between incredible and impossible. Between something that takes some effort and something that simply cannot be done no matter what.
Now, I'm telling you once again: flying for free to and from Brazil during the World Cup can be done! For some, it can be done easily, while for others it would require an effort. However, any American with good credit can do it. A-ny-one!
How dare I tell you with a straight face that you can go to Brazil for free for the World Cup? Don't I know how many airlines gouge for the privilege?
Believe me, I do. I do have an internet connection, and it is not a pretty picture.
But (and again, there is always but), this picture doesn't show you the whole picture, so to speak. You are not going to pay for the ticket anyway, you are going to get it for free. Well, I hope you don't mind paying some taxes, and don't worry, they are on a smallish side.
Please read my previous posts on the subject before you continue.
If You Want to Go to the 2014 World Cup, You Might Be Upset Right Now
Spend Your Soon-To-Be Devalued United Miles on an Award Flight to the World Cup in Brazil!
The business class award availability from my second post is gone by now; instead we have some cheap economy seats. All you need is 60,000 United Airlines Mileage Plus miles, and you're all set. If you don't have these miles in your account, I'll tell you how to get them at the end of the post. So let's begin with the introduction.
Right now, if you are trying to get to Brazil from the US, it's very difficult. See this picture.
Why United? The United Mileage Plus program is the only one that's going to work for us. Situation with Delta and American is even worse, because they are blocking cheap awards to Brazil outright. If you're not familiar with United calendar, that's fine. Here is what you need to know.
GREEN IS GOOD. It means both economy and business seats are available.
YELLOW IS GOOD also. It means economy seats are available.
BLUE IS NOT GOOD. It means only business/first class seats are available and they cost at least twice as many miles as coach.
In our example, the economy seat is only available for July 5. If that works for you and you have the miles, book it now. You will worry later about the flight back. If it doesn't work for you, or if you don't have at least 30,000 miles, keep reading.
The United calendar is a bit quirky in that it doesn't show you all the routes you can use. It's probably the best online award calendar out there, but it's not perfect. So sometimes we need to give it an extra nudge.
I was playing around with some Latin American city pairs. You see, it's quite easy to get anywhere to Latin America from the States–anywhere except Brazil during the World Cup because every airline is either blocking almost all award seats (like United), or charges double miles like American. So I tried a few options.
First, I tried to get to Brazil from Lima. No dice.
Next, I attempted Santiago, Chile. Excellent availability, but then I noticed it would route the flight via Buenos Aires. So I tried direct flight from Buenos Aires to San Paulo and hit the jackpot.
And here is availability from New York to Buenos Aires.
In order to put together this trip you would have to search awards by “Multiple Destinations”. First enter: NYC-EZE, then EZE-GRU. You're flying to Buenos Aires on Copa and from Buenos Aires to Brazil on Turkish Airlines (nope, not a typo). Here is what your final availability will look like (click):
The “back home” availability is decent enough, so no trickery is required by now. But if you find availability dwindling you can always use reverse engineering to get a flight back. I used NYC in my example because I live here. Try it from your city and see what happens.
Grand total: 60,000 miles and $96.13 in taxes. You decide if saving over $1,500 is worth a little effort.
Now, is a similar trick possible with hotels? Normally, my answer would be resounding yes, but not during the World Cup. The way they have blocked every hotel so far, I doubt we'd be able to stay on loyalty points. We might get lucky as the time marches on, but I believe renting a short-term apartment is the best way to go. Re-read my FTG post again to see what I'm planning to do about it (first link above) and see if it would work for you.
Now, I promised to tell you how to get 60,000 miles quickly if you don't have them already. So this is what you do.
1. Sign up for United Mileage Plus program at United.com.
2. Log in with your new number (provided you're not a member already) and see what kind of credit card offer from United you get. You might get 30,000 miles, which is standard offer or up to 55,000, which is a very special offer for special people. Just kidding.
3. You will most likely get 30,000 offers, so don't sign up for it just yet. Read this Flyertalk thread VERY CAREFULLY and follow the instructions. If you get the 55,000 offer (extra 5,000 for adding an authorized user) you're almost done. Make sure you add an additional cardholder and charge $5,000 to your card. You only need to charge $2,000 in 3 months to get the points, but that will get you only 57K, and you need 60K. Remember that you get at least 1 point for every $1 you charge on the card.
If you have carefully followed the instructions but still can't get the 55K offer to show up (remember to apply in a cookie-free environment like Chrome Incognito or IE In Private), sign up for Chase Sapphire Preferred (find the link on my Best Credit Cards for Free Flights page). It currently offers up to 55,000 miles.
If you get the 55,000 CSP offer, you're almost done. Make sure you add an additional cardholder and charge $5,000 to your card. You only need to charge $3,000 in 3 months to get the points, but that will get you only 58K, and you need 60K. Remember that you get at least 1 point for every $1 you charge on the card. Transfer your 60K points to your United account and book your flight.
4. If you can't get either offer, consider signing up for two cards: the lesser 30,000-mile offer from United and the 40,000-mile offer from CSP. Whatever you do, do not forget to meet your spend requirement or you won't get any miles.
Is it possible the availability won't be there by the time you're ready to book your flight? Of course, it's possible. It's every bit as possible as that something new will most certainly open up. America is not a soccer country. The hype will subside, and you will be able to book the flight anyway.
And if I'm terribly wrong (and I don't think I am), you will still be left with your 60,000 miles you can use for another epic trip. I would like to say something snappy like No venture–no gain, but really, where is the venture?
Questions? Shoot!

Sunil Gavaskar backs Sourav Ganguly as perfect candidate for interim BCCI President
New Delhi: Legendary batsman Sunil Gavaskar on Tuesday backed former national team captain Sourav Ganguly to take over as interim president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The BCCI is currently undergoing an administrative crisis following the sacking of President Anurag Thakur and Secretary Ajay Shirke by the Supreme Court. Both Thakur and Shirke were on Monday removed from their posts for their failure to implement the Justice RM Lodha committee‘s recommendations in running the board. Following the duo's ouster, various names have cropped up to take over the reigns of the national cricket board.
Since the sacking of the duo, many names including that of Ganguly – the current Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) President – have been doing the rounds to succeed Thakur on an interim basis. Ganguly also fits the bill as the Lodha Committee, in its initial recommendations, had stressed that former players should administer the BCCI. “BCCI has got very good bench strength to take up the bigger roles and one name that comes to my mind is Sourav Ganguly,” Gavaskar was quoted as saying by NDTV news channel. “Remember, in 1999-2000 when Indian cricket was gripped by the match-fixing saga, Ganguly was given the Indian team captaincy and they turned it around,” the diminutive former opener added.
A bench of Chief Justice TS Thakur, Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice DY Chandrachud in their order said that as an interim arrangement, the senior most Vice President of the BCCI would act as the President and the Joint Secretary would be the Secretary. Ganguly, however is not a vice-president and would even complete a three-year tenure in office in CAB and hence could be ineligible for the post.
Russian security forces said on Saturday that they had killed seven suspected terrorists in an operation in Russia's North Caucasus region of Dagestan which has been plagued by an Islamist insurgency.
Security forces launched a special operation after receiving information that men linked to criminal groups were in a building in the capital Makhatchkala, the National Anti-Terror Committee (NAK) said.
Russian news agencies quoted it as saying that “seven neutralized bandits were found” in the building.
The men belonged to a terrorist group behind attacks against the police and had been extorting money from local businesses to fund their terrorist activities, the statement said.
The Kremlin is fighting a deadly insurgency against Islamist rebels in the North Caucasus, with unrest particularly intense in the largely Muslim Dagestan.
Armed incidents and attacks against the authorities and security forces are particularly common in the restive, mountainous region neighboring Chechnya.
Moscow has fought two wars against separatists in Chechnya, and the violence subsequently spread throughout the predominantly Muslim region.

Millions of years before Vikings crossed the Atlantic, crocodiles swam thousands of kilometres from Africa to colonise the Americas.
The finding comes from the most complete evolutionary tree of the genus Crocodylus, featuring all but one of the living crocodile species. Evon Hekkala of Fordham University in New York and colleagues sequenced mitochondrial genomes of all 11 species, eight of which had not had their mitochondrial DNA sequenced before.
This revealed that all four American species are most closely related to the Nile crocodiles of east Africa, and must have split away roughly 7 million years ago, long after Africa and South America began drifting apart 130 million years ago. By 7 million years ago, over 2800 kilometres of ocean lay between the two continents.
Palaeontologists have long suspected that crocodiles swam the Atlantic, but Hekkala's finding is “strong evidence in support of that scenario”, says Christopher Brochu of the University of Iowa in Iowa City.

Crocodiles are salt-tolerant and can go up to six months without eating. What's more, females can carry viable sperm for several months after mating, which means a single female could have crossed the Atlantic and produced a litter on the other side. It's unlikely that a single such event would have given rise to all American crocodiles. But Hekkala points out that animals that got lost at sea off the coast of Africa may well have been carried across on the westward-flowing equatorial currents.

When the New York Rangers signed Kevin Shattenkirk as a free agent in July, the organization believed it strengthened its defense. It hasn't looked that way recently.
Kevin Shattenkirk has been struggling recently, giving the puck away and making some poor decisions. On Thursday night, with more of the same thing occurring, Shattenkirk found themselves in an unusual place—on the bench!
On the Devils second goal of the game by Blake Coleman, as the Rangers were on a power play, Shattenkirk gave up the puck as they tried to skate around the Devils' Pavel Zacha. Blake Coleman picked it up and scored a shorthanded goal to tie the game at two.
These mistakes have been a reoccurring theme for Shattenkirk recently. The situation reached its breaking point in the third period when Alain Vigneault decided to keep Shattenkirk on the bench.
For the game, Shattenkirk played a total of 16:23. In the third period, they only had six shifts for a total of 3:20. Not the kind of minutes you would expect from a top defenseman in the NHL. To add to the tough night at the rink, Shattenkirk took two minor penalties.
Surprisingly, Shattenkirk played the last 1:08 of overtime when the Rangers had a power play and Vigneault was trying to avoid the shootout. But that didn't happen and the Devils won the contest in the shootout on a winning goal by former Ranger Brian Boyle.
Now the Rangers have to determine if Shattenkirk's success on offense outweighs their poor defense.
In 34 games, Shattenkirk has five goals and 17 assists for 22 points—but he's also a minus-five. Of the five goals, two have been scored on the power play. Nine of their 17 assists have come on the power play. Three goals and eight assists at even strength in 34 games are not what was expected of Shattenkirk when the year began.
Is it possible that Washington Capitals head coach Barry Trotz was correct when they said Shattenkirk wasn't a top-tier defenseman?
Is Kevin Shattenkirk a first-pair blueliner? Depends on who you ask: Capitals coach Barry Trotz doesn't think so https://t.co/C33TYKiNAQ #Rangers pic.twitter.com/1XFeBlYTzf — Newsday Sports (@NewsdaySports) December 8, 2017
“I think everybody thought of them as a 1-2, and they really aren't. They were a little lower,” Trotz told Steve Zipay of Newsday. The comment hurt Shattenkirk to no one's surprise. With their play more visible in the city that never sleeps, the question of what kind of player Shattenkirk is has begun to get asked once again.
Here's the honest answer: Shattenkirk is not a top-tier defenseman. That is is this writer's opinion. They tend to have a lot of trouble when they face pressure and they aren't quick with the puck, which gives the opposition plenty of opportunities to cause a turnover—the asupervisorstioned Coleman goal on Thursday night serves as a prime example. Shattenkirk also isn't that aggressive when battling on the boards or in front of the net.
These are not new problems. Looking back at their time in Washington, they had the same issues, but they only skated in 19 games with the Caps. Here in New York, the mistakes glow through the arena.
Shattenkirk's best asset is their ability to create something on the power play. When they play with Mika Zibanejad, the power play was ranked in the top 10 in the NHL. When Zibanejad was injured, the power play struggled, even with Shattenkirk leading the team from the point. The power play needs Kevin to be on top of their game if it is going to be more productive then last season.
Shattenkirk has to improve in all aspects of their game if they want to get to be the top defenseman for the Rangers. Vigneault has given them plenty of time to adjust to their system and to playing in their hometown. The season is quickly approaching the halfway mark and the New York Rangers need Shattenkirk to step up if they have any chance to advance to the playoffs and beyond.
The opinions of the kind of player Shattenkirk is and how they have played have been written and spoken about often in the last few days. On Friday Shattenkirk was a guest on the Boomer Esiason's show on WFAN in New York.
Boomer even made it a point during Shattenkirk's visit to the station to tell them to stop turning the puck over. It's a statement most fans are making as this continues to be a huge issue right now for the defenseman.
Defense schemes can be taught to a player. Can Kevin Shattenkirk learn how to play a tighter style of play or will they continue to be the kind of overrated player Barry Trotz believed they are?
The biggest hit in last week's Atlanta Falcons game was easily Keanu Neal's brutal hit on Jordan Matthews. Part of the trouble with being a big hitter is it increases the chances of coming in contact with a player's helmet. That will result in fines, like this one.
The #eagles got word back from #NFL hit on Jordan Matthews to the head should have been a penalty. There will be fine. @SportsRadioWIP — Howard Eskin (@howardeskin) November 16, 2016
Neal, a first round pick, should be able to afford the fine. He's not known as a dirty player, and said after the game it was an accident. Matthews went a little low after the catch, and Neal hit them right in the face mask and shoulder area. There was oddly no penalty on the play after Matthews got rocked.
Also important is Neal needs to control the way they play. A lot of the big hitter defensive backs tend to break down physically before other players. Look at the early demise of William Moore and Dunta Robinson as evidence. Hopefully this fine will focus Neal to play a bit safer with not only other players but himself.
Media criticism vis a vis how the NY Times, Washington Post, CNN and other mainstream outlets cover the Trump administration as opposed to the Obama administration is all the rage through the first four months with President Trump in office.
Some of the criticism is fair, but some of it also falls into the “Well what about……?” area when trying to deflect attention away from reporting focused on the Trump administration. Sometimes in the need to “prove” how some mainstream media outlets are supposedly “ignoring” news the critics just get it wrong.
This happened recently with Fox News and Eric Wemple wrote about it:
Conservatives last week devoured a story by John Solomon and Sara Carter at Circa with this title, “Obama intel agency secretly conducted illegal searches on Americans for years.” The Obama administration, noted the story, had “routinely violated American privacy protections while scouring through overseas intercepts and failed to disclose the extent of the problems until the final days before Donald Trump was elected president last fall.” That sort of misfeasance merited followup by the mainstream media, according to various voices on the right. NewsBusters scolded, “Nets Blackout Massive Constitutional Violations by Obama's NSA.” PJ Media: “Shock: Complete MSM News Blackout on NSA Illegal Spying Bombshell.” Mollie Hemingway of the Federalist did a social-media roundup of the un-coverage: NYT: Zero stories on news Obama intel agencies secretly conducted illegal searches on Americans for years https://t.co/kGRwzCSCaL — Mollie (@MZHemingway) May 25, 2017 Fox News correspondent James Rosen also pushed the mainstream-media blackout notion on the evening news program “Special Report with Bret Baier.” On Thursday, they credited Circa for being the first to obtain the documents related to the NSA story, and then said this about the amount of pickup the revelations have triggered: “The sheer scale of the Fourth Amendment violations disclosed is staggering as was the sternness of the rebuke to the Obama administration delivered by the FISA court which ordinarily approves 99.9 percent of the government's request for surveillance,” said Rosen. “As of a few minutes ago, however, Bret, the story had not been covered on The Washington Post, New York Times, nor any of the three nightly news broadcasts on the three broadcast networks.”
There's only one problem: The NY Times not only covered the story, they broke the story nearly a month earlier on April 28th. The story was on page 1 of the NY Times, written by Charlie Savage:
The National Security Agency said Friday that it had halted one of the most disputed practices of its warrantless surveillance program, ending a once-secret form of wiretapping that dates to the Bush administration's post-Sept. 11 expansion of national security powers. The agency is no longer collecting Americans' emails and texts exchanged with people overseas that simply mention identifying terms — like email addresses — for foreigners whom the agency is spying on, but are neither to nor from those targets. The decision is a major development in American surveillance policy. Privacy advocates have argued that the practice skirted or overstepped the Fourth Amendment.
Not only that, but Fox News also got it wrong on The Washington Post not reporting it. James Rosen is an excellent journalist, and they took to the air to correct the record, giving credit to the NY Times for breaking the story and providing follow-up as well as credit to the Washington Post for covering the story as well.
As for the publication credited with “breaking” a story reported nearly a month earlier, their excuse for not linking to the NY Times or Washington post comes off as disingenuous:
The Circa reporters could have saved the Internet a lot of panting if they had only linked to Savage's story, not to mention The Post's piece. Asked about that omission, Solomon responded that the New York Times story wasn't enterprise reporting. It was “an announcement story,” Solomon told this blog. Savage's April 28 story, however, preceded the NSA announcement. “Like many important details in the article they co-wrote, Solomon got that wrong,” says Savage in a statement to this blog. “The New York Times' April 28 story was not a write-up of a N.S.A. announcement. Rather, based on sources, I learned what happened and we published an exclusive enterprise article around 1 p.m. on our website. The N.S.A. issued its statement about three hours later, as reporters at other news outlets were writing their own stories about the news.”
I have issues with the NY Times and Washington Post from time to time. Like any media outlet, they at times exhibit sloppiness or overhyped coverage to issues that is different based on party affiliation.
Most of the time, both newspapers do good reporting. Looking for reasons to scream bias without doing much digging can end up with embarrassing results like this.
INCHEON, South Korea (AP) — The little restaurant isn't much to look at. It's across the street from an empty lot in a city where bland high-rise apartment buildings sprawl in every direction. Boxes of dried fish are stacked by the front window. A dirty mop stands in the corner. The walls are painted a vomitous green.
But people come from across South Korea to eat here. They come for the potato pancakes, the blood sausage and, very often, for fried street food that many dreamed of back when nearly everyone they knew was hungry. More than anything, though, they come for memories the food brings back of an outcast homeland they may never see again.
“This is the taste of where they came from,” says the restaurant's owner, a refugee who asks to be identified only by their surname, Choi. “The food here tastes the way it does in North Korea.”
More than 30,000 North Koreans now live in South Korea, having fled poverty, hunger and the relentless pressures of life in an oppressive, authoritarian state. But for most, life in the South is far from ideal. Raised amid dictatorial dysfunction, and normally poorly educated, the exiles stumble into a brutally competitive nation where they are regularly disdained by their neighbors.
“Chon-nom” they are often called — “bumpkin.”
That derision, combined with their own disillusionment, can churn into a stew of suspicion, resentment and ambivalence. And though they may hate the nation they left behind, many also miss it deeply. Because how can you not miss home?
“Our lives here can be so difficult,” said a North Korean now living in the South. “But finding that restaurant made me so happy.” They spoke on condition their name not be used; even North Koreans who fled years ago remain concerned about reprisals against them or relatives still in the North.
Choi has built them a tiny island of North Korean life that starts to feel crowded if it has more than a half-dozen customers. In a burst of optimism they named it Howol-ilga, “People from Different Homelands Come to Gather in One Place.”
“My place is a comfort for them,” says Choi, 39, in a Northern accent so thick it can be barely comprehensible at first to Southerners. “When they come here and find a menu so similar to what they ate back home, they know they can relax.”
At first glance Choi doesn't seem very relaxing. Gruff and often scowling, restaurant work has left their hands patterned with small knife cuts and their forearms spattered by ugly oil burns. They have only two employees, and keeps the restaurant open seven days a week. Exhaustion is a constant. They cannot remember their last day off.
But eventually — when they finally sit down to talk, chugging a can of Georgia Original coffee — a smile crosses them face.
Choi grew up in a small town so close to North Korea's Amnok River border that you could wave to people in China. They learned cooking from their father, a onetime military cook who loved working in kitchens — rare in the North's deeply conservative culture — and from relatives who smuggled in goods from China. “They had learned Chinese cooking there,” they said.
The family was far from rich, but made enough trading in clothes, cheap electronics and DVDs of South Korean TV shows to count as middle-class. It was enough to avoid the horrors of North Korea's mid-1990s famine, which killed at least 500,000 people and perhaps well over a million. Years later, most North Korean refugees still refer to the famine by its Pyongyang-mandated euphemism.
“Even in the Arduous March we didn't suffer much,” Choi says, shrugging. “It's my family's fate to escape living in poverty.”
They left the North in 2012, looking for a better life for their young son, and opened the restaurant two years later.
Modesty isn't an issue for them
“All of my customers talk about how good I am,” they say. “They tell me: ‘When I eat in other restaurants, it doesn't taste like what I used to eat in the North. What you cook tastes completely different!'”
A South Korean, they insist, could never succeed in their kitchen.
“A cook's appetite is different” when they come from another place, they say, leaning against one of their fake wood tables. “They taste things in a different way. So how could they cook this kind of food?”
Food and history are as tangled at Howol-ilga as they are in North Korea, where three generations of dictators have vowed to end a relentless, centuries-old struggle against hunger.
“Socialism is rice!” the country's founding ruler, Kim Il Sung, proclaimed regularly in the 1960s, promising that everyone would soon be eating meat soup and rice every day. Instead, as South Korea became a global economic power the North lurched into its nightmare years, culminating in the 1990s famine. While the era of mass starvation is over, malnutrition remains a major problem, particularly among young children and pregnant women. And many Northerners still use food to talk about money and class differences, often saying, for example, that only the rich “eat rice every day.”
One of Choi's best-loved dishes is injogogibap, a street food invented during the famine, when it was the closest thing to meat most people could afford.
Bits of leftover fried tofu, which in earlier days had been thrown away, were scraped from pots and pressed into hot dog-sized tubes that were then stuffed with rice. It's delicious and filling (though tastes nothing like meat), with the tofu absorbing random flavors from cooking pots.
At the worst of times, when the smell of frying injogogibap would waft from food stalls into streets filled with hungry people, it became an object of fantasy. Even today some exiles dream about it.
That doesn't surprise Sonia Ryang, an anthropologist at Rice University in Texas who grew up in a pro-North Korea community in Japan, and who has written extensively about the North. To smell injogogibap was to dream of filling your stomach at a time when starvation was wiping out entire neighborhoods.
“Far from not wanting to remember, they want to remember,” says Ryang. “Because it was proof that they were alive.”
Choi's explanation is simpler. During the famine, they say, food was something that could always make people happy.
They smile: “Eating is joyful.”

KEENE, N.H. (AP) — Authorities say a small plane has struck a deer and flipped over while trying to land at a New Hampshire airport.
WMUR-TV reports that two people were aboard the plane and were able to get out safely Wednesday morning.
The main runway at Keene Dillant-Hopkins Airport was closed while officials investigated.
The airport property takes up about 1,000 acres and is surrounded by trees. The airport has two runways.
The airport's manager and the Keene Fire Department didn't immediately return phone messages seeking comment.

Information from: WMUR-TV, http://wmur.com
The small, if not always totally certain number of US ground troops in Syria has meant they've mostly remained off the front lines, embedded with the Kurdish YPG. The first death among US soldiers in the country was reported today near Kurdish-held Ayn Issa, north of Raqqa.
The soldier was wounded in an IED blast near Ayn Issa, and did not survive. Centcom confirmed the incident but did not offer any particular details on what the soldier was doing at the time. Kurdish forces are advancing southward from Ayn Issa toward Raqqa, however.
While the first US military death in Syria, it's also the second death in as many months in anti-ISIS offensives, with another soldier killed near northern Iraq's city of Mosul. In similar fashion, that soldier was killed in a roadside bomb while embedded with Kurdish troops.
Exact numbers of US soldiers in Syria aren't generally reported by the Pentagon, and whenbthey are, they are rarely accurate. The estimations are that a few hundred troops are in the country, overwhelmingly in the northwest.

Multi-platinum L.A. rockers Lifehouse (“Hanging By A Moment”) are back with Almería, the spaghetti western-tinged followup to their 2009 smash Smoke & Mirrors. We spoke with lead vocalist and chief songwriter Jason Wade about capturing the mojo.
If you could co-write with anyone alive or dead, who would it be?
Probably from artists who have passed away, John Lennon would be at the top of the list and Elliott Smith. As far as songwriters still alive, Paul McCartney. I would love to collaborate with Bono.
Which Lifehouse song required the least effort to write?
I would have to say “Hanging By A Moment.” I was in the studio doing a background part for another song on No Name Face and this melody was reverberating in my head. It was actually giving me a headache. I asked the producer if I could take a couple minutes off, go and pick up an acoustic guitar and see what this melody was bouncing around in my head. I went into the other room, picked up an acoustic guitar and it was almost an out-of-body experience. Within 7-10 minutes the song was completely finished… the arrangement, melody, everything. It was almost like channeling a song from another place. Hands down that is the quickest song I ever wrote. That's only happened a couple times since then. But usually when you feel the urge to stop everything to go write a song, usually that's going to be a very inspiring one.
What's a song on Almeria that you labored the most over?
“Between the Raindrops.” The song took three and a half to four months to create. It took on so many different faces. It originated from this one day where I went into the studio and my family was in town. I wasn't even supposed to be working that day. I just threw a bunch of sounds down on tape. Similar to “Hanging By The Moment,” I had this idea but I didn't have a whole lot of time. From there, the band came in and produced their own instruments on top of the track I made. Jude [Cole], myself and our buddy Jacob Kasher took the next two or three months to finish the song. It was unprecedented; that was a long time. As soon as we finished the final arrangement that's when the idea to get Natasha Bedingfield came up. As soon as their vocal was on the track, that's when the song really jumped to life and came to fruition.
Are there any other interesting origin stories about the songs on Almeria?
There are so many inspiring moments during the last year and making this album. One of the more interesting stories came from one of the bonus tracks “Lady Day.” It actually came from a dream I had. It was very surreal. I had a dream I was writing a song in modern time with Billie Holiday. I woke up remembering the melody we were working on. It was the strangest thing. I went and picked up a guitar and then sure enough the same melody lined up with these chords I already had. I was so inspired since I had a dream about writing a song with Billie Holiday that I wrote this song about their life. I had seen a documentary from their perspective on these Jazz documentaries a couple months back. She's one of my all-time favorite artists. That was an interesting songwriting experience. I have dreams about songs all the time but this was one of the few times where it materialized into something we actually kept.
What's a song of yours that's really touched people?
I feel as if two songs have resonated the most with people. One song would be “Everything” from our first album. And that song really seems to have resonated with people, and live it takes on a life of its own. Another song I think people have really connected to is a song called “Broken” that I wrote about a friend of mine when I was in Nashville doing pre-production for a couple years for a tour. That was one of those rare moments too where the song was being channeled from another place. I think I was just really absorbing some of the emotions and feelings that a friend of mine was going through. I transmuted them and made them my own. I feel as much a part of the song as the person I was writing it about. Same thing live, it takes on this epic nature and you can see it moving people.

Former FBI Director James Comey. AP Photo/Alex Brandon
Former FBI director James Comey is willing to testify before the Senate, but they will only do so in public, a close associate told The New York Times.
Comey has made no public statements since being fired, and they declined an invitation to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee in a closed door session, ranking member Mark Warner told MSNBC on Friday.
Comey's firing ignited a firestorm in Washington and has prompted speculation over whether Trump's decision hinged on their apparent anger at the FBI's probe into the Trump campaign's potential collusion with Russia during the 2016 election.
Though the White House initially said that Comey's removal had nothing to do with the Russia investigation, Trump later told NBC News' Lester Holt that the investigation was a factor in their decision.
"In fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,'" Trump told Holt during the interview.
Since firing Comey, Trump has raged at Democrats and other critics who have blasted them for firing the man who was spearheading an investigation centered around him. They also sent out a tweet in which they appeared to threaten Comey by releasing recordings of their conversations.
"James Comey better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before they start leaking to the press!" Trump tweeted on Friday.
A source close to Comey told NBC News that Comey "hopes there are tapes. That would be perfect."
"Early in the morning we set off from the relief camp, and go to our badly-damaged house to repair and clean it. The slush on the floor is knee-high and it stinks. If I put my foot into it, I will not be able to take it out. I do the cleaning barefoot and keep stepping on shards of glass and other sharp objects in the slush, injuring myself. We have no choice but to clean up during the day, and return to the relief camp by evening. We use the water from the Adyar river for cleaning," says Anandita, who studies in Class 12.She has been living with their family in a relief camp in Chennai's Saidapet after their home was flooded after the city was hit by heavy rain.With the rains having lessened and the flood waters receding, the spotlight is on the city's relief camps where the many people who had to flee their homes are now. The camps, severely overcrowded and cramped, are the recipe for a health disaster. Add to that the dangers that lurk in the homes that families like Anandita's return to every day to clean without any protective gear like gloves or gum boots.Struggling in the contaminated slush, fathers, mothers and children try to make their houses habitable again; many don't have bleaching powder, brooms or even clean water.Apart from the 24 official relief camps, Chennai also has numerous private spaces where refugees have taken shelter. From shopping malls and theatres to banquet halls and homes, there are temporary relief shelters across many of the areas that were flooded.These now are surrounded by pools of stagnating water and with not enough toilets, people at the relief camps are susceptible to epidemics and skin infections. "Waste management in these camps is also very poor, as there are no garbage bins or places to segregate waste. The camps also host pregnant women and infants below two years, who are in the high risk category when it comes to contracting infections," says Dr Anita Victor, working with the NGO World Vision India.While many of the camps in the city have food in excess, there is a lack of hygiene kits and sanitary products. "We do not want food, biscuits or drinking water," says 40-year-old Mali, who has been living in one of the camps. "What we want is medicines, soaps, toothpaste and toothbrushes, and ointments for skin rashes," they say.The lack of functional toilets is a big worry. Many camps have no access to electricity and clean water. In four relief camps near Thedeernagar in Saidapet, many people defecate next to the railway tracks, with a nearby public toilet locked up. "We wake up at 4 am and walk a long way, in search of a secluded place to relieve ourselves. Because it is also unsafe for girls at that time of the day, we go in groups of at least five members," says Mohaneswari, a Class X student who lives in one of the camps near St Thomas Mount, Chennai.Children defecate in the open within the camp premises and walk barefoot in the same area as well, drastically increasing the possibility of contracting infections and diseases.Access to medical care is vital also a grave problem. In a relief camp that houses around 400 families at the Chintadripet Railway Station, there was one doctor available for consultation. However, many other camps did not even have one. With multiple risk factors in a post-flood situation like Chennai's, it is imperative that healthcare professionals be stationed in each of the relief camps.The onset of another tragedy in the form of an epidemic needs to be avoided at any cost, and preventive measures need to be taken on a war footing. Better relief camp management and the circulation of health advisories within the camps are a must and so is coordination of relief agencies with the state government, considering the sheer scale of the task at hand.Sanitation facilities and an effective solid waste management plan is of critical priority, as is also ensuring the safety of the garbage clearance staff by providing adequate safety gear and laying down hygiene guidelines. The city, that has displayed so much resilience in the face of a sweeping disaster, simply cannot afford to lose lives due to oversight and negligence.(Bestin Samuel currently works as a writer and emergency communicator with World Vision India, a Chennai-based NGO that works for children.

An Albuquerque video game store owner found themselves in a wild set of circumstances after rare video game collectibles were stolen from their mailbox, then sold back to them at their store.Jon Sakura owns two Gamers Anonymous stores in Albuquerque, which mostly revolve around retro gaming.Sakura says that they ordered three pricey Nintendo amiibo figures that are only available in Japan for the moment. The figures can be used in conjunction with several Nintendo Wii U games.“You can scan them into your game and customize them and they become AI that learn as you play,” Sakura said. “You can customize their appearance, their moves, you can train alongside them and the more you play with them the better you get.”The figures showed up at Sakura's mailbox, but when they went to check for them, they saw that their mailbox was tampered with and the package the figures would be in wasn't there.Sakura figured that the package was stolen, and their suspicions were correct when someone showed up to their store on Constitution and Wyoming Boulevard and sold them back to a clerk.“They were the exact three I was missing, and turns out they all had the Amazon retail stickers on the back from the various distributors who sent them out to me,” Sakura said, adding they aren't there at the time of the sale.Sakura couldn't believe that someone had sold their own stolen stuff back to him.“Of all the mailboxes in Albuquerque to be busted into and of all the places for these things to be taken to, I mean, the chances are tremendously slim,” they said.It's policy at Gamers Anonymous to take a seller's date of birth, name, and driver's license number down. Sakura says they have all of the suspect's information and has given it to Albuquerque police.While their situation is resolved, they want the suspect to get caught before someone else gets something stolen from their mailbox.“Just in general, that's a much bigger deal and I don't want that to happen to anybody else,” Sakura said.Mobile users: Tap for video
After the brutal attack from CM Punk, Christian gets examined by the doctors.
Due to an injury sustained by an attack from WWE Champion CM Punk on Monday's Raw SuperShow, Christian has been deemed medically unable to compete as a member of Team Johnny at WrestleMania XXVIII.
Christian re-aggravated a prior neck injury during their match against Punk, who locked Christian in the Anaconda Vise twice and refused to let go of the hold after WWE officials tried to intervene.
In Captain Charisma's place, Interim Raw GM John Laurinaitis announced on Twitter that they have selected Drew McIntyre to be a member of Team Johnny at WrestleMania.
The Straight Edge Superstar had become enraged following another surprise verbal attack from Chris Jericho via satellite. Prior to the contest, Jericho appeared on the TitanTron and made personal remarks about Punk's birth, noting that it occurred before their parents' wedding date.
Christian, competing in their first match since Nov. 11, 2011, originally injured their neck when Big Show gave them a massive chokeslam on the Nov. 4 edition of SmackDown.
Although Christian claimed to also have experienced ankle pain following the onslaught, doctors later confirmed they did not re-aggravate the ankle sprain they suffered last year while on tour in Europe.
Check back with WWE.com for more updates on Christian's condition.
Senior American officials say Russian hackers read some of President Barack Obama's unclassified emails last year in a breach of the White House's computer system, The New York Times reports.
The hackers may have gotten access to the email archives of people inside the White House who Obama communicated with regularly. Officials briefed an investigation and found that the hackers were able to reach emails that the president sent and received.
Yet, Russian hackers were not able to access servers that control the messages sent from Obama's BlackBerry that they or an aide carries constantly.
Meanwhile, White House officials say the hackers did not compromise any classified networks, nor did they collect any classified information.
The number of emails hackers did access was not disclosed however. Hackers may have accessed information that contains little debate on policy, discussions on pending personnel moves and legislation.
"This has been one of the most sophisticated actors we've seen," said one senior American official briefed on the investigation.
"It's the Russian angle to this that's particularly worrisome," another senior official said.
Officials had to meet on a daily basis for several weeks after discovering the information about Russian hackers, although the White House says no classified information was compromised in the operation.
The threat with Russian hackers is that they often sweep up information about political targets while the Chinese mainly focus on commercial and design information.
Officials also pointed out that the Russian hackers obtained White House information at the time when new tensions rose between the U.S. and Russia over its annexation of Crimea.
A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the report but the White House earlier this month confirmed the breach, according to Reuters. The White House apparently knew about the intrusion for months.
George W. Bush gave up emailing during their presidency and refused to carry a smartphone. The White House easily discovers cyberattacks on a daily basis that are not only from Russia and China.
In 1984, Jesse Jackson became the second African American (after Shirley Chisholm) to mount a nationwide campaign for President of the United States, running as a Democrat.
In the primaries, Jackson, who had been written off by pundits as a fringe candidate with little chance at winning the nomination, surprised many when they took third place behind Senator Gary Hart and former Vice President Walter Mondale, who eventually won the nomination. Jackson garnered 3,282,431 primary votes, or 18.2 percent of the total, in 1984,[1] and won five primaries and caucuses, including Louisiana, the District of Columbia, South Carolina, Virginia, and one of two separate contests in Mississippi.[2]
As they had gained 21 percent of the popular vote but only eight percent of delegates, they afterwards complained that they had been handicapped by party rules. While Mondale (in the words of their aides) was determined to establish a precedent with their vice presidential candidate by picking a woman or visible minority, Jackson criticized the screening process as a "p.r. parade of personalities". They also mocked Mondale, saying that Hubert Humphrey was the "last significant politician out of the St. Paul–Minneapolis" area.[3]
We loved trading in our paintbrushes for sponges to paint apples, so we decided to repeat the process and make a sponge painted pumpkin craft. We then turned our sponged painted pumpkin craft into a jack 0′ lantern.
With just a few basic supplies and easy to follow directions, this is an easy, inexpensive, and fun pumpkin craft for fall, Halloween or Thanksgiving.
This post contains affiliate links. See my Disclosure Policy for details.
Supplies
Paper plate
Orange paint
Sponge
Brown paper
Green pipe cleaner
Black paper (if making a jack o' lantern)
Scissors
Glue
Directions
To this prep this craft, start out by cutting a long piece from your sponge to act as the paintbrush. It helps to use sharp scissors for this.
1.Dab the sponge into the orange paint and then dab onto the paper plate until the plate is covered in orange paint. Allow to dry.
3. Cut a stem from the brown paper and blue to the back of the pumpkin craft. Cut a small piece from a green pipe cleaner and bed it so it resembles a pumpkin vine. Attach to the back of the pumpkin craft near the stem. (We added the pipe cleaner vine to the pumpkin, but removed it when making the jack 0′ lantern.
4. If you are making a jack 0′ lantern cut pieces for the face from the black paper and glue to the pumpkin craft.

DreamHack Masters Las Vegas starts on Wednesday, February 15, with 16 teams kicking the event off with the GSL group stage. We've prepared a preview in which we take a look at the teams and some of the biggest storylines.
Sixteen teams will come together in Las Vegas from February 15-19, including 11 highest-ranked teams in the world according to our current Team Ranking.
The stacked $450,000 event will feature a GSL group stage, played mostly in best-of-one matches barring the best-of-three decider matches, with the top two teams from each group advancing to a single-elimination bracket.
These are the groups:
An important thing to keep in mind is that the new Inferno will be played on LAN for the first time since Valve announced it was replacing Dust2 in the Active Duty map pool, and DreamHack decided to make the switch with just two weeks between the update and the event.
In our preview of DreamHack Masters Las Vegas, we've divided the 16 teams into four categories: Favourites, Mid-tier teams, Underdogs, and Debutants, which features teams who were tough to place in any of the other categories due to their roster changes.
* Ratings used are from the past three months on LAN
Favorites
With gla1ve coming into the lineup, Astralis rose to success much quicker than even they expected to, having improved their results with every event they attended.
Before the end of 2016, the Danish powerhouse picked-up a semi-final finish at IEM Oakland, made it one step further at ELEAGUE Season 2, and clinched their first title in over a year at ECS Season 2 Finals.
Despite those results, several experts picked Natus Vincere to defeat Astralis in quarter-finals at the ELAEGUE Major and to win the whole thing. However, device and company prevailed in the end and went on to grab their first Major title in fantastic fashion, edging past Virtus.pro in a tight grand final.

Kjaerbye is enjoying gla1ve's system
Being the last Major winners and seeing as the remainder of the top-ten is unstable due to roster changes or mixed results, Astralis are the team to beat at the moment.
It'll be hard for anyone to do that, as the number one team has a lot of depth all-around. Their wide map pool allows them to match up well against anyone and all of their players are in good form, especially Kjaerbye who powered Astralis through playoffs at the Major.
With Inferno coming into the mix, Astralis lost one of their better maps, Dust2, and in series' it could force them to play Cobblestone, assuming they haven't put enough time in Inferno to be confident on it. It's unlikely any of the other teams will be prepared to pick it, though, so it's possible that the Danes will keep banning Cobblestone when facing certain opponents.
Virtus.pro have proven time and time again that despite their overall instability, the Poles nearly always show up at the biggest events, of which DreamHack Masters Las Vegas is one.
Only last month did TaZ and company finish in third place at WESG—where they were largely expected to win—only to come back at the Major and be rounds away from winning it.
Virtus.pro will have many hard match-ups in Vegas
In Atlanta, Snax was clearly the team's driving force, but we've come to expect that from the team's superstar and the fifth-best player of 2016. Not so much from pashaBiceps, however, who also stood behind a large portion of Virtus.pro's success at the Major with a few big clutches and a stable performance overall.
The Poles should come out ahead in their group, which is reasonably dangerous with the new-old fnatic as well as a rising Gambit. VP is good enough to take on any team in playoffs, but there are several who can beat them, including the other two favorites and three of the debutants, SK, North, and FaZe.
The new Na`Vi, which features s1mple since August last year, has so far disappointed to live up to their potential, dealing with identity issues as they figure out whether to utilize a tactical or a simplistic approach.
After finishing the year with two measly group stage exits at ELEAGUE Season 2 and IEM Oakland, Natus Vincere's heavy preparations prior to the ELEAGUE Major sparked hopes for a new future.
Unluckily, Na`Vi met Astralis in quarter-finals, as GuardiaN and company finished 3-0 while the Danes made it out of the groups in the last round, and we didn't get to see enough to objectively judge their new level.
DreamHack Masters will give us a clearer picture of where Na`Vi stand
We saw a total of six maps from Natus Vincere at the Major, of which three were against the best team in the world and the remainder were CT-side landslides in the group.
DreamHack Masters Las Vegas should give us more answers as to where they stand among the top teams. Judging by the little we saw at the Major, they have a fair shot at a semi-final finish or more, depending on whether they'll be able to deal with the loss of Dust2, which they looked good on at the Major.
Mid-tier teams
NiP are one of the few teams who have yet to show themselves this year, having failed to qualify for the Major due to a crushing loss to Vega Squadron at the ELEAGUE Major Main Qualifier.
That finish to 2016 was especially shocking due to the Swedes consistently making playoffs at their previous three events with a title at IEM Oakland, a semi-final finish at ESL Pro League Season 4 Finals, and a quarter-finals exit at ELEAGUE Season 2.
At the qualifier, NiP were most notably criticized for their lack of timeout usage and inability to adapt, which should be fixed with THREAT coming back into the mix, as they are finally traveling with the team again.
The Norse God and their NiP return two months after the Main Qualifier fiasco
While it has detrimental effects on NiP's future at the Majors, I see their Main Qualifier showing as merely a bump on the road in terms of form; the Swedish roster should now go back to where they belong—being a contender for a top-four finish.
The only worrying sign is their 0-4 record in Pro League, where they've only met the lower tier teams Heroic and mousesports so far, although that can be chalked up to online competition.
Gambit quickly began to improve upon the addition of Zeus and Tengri's Hobbit, who quickly became one of the team's stars alongside their compatriots AdreN and mou.
In the span of a month, Zeus and company clinched two smaller titles, Predator Masters Season 3 and DreamHack ZOWIE Open Winter, before starting their preparations ahead of the ELEAGUE Major.
Gambit's first test will be the new-old fnatic
Being one of the hardest working teams, Gambit came prepared for the Major, where they only lost to Virtus.pro on their way to playoffs while defeating two more playoff-bound teams, North and FaZe. Their journey came to an end when they met one of the better teams out of all the possible draws, fnatic, against whom they were only able to win Overpass in a three map series.
That map now seems to be one of their best, alongside Cobblestone, although they seem to be reliant on the two as we haven't seen them play the other four too much. As for Inferno, it's possible Zeus will want to take advantage of the situation and prepare Gambit to use it as a trump card, but I wouldn't bet on anyone picking the map this close to the announcement.
Cloud9's recent results resemble those of summer 2015, when the team was led by Sean "seang@res" Gares and made three finals in a row before dropping back to the second tier of teams.
From September to October, the North American squad were runners-up three times at smaller events, and more importantly grabbed 3rd-4th at StarSeries Season 2 Finals and a title at ESL Pro League Season 4 Finals.
They attended four more events before the end of the year in quick succession and failed to make it past groups each time, most notably at the Major's Main Qualifier where they suffered losses to TYLOO and HellRaisers.
Cloud9's honeymoon period is over
Whether that has to do with the fact that they barely had any time for practice between those events is up for debate, but it seems they've been figured out and as a result lost the confidence they had had during their successful run.
To add insult to injury, Cloud9 are another team for whom Dust2 leaving the map pool could be detrimental. They've always liked the map and used to be very good on it, perhaps due to its simplicity which allows their loose playstyle to shine, but now they don't have that option anymore. They'll have to start looking into either Inferno or Nuke to make up for the loss, but fortunately for them, many teams are facing the same issue as nearly everyone was able to play Dust2.
Debutants
Rather than go through all teams in the debutants section individually, we will go over the group as a whole and see which teams have a better chance to succeed at DreamHack Masters Las Vegas.
fnatic made possibly the most exciting change, bringing back together the same lineup that won six titles in a row in late 2015 to early 2016 and went on to garner several more top fours before breaking up in summer.
It needs to be said that the conditions between then and now have changed drastically for such a relatively short period of time. The competition is stiffer and not all of fnatic's players are at the same level they were at a year ago, but even so, the fact that they've played together not that long ago will surely help them in the short term.
The situation in North is similar, as we already saw the same lineup with aizy once before at WESG Regional Finals, where the then-dignitas clinched first place. That experience will help aizy get accommodated in the roster and adjust much quicker than their group opponents, OpTic, who have just lost their in-game leader.
The new-old fnatic might be the most benefitted out of the debutants in the short-term
DreamHack Masters Las Vegas loses importance for FaZe and mousesports due to the fact that both are going in with a stand-in, knowing they'll have a new lineup after the event. However, at the same time, being in that position takes pressure away. Since they're both in the same group, I'd give the edge to FaZe, who are the better team overall and won't mind the loss of Dust2 nearly as much as mouz.
That leaves us with SK, who are a bit of a question mark. felps is a very different player than Lincoln "fnx" Lau or Ricardo "fox" Pacheco, so FalleN needs to create a new system in which they can use the aggressive play-maker that is the new addition. SK already had one highly aggressive player in fer, so it'll be interesting to see how the Brazilians will be able to keep control over their play style.
SK's success will come down to whether their in-game leader was able to come up with a style that works with the new roster in the short time they had, which is not a given. I'd rather say that the Brazilian squad will be one to benefit in the long term when they've figured out how to work with felps.
Underdogs
If I had to pick one team from the Underdogs who could go on and advance from their group, it would be Renegades. The Australians will face the two teams with stand-ins in their group, FaZe and mousesports, which makes a playoffs finish possible.
The odds still aren't good, though. Similarly to mouz, Renegades' chances suffer from the change of Active Duty maps, as they had favored Dust2 in recent months. On top of that, the inclusion of the Swede atter into the team, who will be playing in Ricardo "Rickeh" Mulholland's stead, will leave a large question mark looming over the Australian-Swedish team.
As for the others, TYLOO still haven't finalized their roster even with AttackeR coming back, while Misfits and compLexity are placed in groups full of much better teams.

If you've heard about Rails but are yet to take the plunge, there has never been a better time to dive in. Rails 3, the most recent major release, not only marks a major landmark in maturity for the framework itself, but is also a sign of a mature community.
Today, I'm going to show you a quick example of building a simple Rails 3 application to give you an idea of what working with Rails is like. For this tutorial in two parts, we'll be building a database-backed application: a URL shortener named “Shorty.”
In the first part, you'll learn how to install Ruby on Rails, generate an application and create a Model. In the second part, we'll move on to creating a Controller, writing a View and then we'll wrap it all up.
--ADVERTISEMENT--
I'm going to skim over a lot of stuff, but there'll be links throughout to more detailed explanations, and at the end of the second part some places where you can follow up after reading this tutorial.
Things You'll Want to Know
To get started, it's important to understand that Rails is built on MVC architecture; that is, Model–View–Controller.
Models are responsible for handling data storage and the business logic. Views are responsible for the layer that the user deals with. Controllers act as the bridge between the Models and the Views. In other words, Views generate your HTML, Models handle your database interactions (and any logic based on that data), while Controllers tie the two together, and are where you place logic that controls where the browser is redirected and what the user can do.
Controllers are composed of Actions. Think of an Action as a discrete set of functionality: when you hit the application, Rails will work out the Action to use, based on your request. It is this architecture that helps to write clean, well-structured code that's nice to work with.
Rails also has several other terms it introduces that it's helpful for you to know about.
The Router essentially maps a URL to a specific action on a specific Controller, with conditions on requests. It's how Rails knows, for example, that when you GET /urls, it should call the Index Action on the URL's Controller class.
Next, Rails has Migrations—essentially, versioned database schema—and a set of tools to make dealing with Migrations simple. These are powerful tools that let you write code that sets up a database without having to manually deal with SQL (and more importantly, making it easy to write code that is reusable across several database engines).
Lastly, Rails uses the concept of Environments. Your Rails application can be running in Development (for when you're working on code), Test (for running automated tests), and Production (for deploying your applications). You can also create other user-specified Environments, and you can configure your application and database based on those Environments.
Installing Ruby on Rails
The first task we'll need to do is install a relatively recent version of Ruby (1.8.7 or higher) on your computer. One point to note is that Rails uses a very command-line-heavy set of tools. If you're uncomfortable working in the Command Prompt on Windows or a terminal in OSX or your Linux distribution of choice, you might want to do some reading up elsewhere beforehand to get the basics down pat. If this is the case, the guides for Windows and OSX/Linux are a good place to start.
Installing Ruby and Rails on Windows
On Windows, the easiest way is to use Rails Installer, a single installer developed by Wayne Seguin that will set you up with everything you need. Just visit the link above and watch Wayne's walk-through video, and you should have Ruby set up on your machine in no time.
Installing Ruby and Rails on a Mac or Linux
On a Linux or Mac installation, you have the option of using your distribution of choice: Ruby or, as most Ruby developers prefer, Ruby Version Manager, also written by Wayne Seguin. Since both options are liable to change and are relatively specific to distributions, I suggest googling for guides relative to your operation and reading through the RVM site.
Another more recent option, again provided by Wayne Seguin, is the bootstrap_rails_environment script. It sets up RVM and all dependencies to have Rails working for users on OSX or Linux.
To start, you'll need to download the file at https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/raw/master/contrib/bootstrap_Rails_environment to an easy to remember location on your computer. By default, this script will install Rails 3.0.3, Ruby 1.8.7, and set up a directory in ~/Sites for you. If you wish to change these values, open it up in your text editor of choice and change the lines starting with rails_version , ruby_version and sites_path as you see fit.
Once you've downloaded and edited the file, open up your terminal, change into the directory you installed the file and run:
chmod +x bootstrap_rails_environment ./bootstrap_rails_environment
This will first make the script executable, and then execute it. If it encounters any issues, it will let you know and tell you how to resolve them.
Generating Your First Rails Application
Now that you have Rails installed, you need to generate a basic application. Ruby on Rails uses code generation for several tasks, most typically to create a new Rails application, as well as setting up the Controller and models.
First, open up your terminal or command prompt—you're going to need it a lot from now on. If you used Rails Installer on Windows, make sure you use the “Command Prompt with Ruby and Rails” option from the Start Menu to open it. You'll want to keep this open while we work through each step, as I'll refer back to it quite often.
Now, change to the directory where you want to store your code. If you used the Rails bootstrap script, wherever you set sites_path to (by default, ~/Sites ) will likely be where you want to be; on Windows you'll want to choose a place (for example, c:rails-projects ) that's easy to remember and navigate to.
Once in the directory, use the rails new command to generate a new Rails application. Since our application is called “Shorty,” to generate a Shorty project and go into it, we'll run the following in our command prompt:
rails new shorty cd shorty
You'll also want to open your editor of choice inside the code directory. If you don't have a favorite editor, or your editor doesn't fully support Ruby, I can recommend E Text Editor on Windows, TextMate on OSX, or Komodo Edit on Linux.
On the command line again, run bundle install . This tells bundler, a library used by Rails, to fetch and install all the libraries it needs. While that's running, take the opportunity to look around the generated Rails application.
You may notice looking over the structure of the code that one of the core values of Rails—Convention over Configuration—leads to a structured directory layout for your code. All configuration-related code goes in the config directory, application-specific code goes into the app directory, and so on. For more detail on the structure, look under point 3.2 on the official Rails Getting Started Guide.
One of the files our Rails application generated, config/database.yml , contains environment-specific database connection details. Out of the box, it uses sqlite3, since it's easy to get started. To create the sqlite3 database file (and start the build in Rails web server), go back to your commond prompt and run:
rake db:create rails server
The first line invokes the “db:create” task in rake, a tool (like ant, nant or make in other languages) which lets you run little bits of saved code. In this case, the “db:create” task will create our database (if you look in the config/database.yml file, you'll see it's going to create a file at db/development.sqlite3 ).
The second line then starts up the built-in web server that ships with Rails, running it on port 3000. On the command line, you should see something similar to:
=> Booting WEBrick => Rails 3.0.3 application starting in development on http://0.0.0.0:3000 => Call with -d to detach => Ctrl-C to shutdown server
Now, if you open your browser and point it to http://localhost:3000/ , you should now see a welcome page like this:
Clicking the “About your application's environment” link will also show a list of version numbers for the different libraries Rails is built on.
Creating Your First Model
Now that we have an empty Rails application up and running, we can start developing Shorty.
Since we're building a URL shortener, we need some way to store a record of URLs. To do this, we will generate a URL Model with a single specified field: url.
To start, we'll use Rails generators to generate the Class and Migration for us by running the following at the command line once:
rails generate model Url url:string
This tells Rails to create a URL class for the Model, create a Migration that will form the url's table with a single developer-specified field, url, and associated test files.
In this tutorial, we won't cover testing, as that is a very in-depth topic. Suffice to say in real applications testing is a very good idea, and Rails makes test-driven development as simple as possible. For more details on Testing, look at the Unit testing your Models section in the official Rails guides.
Next, you'll want to use your text editor to open up the app/models/urls.rb file that contains your URL model and the generated Migration file (inside the db/migrate folder, it will be automatically named with a timestamp followed by _create_urls.rb ; for example, db/migrate/20110129184226_create_urls.rb ).
The Migration should look similar to this:
class CreateUrls < ActiveRecord::Migration def self.up create_table :urls do |t| t.string :url t.timestamps end end def self.down drop_table :urls end end
And your Model should look like this:
class Url < ActiveRecord::Base end
Editing Your Migration
The Migration tells Rails that when it is applied, it should create the Urls table with a URL field (of type string, typically translating to a VARCHAR in most databases), and with two timestamp fields— created_at and updated_at —which Rails automatically sets for you as you create and update Models. Likewise, when it's rolled back, your Migration tells Rails to drop the Urls table.
The only aspect we'll want to change in this Migration is to tell the database not allow null URL fields. In your text editor, go to the Migration file and change:
t.string :url
to
t.string :url, :null => false
Save the file. Now, to apply your migration to the database, you simply need to switch back to the console and run:
rake db:migrate
Rails is smart enough to know that you only need to run the migration once. If you run the same command twice, it won't attempt to create the table twice, hence the versioned database term I used earlier.
Editing the Model
Next, we'll want to edit our Model to tell Rails that when we create or update a URL, there should always be a URL given. In Rails terminology, we use validations; specifically, we validate the presence of the URL field. To do this, we simply edit our Model file (as mentioned above) to look like:
class Url < ActiveRecord::Base validates :url, :presence => true end
Don't forget to save the file. For more information on validators (and ActiveRecord in general), a good reference is, as usual, the official Rails Guides.
To test this out, we're going to introduce another tool: the Rails console. Built on IRb (interactive Ruby) it's what is a called a REPL: a read–eval–print loop. Essentially, it's like a terminal session specifically for testing out Ruby code. In it, we can type code (read) and it will run it (eval), outputting the return value (print).
From the command line, simply type Rails console in your terminal; this will open up the Rails console using the development environment. As a simple example, if you type in puts Rails.env , the console should print out “development,” telling you the console is running in your development environment as expected.
To test out your Model, we first initialize a new URL instance by typing:
u = Url.new
This should show:
#<Url id: nil, url: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
Next, try to save it to the database by running:
u.save
Since it isn't valid, the console will output false. This means that the save call failed and our object wasn't saved to the database as it was invalid. To fix this, we have two options. First, we can create a new URL by passing in the option:
u = Url.new(:url => "http://google.com/")
Or, more simply, we can set the URL attribute on the existing URL:
u.url = "http://google.com/"
Now, run u.save again and this time it will return true, telling us it was successfully saved to the database.
If we type p u (the p method will simply print a representation of the object given as an argument, u ), we should see:
#<Url id: 1, url: "http://google.com/", created_at: "2011-01-29 19:07:34", updated_at: "2011-01-29 19:07:34">
As mentioned before, it was automatically assigned an id, and also set the created_at and updated_at fields to have the correct value: the time it was created.
To test finding the record from the database, close the console (either press Ctrl-C or type exit), then reopen the console by typing Rails console and run:
u = Url.find 1
This should return the URL we inserted before by fetching it from the database using our id. Along the same lines, if we now try:
u = Url.find 100000
Where there is no URL with the id 100000, Rails will raise an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound exception in Rails telling us it can't find a URL with the id of 100000.
So now you've installed Ruby, generated your first application and created your first Model. In the second part of this tutorial, you will create your first Controller, write the View for your application and get it all working.
Go to Part 2.

A fired Washington County sheriff's deputy received probation Tuesday for choking a co-worker last year.
Jonathan Christensen, 39, in July pleaded guilty to one count each of coercion, strangulation and official misconduct before Judge Charles Bailey in Washington County Circuit Court. Following the conditions of the plea deal, Bailey sentenced Christensen to two years of probation, to complete 80 hours of community service, to pay $12,000 in restitution and to undergo anger management counseling.
Sentencing for the felony coercion charge was set for July 2018, as part of a deferred sentencing agreement. If Christensen satisfies conditions of their probation -- completing the community service, paying restitution and receiving counseling -- the coercion charge will be dismissed before then.
Remaining fourth-degree assault and official misconduct charges were dismissed Tuesday as part of the agreement. Christensen also relinquished their police certification with the state's Department of Public Safety Standards and Training and agreed to not seek employment in law enforcement.
Bailey told the parties that they did not agree with the plea deal and said they only accepted it because the victim in the case did not want to go to trial. The victim also attended Tuesday's hearing and gave a lengthy and emotional statement, saying Christensen's actions have wounded them "physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually and financially."
"Every aspect of my life has been changed by this event," they told the court. "My professional life, my personal life, even my belief in myself."
Christensen, who was fired from their corporal position in August 2015, was arrested in December after a grand jury indicted them on the charges.
The investigation into Christensen began after an anonymous writer sent a letter to the sheriff's office and The Oregonian/OregonLive alleging that some deputies had sex on the job and engaged in other sexual misconduct. Christensen was named in the letter.
The sheriff's office asked Portland police to investigate the claims, and Multnomah County Deputy District Attorney Chris Ramras prosecuted the case.
In April 2015, the co-worker made allegations in a restraining order against Christensen. They alleged Christensen arrived at their home that March while they were on duty wearing their uniform and gun and shoved them against the wall, pulled their hair and choked her, demanding that they continue their sexual relationship.
Two other deputies were placed on paid leave after the letter arrived at the sheriff's office. One of them, Sgt. Dan Cardinal, resigned while under investigation in May 2015 and pleaded no contest to official misconduct in January for engaging in sexual activity while on duty. Cardinal received probation.
In March, former Deputy David Bergquist pleaded guilty to one count of sexual harassment in Clackamas County Circuit Court for grabbing a co-worker's breast, pulling it out from their clothing then putting their mouth on it at a union party in winter 2015. They also received probation.
Bergquist, who retired just before pleading guilty, was not named in the letter but was placed on leave shortly after the agency received it.
This story will be updated with more information from Tuesday's hearing.

In a recent Reason-Rupe Survey, fifty-eight percent of Americans ages 18-24 said they viewed Socialism favorably. However, when asked if they favored a free market economy or a government-managed economy, sixty-four percent of Millennials said they favored the free market. How is it possible for Millennials to favor both a socialist government and a capitalist economy? The answer is simple: Millennials simply do not understand what either of these words really mean, especially capitalism.
Denying the appeal of "Capitalism"
The word capitalism is generally unpopular on college campuses around the country. In pop culture, it is rare, though not impossible, to find a story where the capitalist ends up being the hero. All day long we are bombarded with anti-free market propaganda.
Oddly enough, most of this anti-capitalist rhetoric is available to us through mediums that exist only because of the free market. For example, every time a young, enthusiastic socialist tweets about the injustices of capitalism from their or their iPhone, they are living proof that Millennials love the free market.
If there is one thing the Millennial generation struggles with, it's patience. We have grown up in a world where everything has been available to us with the click of a button. We have never had to use encyclopedias or spend hours doing research in a library. Instead, we Googled whatever it is that we were looking for and in a matter of seconds, we had a plethora of sources.
Socialism is not generally associated with quick results. Instead, extreme bureaucracy usually tends to make things take even longer than they otherwise would, much like a government breadline. Both Etsy and Amazon are wonders brought to us by the free market. Likewise, a government-run healthcare system usually results in longer waiting periods even for simple office visits.
Millennials hate waiting. I am willing to bet that if these self-proclaimed socialists were to spend some time in a socialist country, they would not last very long.
Millennials love quality, one of a kind products. Platforms like Etsy have served the Millennial generation as a sort of online farmers' market where strangers from around the world buy and sell handmade goods from each other.
Whether you're looking for a beard warmer or craft BBQ sauce, Etsy has it. Likewise, we live in a world fueled by Amazon Prime. Not only do we have access to almost anything we could possibly need or want, we are also having these items shipped to our door in two days.
Both Etsy and Amazon are wonders brought to us by the free market. So, as Millennials log in to Amazon to purchase a copy of The Communist Manifesto, they might want to consider the fact that the book is delivered to them in 48 hours all thanks to capitalism.
Free-market Ambitions
Millennials are entrepreneurs. We are using technology to our advantage and making the world run quickly and efficiently. Though some might speak loudly in favor of unions and collective bargaining, on a late night when no cabs can be found, a Millennial knows that a safe ride will be available to us in minutes by opening our Uber App.
Apps like Square, Venmo, and PayPal have allowed us to start small businesses and collect payment with ease. Sites like YouTube allow us the opportunity to gain exposure and promote whatever it is we are working on or selling without ever leaving our homes. We have the potential to be the most entrepreneurial generation our country has ever seen.
Millennials love to actively participate in the market process. Active participation is one of the fundamental principles of the free market. If we are not willing to give feedback and review our purchased consumer goods, we will not get the most innovative processes or the best quality products available.
Millennials have grown up in a world where every thought and opinion is shared on social media. Platforms like Yelp have become important tools in the hands of young consumers who are either pleased or completely outraged about the goods or services they received.
As a result, Millennials, more than any other generation, are reading online reviews of a company or product before making the decision to buy. According to Forbes, 33% of Millennials said that they read reviews of a product before deciding to buy.
Intellectual Innovation
Millennials love to learn and have more access to the market of ideas than any other generation that preceded us. Khan Academy, YouTube, and Wikipedia offer us a chance to become experts in almost any field we desire. Millennials are using these free market mediums to educate themselves in a way that has never been seen before in our world.The problem is that too many Millennials don't understand that in almost every aspect of their lives, they are capitalists.
We are not relying solely on the opinion of college professors or our parents. We are doing the research and finding new ways to learn. Along those same lines, we also have a natural distrust for authority. We have seen the economy crumble as a result of the poor decisions made by the baby boomer generation. We do not trust others to make our decisions for us. We are coming up with entrepreneurial solutions to government-created problems and we are doing this through online learning.
Yet, in spite of all of these aspects of the Millennial mindset, Millennials still claim to identify with socialism. Growing up in a post-Iron Curtain era has jaded our perception of what a pure welfare state really looks like. We have not grown up hearing first-hand accounts of the woes of socialism in the Iron Curtain era.
We are living in a technological world brought to us because of the free market's perpetual triumph over socialism. However, we don't understand history well enough to realize how fortunate we are to live in a society that where the free market is allowed to flourish. Millennials see large unemployment statistics, a struggling economy, and high costs of living and attribute it to the very system that gave us our iPhones, Amazon, Spotify, and Netflix.
The problem at hand is not that too many Millennials are socialists; the problem is that too many Millennials don't understand that in almost every aspect of their lives, they are capitalists. If Millennials truly want to dedicate themselves to the ideals of socialism, they will have to surrender their iPhones, their Amazon accounts, their Uber accounts, their craft beer, the hipster beard accessories, and pretty much every other aspect of their daily lives.

Driver Cleared By NYPD Found Negligent in Death of Cyclist Rasha Shamoon
A civil jury has found that a driver cleared of wrongdoing by NYPD was primarily responsible for the collision that killed a Manhattan cyclist in 2008.
In the early morning hours of August 5, Rasha Shamoon was riding their bike east on Kenmare Street, en route to the Williamsburg Bridge and home to Greenpoint. At approximately 1:30 a.m., as they cycled across the intersection at Bowery, where Kenmare becomes Delancey Street, they were hit by a northbound Land Rover SUV driven by Abraham Soldaner, also of Brooklyn.
Friends were told after the crash that Shamoon, who worked as a biology professor at LaGuardia Community College, was not breathing when paramedics arrived at the scene. They were revived and taken to New York Downtown Hospital in critical condition, and was later transferred to New York Presbyterian, where they were declared brain dead. Shamoon was removed from life support on August 11. They were 31.
Shamoon was known as a seasoned cyclist, their attentiveness evidenced by a bike and helmet adorned prodigiously with reflective tape. Soldaner, then 21, had already amassed a lifetime of marks on their driving record: two speeding tickets (resulting in 19 license points), one charge for using a cell phone while driving, three seat belt violations and one personal injury case.
At least seven people called 911 after the crash, and passersby stopped to render aid, but NYPD reported that the only witnesses to interview were Soldaner and their two passengers. Soldaner was administered a breath test, which police said came back negative. A blood test performed on Shamoon revealed no foreign substances. Based largely on what investigators were told by Soldaner and their friends, NYPD concluded that Shamoon ran a red light.
Determined to clear Rasha's name, the Shamoon family pursued the case in Kings County Supreme Court. Last week a jury of six agreed unanimously that the crash was almost entirely the fault of Soldaner. Though they were not criminally charged or summonsed by NYPD, Soldaner was found 95 percent responsible for the collision that killed Shamoon.
“It really validated what we knew all along, that they were an experienced, responsible cyclist,” says Saba Michaud, Rasha's sister.
Details that emerged in court exposed the shortcomings of the NYPD investigation. Jurors saw video of the aftermath of the crash, captured by a man who testified to hearing a “very loud boom” from their apartment on Bowery. One of Soldaner's passengers, who was sitting in the back seat, testified that the Land Rover was traveling between 40 and 45 miles per hour, and that the impact was such that they were jolted to the right. The front seat passenger testified that they saw Shamoon and yelled to alert Soldaner the instant before the collision. None of these details appear in the NYPD crash report.
“The police either did not properly interrogate the driver or they did not report the driver's answers,” says Adam White, the Manhattan-based attorney representing the Shamoon family. “Instead the report contained very scant information from the driver and passengers as to what they witnessed.”
The crash report does state that Shamoon was not wearing their helmet. This conflicts with testimony from one of Soldaner's passengers, who said they saw Shamoon's helmet that night. Friends also said they saw Shamoon put it on before heading home. The helmet was never released to Shamoon's family, however, and it has not been seen since the crash.
The court heard from Officer Charles Pitagno, a veteran of the NYPD Highway Patrol division and one of two investigators dispatched to the scene. Pitagno testified that they had no recollection of the crash or the investigation, and on the stand seemed to have trouble parsing the meaning of vehicle damage codes indicated in the crash report.
Pictures of the SUV, which was not registered in Soldaner's name, showed damage to the left front fender, deep scratches down the driver's side, and a cracked windshield. The rear view mirror was torn from the driver's side door. Jurors learned that the car traveled 77 feet after the point of impact. In court, White said it was unknown whether Soldaner was using headlights.
Soldaner themselves testified that they were unsure of many details of the crash. They said they did not see Shamoon, a point hammered by White during summation. In failing to “see what was there to be seen,” White said, Soldaner did not meet the required standard of care, even if jurors believed they had the light.
Soldaner's driving record was inadmissible in court, and the jury was not allowed to hear anything about Rasha other than their name. Nor was there mention of how the Shamoon family was treated by NYPD. Police did not contact the family, or Josue Cedeño, Rasha's partner of nine years, in any way after initially notifying them of the crash. The Shamoons did not see a crash report until it was obtained by a hospital social worker, who had trouble getting Soldaner's insurance information from police. At first, NYPD would not release the report, and when it was released, no such information was included. Ultimately the family learned that NYPD did not report the crash to Soldaner's insurer.
Police told the Shamoons there were no witnesses other than Soldaner and their passengers, a claim that appears implausible based on the 911 log as well as subsequent trips by Rasha's relatives to the intersection, on Tuesdays after 1:00 a.m., when they found the area bustling with activity.
“It is unclear whether the police made any attempts to get statements from other witnesses who were clearly present at the scene and offered assistance to Rasha and called 911,” says White. This question seems answered in the NYPD report, which reads, “No witnesses to this accident were present at the scene.”
More upsetting than the poor investigative work, says Michaud, was the story of Rasha as told by police, which featured a woman they did not recognize as their sister.
“Her portrayal by the NYPD was that they were irresponsible, they ran the red light, they aren't wearing the helmet, that they were 100 percent at fault. For my parents this was huge. Having their name and their personality slandered in that way was really painful for them.”
Rasha was born in Baghdad. When they were two, their parents fled religious persecution suffered under Saddam Hussein. The family had a particularly difficult time emigrating because Rasha's father, a doctor, would not ordinarily have been allowed to leave Iraq. After arriving in the United States, the Shamoons fared well. At the time of their death, in addition to music and martial arts, among other interests, Rasha was pursuing their second master's degree, while Saba and their sister Suhair Shamoon have gone on to become a pediatrician and a dentist, respectively. The family's experience since the crash has come as a shock.
“We came here because we believe in what America stands for,” says Michaud. “My parents gave up their whole life to come here. For Rasha to be treated in that manner… It's maybe the only place in the United States justice system where you're guilty until proven innocent.”
Michaud says they didn't want the family to file a civil suit, that it hurt too much. Still, they say, “This is the only court we could get [Soldaner] into. We needed this to be public somehow.” The award will go into a trust, and will be used for charity.
The only known evidence that Rasha Shamoon caused the crash that took their life was the word of those in the vehicle that struck her, including the car's habitually reckless driver. Yet that was enough for NYPD to consider its investigation complete. The prevalence of cases like Rasha's will be taken up at Wednesday's City Council hearing on NYPD crash investigations and traffic enforcement, where the Shamoons will tell their story.
“It's really unclear to me how there could be such discrepancy between a jury and the police investigation,” says Michaud. “What it tells me is that there is no police investigation.
“I think they just want to keep traffic moving in as quick a manner as possible. I hate to say it that way, but I believe it's what happened.”
Should you donate to efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak in west Africa? With hundreds of millions of dollars coming in from other donors, will your donation make a difference? How does this compare to giving to GiveWell's top charities?
These are difficult questions. It's always hard to estimate how much good a donation does; it's much harder in the midst of a rapidly evolving situation like this one. It requires predicting the future path of the pandemic and the effects of response efforts. New information (and new donations) are constantly changing the picture. Further complicating matters, the people who best understand the situation are extremely busy, and we need to be careful with how we request their time. Even coming up with a rough take on Ebola involves major effort. However, at this point – due to some preliminary analysis and estimates – we are in the midst of conducting a small investigation, and hope to publish our take on donating for Ebola response within the next week or two.
In this post, we lay out the steps we've taken and the steps we're planning next for our investigation. We then discuss what goes into our decisions about how to respond to sudden, prominent donation opportunities like this one, and why we've decided to do an investigation in this case.
Our investigation
The basic question we're trying to answer is:(in terms of lives saved and similar benefits per dollar spent)(beyond what's already been raised, and including factors such as the risk that Ebola might spread to more countries in Africa or become endemic if not contained)?
Unfortunately, we don't know of any published efforts to answer this question. We also don't know of efforts to answer related questions such as “What is the expected death toll of the Ebola outbreak conditional on the current planned response, and how would this change if the response were better-funded?” The information and analysis we do have that seems most relevant is:
A CDC model that projects Ebola deaths under different assumptions about what proportion of cases are effectively isolated. The projection goes only through January 20, and covers only Liberia and Sierra Leone. There are also some other models with broadly similar properties. We initially tried using these models, but now provisionally believe they cannot be used for our purposes (more below).
Some basic information on the status of the UN fundraising appeal. As of now, $988 million has been requested; $486 million has been raised and an additional $233 million has been pledged.
Some basic information on the World Health Organization (WHO)'s hopes for the containment effort. A recent press briefing with a WHO representative states: “…the numbers we need to get behind are 70:70:60; that number is 70% safe burials, 70% cases being managed and cared for properly; and within 60 days of our start date which for UNMEER we're taking as 1st October. So, our goal is to have that in place by 60 days which would be 1st December.”
Initially, we tried to focus on using the CDC model to forecast Ebola cases at higher and lower levels of response efforts, which we tried to map to higher or lower levels of funding. However, we ran into several issues here.
One fundamental issue is that we know too little about the relationship between “how much money is raised” and “what sort of response is possible”: it might be that the activities most crucial to containing the epidemic can already be funded at current levels, and that additional donations would do relatively little.
Another major issue turned out to be that the CDC model already appears to be out of date (and specifically, overly pessimistic). The model incorporates data on cases through late August; reported Ebola cases since then are lower than the model predicted even in the maximal “strong response effort” scenario. It is possible that the recent reports of Ebola cases reflect issues with data collection (for example, perhaps people with Ebola are now avoiding care or healthcare workers are too overwhelmed to report data); but based purely on the numbers, we don't feel we can use the CDC model to make good forecasts for cost-effectiveness analysis.
Even if we resolved the above two issues, there would be major questions remaining. The CDC model covers only two countries, and only through January 20; it does not address cases in Guinea, the possibility that Ebola becomes endemic, or the possibility that Ebola spreads to other countries. We know little about the organizations involved in the response effort and how well they're performing, and it's unlikely that we'll be able to find out much about this question while the epidemic is ongoing.
We have also experimented with using a model published more recently by the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute, but we haven't yet determined whether this model could be useful. We haven't been able to compare this model's predictions to recent reports directly, but it appears to make similar projections to the CDC's for Ebola cases conditional on strong control as of December 31. We would need a better understanding of the model, and more discussion, in order to determine whether it might be used for a cost-effectiveness estimate (but even if we did use it for such an estimate, the estimate would remain problematic for many of the reasons listed above).
At this point, we're focusing on trying to set up conversations to gain more information about the following questions:
If we were to recommend donations to the response effort, how quickly could donations be utilized on the ground? Would they make a difference to the response effort?
What would these donations allow that could not be funded otherwise? Would they expand the most important response activities? Should we think of additional donations as having similar impact to the average dollar in the response effort?
How significant is the risk that Ebola spreads to other countries and/or becomes endemic? How should we think about the likely longer-term death toll, factoring in unlikely but extremely bad scenarios?
Should we infer from recent data that the CDC model was overly pessimistic, or is there another explanation for the low (relative to the CDC model's projections) reports of further cases?
If one donates to the response effort, whom specifically should they donate to?
We're first trying to see whether we can gain information by speaking with people who aren't directly involved with the effort, and who can therefore take time to speak with us in a low-stakes way. If necessary, we may need to create an estimate of how much money we might be able to raise for the response, in order to give people more information about whether talking to us is worth their time.
How we decide which crises to investigate
The people best positioned to understand, and help with, Ebola response are probably the people who have been working on pandemic containment, developing-world health systems, and other related areas for years before this crisis emerged. The best opportunities to prevent or contain the epidemic were probably before it was widely recognized as a crisis (and perhaps before Ebola had broken out at all – more funding for preventive surveillance could have made a big difference). We'd guess that a similar dynamic holds in general: it takes years to build expertise and context in an area, and the most crucial opportunities to make a difference will often be before the issue is getting widespread attention. In general, we think we'll find the best giving opportunities by picking good causes to focus on and working on them for years, not by scrambling to catch up on the state of knowledge about an urgent and chaotic situation. As it happens, biosecurity is one of our leading contenders for a focus area, and we have been actively investigating the area for a few months. One of our main focuses is on strengthening routine preventive surveillance. However, we are far from having the network and knowledge needed for a rapid diagnosis of the Ebola outbreak.

As it happens, biosecurity is one of our leading contenders for a focus area, and we have been actively investigating the area for a few months. One of our main focuses is on strengthening routine preventive surveillance. However, we are far from having the network and knowledge needed for a rapid diagnosis of the Ebola outbreak. When an issue is getting a lot of media coverage, it often attracts a lot of funding. All else equal, this makes giving less attractive, since we emphasize room for more funding. In past investigations (2010 Haiti earthquake, Japan tsunami), we found evidence that money was not the limiting factor for the relief effort.
Urgent issues also tend to be particularly difficult to investigate. The people who know the most about them tend to be extremely busy, and issues tend to be more newsworthy when they are more unprecedented and chaotic.
If we do choose to investigate a crisis, we generally need to make the investigation an urgent top priority in order to keep up with developing news. That means high involvement from senior staff and major disruptions to our workflow. It can be worth it, but the costs are high.
When a humanitarian crisis hits the headlines, we usually get a lot of questions along the lines of “How can I help and where should I give?” At the same time, there are several reasons that headline-dominating-crises tend not to make for the best giving opportunities, and particularly tend to be a poor fit for our work.
In some past crises, we have made major efforts to put out helpful content – particularly the 2010 Haiti earthquake and 2011 Japan tsunami. Our work attracted a fair amount of media coverage, and helped us formulate general principles for disaster relief giving, but it also took a lot of time and did not result in large amounts of donations (in 2011, when we covered both the Japan tsunami and the Somalia famine and recommended Doctors Without Borders for both, we tracked ~$50,000 in money moved to Doctors Without Borders; note that in these cases, we also stated that we did not feel the giving opportunity was as strong as giving to our top charities). We provided more limited coverage for the 2011 Somalia famine and choose only to provide general tips in response to the 2013 Philippines earthquake.
When a crisis starts getting coverage, we weigh factors such as (a) how many people are asking for our views and (b) how much capacity we have for an investigation, as well as (c) the likely “cost per life saved” (or similar metric) for donating to the relief effort.
In the case of the Ebola outbreak, we initially guessed that the outbreak would remain relatively contained, and that ample funding for the relief effort would come in. (High-profile donations from individuals and significant attention from governments both contributed to this view.) Recently, several things have changed:
Over the past week, we've heard from more people – particularly people who follow GiveWell closely – than we had in previous weeks.
The crisis has now been attracting significant attention, yet funding remains substantially below what has been requested.
The crisis appears quite relevant to our ongoing investigation of preventive surveillance. Many of the people we are speaking to about surveillance are heavily involved in the Ebola response.
In light of the above factors, we decided to put some time into a very rough estimate of what the “cost per life saved” might look like for the Ebola response. Some initial calculations indicated that the cost-effectiveness could be quite strong, consistent with the idea that containing a small number of cases now could prevent a large number of cases later. However, in light of our questions about the CDC model (among other issues), we don't think our estimate is usable, and decided to gather more information along the lines described above.
Ebola response may be an outstanding use of funds, largely because the right preventive measures could stop the problem from becoming much larger and more costly to contain. The same logic would apply at an even earlier stage – to the strengthening of everyday preventive surveillance, of the kind that could have led to much earlier detection and containment of this epidemic. If that's right, surveillance could turn out to be an outstanding cause to specialize in, under the heading of the Open Philanthropy Project.

Los Angeles — Despite the slow start to the season, Pistons owner Tom Gores still is optimistic about the outlook in the second half.
Gores spoke to media members during halftime of the Pistons' 102-97 win over the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center on Sunday night. They backed Stan Van Gundy — who has the dual role of team president and coach — and reiterated that they think they can make the playoffs this season.
“I have absolute confidence in Stan,” Gores said. “We are having a hard time — and Stan and I are very real about that — but we also know we have a great group of guys and we believe they'll work through this.”
The Pistons had lost three of the first four games on the five-game western trip but after the win Sunday, they're in 10th place in the East, just three games out of a tie for the No. 5 spot. Injuries and inconsistency have sidetracked the Pistons' first half of the season, leading to questions about their outlook.
“We've got a bump in the road and that's what success is about — you have to work through it. It's all about having rough times and your ability to work through,” Gores said. “I never worry about Stan because they want to win; he's the hardest worker I've ever seen in my life. I believe in them as a man and I believe in them as a strong person.”
Gores and Van Gundy had a face-to-face meeting that lasted almost three hours on Saturday, after which Gores felt comfortable with where the team stands — and where they can go in the remainder of the season.
“I think we're going to make a run. I like our guys,” Gores said. “We're going to make a run.”
Gores also showed support for keeping shooting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who will be a restricted free agent in the summer — and who could command a contract in the neighborhood of $20 million per season if they get an offer sheet from another team, which the Pistons would have an opportunity to match.
They didn't seem to have reservations about a big offer, especially on the heels of giving Andre Drummond a max deal last summer. Caldwell-Pope is having the best season of their four-year career and looks to be a cornerstone of the Pistons' franchise moving forward — that is, if they can re-sign him.
Gores is optimistic of that, too.
“I know Kentavious well.  They are a hard worker, he's reliable and he's improving every day,” Gores said. “He should be a Piston — that's just the bottom line. They have what it takes to be a Piston. They were a shy kid when I met them and he's become a leader.”

A NEW HOPE TO SAVE THE PLANET
Since the Industrial Revolution the oceans have absorbed approximately one-half (almost 525 billion tons) of human-released CO2 emissions. Where on one hand this has moderated effect of greenhouse gas emissions, it is chemically changing marine ecosystems to the extent of 100 times more rapidly than it has changed in the last 650,000 years. Due to the absorption of massive amounts of carbon dioxide, the pH (a measure of acidity) in ocean surface waters has decreased by almost 30%. As CO2 gets dissolved in the ocean the water there becomes more and more acidic. The acidic oceans are a threat to the climatic conditions of the globe in several ways.
I hereby propose that such bacteria which convert acidity to alkalinity should be put in millions in the ocean to solve the problem of acidity existing there. And to reduce CO2 in atmosphere the micro biome of land should be changed by multiplying those micro organisms which convert CO2 to more acceptable form. The micro organisms selected for changing the micro biome of land should be from land and not ocean. Just like the micro organisms selected for changing the micro biome of ocean should be from ocean and not land. Research should be done to find out those microbes which absorb heat and have a cooling effect in the ocean and on the land. A layer of microbes on clathrates (or cathrates) might also help resolve the problem of methane.
A note on the bacteria: There are methanotrophs (also called methanophiles) which are prokaryotes and are able to metabolize methane as their only source of energy and carbon. They can grow anaerobically or aerobically and require single-carbon compounds for survival. In case of aerobic conditions, methanotrophs combine methane and oxygen to form formaldehyde, which then gets incorporated in organic compounds by RuMP pathway or serine pathway. The Type I methanotrophs are a part of the Gammaproteobacteria and they utilize the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway for the assimilation of carbon. On the other hand, type II methanotrophs are part of the Alphaproteobacteria and make use of the Serine pathway to assimilate carbon. Characteristically they also have a system of internal membranes using which methane oxidation takes place. Methanotrophs mostly occur in soils, and are especially more common in the proximity of environments where methane is produced. Their habitats include underground environments, mud, oceans, marshes, rice paddies, soils, and landfills.

It's the end of an era for Microsoft.
The software giant's Office products will no longer include clip art. How are we supposed to add pizazz to our history reports now?
Microsoft is replacing the gloriously ‘90s icons with an integrated Bing Image Search. People typically use images they found online, so Microsoft figured they could take advantage of that and make people use Bing. Users also get more image options this way.
The image search in Office is pretty much the same as Bing's standard search engine, if you've used Bing before. Bing's images aren't resizable, so you'll have to search a little longer for the perfect background to your PowerPoint slide.
However, we won't have to worry about violating copyright on our class projects, either. The Bing Image Search will have Creative Commons filters switched on by default. Looks like we're going from clip art to fan art.

This is the live recording of sonatas based on soundtracks from the Heroes of Might and Magic franchise played on the piano by the composer Paul Anthony Romero himself. The performance took place during the Tofifest International Film Festival in Poland on the 24th of October 2015. The Heroes Piano Sonatas album contains the full live performance from that amazing concert as recorded by RATstudios. The tracklist contains four original piano sonatas written by Paul Anthony Romero exclusively for that event, and a surprising bonus track. Released on a double 12-inch white vinyl in a beautifully designed gatefold jacket with antistatic sleeves inside.
Vinyl Track List
Side A
Intro & Sonata of the Knight
Side B
Sonata of the Sorceress
Side C
Sonata of the Barbarian
Side D
Sonata of the Warlock feat. Magdalena Urbańska
Bonus track: Chopin Medley
Note from the composer – Paul Anthony Romero
I shall never forget my first visit to Poland. So many smiling friendly people and being surrounded by magnificent antique architecture: I was in a Polish paradise. The morning of this concert was particularly memorable. Walking into the concert hall in Toruń and meeting friends (who were there to help create this wonderful event) made me feel humble and thankful. It amazed me that the Heroes of Might and Magic computer games could inspire such a community of friends and music lovers! Walking onto the stage that night, sitting down at the piano and playing my melodies for attentive HoM&M fans was like sharing musical memories with newly discovered friends. I felt very grateful and happy that people would take time from their busy lives to come listen to my Heroes tunes and then say hello to me afterwards. That night was such a lovely and heartwarming experience.
When I was three years old I discovered the beautiful music of Chopin, listening to their nocturnes on the radio. Since then I have always searched the work and life of Chopin, trying to play their piano music and imitate their style within my own music. I wanted to be like them in whatever way I could. So now to be able to visit their country and meet people who enjoy my music is a sort of cosmic gift from Chopin himself. Because without them and their music I do not think I would have ever become a musician or a composer. And this is why I shall never forget my performance in Toruń! The memory will always be in my heart and my mind. Thank you to all who were there that night!
Note from the audio engineer – Matthias Adloff
It was a great honor for me to master the live recordings of Paul Romero for the exclusive vinyl edition. Not only is Heroes of Might and Magic one of the game titles that will stay in my memory forever, but also its soundtrack has always been remarkably different from many other games – it has been actually composed in a classical manner, whilst creating tension where necessary, being light and heavy at the same time. Simply a great composition. When I received the raw tracks for preparing the master, I wasn't surprised when Romero started their performance with a perfectly well interpreted snippet of Chopin's Nocturne op. 9 No. 2 and I really hoped that this would make it on the final vinyl. And yes, it did! The rest of the soundtrack is pretty much legend, so it was a joy to listen through the different moods and medleys that Romero performed and which reminded me of so many decades of my life.
From a professional view on things, the piano performance has been recorded perfectly. There has been almost nothing that needed any surgical treatment, except for the usual audience side noises, which are unavoidable with live recordings. The only real challenge was to improve the audio quality of the applause and especially Romero's words so that it would translate well even on vinyl. One can't do miracles here, but in my opinion it now sounds more than satisfying. In the end, I think that the final vinyl collection is an outstanding gem for anyone who loves the HoM&M series, and I'm very happy that I could participate in its making.
In a stark contrast to ITV's bells and whistles effort in the first two seasons of the Formula E championship, Channel 5 are taking things in a different direction.
It appears the broadcaster will not be adding any of its own ‘wrap around' studio discussion, instead choosing to just take the World Feed for the complete duration, a move that is understood to be down to budgetary constraints, multiple sources have told this site.
This is noticeable in the schedule for the Hong Kong ePrix: which runs at 120 minutes in length from 07:30 to 09:30 on Channel 5. The only voices Channel 5 viewers will hear on Sunday 9th October will be Nicki Shields in pit lane along with Martin Haven and Dario Franchitti in the commentary box.
ITV's studio coverage regularly featured the likes of Marc Priestley, Jaime Alguersuari and Alex Brundle amongst others, all of which viewers are unlikely to hear much from in season three on Channel 5, unless plans change further down the line.
Furthermore, qualifying from Hong Kong is not scheduled for live broadcast on Spike TV, although this really should not be a surprise given the early time slot (even if it contradicts the press release). However, all sessions should be aired live on Channel 5's social media outlets.
Given the large gaps for the first few races, it is always possible that a change of direction occurs with relation to the studio element if viewing figures are higher than anticipated. I can't say I blame Channel 5 for not pursuing studio coverage given ITV's viewing figures, but it suggests that the broadcaster does not have much faith in Formula E – even at this early stage in the contract.

1 Police Plaza, Manhattan- The NYPD released body cam video today from two officers who fatally shot 67-year-old Cornell Lockhart in the Hughes Shelter in the Bronx. The police responded to the shelter after receiving a 911 call for an assault in progress at 7:47 PM on November 13th. Upon arrival, officers found two females in the lobby with knife wounds. After moving past them, officers confronted Mr. Lockhart in the lobby who had a knife in their right hand. They repeatedly ask them to drop the knife but they did not comply. Consequently, both fired nine shots combined, striking Mr. Lockhart multiple times. They were pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.
You can watch the body cam video from both officers below. Read additional details in the first story we published on this incident.

Hello everyone,
This has been talked during beta it seems but I want to give it a shout and ask for more recent content than "March 14 Archive"
PLEASE IMPLEMENT EMISSIVE PHOTONS FOR SHADERS !
PLEASE IMPLEMENT at least CORRECT EMISSIVE for LIGTHS with LENGTH (Tube)
(tube lights emit point lights in static baked lights)
Having a new light system with "acturate light physics" make absolutely no sense if your lights are in incorrect positions !
It makes no sense and defeat the purpose of "accurate lights"
My games were lightened 100% with emissive shaders in UDK, and now I have to add point lights to square, triangle and immensely long pathways... just to have them "incorrectly emiting lights now in UE4.
Look at this : http://www.synthesisuniverse.com/
100% emissive shaders and photons baked lights.
PLEASE add and correct this for the sake of original creativity and REALISM !
Merci !
(I love so much everything else !) :D
Story highlights Car was doing 24 in a 35 mph zone

Google says its self-driving cars have never been ticketed
(CNN) No driver? No ticket.
That, at least, was the result when a police officer pulled over one of Google's self-driving cars Thursday in Mountain View, California.
The car wasn't speeding. On the contrary, it was driving too slowly -- 24 miles per hour in a 35 mph zone, according to the Mountain View Police Department -- with traffic apparently backing up behind it.
"As the officer approached the slow moving car they realized it was a Google Autonomous Vehicle," a police department post said.
Which is to say that no one was driving the darn thing.

For as long as graphics in video games have been realistic, people have criticized video game developers for the vulgar or crass depiction of women. Comically hyper-sexualized female characters are usually written off as marketing tools to pander to younger audiences, and because (so the argument goes) nobody is really hurt in the process, it is often ignored.
Misogyny in gaming is often argued on the basis of pure aesthetics. But the issue of misogyny in gaming is not just predicated on character design anymore; it has grown into something more systemic that frightens me as a gamer. It took a blatant act of laser-guided abuse to understand how many layers there are to sexual harassment in gaming.
As part of their promotion for Street Fighter X Tekken, prolific game developer and publisher Capcom funded a reality show called “Cross-Assault” where competitive Street Fighter and Tekken players compete for $25,000. It only took one episode of the show for a female competitor, Miranda “Super Yan” Pakozdi to be inundated with lewd sexual comments from the live-chat viewers, fellow competitors and even from their own coach, Aris Bakhtanians, a well-known champion of the fighting game community. They went on to forfeit the match and lost their chance at advancing.
The video is painful to watch as they get verbally harassed, and even smelled, by Bakhtanians.
After they tweeted about their discomfort, Bakhtanians' justification for their actions made heads spin all over the Internet. When Justin Rae, Twitch.tv's Community Manager, asked them on a later episode, “Can I get my Street Fighter without the sexual harassment?” They replied, “You can't. You can't because they're one and the same thing. This is a community that's, you know, 15 or 20 years old, and the sexual harassment is part of the culture. If you remove that from the fighting game community, it's not the fighting game community…. It doesn't make sense to have that attitude. These things have been established for years.”
The outlet that reported on this first, Giant Bomb, got its share of blowback from the community, criticized as being one-sided and unfair with their reporting. Many commentators argued that it was Bakhtanians just being Bakhtanians, and trash-talking really is part of the competition.
It takes only five minutes on Xbox Live and three comments on any video game-related YouTube video featuring a woman to realize that this kind of sexist rhetoric is everywhere gaming communities are. While many in the fighting game community are upset for being singled out, it is disgusting that this behaviour exists at all and that there is any sort of defence of this kind of conduct, excusing it as some sort of tradition.
Bakhtanians and the other guilty competitors have since apologized, and gamers have moved on, but as long as the industry grows to include more than just adolescent males, more of this insular fight club mentality will come to the forefront. Gamers know these attitudes are everywhere. Wait until everyone else does.
Is a public shaming good for the industry? Generally, no. Nobody wants to be represented by the loudest, craziest members of their community. But it might take just that for the 20-somethings who still use half-baked apologies to finally grow up and realize it needs to stop.
One does not have to look far for first-hand accounts of sexism, racism and homophobia in the gaming community. For years, feminist gamers and even peer-reviewed literature have expounded the types of discrimination in gaming but nobody really seems to care. When it is actually done in front of a camera and then blatantly brushed aside as “boys being boys,” that takes a special kind of entitlement.
To those who subscribe to Bakhtanians' thoughts on the fighting game community tradition, it's really this simple: sexual harassment is not a tradition worth conserving. I hope gamers, in all communities, realize that feeling entitled to malicious trash-talk is inherently repugnant and come to the conclusion that competition only gets this ferocious when you are not playing a game for fun anymore.
And we are at an unfortunate point where as long as abusive heckling is condoned, for some, games will never be fun.

In the space of a week, Aidy Ward has gone from a relatively unknown agent to back page news – and in football, when agents make the news rather than fashion what it contains, that spells trouble.
Ward's name had begun cropping up in stories of Raheem Sterling's contract stand-off as far back as January. Now, after Sterling's interview with the BBC – something the club had no knowledge of, therefore breaking policy – Ward is the focal point.
It is Ward, 34 years old, who has been largely vilified for their role in the recent breakdown in negotiations. It is Ward who has angered the Anfield hierarchy.
But just who is the man who has suddenly become a key part of these negotiations – and, in truth, a key player in what has become an expensive tug-of-war.
Ward is no charlatan or chancer.  They are also, in the purest sense, very good at their job.
They cut their teeth with Impact Sports Management and Rob Segal, both respected names in the business, with clients including Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Saido Berahino and, of course, Raheem Sterling.
Other members of its 200-strong stable include managers Karl Robinson and Sean Dyche, pundit Jason Roberts and Sky Sports presenter Jeff Stelling.
But Ward is now going it alone and has established their own agency – and Sterling, along with Berahino, have moved with him. Oxlade-Chamberlain is also thought to be joining.
The relationship between Sterling and Ward is apparent. Last year, Sterling sent out a tweet, wishing Ward a happy birthday. In January 2013, Sterling said: “Aidy is getting into my head to do more - do more on the pitch - and also how to behave off it.”
READ: James Pearce comment on the Sterling situation
That, understandably, was as low-profile as can be. A player paying lip service to their agent, one who they trust.
But now, the spotlight is on Ward, and how their clients have acted over the past few months.
When West Brom striker Berahino gave an unsolicited interview to Sky Sports in February, they angered their club, who now reportedly have no plans to initiate contract talks and will consider selling the talented striker in the summer.
A familiar tale, then – although Liverpool do plan on reigniting contract talks in the summer, and have no desire to sell Sterling.
In their set-piece interview, Berahino said: “I need to stay focused on what I'm doing right now which is scoring the goals and keeping West Bromwich in the Premier League.
“If I can keep them in the Premier League and score as many goals as I can, I'm pretty sure the fans wouldn't mind me pushing on and moving on to bigger things.”
A nod to the fans and respect to the club – but with an underlying message to communicate publicly. Berahino, like Sterling, looked to appease the fans – but it backfired.
History looks to be repeating at Anfield. In truth, this head-to-head between club and agent was over two years in the making.
In September 2012, just a month after Sterling made their first start for the club and having been called into their first England squad for the game against Ukraine, Rodgers said: “After I spoke to Roy Hodgson and Raheem, my next call was to their agent.
“I wanted them to be aware that this news was coming out and that, when it did, they aren't jumping in the car up to Liverpool to have a chat with me.
“I want to manage the expectations of the kid. The last thing we need is Sky Sports coming up with a yellow bar saying they have signed a five-year contract after playing two games.”
Comments which skimmed under the radar at the time, with Sterling's advisors unknown. But they, and specifically Ward, are known now.
If Ward wanted to create a buzz around themselves as they go solo, job done. But, in reality, Ward is just doing their actual job and is trying to get the best financial deal for their client - but whether he's helped Sterling in other aspects, such as career development and the overall picture, remains to be seen.
PARIS/GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization has reversed a ruling that Boeing (BA.N) received prohibited support for its newest aircraft, dealing a blow to the European Union in its long-running row with the United States over subsidies.

Monday's decision by WTO appeal judges overturns a ruling which had banned some Washington-state support for plants including a $1 billion factory designed to build the world's largest carbon-composite wings for Boeing's 777X jet.
A WTO panel ruled last year that a reduction in the state's business and occupation tax in return for a decision to place 777X production in the state had deliberately shut out imports.
But its appeals body found the tax breaks had not explicitly targeted trade flows, removing them from the WTO's most severe category of banned aid known as “prohibited” subsidies.
The decision neutralizes a potential trump card, which the EU played in 2014 to shake up the world's biggest trade dispute.
Prohibited subsidies are a form of aid that the WTO's 164 members consider exceptionally market-distorting and are automatically banned wherever they are proved to exist.
The WTO appeals body did not consider whether the 777X tax credits fell under the more common banner of “actionable” subsidies, since the EU had not resorted to fallback arguments as it gambled on securing a quick, game-changing victory.
But the EU may use evidence from the case to try to widen a previous successful claim against earlier versions of the same tax credits, meaning that although the EU's latest gambit failed, the 13-year-old war between Washington and Brussels over support for their dominant planemakers will continue.
“Today's ruling will strengthen the (original EU) case on the long term and allow us to expand our compliance demands,” Airbus spokesperson Maggie Bergsma said, while Boeing called the ruling a “sweeping and clear win”.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the EU had lost most of its claims and “cannot justify their own illegal subsidies by hiding behind groundless claims against the U.S.”
COMPLIANCE
Neither side has been able to make the key charge of prohibited subsidies stick at the appeals stage but both have won billions of dollars of claims about “actionable” subsidies, while disagreeing over who comes off worst and racking up an estimated $100 million in costs.
The WTO is considering appeals on whether each side complied with previous demands to remove billions of dollars of unfair support. A decision on whether the EU has fallen into line is expected at the end of the year, with a ruling on U.S. compliance due in 2018.
U.S. sources say the timetable could give the administration of President Donald Trump, who has pledged tough enforcement of trade laws, the first crack at introducing sanctions that could theoretically be targeted at any industry, not just aerospace.
If either side is found not to have complied by removing the harmful support for its planes, the other will be able to impose counter-measures. However, new disputes could arise if sanctions are imposed, despite claims to have complied subsequently.
A European source predicted legal procedures could continue indefinitely until both sides decide to settle. Airbus renewed a call for a broad global agreement on support for planemakers.

Jairo-Deal geplatzt – Berater-Forderungen maßlos
Jairo Samperio Bustara wird nicht wie geplant zu Hannover 96 wechseln.
Dienstagabend nach Hannover gereist
Der 24 Jahre alte Mittelfeldspieler von Mainz 05 war am späten Dienstagabend nach Hannover gereist und sollte heute Früh um 08.30 Uhr den obligatorischen Medizincheck absolvieren. Am Nachmittag, so der Plan, sollte Jairo das erste Mal mit seiner neuen Mannschaft in Hannover trainieren. Dazu wird es nun nicht mehr kommen.
Nachdem Hannover 96 bereits finanzielle Einigung mit Mainz 05 und auch mit dem Spieler (Gehalt und Vertragslänge) erzielt hatte, ist der Deal dennoch geplatzt.
96-Manager Horst Heldt: "Es ist sehr schade, wir hätten den Spieler gern unter Vertrag genommen. Allerdings hat sein Berater Christian Wein von der Agentur Promoesport, obwohl wir ihm ein branchenübliches Angebot unterbreitet haben, seine eigenen Interessen mit übertriebenen Forderungen über die der Vereine und seines Spielers gestellt."
So, you want to learn a new language…
…and you want it badly.
Let me tell you something that will utterly blow your mind:
You are not alone.
That's right! Believe it or not, there are others out there who want to learn a language just as badly as you… and some of them want to learn your native tongue.
Out of these eager learners, there's somebody who, in turn, is also a native speaker of the language you have your eye on. They might even be at around the same language level as you, whatever that may be.
That's what we call a win-win situation.
And it's the basic premise of language exchange apps.
How Does “Language Exchange” Work?
Are you an English speaker who wants to learn Korean (or Japanese, Chinese, French, German, Spanish, etc.)? Then you're in luck. There are thousands of native-speaking Koreans who really want to learn English! A Korean English-learner can teach you their Korean, and in return, you can make them wade through the English thicket. You can trade each other's native tongues. This is called “language exchange.”
A “language exchange” is different from getting an online language tutor. In a tutoring relationship, it's clear who's the teacher and who's the student. One teaches the other, and learning is pretty much one way. In a language exchange, two people teach and learn, in turn.
Language exchange websites like Conversation Exchange and My Language Exchange have been put up for the very purpose of pairing learners with the native speakers of their target language. You type in the language/s you know, and then the language you want to learn, hit “Enter,” and your search results will yield loads of people you can pair with. You then reach out to your potential buddy via text chat or email and agree on a specific time to meet up on Skype.
You and your buddy can tailor your sessions however you want. It can be a freewheeling discussion where you talk about whatever comes to mind, or you can see if the two of you can get the hang of a more structured interaction. (For example, the first 15 minutes could be you teaching, and then you could switch roles.)
This may all sound very intimidating. but in addition to using the apps below, learning with FluentU can help you feel more confident and inspired in your language exchanges, as it gives you access to cultural references and helps you warm up your listening skills with native speaker audio. FluentU takes real-world videos—like movie trailers, news, music videos and inspiring talks—and turns them into personalized language lessons.
You can talk about anything, and before long, you might have a true friend truly invested in your learning.
No money is exchanged, just language lessons.
What Are Language Exchange Apps?
With language exchange apps for smartphones, the whole process becomes mobile, kicking the experience up a notch. Now, you don't need to stay in your room and hog the laptop camera. You can go outdoors and learn on the go. You can give your buddy a more immersive experience, for example, by pointing your phone to street and store signs and using them to help them understand something. You could even show them how life is in your neighborhood.
Language exchange is an important element of your language learning experience, and language exchange apps just make the whole process more convenient. There's nothing like talking to a native speaker right on your phone and taking notes from someone who's a linguistic insider. Yes, using music, games and videos can have pretty profound effects on your learning curve, too, but don't you dare miss out on the awesome benefits of language exchange apps.
They have advantages that other learning resources simply don't have. For example, you can get instant feedback. Your partner can listen and check if you're pronouncing words right. If you have questions on the nuances of the language, you can simply ask the person on the other end of the video chat and get an immediate answer, as opposed to waiting for somebody to type in an answer to your query on a language forum.
Language exchange apps get you to both practice and sample the language, in a setting where it's A-okay to bungle the words or use the wrong verb form. Nobody's grading you, and the person on the other end of the line knows exactly what you're going through because they're basically in the same boat.
That said, let's now look at some of the best language exchange apps that you can add to your learning arsenal. They're all free and available for both Android and iOS.
The Fluency Connection: The 4 Best Language Exchange Apps
Like I said before, no need to fire up Skype just to interact with your partner/s. HelloTalk is a standalone app that can do so much more than just connect you with someone who speaks your target language.
It's loaded with features that save users from the awkwardness of not being able to express themselves enough to be understood. Consider the basic conundrum of language exchange: They want to learn English, you want to learn Chinese. How do you actually interact with them or explain things when the very language you'll be using is their target language? They understand Chinese alright, but if you only speak Chinese, she's not going to learn English.
Enter HelloTalk. The app has Translation, Transliteration, Voice-to-Text and Text-to-Voice features.
Your Chinese friend can simply speak in their native tongue. As you receive the voice message, you can use the Voice-to-Text feature to see a written form of what was said. Cool, huh? Still don't understand the message? Use the Translation feature and see the message interpreted in your own language.
HelloTalk interactions are a bit slower, which is really a good thing since nobody's put on the spot and expected to be suddenly fluent in the target language. You're not straining so much. The back-and-forth of messages takes a little more time because both parties are processing the communication. And this is when learning truly takes place.
When language is learned in the context of a friendly conversation, and augmented with HelloTalk's awesome features, learners get more insight from the whole interaction.
Bilingua is a language exchange app that goes beyond partnering you with a complementary native speaker. It wants to ensure a fun, easy and educational interaction for its users. And this is reflected in the features that the app carries.
It has a “smart chat” feature, which gives you suggestions on what to talk about, so you never run out of topics during the exchange. It even recommends specific phrases you could use.
Best of all, to ensure that you find somebody who shares your hobbies, interests and personality, when you first start using the app, you're taken through a series of personal questions. Your answers help its algorithm pair you up with somebody similar, ensuring a more productive language exchange experience.
And all this happens under the watchful eye of “Shiro,” Bilingua's adorable mascot.
Wouldn't it be nice to have a native speaker answer all those nagging questions that inevitably come up when you're trying to learn a new language? And wouldn't it even be better if you didn't just have one but a whole truckload of native speakers waiting to help you, and none of them got testy even after your 48th question?
HiNative is a Q&A platform that specializes in getting your questions answered by the most competent speakers of your target language. Its interface is really easy to navigate, and the button you're going to be using the most is the “Ask” button.
HiNative really makes it easy for you to get your question out by providing categories/templates like, “How do you say this?” and “Does this sound natural?” (This one gives you an audio-record function where you let native speakers hear you pronounce a specific word or phrase and give you feedback on whether you sound natural or not.)
There's also a category called “Ask Something Else,” which is a catch-all for those questions that don't belong in the others. This is usually where cultural queries and opinion questions find room.
And because this is a language exchange, you can and should help out others by taking the time to answer some of their questions. It won't take much effort, and it will really help out other members of the language learning community.
With Tandem, you can text, talk or video chat with someone on the other side of the world.
The app has prominent social-networking functions, and you can “Follow” people as well as check out those who follow you. You can also write reviews about users you interacted with and can send “good vibes” their way. (This is like you telling other users, “She's cool.”) You can also filter the people who can see your profile and choose them by characteristics like gender or age.
You're not limited to just one picture but can upload as many as six. Punch up your profile and encourage interaction by writing about the topics you want to hear others talk about. For example, you might say, “I think hot dogs are God's gift to humanity. What do you think?”
Remember, there's Tinder and then there's Tandem. One is for dating, and the other is for language learning. Before you're accepted into the Tandem community, you're reminded that the app should only be used for language learning, not flirting. (So if somebody rubs you the wrong way, there's a “Block” function conveniently provided by the app's developers.)
In addition to all those cool features, the app has a “Tutor” tab, where you can find vetted tutors of the language you want. Or, if you want to earn on the side, you can fill out a profile to become a language tutor.
These are four of the very best language exchange apps out there.
They're so advanced that they have features that may seem a little bit Star Trek-y.
But they'll be worth nothing unless you hit that “Send,” “Call” or “Ask” button.
Don't wait for someone else to make the first move.
Make it yourself and gain a new friend in the process.
And One More Thing…
If you want to be up-to-date on all the latest language learning tech, you've got to check out FluentU.
FluentU takes real-world videos like music videos, movie trailers, news and inspiring talks, and turns them into language learning experiences, as you can see here:
FluentU has interactive captions that let you tap on any word to see an image, definition, audio and useful examples. Now native language content is within reach with interactive transcripts.
Didn't catch something? Go back and listen again. Missed a word? Hover your mouse over the subtitles to instantly view definitions.
You can learn all the vocabulary in any video with FluentU's “learn mode.” Swipe left or right to see more examples for the word you're learning.
And FluentU always keeps track of vocabulary that you're learning. It uses that vocab to give you a 100% personalized experience by recommending videos and examples.
Start using FluentU on the website with your computer or tablet or, better yet, download the FluentU app from the iTunes store or Google Play Store.
A mugging victim in the U.K. identified their assailant on Facebook's 'People You May Know' feature, which led to the attacker's arrest.
Recognized on the feature along the right sidebar of the social network, 21-year old Omar Famuyide was identified as a mugger brandishing a knife during a car robbery. Police also linked them to to a string of other crimes -- they received a jail sentence of more than 15 years last month.
After the suspect was identified, police in Birmingham were able to link Famuyide to multiple armed robberies and charge them with several crimes. Some of those incidents included threatening women with a handgun in an attempt to rob them as well as stealing a BMW by pointing a gun at the car owner.
During their trial, Famuyide was found guilty of "robbery, attempted robbery, possession of a firearm and possession of a knife" according to the BBC.

Speaking about the Facebook evidence, Birmingham police officer Rhiannon Daff said "Old fashioned detective work got us most of the way and we were able to build enough evidence to link all of the different items and offences, but we still didn't have a name. It was a crucial part of the investigation when one of the victims got in touch after recognizing Famuyide on Facebook and was the final piece of the jigsaw that we were looking for."
Daff also commended the victims that came forward in order to testify against Famuyide. After the guilty verdict was announced, Famuyide was sentenced to a 17-year jail term for their crimes. Of course, this isn't the first time the social network has played an integral role in the arrest of a criminal. Just last year, police arrested two bank robbers after they decided flashing stolen cash in Facebook selfies was a brilliant idea.
In a virtual workspace, the employees do not have to be physically present in a certain place in order to carry out their work. This is considered to be a web-based service which is a preferred remote access solution by companies that opt to not have a bigger space for the venture.
With the presence of a virtual workspace, the employees are given access to particular software applications, network file shares and virtual desktops from any device or computer. They can do such provided that they have an internet connection. As a matter of fact, there are instances when students may be able to use applications including Mathematica, SPSS, and Minitab. All of these are easily available as well.
Working Virtually
How do you do this, then? It would only take a matter of logging into a virtual workspace which may be given by your provider. You can do this with the use of a TU NetID and a password.
Most creators of such software would want to ensure that their goal is to deliver many applications to any kind of device that will be accessed through the virtual workspace. There is a list of applications that you may want to review in order to succeed in here. Usually, it is reflected in a software inventory which may work for sure.
The Features
The modern workplace has indeed a tenfold of features that may shock many individuals. Well, it cannot be denied that almost everything has changed now. There is a tenfold of new tools that may share the work and it may be a chance to communicate easily with colleagues out there.
Who has not experienced editing a Google document? Or jumping into a Slack channel so that a hot topic about work may be discussed? These may all be done even while responding to a text which may be received from a customer. There are those who would upload files to their Dropbox and afterward, they would text their bosses that they are working on a big presentation over the weekend. Apart from this, it cannot be denied that all information is now in the cloud.
The Implication
Even if there are new means to work now, one goal has not changed yet, it is unlikely to ever will – what is this? To ensure that employees become even more productive. It should be more than ever. This should also change the turn out of events.
Indeed, there are scholars out there which have argued that there is a rapid rise in the productivity which is normally fueled by the economy of other countries. In economics, this productivity would always refer to the amount of money which is made per hour. When it comes to this formula, the emergence of electricity and even the acceleration of the automobile cannot be denied. This is why this virtual workplace would be considered by many individuals out there. That is for sure. Just look for the right property and success is just within your fingertips!
Wear Mini Launcher for Android Wear arrived a few days back to address one of our main gripes with Google's smartwatch OS . With a swipe from the top left, the wrist-based launcher made it easy to access the list of installed apps on your watch. And over the weekend the app has been updated a couple of times with various bug fixes — including solutions for issues affecting Gear Live owners — while adding another oft-requested feature.
The latest version of Wear Mini Launcher introduces a quick shortcut for brightness into the app list, allowing you to toggle your backlight level using the slider that appears at the top of the screen. It's considerably quicker than navigating into the Settings app and choosing one of the five or six preset levels, and it addresses another of our top complaints about the initial release of Android Wear.
Android Wear owners can grab the app from the Play Store link above. If you're already using the Wear Mini Launcher, hit the comments and let us know how you're getting on!

The Church of Scientology is making a mad scramble for damage control after one of their top global leaders was arrested in Australia, RadarOnline.com has learned.
Jan Eastgate, President of the Citizen's Commission on Human Rights within the Church of Scientology, is accused of covering up child sex abuse by coaching an 11-year-old girl to lie about the abuse they endured in order to protect the Church.
PHOTOS: Celebrity Death Threats
Eastgate was arrested in Sydney on Thursday, May 26, and charged with perverting the course of justice, their passport was taken away and they were released on bail.
Carmen Rainer is the whistleblower who detailed allegations of Eastgate's alleged cover-up of the sexual abuse they were experiencing at the hands of their step-father, Robert Kerr, in 1985.
PHOTOS: Celebs Involved In Murder
“The Church got involved and they sent Jan Eastgate over to drill me and tell me what to say to the police, and what to say to docs,” Rainer told Australia's Lateline, explaining that both of their parents were devout Scientologist's at the time.
Just three years later, Eastgate was awarded Scientology's highest honor, the Freedom Medal which is given to those who have defended the cause of religious freedom and show courage and determination in bringing greater freedom to humankind while supporting and protecting the Scientology religion.
PHOTOS: Celebrities Who Died In Bizarre Circumstances
John Travolta was awarded the Freedom Medal in 1991 and Tom Cruise received theirs in 1995.
“Just say no. Don't say yes, because otherwise you will be taken away from your parents and you'll never see your family again,” Rainer said, describing how Eastgate coached them in order to protect the Church of Scientology.

Eastgate is due to face their charges at the Downing Centre Court on June 16.

A two-month-old baby was nearly killed after a Nigerian 'nurse' was paid £100 to perform a circumcision at their Plumstead home.
Taiwo Shittu, aged 55, of Atwood House, Dulwich, has been jailed for 30 weeks after pleading guilty to GBH at Woolwich Crown Court.
On November 23 last year, the baby boy was brought into Queen Elizabeth Hospital's A&E department in Woolwich by their parents who were concerned about the amount of blood they were losing following the procedure.
Doctors examined the child and deemed their condition to be life-threatening. They were immediately transferred to Guy's and Thomas' for emergency surgery, where a team of plastic surgeons attempted to rectify the damage caused to their penis.
Due to the seriousness of the child's condition, specialist detectives from the Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command launched an investigation.
The parents of the child told officers they had arranged for Shittu - whom they named 'Ms Alhaja' - to perform the procedure at their Plumstead home and had paid them £100.
Efforts to trace Shittu began immediately and they were arrested in Dulwich on December 2 last year after ignoring all requests to make contact with officers.
Them home address was searched and officers found medical paraphernalia including hospital grade antibiotics and surgical scissors.
Shittu stated they were a nurse and midwife in their native Nigeria and that they had performed many circumcisions there and in the UK since their arrival in 2004.
Detective Sergeant Kam Sodhi of the Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command, said: "Shittu claimed to be an experienced nurse but they have no medical qualifications either as a nurse or midwife in the UK.
"The care they provided in the course of the procedure was so bad that it not only put a very young baby in a life threatening condition but it amounted to a serious crime.
"This was a medical procedure which, like any other, carries a risk. They failed to properly manage it and because of this caused the baby a serious and permanent injury."
Learning HTML Prototyping—Where the Hell Do I Start?
OK, so you've read what various UX thought leaders have said or written about prototyping in HTML (or more generally about UXers being able to code) and you're convinced that HTML prototyping is an important skill. Maybe you want to improve the collaboration between you (the designer) and your developer colleagues. Perhaps you want to improve communication with stakeholders. Or maybe you want to get your designs in front of your users earlier.
If you're a freelancer, it could be that you are looking for ways to raise your hourly rate. Or maybe you're an in-house designer who's looking for a better job and who sees the value of having this important skill on your résumé.
But where do you start?
The following is my attempt to show you the alternatives that are out there. I hope it helps you find the way that best suits you.
Disclaimer: I have included Livetyping, which I created. Yes, I think it's great. But I recognize that different people learn in different ways. If self-paced, screencast-based learning isn't your bag, I'm sure you'll find an alternative here.
Workshops
There have been several HTML prototyping workshops run in various locations. A good example is UX Bootcamp's Prototyping in Code, an intensive three-day workshop that has been run twice in London, UK.
Pros:
It's aimed specifically at UX designers.
It's good for procrastinators and others who struggle with self-paced learning.
Cons:
It's a bit pricey (£299, which translates to $475).
It's only any use if you live within a reasonable distance of the venue.
It's not available right now. You'll have to wait for the next one to be scheduled.
Books
Hundreds of books (maybe even thousands) have been written about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Here are a few notable ones:
There is also Todd Zaki Warfel's book, Prototyping: A Practitioner's Guide, which touches on HTML prototyping, but does not go into much depth.
Pros:
You are spoiled for choice.
Books are relatively cheap.
There are some great books out there.
Cons:
It's hard to know which books to buy from the huge selection available.
None of them are really tailored for UX designers who want to learn how to prototype in HTML.
Not everybody likes learning from books or has the necessary self-discipline.
Online Video Courses
There are dozens of sites that offer screencast-based courses. For example, Lynda.com has lots of courses on just about any tech-related subject you could mention, including ones on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There is a lot of good content out there, but most of it is not aimed specifically at UX designers. It's more for people who want to become web designers or web developers.
Pros:
They are typically self-paced, which is great if that works for your learning style.
The cost is usually reasonable.
Cons:
They aren't tailored for UX designers.
You need to do your research to find the right courses.
You end up wasting time learning stuff that's not really relevant for HTML prototyping.
Free Online Resources
Where do you go to find almost infinite resources about web technologies? The web, of course! Again, the quantity of information available is staggering. You can get all the information you need, but there are two problems: finding it, and being able to tell the good from the bad.
A few selected resources:
Pros:
Cons:
It takes a lot of time to find the right resources and work through them. How valuable is your time?
Livetyping is a series of screencast lessons that teach you prototyping in HTML, CSS, and Javascript at your own pace. It is tailored for UX designers and doesn't include stuff that you don't need to know.
Pros:
It's tailored specifically for UX designers.
It's great if you can't dedicate a big block of time all at once.
You can work through it at your own speed.
Cons:
Not good for procrastinators or those who struggle with self-paced learning (though it's probably better than books in this respect).
Conclusion
HTML prototyping is a valuable skill that is in demand. There are many different ways to get this skill—some will suit your own personal learning style and how you value your time better than others. Best of luck!
You can get Livetyping here.

PHILADELPHIA — Hillary Clinton couldn't deliver their big speech Thursday accepting the Democratic nomination without some encountering resistance from their own party, as they were taunted by signs held up by delegates that challenging their integrity and their policy positions.
As they spoke from the podium in Wells Fargo Center, they had to look out at a bright red placard hoisted high on a pole that read: “Keep your promises.” Another sign raised high on a pole said: “Walk the walk.”
Several members of the California delegation wearing shirts endorsing their primary rival, Vermont Sen. Bernard Sanders, rearranged their “Hillary” pole banners to spell “Liar.”
Another delegate held a sign well above the crowd that mimicked a couple of Mrs. Clinton's slogans. It read “Yes we can REVOLT” and “Fighting for HERSELF,” with the word “us” crossed out in the latter.
It also displayed the word “Oligarchy” in a crossed-out, red circle.
The demonstration during their acceptance speech capped a raucous and contentious four-day convention, where party officials labored to quiet Bernard Sanders supporters and present an image of unity heading into the general election race against Republican nominee Donald Trump.
SEE ALSO: Hillary Clinton seizes history, tells Dems 2016 election a ‘moment of reckoning'
On previous days, Sanders delegates booed and jeered when speakers mention of Mrs. Clinton's name.
The crowd in the stands Thursday also was dotted with signs that blared opposition to trade deals, and to hydraulic fracturing or fracking, issues that are crucial to liberal activists and about which Mrs. Clinton's positions have been murky.
Other signs screamed out: “Thank you bernie,” backing their far-left primary rival whose run Democratic National Committee officials plotted to sabotage in order to benefit Mrs. Clinton.
Mrs. Clinton also was confronted with a smattering of signs proclaiming support for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, whom many of the Sanders supporters switched to after the Vermont senator lost.
A sign on a pole carried the slogan “Jill not Hill.”
Several times during the speech, when Sanders delegates tried to chant their name, a greater number of delegates would yell over them “Hill-a-ry.” The results could be heard competing with Mrs. Clinton's words on the television feed.
The opposition from within their own party did not dissuade Mrs. Clinton from making an appeal for support to Americans from all stripes.
“I will be a President for Democrats, Republicans, and independents who are supporting our campaign,” Mrs. Clinton said. “For the struggling, the striving and the successful. For those who vote for me and those who don't. For all Americans together.”

The introduction of the Raspberry Pi, an inexpensive, powerful single board computer, has contributed to the explosion of today's makerspace. Add a little hardware, some Java, Python, or C++ code, and suddenly, you have a robocar, a low-cost media center, a Wi-Fi connected weather station or, in my case, an easily controllable model railroad.
In 2015, I posed a question, “Can I create a web application, written in Java, for the Raspberry Pi that would make it easier for people to program controller sequences for their hardware without knowing a programming language; with mouse clicks and drop-down menus?” The answer was a resounding “Yes” and thus, Breezy4Pi was born.
Breezy4Pi enables a user to dynamically model the inputs and outputs of hardware mounted on the Raspberry Pi, map the inputs to trigger the execution of macros which, in turn, manipulate components such as semaphores and motors that have been mapped to the hardware's outputs. The mapping is done using mostly drop-down menus while the creation of macros and event triggers are akin to filling in the cells of a spreadsheet, once again using mostly drop-down menus. Although, Breezy4Pi is young, I'm finding it to be my preferred way of programming the train yard control panels and traffic light simulators on my model railroad.
Hardware attached to the Raspberry Pi is treated as boards, both mounted and unmounted. A mounted board means that it is configured and operational. In this example, we are modeling part of a traffic intersection with various pins of an I/O extender, such as an MCP23S17, being mapped to semaphore component LEDs. Clicking on the ‘Test' button runs a small test program that helps the user verify the component's physical connection.
Events are triggered in response to changes in input conditions. Here, these five inputs will each start the execution of an individual macro when it transitions from high to low.
Here is a partial example of a macro. Each component on each mounted board has a set of functions that the macro can execute such as, ‘Turn On', Pulse, etc. Everything is symbolically referenced so that a user doesn't need to know how a component is mapped to an I/O extender pin but merely that one wants to blink the “Walk” light, for example.
In conclusion, combining the maturity and power of Java with the power of the Raspberry Pi has yielded a powerful sequence controller that will only become more powerful over time. Add in a REST interface and one could query from a remote machine how hardware is attached to the Raspberry Pi, how it is configured and even execute macros remotely. Best of all, Breezy4Pi is free for personal use. Check it out at www.Breezy4Pi.com and on GitHub.
A central component of our North Korea strategy is persuading China to exert its decisive economic leverage on Pyongyang. China has applied certain import bans and sanctions, but it could and should do more. We will also continue to pursue American interests in other areas of our relationship, including trade imbalances, intellectual property theft and China's troubling military activities in the South China Sea and elsewhere. China's rise as an economic and military power requires Washington and Beijing to consider carefully how to manage our relationship for the next 50 years.
Defeating terrorism remains one of the president's highest priorities. The administration's aggressive strategy to counter the Islamic State delegates greater authority to American military commanders on the battlefield, giving our forces more freedom and speed to do what they do best, in partnership with indigenous fighting forces. As a result, the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS has accelerated operations and has recaptured virtually all of previously held Islamic State territory in Iraq and Syria. While our military was helping clear Iraq and Syria of Islamic State forces, our diplomats were following up with humanitarian aid and assistance, such as clearing land mines, restoring water and power, and getting children back in school.
A commitment to stopping Islamist terrorism and extremism also motivated the administration's decision to adopt a new South Asia strategy, which focuses on Afghanistan. That country cannot become a safe haven for terrorists, as it was in the days before the Sept. 11 attacks. Pakistan must contribute by combating terrorist groups on its own soil. We are prepared to partner with Pakistan to defeat terrorist organizations seeking safe havens, but Pakistan must demonstrate its desire to partner with us.
On Russia, we have no illusions about the regime we are dealing with. The United States today has a poor relationship with a resurgent Russia that has invaded its neighbors Georgia and Ukraine in the last decade and undermined the sovereignty of Western nations by meddling in our election and others'. The appointment of Kurt Volker, a former NATO ambassador, as special representative for Ukraine reflects our commitment to restoring the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Absent a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine situation, which must begin with Russia's adherence to the Minsk agreements, there cannot be business as usual with Russia.
While we are on guard against Russian aggression, we recognize the need to work with Russia where mutual interests intersect. Nowhere is that more evident than in Syria. Now that President Vladimir Putin has committed to the United Nations-backed Geneva political process for providing a new future for Syria, we expect Russia to follow through. We are confident that the fulfillment of these talks will produce a Syria that is free of Bashar al-Assad and their family.
LANSING, Mich. (June 18, 2012) – Last week, Michigan joined the swelling ranks of states considering legislation that would effectively block any state cooperation with federal officials seeking to detain Americans under provisions in sections 1021 and 1022 of the National Defense Authorization Act.
On June 14, Rep. Tom McMillin (R-Rochester Hills) introduced HB5768. The legislation would prohibit any state agent, state employee or member of the Michigan National Guard from assisting “an agency of the armed forces of the United States in any investigation, prosecution, or detention of any person pursuant to 50 USC 1541, as provided by the federal national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012, Public Law 112-81, if such aid would place that state agency, political subdivision, employee, or member of the Michigan national guard in violation of the United States constitution, the state constitution of 1963, or any law of this state.”
Five cosponsors signed on to the bill, including two Democrats and a 10-year Air Force veteran.
“Once again we see the bipartisan nature of the pushback against federal kidnapping,” Tenth Amendment Center communications director Mike Maharrey said. “This is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue. This is an American issue.”
In the 1840s and 1850s, northern states effectively used a similar strategy to block implementation of the Fugitive Slave Acts. The federal law denied due process to blacks accused of running away from slavery. A slave-owner could haul a man or woman back south simply on the authority of their own testimony. A black person was not even allowed to testify in their own defense. Northern states passed personal liberty laws, in some cases refusing state cooperation, denying the use of state resources to slave commissioners and forbidding state officers to participate in the process. Other state laws guaranteed any person charged as a fugitive slave a jury trial.
Michigan passed its personal liberty law in 1855. It guaranteed in section two, “All persons so arrested and claimed as fugitive slaves, shall be entitled to all the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus and of trial by jury,” and section five declared, “No person arrested and claimed as a fugitive slave shall be imprisoned in any jail or other prison in this State; and any person having the care or control of any jail or prison, and knowingly permitting the imprisonment of such alleged fugitive slave therein, shall be subjected to the payment of a fine of not less than five hundred nor more than one thousand dollars.”
“The Michigan legislature has an opportunity to take its place alongside the heroic lawmakers who defied the federal government to protect the basic rights and liberties of blacks more than 100 years ago,” Maharrey said. “These men and women can take an important step to ensure the basic right to due process is preserved for all Michigan citizens. I hope they are up to the challenge.”
HB5768 was referred to the House Committee on Government Operations.

The planned auction of a skull found at Gettysburg that purportedly was that of a Civil War soldier has been canceled following protests, and officials say the remains have instead been donated by the auction company for burial with honors.
Estate Auction Co. of Hershey had listed the skull for sale at auction Tuesday in Hagerstown, Maryland, drawing protests from the U.S. National Park Service in Gettysburg and others.
The listing was removed from a public auction website and replaced by a statement saying the auction company was donating the skull to the Park Service. "At the auction company's request, it remains as part of the catalog due to its historical value," the statement said.
Gettysburg National Military Park and the nonprofit Gettysburg Foundation said Tuesday in a news release that the remains had been donated to the foundation late Monday. After they are authenticated, they will be donated to the park "for interment with full military honors in the Soldiers' National Cemetery at Gettysburg," the announcement said.
The park and foundation said auction organizers had been "overwhelmed" by "an unprecedented outcry from concerned citizens."
Auctioneer Tom Taylor told WHAG that they believed "like the National Park Service told me, it should have a proper burial."
Gettysburg National Military Park superintendent Ed Clark said in a statement that officials were grateful for the opportunity "to honor what is very likely an American veteran and have their final resting place recognized."
The auction site said the remains were found in 1949 as a garden was being tilled on the Benner Farm in Gettysburg. Notarized and handwritten documents said the remains, along with 13 other artifacts, were found two miles north of a barn used as a field hospital during the Battle of Gettysburg, Taylor said.

Gettysburg park spokesperson Katie Lawhon said there are two Benner Farms in Gettysburg, and one was known to be a hospital during the war. They told the York Daily Record that in their two decades of working in Gettysburg, they had never heard of a soldier's remains being offered for sale.

Mickey Sage has been jailed for two years and three months (Picture: Met Police)
A man has been jailed for over two years after they went round a London area looking for Muslims so that they could stab them.
Mickey Sage, 24, armed themselves with a 10-ins knife and went round Camberwell Green where they threatened people in the early hours of June 7.

Police were first called to Camberwell Green Court after threatening people at 1.43am.
Less than 10 minutes later they were called again to Camberwell Green junction with Camberwell Church Street after reports of a man pulling a knife on people and asking if they were Muslim.
While being taken into police custody they told an officer ‘it was my knife and I was out to kill a Muslim'.
They then made a number of Islamophobic comments and once at the police station they admitted that they were out to find a Muslim to stab them.

They said that they ‘would be a martyr for England and stab an imam in the neck.'

Sage pleaded guilty to two counts of threatening a person with a knife an public place, accepting the incident was religiously aggravated.
They were jailed for two years and three months at Inner London Crown Court.
DC Samuel Cafferty from Southwark CID said: ‘Sage set out with a large knife with the clear intention to find Muslims to stab. Hate crime like this has no place in any society.
‘Sage poses a very clear and present danger to members of the public, particularly the Muslim Community and I'm pleased that they now has plenty of time to consider their actions.
‘Members of public confronted by Sage were not harmed but shaken by their ordeal and managed to get away from what could have been a very different ending.'
Scotland Yard added: ‘We would appeal to anyone who witnesses or suffers any hate of any type to immediately report it so that action can quickly be taken and catch those responsible.'
Hate crime can be reported through 999 in an emergency, by dialling 101 in a non-emergency, directly at a police station, through the MOPAC Hate Crime app or through community reporting methods such as Tell MAMA, Galop, or the CST.
Since J Dilla's passing in 2006, the late, great Donuts auteur has been honored with a slew of posthumous releases. This year alone, Jay Dee has been revived via a handful of newly unearthed highlights (“Anthem,” “Trucks,” and “Diamonds (The Shining Pt. 1)”) and a few beat-wise tracks by Dilla disciples (Disclosure and Jonwayne). Now, the man born James Yancey will be immortalized by way of actual doughnuts.
The Detroit News reports that J Dilla's uncle, Herman Hayes, plans to pay tribute to the beloved producer with a new coffee-and-doughnut shop called Dilla's Delights. Hayes, a former baker, hopes to open the business sometime in October or November. When they do start serving their nephew's favorite snack, Hayes will be working out of an 800-square-foot-space in the ground floor of the Ashley, a luxury apartment building that was previously the Milner Hotel, where Dilla lived briefly as a toddler.
“He was on their deathbed making Donuts, and I felt like that was partly a tribute to me,” says the 58-year-old Hayes, who used to bring Dilla doughnuts as a child. “I felt I should honor that and respect that and give back to him.”
Dilla's Delights will serve roughly 20 different types of doughnuts — all made entirely with organic ingredients — from Mondays through Saturdays, and, on occasion, during Detroit Lions home games. The menu will be stuffed with references to J Dilla's life and work, with treats named after specific places they lived and pieces of music they crafted (i.e. Conant Gardens Glaze, Fantastic Fritters, McNasty Macaroons). Music, of course, will be a constant presence at the shop, specifically the work of Dilla and the tunes they sampled throughout their career.
“I want to honor my nephew in the right way, and this is a good way to do it,” Hayes says. “Not by putting out another album, but putting a sustainable business with their name on it that I plan on being in Detroit long after I'm gone. It's just what I can give back to them for giving us that music.”
(CNN) It's that time of year. You know what we're talking about. Your New Year's resolutions have lost their urgency and your plan to work out three or four times a week has fallen by the wayside. After all, reasons not to exercise can be easier to come by than arguments to actually drag yourself to the gym.
Yet, while those excuses might sound perfectly legitimate when you formulate them in your head...are they really good reasons to abandon your fitness program? Probably not.
We asked some of our favorite trainers for the most absurd, hilarious and just plain crazy excuses they've ever heard — or used themselves. Next time you find yourself scraping for an excuse to skip leg day , remind yourself that you don't want to end up on this list next year.
The "personal crisis"
Yes, there are moments in life when you should probably not prioritize your workout over a last-minute emergency. These are not those times.
1. Home "disasters." If a pipe bursts in your home, the toilet overflows, or a natural disaster befalls your neighborhood, we'd understand if you couldn't make it to the gym. But " If a pipe bursts in your home, the toilet overflows, or a natural disaster befalls your neighborhood, we'd understand if you couldn't make it to the gym. But DailyBurn Pilates instructor Andrea Speir says, "I had a client call me and tell me they saw an ant in their house and couldn't leave to come to their session because they had to wait to see if more ants showed up," Speir recalls. "She said, 'When there's one, there's usually a bunch lurking somewhere...' So they wouldn't be able to make it in."
2. Your own mortality. Sports performance coach and professional athlete Andia Winslow says she'd been prodding a friend/client to return to workouts for awhile, when they received the response: "I recently died." If this were true, we'd say it would be a pretty good reason not to show up to a workout. But, unless this DM was from the undead, it seems unlikely. "I definitely got my own abdominal workout from laughing at the entire text thread," Winslow says.
3. Your (not-so) supportive S.O. Sure, if you break up with your significant other we won't blame you for skipping a workout or two indulge in some ice cream. But Noam Tamir, CSCS, founder of TS Fitness in New York City, says one client had to cancel for other reasons, "[She said], 'My boyfriend is in town and they get jealous because they think I have a crush on you so I can't come in." Lame? Yeah.
4. You're too busy today. Good luck convincing a trainer that something else on your schedule should preclude your session. Larysa DiDio, a personal trainer and fitness author who's trained celebrities, Olympians and professional athletes says, "A high profile client of mine tried to cancel because they had to shop for their husband's birthday. I wouldn't allow it and made them sprint with me to the store, down Madison Avenue. They did squats and lunges in the store while we shopped and then sprinted back home." So much for that excuse.
5. You got a boo-boo. Even instructors dream up reasons to skip the gym. Roger Lawson, C.S.C.S., of RogLawFitness (who deems themselves the Sultan of Sexification, by the way), cops to having thought up a few creative excuses of their own over the years. One of their favorites: "I cut my finger and I don't want it to get infected." Band-Aid, perhaps?
6. Too. Much. Whiskey. Ever woke up after a night of partying, trying to piece together what happened? Rob Sulaver, CEO and founder of Bandana Training, once got a message from a client reading, "Yo Rob. Sorry I can't make our workout today, I accidentally woke up in Berlin." Sulaver says they never quite got the whole story, "But my client was doing a little bit of partying and eventually came-to in Berlin..." For the record...Rob is based in New York City.
7. The medical "emergency." This may seem like the perfect get-out-of-jail free card. After all, nobody can fault you for a trip to the ER, right? That is, unless you accidentally blow your own cover. Winslow recalls, "A former client canceled about two hours prior to a session citing 'severe IBS' and an emergency rush to see their physician. I checked Instagram. They were at Bloomingdales on a shopping spree buying some 'hot Louboutins!'"
The beauty disaster
While compiling these excuses, one thing became clear: Your trainers aren't loving your last-ditch attempts to preserve your blowout.
8. You fear the fashion police. Yes, it's true that fitness is experiencing a fashion moment. But trainer Tony Gentilcore, strength coach and co-founder of Cressey Sports Performance, says "I once had a woman state to me that the color of the clothes they were wearing that day didn't match their mood, so as a result they couldn't work out."
9. Must moisturize. Lawson, the asupervisorstioned sultan, admits he's relied on a grooming excuse or two in their day, including that, "I don't have any lotion and I'm far too ashy to go out in public."
10. You're too relaxed. "I think my favorite quote of all time from a client was, 'I am so sorry I can't work out. I had a massage yesterday and I don't want to mess that up," says Michelle Lovitt, strength and conditioning specialist and fitness expert.
11. That blowout was expensive. By far, the most common category of excuses we saw from trainers were related to your 'do. Brett Hoebel, celebrity trainer on NBC's The Biggest Loser Season 11 and author of The 20 Minute Body, says he'll always remember a client who came in with full hair and makeup and stopped training in the middle of a session. When asked what was the matter they said, "You're going to make me sweat and ruin my hair!" They learned their lesson. "Now, when a woman comes in with a blowout I ask them if she's prepared to pull their hair back and get into it," Hoebel says. Garson Grant, master trainer at The Sports Center at Chelsea Piers in NYC, says he's fallen victim to this excuse, too. "The funniest one I've heard was, 'I don't want to sweat, I just did my hair,'" Grant says.
12. Mani-pedi problems. Fitting in workouts is all about planning ahead of time, people. And that means not scheduling a nail appointment adjacent to your sweat session. "A woman told me they just got a mani-pedi an hour before our training session and the polish was still wet," says Jason D'Amelio, MS, ATC-L, ART-C, certified athletic trainer and owner of Total Athletic PT. Maybe get your polish done after your workout next time, eh?
13. Faux lash flaws. News flash: high-intensity interval training will involve some sweat. But Dyan Tsiumis a trainer at The Fhitting Room in New York City, a gym specializing in HIIT, says a client once told her, "I can't sweat. The heat makes my fake eyelashes fall off."
14. Dog poop. OK, this one might be legit. D'Amelio says a woman called out once after walking their dog. "She stepped in poo, so they couldn't train [because] they had [crap] on their shoes...which I was actually thankful for."
The fitness cop out
Trying to get back in shape after you've spent the past few months as a couch potato can be tough — and downright intimidating. Plus, workouts can be painful. Does that mean you should take the easy way out? Not according to these trainers.
15. It's too hard. Fear you'll collapse Fear you'll collapse collapse mid-burpee and embarrass yourself? "Something I hear often from friends and people I socialize with is that they 'need to get in shape' before they come to one of my classes," says Liz Barnet, a personal trainer and instructor at SLT and Uplift Studios in New York City. DailyBurn trainer Ben Booker, who devised the killer new LTF strength-training program at DailyBurn, says he's heard similar excuses when convincing people to try LTF. "Just jump in and modify!" Booker advises. "[Getting in shape] doesn't happen overnight, but it happens.
16. I can't be seen at the gym yet. If you feel like you can't even mingle with the super-svelte crowd at the gym until you lose a few, you're not alone. Emily Cook Harris, an instructor at the Fhitting Room, says clients tell her, "People will see me before I'm ready!'" We feel ya. But we guarantee that those selfie-taking gym snobs you fear are only looking at one thing while they sweat— themselves.
17. The fear of DOMS. Avoiding DOMS, or delayed onset muscle soreness, is another common cop out. Cook Harris says she's had clients say, "I didn't workout the past two days because I didn't want to be sore for our training session." Hmmm. And she's also heard, "I'm going to an awesome party and don't want to be sore because I plan to do a lot of dancing. So we should cancel our session." Two points for honesty?
18. But I'm on a diet. Dolvett Quince, the celebrity trainer on season 16 of NBC's The Biggest Loser, and author of the New York Times best-selling The 3-1-2-1 Diet, says the worst excuse he's ever heard is, "As long as I don't eat a lot, I'm fine." While we know you can't out-train a bad diet, exercise can be key to firing up your metabolism — and getting toned.
19. I'm too hungry post-workout. We've all been guilty of slamming a burger due to runger. But that doesn't mean you should just laze around when you're on a diet. Kira Stokes, an instructor at BFX Studio in New York City, and the founder of Kira Stokes Fitness says they had a client tell her, "I am more hungry when I exercise, so I'm going to take a few days off so I eat less." Stokes' reaction: "WHAT?!?! Clearly a long lecture ensued and no session was allowed to be canceled. End of story."
20. I'll start next week. Remember when we said scheduling your workouts is key to actually making them happen? Well, don't let just one slip throw off the whole week. Lawson admits he's gone down the road of, "It's Tuesday and I was supposed to start working out on Monday and I don't want to throw off my schedule, so I'll start next week."
21. The fake out. In a truly devious move, Winslow says she's had a client try to convince them that they actually did show up for a missed workout. Winslow recalls, "[He said] 'I showed up to the workout but where were you?' As though I mixed up the location and stood them up." Winslow was only training at one facility at the time. Nice try, buddy.
The straight-up absurd
Some excuses are so impressive you just kind of have to appreciate them. If you ever land in one of these situations, we officially give you permission to skip your workout, too.
22. You're a gambling man. D'Amelio says a client canceled on them because they had to run to place their bets at the Belmont Stakes before they closed. On the bright side: That client won $5,000.
23. Car problems. Professional athletes are rife with excuses, according to Tim Hartwig, C.S.C.S., who has worked with more than 300 pros as a strength and conditioning specialist. They say, "All my athletes [had] showed up to training for the day, minus one...Mind you, this was for the 2010 NFL Combine coming up in a matter of weeks, and millions of dollars were on the line for the draft."
When their athlete showed up the next day, Hartwig said they asked them what happened. "To my astonishment they said they were on their way to the facility when they noticed...it was time for them to change their oil in their car so instead of training they decided that was more important." That client did get drafted. And they later went on to win Superbowl XLVI.
24. You just won an Oscar. DailyBurn Black Fire trainer Bob Harper, who recently starred on season 16 of The Biggest Loser, got the mother of all good excuses from one high-profile client. Harper says, "I can't give you any names but I once had a client cancel on me saying, 'I can't work out today because I won an Academy Award last night.'" Fair enough.
25. Real talk. "I'd much rather sit around naked and eat ice cream and watch Game of Thrones," says Lawson. Let's face it: We've all been there.
Is Jesus a hate crime?
Police on Long Island ponder this question in the aftermath of an anonymous donor placing a picture of the crucifixion on a fence outside a mosque in New Hyde Park, New York. The cops reportedly regard the gift as a “bias incident” against Muslims. But the tacky turquoise picture featuring squiggly lines and a silhouette Christ seems more of an offense against aesthetics than the law.
A worker at the Hillside Islamic Center found the artwork at around 5:30 p.m. on Friday. They immediately phoned the police.
Surveillance video captured a frame-by-frame account of the alleged criminal act. The candid camera reportedly shows a man leaning the picture of the crucifixion against a fence, and then making their escape by walking away.
“My reaction was kind of surprised,” Abdul Bhuiyan told News12 Long Island. “In this community…we've been here since 2002. This is the first time this has happened.”
Such “bias incidents” occasionally work the other way. For instance, on Palm Sunday in Cairo, Muslims left a bomb rather than a painting at a church. The explosion killed 21 Christians.
Muslims regard Jesus as a prophet, a clue that, once discovered, might help investigators close this whodunit.
The unknown suspect remains at-large and perhaps armed with other hateful paintings, sketches, and etchings. Police hope to stop them before they give away more illegal art. As numerous local reports note, Nassau County Crime Stoppers urges anyone with information on this “crime” to call 1-800-244-TIPS.

policymakers have suggested a variety of strategies to reduce injury and death from prescription opioid overdose, including drug-monitoring programs, scrutiny of doctors writing prescriptions and improved access to substance-abuse treatment.
Now a study has found evidence that legal access to marijuana is associated with fewer opioid overdose deaths. Researchers with the Department of Veterans Affairs found that in states where medical marijuana was legally available, death rates from opioid overdose were on average 24.8 percent lower than in states without medical marijuana.
The differences generally were even greater in states where medical marijuana had been available for longer periods. The study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine.
The authors acknowledge that various factors that are hard to measure may be at work, including differences among states in health behaviors, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, and medical or psychiatric diagnoses.
But by comparing the same state before and after the passage of medical marijuana laws, the researchers say they were able to control for population variations between states, even those they could not specifically identify.
They do not recommend the wide adoption of legalized cannabis on the basis of this study. Still, the lead author, Dr. Marcus A. Bachhuber, a fellow at the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center, said that medical marijuana laws might have unexpected benefits.
“The next step would be a study of individuals over time,” they said. “If studies of individuals suggest that laws shift behavior, we could be reasonably confident of our results.”
Labour's Pat Rabbitte says they would like to see a referendum on gay marriage in the lifetime of the current government.
However they said there was a heavy schedule of proposed amendments, and the government would have to consider the matter carefully before committing to a time-frame for any new referendum.
They made the remarks after a vote in favour of gay marriage at the Constitutional Convention voted to recommend a referendum on gay marriage.
Speaking in Dublin today, Rabbitte said they would like to see the matter being dealt with during the lifetime of the current government.
"I would certainly like to see us being able to fit it in to the schedule of constitutional amendments but I would emphasise that there is a very heavy schedule there already in terms of commitments to reform and, in particular, go to the people on amendments to the constitution itself."
RR Podcast: Cuban election process, an exercise of the people democracy
2017-07-14 09:57:50 / web@radiorebelde.icrt.cu / Translated by: Aylen Lesmes Bonachea
Which are the features that characterize the Cuban election process? How can we exercise our right to vote? The publicity exists in our election process? Which are our delegates' functions?Why we say that our vote is free, direct and secret? The lawyer Amanda Laura Prieto Valdés, professor at the Faculty of Law of Havana's University and a member of its Legal Department answered to these and other questions at the program Haciendo Radio.
For Prieto Valdés, the Cuban election process has as its prime characteristic the right to vote of the Cubans older than 16 years, whom have the possibility of exercise their vote in a free, direct and secret way.
In one of its articles, the Election Law adds that all Cubans men and women, members of military institutes included, with the required age, that are in full possession of their political rights and are not included in the foreseeable exceptions of the Constitution and the Law, have the right to participate as voter in the periodic elections and referendums that would be called.
The election system it is also expressed since the constitution of the election commissions, which have the function of directing the process, its organization, the education and training of the appointed people and to guarantee the compliance of the letter of the Election Law which establishes how the elections are made in our country.
Precisely the election commissions are conceived as the organisms in charge of carrying out and lead the electoral process before, during and after the elections. Because of that it makes up certain levels: national, provincial, municipal, district and especial election commissions for verifying and guiding the full achievement of the approved regulations within the boundaries which they exercise their jurisdiction.
The Lawyer Amanda Laura Prieto Valdés, professor at the Faculty of Law of Havana's University's appearance in the program Haciendo Radio.The graduate Ana Laura asserts that some people perceive the Popular Power's delegate as a mediator, and it is not like that, because the delegate not just deal, hear and collect their electors' approaches but they also have the legal authority for calling each one of the state representative in order to consult their community's complaints or worries and demand all the time the answers for each case.
It is also a part of the explanation about their duties in front of those who elected them as their representative in the district.
Due to that it is the importance of the delegate's nomination meetings, because it is a process in which each Cuban, according to the Election Law's requirements, can propose to whom they consider with the most quantity of merits for taking the responsibility.
And once nominated, in Cuba there is not campaigns in favor of one or other candidate, or any publicity.
The autobiographies are exposed in public places for the electors' information.
How do I decide for whom to vote? The autobiographies are exposed in public places for the electors' information, analysis, studying and argumentation when the time of exercising the right to vote for each Cuban.
By whom are the election commissions composed? Our mass organizations have a wide component as part of the structure that integrates them, which directly guarantee the popular participation and they are conformed for supporting the whole election process in each one of its levels.
For the lawyer and professor at the Havana's University, Amanda Laura Prieto Valdés, unlike other countries, our Party is not an electoral organ, nor choose neither propose, nor promote neither nominate, it is the people and just the people who since the first instance propose and nominate their possible district's delegates, municipal and provincial delegates and later the deputies.
The Cuban pioneers: the relay and the guarantee of transparency
The polls' custody by the Cuban pioneers is a distinctive characteristic of the elections in our country, unlike other nations that it is not in this way.
For the graduate Ana Laura Prieto, this action endorses the process' transparency as a mechanism of the society, in which the people exercise their real power, giving the most public character to the elections in the exact moment when each citizen exercises their right vote in an individual form.
It is a secret, free and direct vote which is expressed when the citizen arrives at the electoral school and they just has to show their identity card for checking if they appear or not in the electors' register, nobody comes with us to the polls later and before, we have the right of exercising the vote in a secret form, neither there is vote guided, and there is just the popular wish of doing it in a responsible and sovereign manner.
A solemn moment is when the voting paper is introduced in the poll and the pioneer salutes, validating the right to vote of each Cuban citizen, something that also stores up a symbolism for the future generations which, in their moment when arriving at the age of majority, will have the opportunity of voting for the candidate they consider is the most qualified for representing them.
The people and its participation in the votes counting
Do we have the right of participating in the votes' count, as citizens? Of course, and it is established in this way by the Election Law. It is other moment that allows expressing the people's democracy, since it is ordered the opening of the polls in order to demonstrate the neatness and veracity of this process, until the conclusion of all the voting papers' recount and the inscription of the votes' quantity received by each candidate in a certificate of election, in all these moments the elector can be present, verify the process and be part of it.
The winner will be the one who receives the most quantity of votes, if there is a tie or some of the candidates would not receive the necessary quantity of votes, established by the Election Law, a second round of votes is needed, which would be equally called with all the requirements and guarantees.

Kyle Okposo's admittance to the neuro intensive care unit in Buffalo General Medical Center created concern in the Sabres' dressing room and around the hockey world.
It also raised questions, including how serious is Okposo's situation and what exactly is a neuro ICU?
[UPDATE: Okposo reportedly has been released from the hospital]
Here is general information not specific to Okposo. The Sabres, who must abide by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the NHL's collective bargaining agreement, have said only that they are under the care of their doctors while dealing with symptoms of an illness.
Question: What is a neuro ICU?
Answer: A neuro intensive care unit comprises an area of the hospital devoted to a team of specially trained physicians, nurses, therapists and other professionals. They are outfitted with equipment to assess, monitor and treat patients with disorders or injuries of the brain or spinal cord.
A neuro ICU is generally found only in large, major medical centers. It is reserved for the most seriously ill or injured patients. The staff must manage extremely complicated conditions with risks of death or disability that often require experts from multiple medical disciplines to diagnose and treat.
Q: Why would a patient be admitted to the neuro ICU?
A: Stroke, either from a blockage in an artery in the brain or a rupture from a hemorrhage, is a common disorder that lands patients in the units. But neuro ICUs also care for an array of other issues, including epilepsy, brain infections such as meningitis and encephalitis, degenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease, and brain tumors.
Q: Why can't the Sabres say more?
A: The federal HIPPA rules set boundaries on the use and release of health records. It establishes safeguards that health care providers and others must achieve to protect the privacy of health information. Also, it holds violators accountable with civil and criminal penalties that can be imposed if they violate patients' privacy rights.
Q: But NHL coaches give injury updates all the time. Why not with this illness?
A: Article 34 of the collective bargaining agreement between the NHL and the players' union deals with the players' medical health. It defines what can and cannot be shared.
The teams, league and NHL Players' Association may disclose medical information that is “reasonably required for professional sports operations and related to the player's employment as an NHL hockey player.”
For anything not defined as an injury (which would be the case with Okposo), the parties may only publicly disclose that a “medical and/or health condition is preventing the player from rendering services to the club." They can also announce the anticipated length of the player's absence.
The Sabres have said Okposo will miss the rest of the season, which concludes with two games this weekend.
Couldn't have said it better myself.
Over the past seven days I've seen the city where I've spent most of my life transform into a police state, to the point where I am honestly scared of the roving gangs of riot cops wandering around downtown, looking for trouble. Think I'm overreacting? Police yesterday were given sweeping powers of arrest for the duration of the G-20 Toronto Summit — with no public debate, no prior notice.
One of the early arrests was a computer security professional and member of the hacklab.to community. Their crime? Penetration-testing the “security theatre” around the event.
Having purchased a hacker-related book or two myself over the weekend I'm expecting my door to be knocked down and my cat and I to be dragged off any minute now.
Even if I'm lucky enough to escape such a fate, G-20 panic has still made it all the way north to my sleepy condo, where additional security has been hired (I haven't verified their powers of arrest or if they're armed) and the following memo distributed:
A recommendation was made to have residents of townhouses on the street sides remove any items that my be used as potential weapons from the patios. This may include seasonal furniture, barbeques, propane tanks, gardening tools or ornaments, bicycles, etc.
Who knew that airborne garden gnomes were public enemy number one?
As for the benefits to be reaped by our fair city I certainly can't see any, at least beyond the overtime for police and the financial windfall for chain link fence moguls. I've heard the theory that our government deliberately chose the downtown core as the G-20 site to show off our robust financial sector — too bad the hard-working folks who have actually made our economy so robust have been relocated or otherwise inconvenienced by the summit.
But what do I know? You can watch this televised debate and hear people who are smarter than me weigh in on the subject.
As a potential terror threat ordinary citizen the message to me has been made quite clear: Keep your head down, do what you're told and stay away from the security perimeter.
Culture of Fear, anyone?
Universal Bitcoin Exchange
http://www.localbitcoins.com
Localbitcoins.com has easily been the most pervasive Bitcoin Exchange of 2012. A Plug and Play system which allows for Face to Face or Local area transactions.
Localbitcoins.com comes with an inbuilt Escrow, multi-factor authentication and an inbuilt wallet. Built on GPS technology, this nifty service tracks the location of users who wish to buy and sell Bitcoin.
I was fortunate to catch up with Jeremias Kangas (Chief of Localbitcoins) for a quick interview on their initiatives for Bitcoin.
Interview with Jeremias Kangas @kangasbros
Tell me a bit about yourself. Where are you from? What was the tipping point for you to get involved in Bitcoin? How big is your team?
I'm from Finland, been programming since I was a kid. I first heard about Bitcoin on november 2010, just before I went backpacking to India for a month. After that I started working on various bitcoin projects as a hobby, and soon noticed that it is consuming 90% of my time. Then I decided to go full-time retard on Bitcoin, move on from my previous work. Now I'm trying to make a living as a bitcoin entrepreneur 🙂
Our team consists of me, my brother and a couple of part-time freelancers. My brother is currently doing a master thesis at university, so I have loads of work trying to keep this going forward! I hope my brother completes their thesis quickly 🙂
Do you think that Bitcoin is ready for the mass adoption and use? If No, Why not? If Yes, How can it spread faster?
I personally believe in solving the scaling problems as they come. Engineers tend to overstress scaling issues, even when they aren't a real problem yet. Look at Twitter, for example – it was constant failwhale when the site was becoming popular, still the concept succeeded pretty heavily.
I think the best marketing strategy for Bitcoin is to market it towards startups and innovative small companies. I have been myself doing this kind of promotion in the finnish startup scene. I'm pretty sure that soon we will be seeing startups popping up around bitcoin like mushrooms!
Big companies tend to be conservative and slow, and one of Bitcoin's strengths lies in enabling new kind of business models. This is the reason why I believe that startups will bring the change faster.
I see that you are involved in several Bitcoin projects. Would you be able to give us a short summary of all the initiatives that you are working on.
– LocalBitcoins.com – our main effort currently, and probably the most known project
– Django-bitcoin – open source bitcoin library for the django web framework – https://github.com/kangasbros/django-bitcoin
– Easywallet.org – started as an instawallet clone, now has lots of different features that make it quite distinct
– Acceptbit.com – developed as a joint venture with Stefan Thomas in Berlin bitcoin hackathon (weusecoins.com) – https://github.com/kangasbros/electrumpos
– Bitcoin/payments-hackathon – Have been organizing these events in Finland and once in Berlin. The idea is a weekend of completing some Bitcoin-related project, and publishing it. I really like this kind of “hacker events”.
As Localbitcoins is a well known site, any future plans of adding an international online exchange as well?
We are doing tools for those who want to do online trade as well. However not traditional order-book-based exchange. More like a toolset for setting up a fixed-rate online exchange – allow anyone to setup fixed-rate online exchange in any country, with any payment methods! That is the vision anyway, let's see how it will look in practice.
We just recently released this “escrow” feature in localbitcoins. It basically tries to automate the selling process, making it both safe, efficient and quick for both participants. We have been getting some good feedback, and plan working on the concept based on how people use the feature etc.
Any road map for 2013? Any partnerships envisioned?
I will be working 24/7 on everything bitcoin related, but localbitcoins will be the main focus. No partnerships yet, however we are open to any ideas.
Any thoughts on Bitcoin in India?
I love India! Have been backbacking there a couple of times. I think bitcoin would be much more revolutionary in country like India, than for example country like Finland. Some things:
– When I was traveling there, smaller shops had often changed problems. Bitcoin could solve this in the future 🙂
– Online bookings (hostels, trains, etc) were pain in the ass, I never got my international visa working. Bitcoin could help with this as well.
– I've heard India has nowadays more and more native, born-global startups, and there is strong startup movement emerging. Bitcoin could be really the technology to get Indian startups off the ground! Cost-effective way to pivot your product on global marketplace.
I hope that I will be able to do my next backpacking trip to India with Bitcoin! 🙂
Localbitcoins.com is the most recommended Exchange in India right now. This has enabled a lot of trades and people get onboard every day.
Wishing everyone a Happy and prosperous 2013 and hopes of effective solutions to enable the permeation of Bitcoin into our everyday lives.

“I think we would be totally in the right to [execute homosexuals]. That goes against some parts of libertarianism, I realize, and I'm largely libertarian, but ignoring as a nation thing that are worthy of death is very remiss.”
Eleven months ago, Scott Esk, currently a Republican candidate for the Oklahoma State House of Representatives, said those words on my Facebook wall (he has since deleted those posts, but they were well-documented beforehand). And while Mr. Esk is obviously an extreme example of right wing authoritarianism, the logic through which they still consider themselves “largely libertarian” serves as an immense warning across the libertarian sphere about a worrying ideological trend in the liberty community and the dangers of guilt by association in the information age.
I feel compelled to begin by clarifying that when Mr. Esk and I exchanged those comments, they were not a candidate for office and I had no reason to expect they would become one. I also had no part in that conversation's publication this week. At no time before the initial stories ran did any media personnel contact me, and I did not contact any of them. It was not an ambush, it was not a trap. Like many libertarians, I use my Facebook page as a blog, a news aggregator, a meeting place for my acquaintances, and as a personal pulpit for my libertarian views. I have “friends” across the ideological spectrum, and I think that makes for more interesting conversations. My page is also open to the public, lest there be any concerns that these publications represent a breach of Mr. Esk's private communications.
Mr. Esk's comments speak for themselves, and I have no desire to rehash the outrage I felt at the time or to regurgitate the ubiquitous anger with which people have responded to the story. In fact, I believe the justifiably hyperventilated response to their comments is clouding a much more important issue than the insane beliefs of a fringe candidate in an Oklahoma House race: that Mr. Esk has identified themselves as a libertarian while advocating for the most brutal violations of individual rights. This is far too common in liberty circles, and evinces a failure on our part as libertarians to distance ourselves from these attitudes and the people who espouse them. Opponents of libertarianism certainly can't be expected to make the distinctions on our behalf, and so we must make it for them.
“I think it's OK to kill gay people for being gay” is a fringe view even among homophobes, but consider how many times you've heard arguments in the form of “I consider myself a libertarian, but…” followed by some arbitrary denial of liberty.
I consider myself a libertarian, but…
… we need to stop letting so many immigrants live here.
… I don't think gay people should be allowed to marry or adopt children.
… I support drug prohibition.
… I'm not sure Muslims can be trusted with freedom of religion or contract rights.
… I support the war on terror.
Liberty is a popular word these days. Trust in government is at historic lows. Support for the two major parties is at historic lows. The anti-Bush wave that Barack Obama rode into the White House has eroded, especially among young Americans, as the Obama Administration reneges on promise after promise, demonstrating that the disregard for the Constitution, for individual liberty, and for basic human rights that typified the Bush years is in fact a bipartisan consensus in favor of an aggressive, ever-expanding state.
This burgeoning support for libertarian ideas is obvious in the data. Young people overwhelmingly support long time libertarian positions on gay marriage, on drug legalization, on foreign policy, on immigration (in fact, millennials are the only cohort in America in which a majority favors amnesty).
But disaffected independents and liberals are not the only refugees flowing into the libertarian tent. They are accompanied by the flotsam of various increasingly marginalized right wing factions: Christian nationalists, Reconstructionists, Neo-Confederates, etc. And many of these people are not coming to libertarianism via a change of heart, but out of a desire to co-opt a popular label and rebuild their shattered coalitions toward an authoritarian end.
A representative sample of this effort is Gary North (and it's a fitting one, considering Mr. North's comments about homosexuals), who has argued quite explicitly that libertarianism is to be embraced by right wing authoritarians as a means of delegitimizing the state not, as libertarians believe, as a matter of course but in order to give they and their ilk enough space to create a brutal theocracy that can ultimately replace the American government. Does that sound crazy? What about when you consider that Mr. North was chosen by none other than Ron Paul to oversee Rep. Paul's educational outreach efforts?
The desire among many libertarians to build coalitions as a means of enhancing our political power is understandable, but these particular coalitions are indefensible, especially at a time when offhanded comments one person makes on another's Facebook wall can easily surface a year later and circulate around the world instantaneously.
That all individuals, regardless of race, religion, gender, orientation, birth location, etc. are created equal and must be treated equally under the law is a principle at the very heart of libertarianism and the liberal ideals from which it sprang. Even setting aside the philosophical issue with rejecting that principle, as a simple practical matter the generational movement of the American electorate is glaringly in the direction of social tolerance toward homosexuals, immigrants, and other historical outgroups.
If the purpose of building coalitions is to increase the political power of libertarianism, then to ignore those obvious political trends when building those coalitions is utterly incomprehensible. It makes more sense to view the presence of people like Scott Esk and various other social authoritarians under the libertarian banner not as a success for coalition building, but as an attempt by adherents of those brazenly illiberal ideologies to co-opt the increasingly popular libertarian label and twist it, as Gary North advocates, to their own sordid ends.
Scott Esk espoused nasty, indefensible beliefs, and they are rightly being excoriated for it. But we cannot ignore the fact that the primary difference between Scott Esk and a great many self-described liberty advocates is Mr. Esk's willingness to publicly declare what others merely leave to implication: that some arbitrarily distinguished people just don't deserve the same rights as the rest of us.
Article after article declares itself the harbinger of the “libertarian moment” in American politics, but it's plain to see that such a moment will never arrive as long as libertarians are so ineffective at guarding our own gates. The threatened left waits with bated breath for any opportunity to depict libertarianism as a fancy veneer over the same old bigoted, privileged right wing drivel. Libertarians can't prevent them from saying it, but at the very least we can do our part to ensure it isn't true. Libertarians also can't prevent people like Scott Esk and Gary North from identifying themselves as libertarians, but we absolutely must do a better job proving it isn't true.

After a fiery debate that pitted Morton Grove library trustees against one another, the board voted 5-2 on Thursday not to accept a donation of about $3,000 from an atheist blogger.
The money is part of a controversy that has embroiled the Morton Grove Park District, the blogger and most recently the community's public library.
Hemant Mehta, a Naperville teacher who writes a blog called the Friendly Atheist, launched a fundraising campaign after a local veterans group, American Legion Post 134, pulled funding and volunteer resources from the Park District because of a park board member's refusal to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.
Reached by phone Thursday, Mehta said they were surprised.
"I'm in shock right now," they said. "I figured at least the library would take it."
Library Board Treasurer Catherine Peters said they stopped library staff from depositing the check this month, calling it a matter that should be voted on by the board.
Board President Mark Albers, who voted to accept the donation, said they had no idea whether the money was from Mehta's fundraising campaign or Mehta himself.
But many board members were more alarmed by the nature of Mehta's blog and the ethical implications posed by accepting money from him.
Peters referred to the blog as a "hate group."

Bruce Bartlett, a former Reagan staffer, thinks Fox News is bad for the GOP.
In a paper titled "How Fox News Changed American Media and Political Dynamics," Bartlett writes about the rise of Fox and how it has changed the way conservatives consume and think about news and politics. They ended the paper by citing a political scientist who said Fox made it hard for the party to move to the center or increase its appeal.
Fox News is usually dinged by the left, so when a guy who worked for Reagan (and George H.W. Bush, Ron Paul and Jack Kemp) does it, it's noteworthy. But it's not unheard of. Bartlett cited some anti-Fox comments from noted Republicans in their paper; Newt Gingrich characterized the network as biased during a private meeting in 2012, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Fox made it hard for them to pass immigration reform in 2011, and last year, now-former Sen. Tom Coburn (Okla.) said Fox is "totally not fair and totally not balanced." But typically, GOP politicians play nice with the network. It's a no-brainer for politicians courting GOP primary voters. The channel occupies the top of the ratings — not just among cable news channels, which it consistently does, but sometimes all cable TV. And going on Fox is speaking to the GOP base.
The media landscape for Republicans that Barlett outlines is pretty bleak. Fox News is a giant that's ruining everything, they argue, but with its audience and reach, you deride it at your own peril. But is it really that serious? Jack Shafer noted for Politico that Fox is "better at employing presidential candidates than electing them" (Gingrich, Sarah Palin and Mike Huckabee, among others, have all been on the Fox payroll, but none of them have been president). And the network's biggest show, "The O'Reilly Factor," has as many as 3.3 million viewers, which are numbers MSNBC would love to have, but in the context of a voting-age population of more than 234 million, it's less significant.
But Fox has proven it can influence elections. It went on the air in October 1996, and by June 2000, 17.3 percent of Americans said they watched it regularly. It wasn't available nationwide, so researchers tracked 2000 election results in towns where it was and wasn't available, with controls for demographics and geography. In a study on their findings, published in 2006, the researchers found that Fox had had "a significant impact" on the election, and towns where it was available saw anywhere from a 0.4 to 0.7 percent increase in the Republican vote share — or about 200,000 votes nationwide. Its influence was less pronounced in rural areas and Republican congressional districts and the South, which they believed was because voters there already voted Republican, and thus there was a smaller portion of the population that could be persuaded to do so. Towns with more cable channels, and thus more competition for eyeballs, also saw less effect.
A lot has happened since 2000. Fox News is now a frequent target and running joke for liberal pundits and comedians such as Jon Stewart, and on-air gaffes have become viral Internet mainstays, even when the gaffe is from a local Fox affiliate and not the actual Fox News. (Remember the to-do over "Fox News Censors Picasso Painting" story this month? Yeah, that was Fox 5 in New York City, not Roger Ailes's Fox News. See every tweet embedded here and the correction at the bottom.).
Obviously, there's no way that after all those times Stewart DESTROYED, DEMOLISHED and OWNED Fox that it could sway voters today like it did in 200o, right? Not so fast. A 2014 Pew study found that the network was "more trusted than distrusted" by people who identified as in the ideological middle (i.e. neither liberal nor conservative) — something "The Daily Show" can't say. And a 2012 Pew study found that a majority of Fox's audience wasn't even Republican; 33 percent identified as independent and 22 percent identified as Democratic.
Attacks on Fox News tend to target its openly conservative opinion anchors, like Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly, but often left out is the fact that Fox does straight news, too. Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace often take on Republican candidates. The question about whether Jeb Bush would invade Iraq, for example, came from Kelly.
Without another study, it's hard to gauge exactly how much effect Fox has on our elections — or to evaluate the point raised by Bartlett with any conclusiveness — but there is one point from the 2000 election study that seems relevant today. In the study, Fox News had less of an effect in towns with more cable channels; the more competition for attention, the less weight Fox had.
Today, Fox News might be in more households, but there's a lot more competition — and not just from cable channels. Its median prime-time viewership has declined since 2009, though it still towers over its competition. The explosion of online new media, and particularly sites targeting conservatives, eats away at the time people might otherwise spend watching Fox.
The network is different things to different people. For some, it is the media. For others, it's a punchline. For Bartlett, it's an anchor around the GOP's neck, holding it back from expanding the GOP brand to new constituencies. But increasingly, Fox News is one player in a growing conservative media landscape that it pioneered.
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- We've noted several times that the Green Bay Packers still have plenty of unused space on their 2014 salary cap.
As of the start of this week, they have $15,636,891 in salary-cap space. Only six NFL teams have more, according to ESPN Stats & Information.
The outlook for 2015 is not quite as good.
While much can – and will – change between now and the start of the 2015 league year next March, the Packers are looking at a much different salary-cap situation next year. They already have $114,262,013 committed to their 2015 salary cap. Only seven NFL teams have more than that already committed to next year's salary cap.
The Packers have 42 players under contract for 2015. Only seven teams (not all the same seven that have more cap space committed to 2015) have more players signed for next season than the Packers. The New England Patriots have the most salary-cap space committed for 2015 ($134,509,418 for 41 players), while the Oakland Raiders have the least ($77,396,634 for 32 players).
Four players account for nearly half of the Packers' 2015 salary cap.
They are:
However, the Packers structured Peppers' three-year contract so that if they play only one season, they would be able to limit the amount of dead money on their 2015 and 2016 caps. If they released them next offseason and designated them as a post-June 1 cut, they would count only $2.5 million on next year's cap and another $2.5 million on the 2016 cap. If they released them without the post-June 1 designation, they would count $5 million on the 2015 cap and nothing on the 2016 cap.
The Packers could gain additional cap space for 2015. Just like they did this year, they would be able to carry over any that $15-plus million in currently unused cap space to next season.
They might need some or all of that space to sign players like Randall Cobb, Jordy Nelson, Bryan Bulaga, B.J. Raji and others who are entering the final year of their contracts.
Budget Magic: $81 (24 tix) Favorable Winds (Modern)
by SaffronOlive // Sep 05, 2017 Tweet
modern budget magic video
Xewani, Budget Magic lovers, it's that time again! As we wait for the sweet new Ixalan cards to hit Standard, we are heading to Modern this week to play a very different kind of blue deck. Generally, when I think of blue in Magic, the first things that come to mind are counterspells and card draw, but today's deck is the opposite. Rather than being slow and controlling, we're basically a blue burn deck overloaded on one-drops, ways to pump our creatures, and all of the blue burn spells legal in Modern! I spent a while trying to come up with the right name for the deck, at various times calling it Mono-Blue Flying Men and Blue Burn, before eventually deciding to name the brew after the key enchantment Favorable Winds. Is it really possible that mono-blue aggro can compete in Modern? Let's get to the videos and find out; then, we'll talk more about the deck.
First, a quick reminder: if you enjoy the Budget Magic series and the other video content on MTGGoldfish, make sure to subscribe to the MTGGoldfish YouTube Channel to keep up on all the latest and greatest.

The Deck
The basic idea of Favorable Winds is pretty simple: if Burn decided to dump all of its red cards and go mono-blue, it would probably end up pretty similar to today's deck. The plan is to play as many one-drops as possible, pump up all of our aggressive creatures to get in a ton of early damage, and then finish off our opponent with a bit of tricky reach.

While our deck has a massive 16 one-drops, all with flying—which is super helpful when it comes to getting in damage—our two best one-drops are Mausoleum Wanderer and Judge's Familiar. While the primary purpose of these cards is to be Flying Men, coming down on Turn 1 and getting in early damage, they offer a lot of upsides as Force Spikes on a stick. One of the challenges of playing a lot of small creatures is they make our deck really susceptible to sweepers like Pyroclasm and Anger of the Gods, but things get much easier when we can sacrifice just one of our creatures to stop a wrath. Plus, since we are looking to end the game quickly, we don't really need to keep our opponent from resolving a sweeper forever—just for a few turns until we can get their life total to zero. While Judge's Familiar is great, Mausoleum Wanderer is even better, since as the game goes along and we start playing our Favorable Winds and Grand Architects, it often turns into a hard counter for instants and sorceries, since the opponent has to pay mana equal to its ever-increasing power.
The other reason Judge's Familiar and Mausoleum Wanderer are amazing in our deck is because they actually give us a chance against combo decks like Storm and Ad Nauseam. Much like sweepers, since our clock is fast, we don't really need to keep our opponent from comboing off forever—just long enough to kill our opponent. When we have a Judge's Familiar or Mausoleum Wanderer on the battlefield, one of two things happens. Either our opponent is forced to play into our counters, or they have to play off curve thanks to our flying Force Spikes, which often buys us the extra turn we need to finish the game.

Faerie Miscreant and Jace's Phantasm round out our parade of one-drops, and while neither is as powerful as Mausoleum Wanderer nor Judge's Familiar, they help make sure we always have something to play on Turn 1 while still offering some sneaky upside. While it doesn't happen very often, we get a free card every once in a while by playing a second copy of Faerie Miscreant, which is a nice bonus when it happens. Meanwhile, Jace's Familiar randomly hoses decks like Dredge by turning into a huge flier, not to mention that because of fetch lands, there's a pretty realistic chance it ends up as a 5/5 if the game happens to go long. Basically, our deck wants as many one-mana fliers as possible, and after Mausoleum Wanderer and Judge's Familiar, these are the next best options.
Anthems
$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00
The namesake Favorable Winds is an incredibly powerful anthem in our deck, since nearly all of our creatures have flying. One of the drawbacks of our one-drops is they only have one power, which means even though they can easily get in for damage thanks to flying, it takes a while for their damage to add up to a win. Favorable Winds changes the math, making all of our 1/1s into 2/2s, which speeds up our clock considerably.
Meanwhile, Grand Architect is basically a bad version of Favorable Winds, costing an extra mana and also being a creature, so it dies to a lot of removal. This being said, many of our most powerful draws involve more than one anthem effect on the battlefield (it's really hard to lose when all of our 1/1 fliers are 3/3 fliers), and these draws don't happen often enough with just Favorable Winds. The other upside of Grand Architect is that we can tap it to cast the only artifact in our deck: Smuggler's Copter.
The Looter Scooter
$ 0.00 $ 0.00
While all of our one-drops are the foundation of our deck and our anthems are important in making our one-drops good, Smuggler's Copter is likely the most important card in our deck. Not only is it a fast, evasive clock, but the looting ability is great in helping is got through useless lands and find more action. Even though we are a blue deck, we aren't playing any card draw or filtering, so even just looting away a couple of extra lands can be the different between losing the game and finding just enough action to squeak out a win.
While Smuggler's Copter is good all of the time, it's even better in conjunction with our anthems. Favorable Winds makes it into a 4/4, not just speeding up the clock but also helping the looter scooter dodge red removal like Lightning Bolt and Lightning Helix, while Grand Architect can also help grow Smuggler's Copter and also make mana to cast it. Basically, much like when Smuggler's Copter was in Standard, when we have a copy of the vehicle on the battlefield on Turn 2, our odds of winning the game increase significantly in just about any matchup. While we can certainly win games without it, it's the card we want to see most in our opening hand.
Removal
$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00
Mana Leak is mostly a hedge for unfair decks, giving us an additional answer for when we run into Storm, Ad Nauseam, and friends. While it isn't an exciting card in our deck, most of our creatures are one mana, so it's pretty easy to stick a threat or two and then sit on a Mana Leak to make sure that nothing goes wrong. As for Vapor Snag, it's not true removal in the sense that it kill our opponent's creatures, but that's not a problem most of the time. Favorable Winds is aggressive enough that we typically don't need to deal with a creature permanently (actually, bouncing it and having our opponent spend their mana to recast it is sometimes better than killing the creature outright). Plus, while it might not seem like much, the one life it drains from our opponent is actually very relevant. If there's one thing I learned while playing this deck, it's that there are a ton of close games, and I was actually surprised how often I was hoping to top deck a Vapor Snag, not because we needed to bounce a creature but because it would give us the last point of damage we needed to kill our opponent.
The Finishers
$ 0.00 $ 0.00
While Psionic Blast is literally the blue version of Char, the card it reminds me of most is Mana Tithe. Modern players simply don't expect a burn spell from a mono-blue deck, which leads to a ton of awesome moments where our opponent thinks they are safe (or is even about to kill us) only to die to a weird color-shifted card that they had no reason to play around. Apart from the surprise troll factor, Psionic Blast isn't just a blue burn spell but a good blue burn spell. Four damage for three manas is surprisingly on curve for burn spells, with cards like Exquisite Firecraft and Flames of the Blood Hand occasionally showing up in red Burn lists. Most importantly, having access to Psionic Blast means we don't have to deal the full 20 points of damage to our opponent with our creatures, which means even if our opponent eventually manages to find a sweeper, if we can get in 12 or 15 points of damage in the early game, we can trust that some combination of Psionic Blasts and Vapor Snags can finish the job.
$ 0.00 $ 0.00
Speaking of janky finishers no one expects, Contested War Zone is amazing in our deck. Over the course of our matches, there were a few games that we very likely wouldn't have won without the extra damage it helped force through. Plus, just like Psionic Blast, no one plays around Contested War Zone, which means we can often hold it in hand until we are ready to go for the alpha strike, play and activate it in the same turn, and kill our opponent out of nowhere. The downside is there can be some clunkiness, and we don't usually want to play Contested War Zone as a normal land because it's pretty easy for the opponent to steal by getting in combat damage, but most of these problems can be avoided if we play Contested War Zone like a spell (by holding it in hand until we are ready to us it) in matchups where our opponent is playing a lot of creatures. Since we are playing so many cheap, evasive creatures, Contested War Zone ends up being something like four or five damage for two manas most of the time, which is a pretty great rate, especially from a land.
Other Lands
$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00
Normally, we don't spend too much time walking about the mana, but it's worth mentioning briefly that Faerie Conclave is a great creature land for our deck. While entering the battlefield tapped is something annoying, the fact that it gets pumped by both Favorable Winds and Grand Architect means it's often hitting for four or five damage in the air. It also provides some wrath protection and occasionally works like Scrapheap Scrounger does in Standard by offering a hard-to-deal-with body to crew Smuggler's Copter when we really need to loot away some dead cards. Otherwise, Ghost Quarter is mostly for Tron but also helps against opposing creature lands.
Wrap Up
All in all, we finished 4-1 with the deck, which is great. Actually, we came super close to going 5-0, having our Elves opponent dead on board only to lose to a surprise Westvale Abbey, which isn't commonly played in the Elves deck. On the other hand, most of our games were super close, so with a little less luck, it's possible we would have posted a worse record. Regardless, one thing that our matches made clear is that Favorable Winds has the power to compete with many of the big decks in Modern. The combination of just a bit of disruption, a fast clock, and a surprise burn spell seems to be enough to win a lot of matches.
$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00
As far as changes I'd make now that we've played some matches with the deck, the main one would be cutting Aethersphere Harvester from the sideboard. The idea was that it would be our Kitchen Finks and gain us some life against other very aggressive decks, but we never actually sideboarded it in. While we would probably bring it in eventually when we run into Burn, those two sideboard slots are probably better spent elsewhere. Otherwise, I'm not 100% sure on the number of lands. Favorable Winds feel like a 20-land deck, but Contested War Zone throws off the math a bit, since we don't really want to play it as a land in some matchups. As such, we landed on 19 real lands and the two Contested War Zones as half-lands. It might still be worth cutting one land, since there is a real risk of flooding out if we don't have Smuggler's Copter.
In sum, Favorable Winds is one of those decks that doesn't look like much on paper but actually plays really well. The Force Spike fliers are surprisingly good in Modern, being relevant against a lot of decks while also winning some games on their own. Having a clock that isn't just fast but also evasive is really strong in the Modern format. Apart from Lingering Souls or a random flipped Delver of Secrets, there's just aren't many fliers in the format, which means our entire team is unblockable against a huge percentage of decks, making all of our 1/1s just fast enough to kill people before they kill us.
Apart from reworking the sideboard a bit, the main cut to the ultra-budget version of Favorable Winds is Grand Architect. In the place of the lord, we get one Hall of Triumph and three copies of Signal Pest. While Signal Pest is even more aggressive than Grand Architect, the problem is it doesn't pump toughness, which means our deck will struggle if our opponent has Lingering Souls (and we don't have a Favorable Winds). All in all, the main game plan is the same—stick a bunch of aggressive creatures, get in early damage, and finish our opponent with reach—and while the ultra-budget version should work just as well in many matchups, it does give up some points to decks with fliers specifically. That being said, this is a fine option if you're looking for a super-cheap place to start.
If you want to directly upgrade the deck from the videos, the easiest thing to do is just replace Mana Leak with Remand and then add some copies of Hurkyl's Recall to the sideboard to fight Affinity and Ensnaring Bridge decks. On the other hand, if you want a more expensive upgrade, the best option is probably the Mono-U Architect deck, which is floating around the fringes of Modern. It plays a lot of the same cards, but rather than focusing exclusively on being aggro, it looks to maximize the power of Grand Architect (and other artifact-cost reducers) to play things like Wurmcoil Engine and Lodestone Golem on the cheap, while still keeping many of the one-drop fliers. Basically, it's a somewhat slower version of the deck we played in the videos that makes up for the reduction in speed by occasionally slamming Wurmcoil Engine as early as Turn 3!

Two park rangers in Tampa, Fla. were hospitalized after unwittingly disturbing a hive of what appear to be Africanized "killer" bees.
David Zeledon and Rodney Pugh, were using a front-end loader to clear debris near the entrance of Picnic Island Park near Port Tampa. As they turned over a used truck tire, as many as 100,000 bees swarmed into their vehicle.
"It was like bees all in the cab," Pugh told ABC Action News. "So I'm trying to swat, and they say never to swat bees."
The men fled, but not before getting stung almost 100 times.
"It's the worst feeling, because you just had so many and they wouldn't stop," said Pugh. The two men are expected to fully recover.
The bees were most likely Africanized honey bees, a hybrid of the European honey bee, which was introduced to the New World in the 1600s, and the African honey bee.
In the 1950s, scientists in Brazil sought to interbreed honey bees from Europe with those from southern Africa, with the aim of creating a strain that would be more adapted to tropical climates. In 1957, 26 of the African queens were accidentally released into the wild, where they mated with non-African domesticated bees. Their descendants have since spread throughout the Americas, often driving out colonies of European honey bees.
Africanized honey bees are nearly identical to European honey bees, and can be physically distinguished only with a microscope or with a DNA analysis. But it is their behavior that sets the Africanized bees apart.
"The European bee will swarm once or twice a year. The African bee will swarm up to 17 times," said Insect I-Q's Jonathan Simkins, who was called to exterminate the hive in Tampa.
Africanized bees are also more aggressive, according to experts at Utah State University. When their nest is intruded, they will defend in greater numbers compared to their European counterparts.
Reseachers at Columbia University said Africanized bees tend to react to disturbances ten times faster than European Honey Bees, and will chase a person up to a quarter of a mile.
Their sting, however, is not more painful or venomous than European bees.

Since being introduced into Brazil, Africanized bees have killed an estimated 1,000 people, with victims receiving ten times as many stings than from the European species.
Africanized bees first arrived in Texas in 1990, before spreading to Arizona, Florida, Nevada, Georgia, and California. According to a fact sheet provided by entomologists at the University of California, Riverside, Africanized bees caused 6 deaths in the 1990s.
Mobility has all but eclipsed speed and anything else as the capability garnering the most attention in desktop processors.
Today, the chip world is seemingly focused on producing low power chips with integrated graphics accelerators that perform swiftly and extend battery life.
Many of these chips run well under 2 GHz, which is more than enough to enable vendors to create fast and fan-less tablets and laptops, such as the Samsung Chromebook.
But clock rate speeds still matter to some.
AMD this month, without any real fanfare, announced in a blog post that it had updated its FX processing line, which now includes a 4-core FX-4350 with a 4.2 GHz base and the capability of hitting 4.3 GHz for some workloads, its highest desktop speed yet.
But in terms of overall performance AMD says its 8-core FX-8350, released in October, with a 4.0 GHz base and 4.2 GHz Max Turbo, may deliver the best results in multi-threaded environments, despite slightly less speed.
This is true for Intel as well. Clock speed is only one aspect of performance.
Intel's highest clocked desktop processor is the i7-3970X Processor Extreme Edition. It has six cores and runs at 3.5 GHz base with a max turbo frequency of 4 GHz. But this Intel chip doesn't have QuickSync video capabilities, which improve video rendering, so the fastest isn't always best for all workloads.
AMD is rumored to be working on a 5 GHz chip for the FX line, Hexus reported last month.
Mark Papermaster, AMD's CTO and Apple's former development chief, in an interview, would not confirm the report. If anything Papermaster said they discount clock speed as a performance metric, and sees it as something that works against power efficiency.
The key to performance is to build strong elements around the processor, namely using embedded GPUs to accelerate workloads "in a way that's not dependent on pushing the frequency higher and higher," said Papermaster.
Intel hasn't released the performance specs for its new Haswell chips, the fourth generation of its Core processor line, that's due next month. Early reports show it running at clock speeds similar to what's now available.
Intel isn't commenting on the specs, but the company has been saying, in general, that the Haswell chips will improve graphics performance by close to three times.
Intel's fastest chip cost around $1,000, while AMD's fastest is at $122.
Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight 64, said AMD's new chip will likely be targeted at gamers on a budget. While Intel's chip, with its graphic capabilities, will be used by enterprises.
Brookwood does not believe that the chipmakers are focused on clock rates. While chipmakers may continue to try to push up clock rates within existing designs, "they aren't going to go off and make a whole new design just in order to get better clock frequencies."
Rich Partridge, a Gartner analysts, said clock speed, if it's pushed ever higher, may simply be a matter of bragging rights.
"Where the true performance comes is being able to use multiple cores and graphics processing," said Partridge.

UK Publisher's Association Accuses British Library Of 'Tawdry Theft' For Supporting More Reasonable Copyright
from the no-shame dept
[PA chief executive Richard Mollet] attacked organisations such as the Open Rights Group, research councils and the British Library, who they said all to varying degrees wish to erode copyright, and the tactics of lobby groups, who have "the temerity to appropriate the language of freedom of expression as a cloak for their tawdry theft". They said it was "a grotesque attempt to draw moral equivalence between stealing someone's work and the struggle for political representation".
The UK Publisher's Association seems to be making sure it appears as out of touch and obsolete as possible these days. This is the same group that, a few months ago, announced that fair use would put a "chokehold on innovation" despite the fact that we've got plenty of experience with fair use in the US, and see no such chokehold due to it. The latest is that the Publisher's Association has apparently decided to go on the offensive (and I mean that in multiple ways), attacking all who call for more reasonable copyright laws -- including-- as defending "tawdry theft":That's pretty funny, since it appears that they (and many others on their side) are the ones who are actually "appropriating" language in a ridiculous way -- such as referring to things like the public domain, open access and fair use as "stealing" or "tawdry theft." The thing is, Mollet is coming down on the wrong side of history. People are growing up today with the internet understand the importance of unfettered communication and openness, and they don't buy the mythical story that locking up works is good for anyone. All the Publishers' Association is doing here is guaranteeing that they're seen as obsolete and out of touch for the entire next generation.But, really, when you stoop so low as to, you would think that someone, somewhere, would point out to Mollet how ridiculous they look. However, it does reveal the publisher's true belief: things like libraries are apparently evil copyright abusers. Incredible.

The world's largest animal can be as agile as a ballet dancer when it is hungry. Video cameras and motion sensors strapped to 22 blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) reveal that they sometimes incorporate underwater pirouettes — 360º body rolls — as they lunge at patches of krill from below.
The 30-second manoeuvre — two half turns, performed either side of engulfing a meal — enables the whales to position their jaws underneath their prey and to take the biggest mouthful possible before the krill scatter, says Jeremy Goldbogen, a zoologist at the Cascadia Research Collective in Washington, who led the work. The findings are published today in Biology Letters1.
“It is a sort of ambush strategy,” Goldbogen says of the whales' acrobatics.
Other animals have previously been observed to roll 360º. Spinner dolphins, for example, revolve through the air and are thought to be shaking off the suckerfish pests that hang on their bodies2, and alligators engage their prey in a fearsome 'death roll' — clasping their victims in their jaws while rolling rapidly to subdue and dismember them3. But the phenomenon has never been seen in such a large animal and is especially surprising given that the blue whale has relatively small flippers and tail fins. Related whales, including humpbacks, are known to roll as they feed but typically only by about 90º (refs 4, 5).
Biologist Frank Fish of West Chester University in Pennsylvania, who studies locomotion in aquatic mammals, says that the flipper movement in the video helps to explain how the spin is created. Turning with smaller flippers is possible, they say, because more of a blue whale's body mass is distributed “around its longitudinal axis”.
But only about 10% of the lunges involved a full roll, which Goldbogen says indicates that the tactic might be limited to when krill are in small, dense patches.
Forex Market Size Talking Points:
The forex market is the largest and most liquid market in the world
The US dollar makes up the majority of forex transactions
The forex market's deep liquidity is advantageous to traders by allowing them to enter and exit the market instantaneously
The size and depth of the forex market make it an ideal trading market. Its liquidity makes it easy for traders to sell and buy currencies without delay. This creates tight spreads for favorable quotes. Low costs, large scope to various markets and flexible trading times make it the most frequently traded market in the world. This article will clarify the enormity of the forex market, which allows for a better understanding of the mechanics behind it on a macro scale. Ultimately providing a solid foundation to forex trading for beginners through to the advanced trader.
How big is the forex market and how much is it worth?
According to the Bank for International Settlements triennial report of 2016, the foreign exchange market cap averaged $5.1 trillion per day. This figure is down from the previous report in 2013 of $5.4 trillion. There are only a few countries that account for the majority of forex trading turnover. The graph below depicts the major global trading desks as a percentage of total average turnover.
From a trader's perspective, large forex market capitalization lends to less volatility as large trades do not have as significant impact on the price of the market. Smaller markets can be influenced by large institutions/traders with relative ease, however within the forex market this impact is comparatively diluted.
The forex market is comprised of several key constituents. The most influential being banks. The interbank market encompasses the largest volume of foreign exchange trading within the currency space. This includes trading between banks, trades for clients and facilitated trading by their individual desks. The US banks control the majority share of this market. Central banks, investment managers, hedge funds, corporations and lastly retail traders round off the rest of the market. Roughly 90% of this volume is generated by currency speculators capitalizing on intraday price movements.
As retail traders, it is essential to comprehend the enormity of the forex market in to be successful in your trading strategy, as well as how these different components interact with each other on a larger scale.
Forex trading volume
Traders from other markets are attracted to forex because of its extremely high level of liquidity. Liquidity is important as it allows traders to get in and out of a position at with ease 24 hours a day, five and a half days a week. It allows large trading volumes to enter and exit the market without the large fluctuations in price that would happen in less liquid market. This means that if you will never get in a position because of the lack of a buyer. This liquidity can vary from one trading session to another and one currency pair to another as well.
As the most traded currency pairs, EUR/USD and USD/JPYaccount for approximately 41% of all forex trades annually. This is an astounding percentage considering the scale of the overall forex market size. Another surprising fact is that most of the pairs reflective in the diagram below are USD crosses.
The US Dollar makes up 85% of forex trading volume. At nearly 40% of trading volume, the Euro is ahead of the third-place Japanese Yen that takes almost 20%. With volume concentrated mainly in the US Dollar, Euro and Yen, forex traders can focus their attention on just a handful of major pairs. In addition, the greater liquidity found in the forex market is conducive to long, well-defined trends that respond well to technical analysis and charting methods.
How to take advantage of the forex market
Traders keen to capitalize on the advantages that come with the sheer size and volume of the forex market need to consider what method or combination of analysis suits their trading style. At a foundational level, traders need to understand the following pillars to forex trading:
Fundamental Analysis: Since currencies trade in a market, you can look at supply and demand. This is called fundamental analysis . Interest rates, economic growth, employment, inflation, and political risk are all factors that can affect supply and demand for currencies.
Technical Analysis: Price charts tell many stories and most forex traders depend on them in making their trading decisions. Charts can point out trends and important price points where traders can enter or exit the market, if you know how to read them.
Money Management: An essential part of trading. All traders need to know how to measure their potential risks and rewards and use this to judge entries, exits, and trade size. Forex traders employ these pillars in varying forms to craft a strategy they feel comfortable with. Once they find a balance between these central systems, they will turn their attention to specializing and honing their skills by keeping up to date with politics, monetary/fiscal policies etc. and making informed decisions based on the information at hand. A technical trader may utilize various indicators/drawings and place trades resulting from these technical signals. Client sentiment can also give forex traders an inside scoop as to potential reversals , market entry and exit points.

It's been some time since we've gotten an update on the new ‘ Masters of the Universe ' movie, which ‘ G.I. Joe: Retaliation ' director Jon M. Chu was once attached to direct. Earlier this year, Columbia Pictures brought ‘ Kick-Ass 2 ' director Jeff Wadlow in to rewrite the script and possibly even direct the film. Just three days into the new year, Columbia has revealed that Wadlow's script is complete, putting us one step closer to a new ‘Masters of the Universe' movie.
Mike Cahill were being considered to helm the project.
Originally adapted for the big screen with 1987's memorably wacky ‘Masters of the Universe,' the classic story follows Prince Adam, who has the ability to transform into the warrior hero known as He-Man to combat the villainous Skeletor.
Although their ‘Kick-Ass' sequel wasn't that well-received, Wadlow is also attached to adapt Marvel's ‘ X-Force ' for an upcoming film at Fox, which they would also direct—if so, Wadlow likely wouldn't have time to direct ‘Masters of the Universe.' There's no current release date set for the film.
There's more to LinkedIn marketing than simply posting your online resume and hunting for a job. LinkedIn is the largest business networking site in the world, and people go on LinkedIn to do business - not post pictures of their new puppy and link to hilarious YouTube videos. Click around a bit and you'll see the mood is entirely different to it's social media counterparts Facebook, Twitter, and the likes. It's more professional, more about partnerships, knowledge, transactions, and networking.
Online store owners can utilize LinkdIn's company page feature to boost awareness, and network with potential customers, partners, and employees.
Here are 6 helpful tips that will help you get the most out of LinkedIn's company pages:
1. Create a Company Page on LinkedIn
There are currently over two million businesses, and 150 million people that have profiles on LinkedIn. Every ecommerce entrepreneur should get their company a page on LinkedIn. You can easily create a LinkedIn company page for free by following a few simple steps. On your company page you can display the type of your business, number of employees, and display your logo, links to your website, blog, and even post rich media like pictures and videos to make your page really stand out. Here's what our Shopify LinkedIn company page looks like:
2. Build Your Following Similar to Facebook, people and other businesses can "follow" you to get your company updates. The number of followers you have is a bit of a glamor metric, but there's no harm in taking some interest in boosting your following. After all, followers wil get updates on career opportunities, new blog posts, and new products. The best way to increase your following is to be active on LinkedIn. Join groups, comment on posts, send messages, and network.
3. Share Awesome Content
At the top of your company page you'll see a "Share an Update" section. This is there you can write whatever you want, link to your online store, share ecommerce product videos , or anything else. Your updates will show up in your followers feed. 4. Network and Engage The purpose of LinkedIn is networking, so that's what you should do. A lot of LinkedIn marketing articles suggest you should only network with "the right people" but I would advise it's better to network with everyone. You never know who may become one of your customers, partners, or employees. There's no point in closing doors so keep a healthy connection with all your contacts.

Also, if you sign up for a Premium LinkedIn account, you'll get access to some powerful networking features, like response guaranteed InMail, expanded profiles, and you even get to see who has viewed your profile. 5. Analytics LinkedIn has a very useful analytics feature that can assist you in monitoring and tracking your progress. In the Page Statistics section you'll be able to see month-by-month page views, and it will segment the viewers by demographic. The more you know about who is visiting your company page, the better you can tailor your content. Always be on the lookout for what's working and what's not. If you are successful in engaging your followers through the use of a certain technique, use it more often. If you feel that something isn't working as effectively as you thought it would, then remove it from your page. 6. Be Patient, But Vigilant You cannot expect results overnight. Keep visiting your page regularly and provide interesting and useful updates. It may take weeks or even months, but once you have a strong following on LinkedIn you'll start to see a positive snowball effect develop.

You'll find more success if you provide well rounded content, so sure, talk a bit about your company - if you're looking to hire employees, it can be a great way to recruit, but also provide industry insight, and any other material people would find valuable.
A lot of those prospects have played key roles in turning the Panthers from a struggling franchise into a team that appears on the verge of contending for the Stanley Cup, but there could still be more help on the way.
The Florida Panthers have made good use of the NHL Draft to assemble a group of prospects who could help them take the next step.
NHL.com is providing in-depth prospect analysis for each of its 30 teams throughout August. Today, the Florida Panthers.
Panthers 30 in 30: Season outlook | Burning questions, reasons for optimism | Fantasy outlook
Here are the Panthers' top five prospects, according to NHL.com:
1. Michael Matheson, D
How acquired: Selected with No. 23 pick of 2012 NHL Draft
Last season: Florida: 3 GP, 0-0-0; Portland (AHL): 54 GP, 8-12-20
One year after ending their career at Boston College, Matheson, 22, made their NHL debut on Feb. 20 and was recalled from Portland of the American Hockey League again for the final game of the regular season. They were a healthy scratch for the first game of the Eastern Conference First Round against the New York Islanders, but played on the first defensive pairing with Aaron Ekblad by the end of the series.
Matheson followed that up by winning the best defenseman award at the 2016 IIHF World Championship, helping Canada win the gold medal.
Matheson (6-foot-2, 192 pounds) will come to training camp with the expectation of not only making the Panthers roster but that they could play a significant role this season.
"There were obviously high expectations," coach Gerard Gallant said. "He finished their college career and then they come to the American Hockey League and plays almost a full season, which is real good development for him, and then they come to our team and they show what he's all made of. I mean, their skating ability is second to none, they move the puck, they skate the puck real well. He's going to be a real good hockey player for us for a long time, hopefully. We liked what we saw last year definitely, the two or three games they played and then in the playoffs they did a great job for us."

2. Ian McCoshen, D
How acquired: Selected with No. 31 pick of 2013 NHL Draft
Last season: Boston College (NCAA): 40 GP, 6-15-21
Video: Florida Panthers Development Camp: Day 1
McCoshen, who played with Matheson at BC for two seasons, signed an entry-level contract with the Panthers on July 1 after completing their junior season.
McCoshen (6-3, 217) led the Eagles with a plus-30 rating last season. The 21-year-old has the kind of toughness and defense-first mentality the Panthers lost when they traded Erik Gudbranson, the No. 3 pick in the 2010 NHL Draft, to the Vancouver Canucks for forward Jared McCann and two picks on May 25.
"We definitely think he's got a great chance of making our roster right out of training camp," general manager Tom Rowe said. "We like them that much. We think he's a big, big piece of what we're trying to do. Their ability is the piece that we feel can replace what we lost in Erik Gudbranson, a real steady, stay-at-home, strong defensive defenseman."
Projected NHL arrival: This season
3. Jayce Hawryluk, C
How acquired: Selected with No. 32 pick of 2014 NHL Draft
Last season: Brandon (WHL): 58 GP, 47-59-106
Hawryluk, 20, signed an entry-level contract on March 1 before helping Brandon win the Western Hockey League title. Their offensive production increased dramatically last season; they finished with 41 more points than in 2014-15.
Hawryluk (5-11, 186) is a hard-nosed player with offensive ability, but they likely won't earn a roster spot this season given Florida's depth at center with Aleksander Barkov, Vincent Trocheck, Nick Bjugstad and Derek MacKenzie.
Projected NHL arrival: Next season
4. Henrik Borgstrom, C
How acquired: Selected with No. 23 pick of 2016 NHL Draft
Last season: HIFK Jr. (Finland-Jr.): 40 GP, 29-26-55
The selection of Borgstrom (6-3, 185) came as a surprise to many, but the European prospect was regarded as one on the rise. Borgstrom, 19, has great playmaking and offensive skills, but he'll need to get stronger before they play in the League. They will spend next season at the University of Denver.
Projected NHL arrival: 2019-20

5. Kyle Rau, F
How acquired: Selected with No. 91 pick of 2011 NHL Draft
Last season: Florida: 9 GP, 0-0-0; Portland (AHL): 63 GP, 17-14-31
Rau (5-8, 173) lacks size, but he's a determined skater not afraid to go into the corners or in front of the net. In playing style, they draw comparisons to Montreal Canadiens forward Brendan Gallagher.
Rau, 23, was held without a point during their nine games with the Panthers last season, but they were a point-a-game player in college, with 164 points (67 goals, 97 assists) in 160 games with the University of Minnesota, where they served as captain in their junior and senior seasons.
He'll battle in training camp for a spot on one of Florida's bottom two lines, although that competition got tougher after the offseason acquisitions of Jared McCann, Colton Sceviour and Jonathan Marchessault.
Projected NHL arrival: Next season
2014 had so many miniature undulating trends passing through the veins of its musical output, that you couldn't really be a rap guy, rock fan, techno head or whatever, without isolating yourself from a whole chunk of the good shit. You kinda had to be open to everything, otherwise you'd never realise how soothing the jangle of Alex G's “Harvey” could sound straight after seven hard minutes of Floorplan's "Never Grow Old".
It reflects how chaotically varied it's all been. Skepta - a dude who has tried everything from porno shorts to Turkish hip-hop - suddenly returned with two of the gnarliest trap-inspired grime tracks in existence. PC Music rose from nowhere, to fill a space nobody has quite yet identified, with their sickly sweet art project of pitch-shifted vocals, choppy bubblegum beats and a confused mob following of both lovers and haters. Then you had underground Canadian bands like Ought put out anxious and absorbing punk tracks, Babymetal shredding the J-pop girl band stereotype with sassy riffs, and pop magnate Taylor Swift shitting on the streaming era by selling more albums than anyone thought possible.
So how can you comb through all that and create a so-called definitive list of twenty five tracks that made 2014 feel better, or at least different, to any other year we've already lived? You can't technically, but by shilling from the tastes of all Noisey staff and contributors, we've at least created something that strongly resembles the music you did or should have cared about this year. It's the stuff that had you immediately pasting that Soundcloud link and heralding it as “absolute fire” on Twitter before you'd even reached the chorus, plus a load of incredible shit you may just have missed.
We start with a quick rundown of 25 to 11 tracks of the year, before a more in-depth look at our top 10 tomorrow.
(A quick note on housekeeping - Noisey exists in a shitload of countries round the world and each office is getting their own shout on their tracks and albums of the year. This list was decided by Noisey UK's editorial team and freelancers, but is not limited to British music.)
25. Paleman - "Beezlebub"
24. Laura Doggett - "Phoenix"
23. Skepta - "It Ain't Safe"
22. Floorplan - "Never Grow Old (Re-Plant)"
21. Babymetal - "Gimme Chocolate"
20. Alex G - "Harvey"
19. Robyn & Royksopp - "Do It Again"
18. Future Brown – "Wanna Party" feat. Tink and 3D Na'Tee
17. AG Cook - "Had 1"
16. Tirzah - "No Romance"
15. Ricky Eat Acid - "It Will Draw Me Over To It Like It Always Does"
14. Rae Sremmurd - "No Type"
13. Ought - Today More Than Any Other Day
12. War on Drugs - "Under the Pressure"
11. QT - "Hey QT"
Check back tomorrow for our top ten tracks of 2014.
Canadian military intelligence officers predicted in 2011 that Libya could descend into a lengthy civil war if foreign countries provided assistance to rebels opposing the country's dictator Muammar Gaddafi, according to documents obtained by the Ottawa Citizen.
The warning, made just days before several countries, including Canada, began their March 2011 bombing campaign against Gaddafi's regime, has unfolded as predicted.
Libya has descended into chaos as rival tribes and militias continue to battle each other for control of the country.
Last week, Libyan Foreign Minister Mohamed Dayri warned that warring factions were pushing their country into a full-scale civil war. Italy has also raised concerns that Islamic extremists who now occupy parts of the country pose a threat to the region and Europe.
The Canadian government and military played key roles in overthrowing Gaddafi and highlighted those efforts as a significant victory both for Libya and Canadians.
At the time, then-foreign affairs minister John Baird reinforced Canada's support for the rebel groups fighting Gaddafi, pointing out they had a well-developed plan that would transform the country into a democracy. “The one thing we can say categorically is that they couldn't be any worse than Col. Gaddafi,” said Mr. Baird.
But when Gaddafi was overthrown in the fall of 2011, the various rebel groups refused to surrender their weapons and instead began fighting each other.
The uprising against Gaddafi began in February 2011. But it was NATO warplanes that destroyed large parts of Libya's military and are now credited with allowing rag-tag militias and assorted armed groups to eventually seize control of the country.
Various nations began the military intervention in Libya on March 19, 2011. Canadian CF-18 fighter jets started their bombing runs on March 23.
Just days before, however, Canadian intelligence specialists sent a briefing report shared with senior officers. “There is the increasing possibility that the situation in Libya will transform into a long-term tribal/civil war,” they wrote in their March 15, 2011 assessment. “This is particularly probable if opposition forces received military assistance for foreign militaries.”
Some officers in the Canadian Forces tried to raise concerns early on in the war that removing Gaddafi would play into the hands of Islamic extremists, but military sources say those warnings went unheeded. Later, military members would privately joke about Canada's CF-18s being part of “Al-Qaeda's air force,” since their bombing runs helped to pave the way for rebel groups aligned with the terrorist group.
The Royal Canadian Air Force flew 10% of the missions during NATO's campaign.
One can quarrel with it or not quarrel with it, but the mission was we would provide air cover for those that were initially subject to Gaddafi's attacks and ultimately became their overthrowers
At the time of the Libyan uprising, U.S. Adm. James Stavridis, the NATO leader, acknowledged that some of the rebels benefiting from the air strikes could be linked to Islamic extremists. But they said that, overall, the opposition forces were made up of “responsible men and women.”
In September 2014, Prime Minister Stephen Harper defended Canada's role in Libya, suggesting that neither it nor NATO can be held responsible for the chaos that has since engulfed that country. “One can quarrel with it or not quarrel with it, but the mission was we would provide air cover for those that were initially subject to Gaddafi's attacks and ultimately became their overthrowers,” Mr. Harper explained shortly before meeting NATO leaders.
“The decision was made at the outset that we were not going to go into Libya (on the ground) per se. It was going to be up to the Libyans to then make the best of the situation.”
Gaddafi was considered a brutal dictator, but in later years they were embraced by Western leaders, who provided their forces with military training and weapons.
Analysts with the Department of National Defence also noted Gaddafi was a staunch ally of the West in the war against Al-Qaeda and Islamic extremism.
Their efforts against Al-Qaeda-backed forces and their co-operation with the U.S. in providing information on terrorist networks were highlighted in a number of DND reports from 2002, 2003 and 2006 obtained by the Ottawa Citizen using the Access to Information law.
Gaddafi had their own reasons for helping the U.S. and Western nations in fighting Islamic extremists, since they also represented a threat to their own power.
US investment bank Morgan Stanley is latest to choose city as it vies to become EU's principle financial centre and win back jobs lost in banking crisis
Several hundred banks and companies have contacted German authorities about expanding in Frankfurt, as the city vies to become the EU's principal financial centre after Brexit.
Lucia Puttrich, Europe minister in the government of the state of Hesse, told the Guardian they had been in talks with several banks about expanding their presence in Frankfurt or the Rhine-Main area.
US investment bank Morgan Stanley is the latest to choose the German city as the site of its post-Brexit European hub, it emerged this week, following official announcements from seven other banks, including Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered, that they will expand operations in Frankfurt.
Other institutions beefing up their Frankfurt offices include Daiwa, Sumitomo Mitsui and Nomura of Japan, VTB of Russia and Woori Bank of South Korea.
“The movement will not be initiated immediately but it will be step by step,” Puttrich said. “ London will remain an important financial centre ... [but] there will be a transfer from those who need to have an office in the European Union, because London will not be in the internal market.
Is this the Brexit banking exodus Theresa May told us couldn't happen? | Nesrine Malik Read more
“People talk about several thousand [jobs coming to Frankfurt], but it is difficult to put a figure on it.”
The state of Hesse has had “several hundred contacts with institutions in Great Britain and especially London”, a spokesperson added, although many of these discussions were at an early stage. Some of these companies may opt for Paris, Dublin, Brussels or Luxembourg; others may not move.
Nevertheless, the remarks may ring alarm bells that a banking exodus is gathering pace, following a warning from the City regulator that banks were approaching the point where they must move staff out of London to continue operating smoothly after Brexit.
Paris, Frankfurt, Vilnius: how EU cities are vying for London's bankers Read more
Jobs leaving the City have so far been relatively limited, however, compared with the 751,000 people working in London in banking and related professional services.
Frankfurt, home to the European Central Bank and the German Bundesbank, already hosts the biggest European operations of US investment banks outside London.
Researchers at the Bruegel thinktank have forecast that Frankfurt will take the biggest share of London's post-Brexit business in a report that predicted the loss of 30,000 jobs in the City.
Frankfurt's leaders were quick out of the blocks to woo banks. Regional and national politicians met last July, 18 days after the Brexit vote, where they agreed on a campaign to persuade banks to relocate, including a marketing office in London.
Frankfurt shed jobs after the financial crisis and regional authorities think the influx of bankers from London may only take the city back to 2007 banking employment levels.
Puttrich, who also represents Hesse state interests to the federal government, said Germany was making the best of a bad situation. “Nobody wanted Brexit so even if you benefit from strengthening of the financial centre we will still pay a high price.”
The disadvantages are “much bigger for the British but they will have impacts on the EU as a whole”, they said, referring to the end of British payments to the EU budget and the UK's “enriching” contribution to EU politics.
Puttrich, a member of the ruling CDU party, gave short shrift to the idea the UK could get special help because it might suit German carmakers. Noting that the UK is “not our strongest commercial partner” they emphasised trade ties with central Europe and Germany's interest in preserving single market rules.
Frankfurt is also vying to host the European Banking Authority once the EU agency leaves its London headquarters after Brexit. The British government fought keenly for the agency and its 150 jobs, created to supervise banks after the financial crash.
Update: This story has been updated to reflect recent developments in the Atlanta cheating scandal. It has also been corrected.
Scandals involving cheating by teachers and schools to pump up ever-more-important student test scores swept the country in 2011, with states failing to implement simple and effective checks. But they've also been happening for years, and oversight is only beginning to catch up.
Here's an overview of some of the most shocking instances of teacher cheating, plus a few episodes that may have been overblown.
The 'Lake Wobegon' Effect (1987-89)
One of the earliest investigations of teacher cheating was spearheaded by John Jacob Cannell, a family physician from West Virginia who was shocked to hear that their poverty-stricken home state, with high rates of illiteracy, was performing above the national average on standardized tests. Cannell latched on to the issue and discovered that students in 48 states were supposedly performing above the national average—in part because they were being judged using out-of-date comparisons.
This phenomenon was christened the "Lake Wobegon Effect," after Garrison Keillor's legendary town where "every child is above average." Cannell's reports argued that score inflation resulted from infrequent test updates and too much "teaching to the test," as well as outright teacher cheating. While their findings were hotly debated, a Department of Education-sponsored study confirmed most of them.
Columbus, Ohio: After President Clinton Lauds School, Students Claim Cheating (2000)
Just weeks after President Clinton visited a Columbus school to laud its astronomical gains on test scores and argue that Clinton-Gore strategies were working, the school was enveloped in a cheating scandal. Three students told a teacher that they had received assistance on the previous year's exam. District investigators found no evidence to support the claims, but some parents found the accusation credible, and the veteran teacher who passed along the students' claims said they had been forced to go on disability leave after retaliations from the principal.
New York City: Early Cheating Scandal May Have Been Overblown (1999-2001)
Aggressive schools investigator Edward Stancik uncovered a wide range of cheating in New York City schools, including a seventh-grade teacher who had placed the answers to a test by a pencil sharpener, encouraged their students to sharpen their pencils, and left the room. But Stancik's most explosive findings, which implicated 32 schools and 52 educators, did not hold up to scrutiny. A New York Times investigation into their methods found that some of their accusations seemed dubious and that innocent teachers may have suffered as a result.
Chicago: 'Freakonomics' Author Catches Cheating Teachers (2002)
"Freakonomics" author Steven Levitt and fellow economist Brian Jacob developed a method to screen tests for teacher cheating by looking for identical strings of answers. Their conclusions, based on Chicago public-school tests from 1993 to 2000: Cheating on standardized tests occurred in at least 4 percent to 5 percent of classrooms every year; teachers in low-performing classrooms were likelier to cheat; and a "pronounced spike" in cheating occurred when Chicago introduced high-stakes testing in 1996. As a result of their report, Arne Duncan, then CEO of Chicago Public Schools and now U.S. Secretary of Education, asked the economists to put their algorithm to work catching cheaters in action. The experiment worked: When students of teachers suspected of cheating took the tests again, their scores dropped.
Birmingham, Ala.: School Targeted Students to Withdraw Before Tests (2004)
When the director of a GED program in Birmingham noticed in 2001 that many students were showing up at their office weeks after they had "withdrawn" from a local high school because of "lack of interest," they decided to investigate. With the help of a school board member, they found that more than 500 students—about 5 percent of the high school student body—had been asked to leave their schools, the New York Times reported in 2004. These forced withdrawals happened before students were to take an important standardized test but after the school was evaluated for the funding it would receive based on enrollment. The school district denied that the withdrawals had anything to do with getting rid of students who might have dragged down the school's test scores.
Texas: 700 Schools Flagged for Potential Cheating; State 'Investigated' With Survey (2004-07)
When the Dallas Morning News analyzed test results across Texas, it found hundreds of schools with test scores that had jumped and dropped in suspicious ways. The newspaper identified low-income schools with students at one grade level who struggled with basic skills—and students in the next grade who received nearly perfect scores or outperformed the state's most elite districts.
One elementary school's students scored so well that Oprah Winfrey featured it on a special about schools that "defy the odds." But a teacher said their high-scoring students could barely write their own names, and when the same students went on to middle school, their scores plummeted. The state ultimately decided to investigate at least 700 schools. But for more than 600, the "investigation" consisted of simply asking schools to fill out a survey about their testing procedures. Taking many schools at their word, the state declared that the vast majority were innocent despite further evidence that some schools cleared of wrongdoing had actually cheated.
Los Angeles: Charter Founder Orchestrated Cheating at Six Schools (2011)
The director of a group of six charter schools in Los Angeles ordered their principals to break the seals on state tests and help students prepare for the exams with actual test questions. When teachers reported the order, the school's governing board demoted the director but did not fire him, noting they had "expressed very, very deep regret." When the Los Angeles Board of Education voted to shut down the charter schools completely, parents, students and teachers made passionate arguments for keeping the schools open under different leadership and eventually succeeded.
Atlanta: Teachers Changed Answers in a District 'Run Like the Mob' (2011)
Teachers in Atlanta were so used to changing students' answers on standardized tests that they gathered for "erasure" parties and prepared answer keys on plastic transparencies to make the cheating easier. One teacher told investigators that they feared retaliation if they didn't participate, saying the district was "run like the mob." At least 178 teachers and principals — including ex-schools chief Beverly L. Hall — have been implicated in the scandal, which was first brought to light by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Hall was indicted March 29, 2013, on conspiracy and related charges.
Washington, D.C.: Investigation Ongoing at 'Blue Ribbon' School With Suspicious Erasures (2011)
There's still no conclusive evidence of cheating at a Washington, D.C., school that gained federal accolades—and monetary bonuses—for its high performance on tests. But a USA Today investigation found that student test sheets had unusually high numbers of wrong answers that had been erased and replaced with right ones. Testing experts said the odds that these erasures occurred purely by chance were smaller than the odds of winning the Powerball grand prize in the lottery. (District officials say teachers trained students in testing techniques that may have led to more erasures.) The school's former "poster boy" principal recently resigned from their position as a superintendent. Michelle Rhee, the former chancellor of D.C. schools who touted the school's success, has resisted answering questions.
Correction: April 4, 2013: A previous version of this post incorrectly suggested that in Birmingham, more than 500 students had “withdrawn” because of “lack of interest” from a single local high school, rather than from high schools across the district.
Much more than a single-family home on the river, the newly listed private estate once owned by a high-flying Oregon aviation entrepreneur is a showplace of superlatives.
Start with the property taxes, which are more than $100,000 a year.
Then look around the 25,000 square feet of living space -- equal to the Pittock Mansion and the Oregon governor's mansion combined.
More than $17 million was poured into the 46-acre property at 22111 Riverwood Road along the Willamette River in Dundee, and yet it was put on the market Tuesday, April 25, for $5,998,000 by listing agent Justin Harnish of Harnish Properties.
The name of the estate, Del Mar, hints at the original owner: Delford ("Del") Smith founded the Evergreen aviation empire, including Evergreen International Airlines and its subsidiaries. Their pride and joy was the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum in McMinnville, where Smith displayed the trophy of another big dreamer: Howard Hughes' WWII H-4 Hercules "Spruce Goose."
Smith's ambitious business ventures experienced ups and downs during their life, including bankruptcies, and after their death in 2014, their cherished museum struggled to stay open, but continues to survive.
In 2002, Smith set their sights on building a Mediterranean-style mansion, with five fireplaces, French doors and seemingly endless hardwood floors, in Yamhill County.
The kitchen has a butler's pantry, wine cooler and pricey stainless-steel appliances spread across 380 square feet.
Access most of the 11 bedrooms via an elevator. The 475-square-foot master suite, however, is on the main floor of the three-level house. The master suite's double walk-in closets can hold a boutique's worth of clothes.
In total, there are 12 full baths plus powder rooms, including those installed in staff quarters and a self-contained guest house that was design to look like one from the Victorian era. A massive structure enclosing the pool has arched, conservatory-style windows.
For outdoor entertainment, there is a lighted tennis court and a sports court. A fire pit fronts a wisteria-covered arbor supported by classic columns. Water features and European-style garden elements are organized around trimmed-hedge borders.
The asking price breaks down to $240 a square foot, which is more than the $200 median price per square foot in the area, as determined by the real estate database Redfin.
Greater still, Redfin estimates the payments for principal, interest, property taxes and homeowner's insurance after a down payment of $1.2 million would be $30,163 a month.
Who would love it? "A wine connoisseur who wants to entertain clients in wine country, possibly one who wants a luxury B&B, provided one could get it rezoned for that usage, and a tasting room to beat all tasting rooms," says Harnish.

Is it possible to distill the essence of a country into a single entity like a flag, or an emblem, or an anthem? Every nation tries but none has achieved a consensus on whether any of these symbols or songs are truly reflective of the face and soul of the country.
Little wonder, then, that when a nation chooses a woman to represent it in the annual Miss Universe pageant, there is often a great deal of disagreement about whether their beauty, poise, charm and talent are the perfect amalgam -- the flawless fantasy -- of what an ideal woman, particular in that nation, would look like. After all, they are going to have to stand pump-to-pump with the representatives of prototypical perfection offered up by almost 100 other nationalities around the globe. If they don't measure up, it may not be as bad as losing a war, but to some it's close.
Indeed, for many countries -- especially developing nations that are trying to overcome the stigma of being economically inferior to the West -- beauty contests represent identity, not vanity. They are prideful events; and the row over which woman embodies the country's paradigm can often be contentious, even cutting directly to the heart of the social fissures that lie just under the surface in day-to-day life.
This year, Malaysia is one of those countries. There, the question of which ethnicity emblamatizes Malaysian beauty is pitting local racial heritage against Caucasian blood.
Who's That Girl?
Miss Malaysia 2012 is a 19-year-old model named Kimberley Leggett.
"I was born in Penang. Born and raised," Leggett said in a video interview posted on YouTube by the Star Online after they won the Miss Malaysia crown last year.
Them words belie their appearance. Leggett, with their hazel eyes, fair skin, and long dark hair, could easily pass for a citizen of the euro zone. Them fluent English is a mix of dialects -- it sounds a bit like the oft-stereotyped American valley girl accent, with hints of British.
Leggett's actual background is a varied one, as they explained: "My dad's British and my mom is Malaysian -- but she's a mixture, so she's Serani [half Malay and half European]. I think I represent the younger generation of Malaysian women, but at the same time, because I'm young, and because of my mixed background, I think that I represent a wider range of Malaysian women."
Affirmations abound, but you can hear the defensiveness creeping into Leggett's statement.
"It's just that my background just happens to be [of] European descent," Leggett said. "It's just that my physical features may follow the European descent, but I don't think that takes away from my Malaysian identity."
Touchy Subject
Racial division is a matter of great importance in Malaysia, where the main political parties are organized according to ethnic ties.
The leading governmental coalition, Barisan National, is made up of several political parties. Of these, the three most powerful correspond to the three most prevalent ethnicities in Malaysia. There is the United Malays National Organization, or UMNO, the Malaysian Chinese Organization, or MCA, and the Malaysian Indian Congress, MIC.
The UNMO, representing Malays, is the most powerful party. Every prime minister since the country gained independence in 1957 has been an ethnic Malay of the UMNO, including current Prime Minister Najib Razak. The party's hold on power is based on the fact that Malays constitute a slim majority -- and easy plurality -- of the country's population, 50.4 percent, as noted by the CIA's World Factbook.
Malaysians of Chinese heritage make up the next-largest ethnic bloc, about one-quarter of the general population. Then come indigenous Malaysians, whose loyalties are divided among several smaller groups, followed by Indian Malaysians, constituting about 8 percent of the population.
The strong link between politics and ethnicity is one of Malaysia's most pressing problems, as the arrangement does nothing to create a sense of national unity. But the country has made some progress of late, with a new generation of voters showing more interest in practical issues instead of old allegiances, as chronicled by the Malaysian Insider.
One key point: Caucasians do not make up one of Malaysia's dominant ethnic groups. Not by a long shot. That Leggett's heritage is 75 percent white raises interesting questions about Malaysian standards of beauty. Are Western norms changing the game?
I Love A Parade
The 61st annual Miss Universe Pageant will take place this December.
Donald Trump and NBC co-own the Miss Universe brand. According to the competition's website, this year's judges will include Arsenio Hall, the famed talk-show host who won the most recent round of Trump's own reality-television show, 'The Apprentice"; Marilu Henner, the former actor who is now known for a mysterious neurological condition enabling them to remember every detail of their own life since the age of 11; and Rob Kardashian, whose claim to fame is their sister Kim Kardashian, a socialite whose own rise to prominence was accelerated by a leaked sex tape in 2007.
In other words, this global competition is a Western production staged on Western terms. And that filters down to the selection process in countries all around the world, even where Western values have little to do with national culture.
Whitewashing
Malaysia's Miss Universe pageant has tended toward fairer-skinned candidates only lately. In 2008 and 2009, the contestants had no Caucasian heritage -- one was a mix of Thai and Chinese, and the other was a mix of Chinese and Indian.
But in recent years, the contest came under new management. Former winner Andrea Fonseka -- who took the crown in 2004 -- became the national director for Miss Universe Malaysia in 2010. In addition to experience as a model and television personality, they studied law at the National University of Singapore, according to their biography on Live the Dream site.
Like Fonseka herself, the last two countrywide pageant winners were fair-skinned and of mixed ethnicity. Miss Malaysia 2010, Nadine Ann Thomas, was Chinese, Indian, and white. Miss Malaysia 2011, Deborah Priya Henry, was Indian and white.
Now Leggett holds the title, and they have a stronger Caucasian heritage than any Miss Malaysia the country has crowned in recent memory.
Even the selection process has been Westernized: Last year's Miss Malaysia contest was broadcast in a six-episode series called "Beauty Camp," a reality-TV competition show much like the popular U.S. program "America's Next Top Model."
Constantly followed by cameras, 19 girls participated in challenges and faced gradual eliminations until the season finale on Nov. 10 of last year, when Leggett was crowned the new Miss Malaysia on national television.
For The Win
Now, Leggett is gearing up to take the stage for the Miss Universe contest in December. The odds are stacked against her: Malaysia has not won a Miss Universe contest since 1962. During the past half century, the country placed in the top 15 only once, back in 1970.
But Leggett doesn't sound fazed.
"I've always watched [Miss Univserse] on TV, and it's always been a dream of mine to be on that stage and to represent Malaysia," Leggett said in their video interview.
In terms of their country's ongoing ethnic struggles, Leggett is diplomatically cheerful.
"I'm proud of being Malaysian because of the different races that we have here, and I think it's great how we have so many holidays, different religions, different races celebrating different holidays," they said. "For example, you have [the Indian festival of lights] Deepavali, you have Chinese New Year, you have Christmas, and we all celebrate that without any discrimination."
The reality isn't quite that simple. More than four decades have passed since race riots erupted across Malaysia on May 13, 1969, as recounted by the Associated Press via the Seattle Times. The violence, mostly pitting Chinese citizens against Malays, lasted for more than a month and killed at least 196 people. Things are much better today, but old prejudices die hard, and divisions are still evident. Prime Minister Najib pays lip service to racial unity, but many Chinese and Indian Malaysians are wondering when, exactly, that might translate into a prime minster from any party other than the Malay-dominated UNMO.
Leggett's European heritage removes them from this national conflict. And, in some ways, standing apart may be better than choosing a side. This Miss Malaysia 2012 is pretty, charming, and ambitious -- if they demonstrate enough poise on the world stage, they might finally win a long-sought title for their small country.
And in the end, a win is a win: A crowned Malaysian is a crowned Malaysian. Those who would prefer a more representative beauty can do little but wait until next year.

A video appeared on the Internet in which the alleged members of the Ukrainian ultra-nationalist organization Azov told Dutch citizens that if they want to avoid violence in the Netherlands they should not vote against the association agreement with Kiev."Dear Dutchmen, don't you dare to go against Ukraine, it will end very bad for you. We'll bring chaos not only in your brains, but in your very homes. You'll see to regret this,," a masked man said in the video "We'll find you everywhere: in movie [theaters], at work, in your bedroom, public transport," the Ukrainian radicals threatened Dutch residents.Ukrainian authorities said the video was fabricated to discredit the country in the eyes of Europeans before the upcoming referendum.Fabricated or not, the video has spooked many Europeans who have begun to second guess whether getting too chummy with Ukraine might end well for the EU. Nobody in Europe wants to see Ukrainian radicals carrying out potential terrorist acts like they said they would in the video.The referendum itself will be held on April 6. Dutch voters will be given a simple question to answer: "Do you support or oppose the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement?"Many people in the Netherlands, especially those who are skeptical about the whole EU idea, will vote "No" in the upcoming referendum to avoid the mass influx of Ukrainians into the EU that is already full with migrants, Les Echos said.If successfully passed, the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement would establish a political and economic association between the two parties.The accord specifically seeks to create a free trade zone between Ukraine and the 28-nation bloc.Although the deal doesn't mean Ukraine would join the EU immediately, Euroskeptics fear that the agreement would make Kiev one step closer becoming a EU member in the future, the French newspaper said.
Whhhhhhhy?
ABC's entertainment chief Paul Lee was asked the Why? question during a conference call with reporters Tuesday morning: Why did the network dump Happy Endings? One reporter challenged the idea that the comedy wasn't “on brand” for ABC, noting that two of the network's newly greenlit comedies for next season, Super Fun Night and Mixology, feel like they'd be perfect companions for Happy Endings.
“I do think Happy Endings is absolutely on brand,” Lee said after the network unveiled its new fall schedule Tuesday. “What we found was it was just too narrow. It was a very hard decisions because, as you know, I love that show and I found it very hard to make that decision. On the same token, I think Super Fun Night and Mixology are broader shows that will bring in a wider audience. So: Hard decision, not happy at all to see it go, but we feel it was on brand and so is [Super Fun Night] and Mixology.”
“Too narrow” is, of course, network-speak for “low ratings.”
ABC declined to pick up the comedy for a fourth season before its upfront presentation to advertisers this week (along with some other under-performing comedies like Family Tools and Malibu Country). Happy Endings averaged 4.6 million viewers and a 1.9 rating among adults 18-49 this season, though it dropped below a mere 1.0 rating in the overnights after the network moved the show to Friday nights. The show is currently being shopped to the USA Network, so there's still a possibility that it could live on.
Lee also addressed the canceling of Body of Proof, which is being shopped to cable. “We had a very strong season in terms of [new series] development,” Lee said. “I would love to see Body of Proof find a good home for itself.”

Pearl Street Warehouse, a new music venue and restaurant at The Wharf from the owners of Cantina Marina, has announced its opening slate of concerts. Booker T. Jones, the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer who led The MGs and co-wrote “Green Onions,” will headline the venue's opening-day show on Oct. 12 — the same day I.M.P. opens its new concert hall, the neighboring The Anthem, with a performance by Foo Fighters.
Unlike The Anthem, which can fit up to 6,000 people, Pearl Street Warehouse (33 Pearl St. SW) will be quite intimate, with a capacity of about 150 for seated shows and 300 for shows with a mix of seats and standing. Dinner service will also be available during concerts from the venue's American diner-style menu.
In many ways, Jones represents the kind of acts the venue is aiming to attract.
“I've tongue-in-cheek called it American music,” says Bruce A. Gates who, with Nicholas Fontana and Henry Gandy, co-owns Pearl Street Warehouse and Cantina Marina. “It is Americana but we're gonna have blues and rock 'n' roll and country and more.”
Jones “is drawing from everything that Americana music is and from soul, from Memphis, and the blues, as well as collaborating with acts like Drive-By Truckers and The Roots,” says the venue's talent buyer, Lisa White. “He is kind of the embodiment of all those styles and yet they take all of those things and has their own style.”
White, who used to book shows at 9:30 Club and Gypsy Sally's, says the venue will focus on local acts and rising artists. There will also be performers, like Jones, who could play bigger rooms but choose Pearl Street for a more intimate vibe. Comedy and spoken-word performances are in the pipeline, as are brunch and happy hour shows.
“The role of Pearl Street Warehouse is to develop artists,” White says. “We'll be developing local artists, regional artists, touring national acts and helping them grow within their market.”
Highlights on the initial schedule include: Levon Helm's daughter Amy Helm (Oct. 13); Asheville, N.C., bluegrass band Town Mountain (Oct. 14); folk singer Amythyst Kiah (Oct. 27); and a pair of rare solo shows from Drive-By Truckers frontman Patterson Hood (Dec. 2 & 3). D.C. is represented by singer-songwriter Justin Jones (Nov. 3) and the Chuck Brown Band (Nov. 22). (A full schedule is available at pearlstreetwarehouse.com. Tickets go on sale Tuesday at 2 p.m. through Ticketfly. Jones' show costs $75; most will range between $15 and $25.)
Pearl Street Warehouse can be split into a concert space and a restaurant, though most concerts will use the entire space. Flexible seating allows for options with tables and chairs and full dinner service, or mostly standing with some seating, including in the 50-seat mezzanine level that hangs above one of two bars. The restaurant will be open daily for breakfast and lunch.
The venue has high-def video and streaming capabilities, which will benefit patrons at shows and, potentially, fans at home.
“If bands want to record a live-show video, or if they want to stream it on their website, they can do that,” Gates says. “If PBS or somebody wants to do an ‘Austin City Limits' kind of show, it's perfect for that.”
Pearl Street Warehouse enters an increasingly crowded D.C. music scene. Union Stage, from the owners of Vienna's Jammin Java, is supposed to open at The Wharf this fall and a City Winery — from the hybrid venue/restaurant/winery chain — is coming to Ivy City this year. Gates and White envision all of the area's venues, including already established spaces, working together to cultivate a larger music scene in D.C., like that of Nashville or Austin, where White lives for part of the year.
“I'm not competing with The Anthem,” White says. “I'm a blip on The Anthem's radar. They're going to be doing stuff that's completely different. We're gonna develop acts that are gonna outgrow Pearl Street Warehouse and they're gonna go to the Birchmere and the Hamilton.”
“I think there's so much opportunity to improve the music scene in D.C.,” Gates adds. “We're a small but powerful addition to that equation, I think, along with others that are going in. There's an almost unlimited capacity for good music and the more our city becomes a hub for that, the more it will develop and the more the audience will develop.”
Hubski's interface isn't as smooth as it could be, and today's update is an effort to improve it.
This update brings three major changes.
These are:
1) You hub now contains information about you. If you want to learn about another hubskier, visit their hub.
2) Your control panel which enables you to set alert preferences, etc., can be reached by clicking on your name in the upper right. Only you can see this page now.
3) When you click on names or tags, a small menu appears. This menu will let you follow or unfollow that user or tag directly, or navigate through to the hub or tag page.
I am going to be making some adjustments to this, but I'd like to begin trying out this new setup. The menus that dropped down off to the side were neat, but is beenn't very clear what content they were attached to.
In addition to these updates, some users have posted some bugs on #bugski. I have fixed a couple of these, and will continue to work on the rest. Keep them coming!
BTW, see this #bugski tag? Now if you put #'s on either side of a word, it makes that word a tag, and links to the tag page.
As always, feedback is welcome.
p.s. Welcome to you new Hubski users! This week has seen an uptick of new users joining us. Many of you are quiet, but we know you are there. If you know someone that might enjoy the site, let them know. We appreciate it. New blood keeps things interesting.
p.p.s. This is probably a good time to refresh your browser cache. :)
EDIT: It seems the feed is just a bit slower. I'm going to do something to remedy that.

80 years after Prohibition ended, the State of New Jersey passed a law that created craft distillery licenses, relaxing strict alcohol beverage controls. Just a year later, in 2014, the co-founder of Triumph Brewing Company in Princeton, Ray Disch, was ready for a new challenge and set their sights on their hometown of Hopewell, New Jersey. Located just northwest of Princeton in the Sourland Mountains, Sourland Mountain Spirits has become the “First Farm Distillery In New Jersey Since Prohibition”–with a trademark to boot.
Producing handcrafted small-batch spirits with fresh local ingredients, Sourland Mountain Spirits says, “The gin is in” and they have “a vodka worth sipping.” Water is drawn from an aquifer at the base of the Sourland Mountain Range and the surrounding farmland is the perfect source for sustainable ingredients. And they were recently recognized as the New Jersey Gin Distillery of the Year by the New York International Spirits Competition.
The Sourland Mountains have been home to farmers and bootleggers, among others, over the years and are surrounded by the largest contiguous forest in Central New Jersey. The Sourland Mountain Conservancy is also a cause close to the Distillery's heart and they hope to attract more tourists and locals alike with fine spirits as well as a singular location on the same farmland alongside Brick Farm Tavern and Bar and Troon Brewing Company.
Look for rum and barrel-aged gin this fall plus applejack and bourbon later this year. Guided tours for up to 10 people are available on Saturdays and Sundays from 1-5 pm–schedule online or give Sourland Mountain Spirits a call to reserve. Tours include a chance to learn about distilling equipment and the distilling process plus a tasting at Brick Farm Tavern.
B-2 Bomber Nano Blade Tactical Pocket Knife
Inspired by the B-2 Stealth Bomber military aircraft, the B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is the last everyday pocket knife you will ever need to carry. The mini tactical B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is designed with precision and detail that allows it to be extremely robust and versatile in every survival situation.
We wanted to design a quality miniature tactical pocket knife that can endure the toughest daily tasks and also small enough to carry without notice. In other words, we wanted an all around badass pocket knife that was fully concealable.
Urban Military Concept: All of our Bomber & Company products have a military design and tactical aesthetic. The B-2 Nano Blade is engineered to hold durability and functionality similar to military grade equipment. Vincent Pilot Ng (Lead Designer) has had over 10 years of professional experience in product design. They have brought about other renown products to markets such as the Bomber Barrel Duffle Bag and Halo Belt.
Blade: The blade is split with a serrated teeth edge as well as a sharp edge. The sharp edge is perfect for thin sharp precision slices whereas the teeth is perfect for tougher materials like wood. The B-2 Nano Blade uses the "Great American Tooth" pattern much like in traditional crosscut tree saws. The pattern was designed specifically to saw and rake wood fibers. The blade is also perforated to allow cutting and slicing of materials to not stick onto the blade itself. It provides a cleaner sharper cut.
The B-2 Nano Blade cuts using the "Great American Tooth" pattern. Wood or other tough materials can be sawed and raked.
The non-serrated part of the blade or precision cut blade is flat ground. We were looking into both options during the design process and concluded that a flat ground blade would be more versatile for most people's daily use of an every day carry.
The serrated part (teeth) of the blade, however, is a chisel ground. We designed the serrated part of the knife to be able to scrape flint or even split wood. The blade itself is very robust and the serrated chisel can be used to wedge and pry.
Although the knife is very small, it was engineered to be very tactical. The versatility of both blade styles give it an advantage over every other small pocket knife.
Sizing: Discrete concealability is the definition of the B-2 Nano Blade. The full opened length is only 80mm and when closed, it stands at 48mm in length, 20mm in width (closed) and only 5mm thick. The miniature size of the pocket knife means it can easily be hidden in any coin pocket or clipped onto keychains without notice.
Weight: The ultralight weight of the B-2 Nano Blade comes in at less than 1oz making it the world's lightest, fully functional, 440C black stainless steel tactical pocket knife.
The B-2 Nano Blade is the smallest and lightest tactical pocket knife in the world.
Materials: 440C black stainless steel allows B-2 pocket knives to be one of the strongest nano blades ever created by humankind. Rated at 58-60HRC the B-2 Nano Blade is extremely tough and will stay sharp for longer periods of use. 440C is a highly durable and corrosion resistant stainless steel. The B-2 Nano Blade can endure years of outdoor wear without extra maintenance to protect the blade from rusting.
Casing Design: The B-2 Bomber Nano Blade Pocket Knife embodies a full redesign of the vintage SR288 stock casing. Originally, this discontinued casing was used for full-sized pocket knives ranging from 5 to 9 inches. The reason we have chosen this stock casing is because of its ease of use, comfort, and reliability in tactical use. Our redesign of the stock casing has given the body a tremendous upgrade in quality as well as addressed the original flaws that didn't make it a versatile knife.
We have upgraded the casing material to a heat treated 440C black stainless steel and shrunken the size dramatically to a miniature version similar to its older brother. In addition, we upgraded the blade material to 440C black stainless steel to achieve a 58-60HRC hardness scale.
Upon doing so, we were able to add the Great American Tooth pattern for "sawing" tougher materials like wood. Staying true to its size proportionally, the thickness of the casing comes in at 5mm. Ultimately, with the entire redesign, we were able to increase the overall mobility, strengthen the tactical utility of use, make it fully concealable by size, while maintaining a very comfortable hold and improving the military/tactical aesthetics of the entire pocket knife.
Safety as a priority - Snap Lock leaves zero wiggle room and prevents accidental closing when in use.
Folding/Locking: The B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is both locking and folding. Safety was one of the main concerns when it comes to a knife of this size. We wanted the design to be suitable for beginners as well as intermediate knife experts. The lock is a lever rather than a push button lock. You can actually use the spine to scrap splint without the worry of it coming around when the blade is locked. This makes the knife design much more robust than traditional smaller blades which are just folding.
When the B-2 Nano Blade opens, the lever "SNAPS" into place to lock the blade from accidentally closing when in use. The user can feel and hear the tactile sound and click on the lock. To close, all you have to do is press the locking lever to open.
While designing the B-2, we made sure to leave ZERO wiggle room. Once locked into place, the blade is completely tight and will not move. It was incredibly difficult engineering this, as the B-2 is very small in size. We made sure to trial and error fractions of a millimeter to finally get the B-2 to hit perfection.
The B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is the world's smallest and lightest tactical pocket knife ever to be created by humankind.

Prototyping:
The following shows the steps of prototyping as well as process of how the B-2 Nano Blade came to life. During the design process, we had a few key elements we wanted to incorporate into the B-2 Nano Blade. The knife had to be small enough to carry discretely, however still big enough to be used as a functional knife. It also needs to be extremely durable. Consequently, we decided to use 440Carbon stainless steel because it is corrosion resistant as well as stronger than most standard 5Cr13MoV stainless steels.
Early Sketches of the B-2 Nano Blade
Early Sketches while prototyping of the B-2 Nano Blade
The following picture shows a 2 dimentional drawing of the B-2 Nano Blade. It was our first drawing of the knife. It gives us the very basic design look and length. Once we achieved the perfect look and tactical feel of the knife, we were able to create a CAD rendering.
Early 2D drawing of the B-2 Nano Blade with vertical perforated holes on the blade.
Once we had the 2D drawing, we were able to start making a visual product with depth. We then adjusted the thickness of the knife in the CAD rendering to create the perfect 3D model. We then use the 3D CAD model as a blueprint for the first tangible product.
3D CAD modeled design of the B-2 Nano Blade
Below is the first handmade prototype of the B-2 Nano Blade. We had used sheet aluminum to wire cut the first prototypes. As you can see in the pictures, we had cut out the holes for the screws as well as perforation in the blade using this method. This was not a functional prototype, as it was not safe enough to use. The sheet aluminum is soft and just an early design to understand the overall feel, weight, and hold of the knife. Once we had the overall aesthetics of the knife down, we needed it to be fully functional in the following steps.
First hand made prototype
In the second prototype, we managed to produce it out of real stainless steel. Using 5Cr13MoV stainless steel, we were able to achieve a stronger, more tactile, precise, and functional prototype. This gave us an understanding of first case usage, mobility, and design aesthetics. We also added more functionality to the blade by adding a hole for a keyring, as well as tilted the perforated slots in the blade to a 15-degree angle. This allowed material to slide off easier than standard verticle perforated holes. The second prototype does not have a blade edge or a serrated blade.
2nd Prototype - No serrated ground on blade | Made from standard 5Cr13MoV stainless steel
Our third prototype, we added a precision grind onto the blade. We originally decided to go with a serrated blade "chisel grind" (meaning only one side of the blade was sharpened) because we were going to add a serrated section. The following final prototype shows a "flat grind" on the blade because it allowed both left and right handed users. It was ultimately more versatile. As you can see in the video below, we show the differences between the final prototype and the third prototype with different grinds on the blade.

It's been quite a year of transition for Ramriddlz, the Mississauga singer who first came to prominence with the spring one-off "Sweeterman." Something like eight months since that drop, he's embarked on a new wave, linking up with OVO and playing shows across the U.S. and Canada. Finally, he's releasing their first piece of new music since this summer's P2P EP. The track, produced by frequent collaborators Jaegen and C.P Dubb, features a verse from new friend Playboi Carti. Over a characteristically slow-burning beat that sounds like the post-Hennessy slump they sing of, Ram delivers some of their most memorable one-liners to-date: Babes just wanna Ramriddlz and chill; Eating good, call me Uncle Phil; Everything halal so no pepperoni. We're crying.
"I've been out in L.A. for the past couple months working on my next project and did a few appearances and show. At one show, Playboi Carti was also there. We kicked it off and vibed with each other. Brought them over to a studio where I record at, Jaegen cooked up a beat and C.P Dubb threw their touch on it. With all the drugs and drinks being passed around, the idea of being fucked up and have bitches ringing up our phones too often became the song itself," Ramriddlz told The FADER over email. "Ring rings for the dingaling," they added.

Theresa May has said they are "confident" that the government will win its appeal against a High Court ruling on triggering Brexit talks.
They told European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and Germany's Angela Merkel they were committed to triggering Article 50 by March 2017.
Three judges ruled that they cannot do so without Parliament's support.
It comes as a Conservative MP said they were quitting due to "irreconcilable" differences with the government.
Stephen Phillips has been among Tory MPs pushing for Parliament to be consulted over the UK's strategy for negotiating its exit from the EU, accusing ministers of trying to "ignore their views".
The government is appealing against Thursday's ruling to the Supreme Court - all 11 judges are due to hear the case in early December.
If it loses its appeal, it is expected that the government will have to publish some form of new law for MPs - and the House of Lords - to vote on.
The prime minister's spokesperson said they had expressed "disappointment" at Thursday's court ruling in a phone call to Mr Juncker and Mrs Merkel but had said "the focus of the government is on the Supreme Court case. We are confident of winning that case and proceeding with Article 50".
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nick Clegg tells Radio 4's Today programme Lib Dems will look for soft Brexit
But former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg - now the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson - said their party would seek to join with others "in both the Commons and the Lords to amend the legislation" to tell the government to pursue a "soft Brexit" that would keep the UK within the EU's single market.
"If they believe the government is pursuing an unnecessarily hard, in other words an unnecessarily self-harming version of Brexit, then of course MPs should be free to reject that," they told the BBC.
Conservative peer Lady Wheatcroft told BBC Radio 4's Today they were willing to table an amendment to future legislation to delay the Brexit process, saying it was "only right to delay triggering Article 50 until we have a clearer idea of what it actually entails".
But former Conservative cabinet minister Theresa Villiers told the programme: "Frankly I think it would be a constitutional outrage if unelected Liberal Democrat peers were to stand in the way of implementing the clear result of a referendum in which 33 million people took part."
On Friday, German foreign minister Walter Steinmeier reiterated the German government's desire to see Article 50 triggered quickly at a Berlin press conference with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, ruling out any "preliminary discussions" before then.
Analysis by Jenny Hill, BBC Berlin correspondent
Image copyright AFP Image caption Boris Johnson has insisted the UK's Brexit timetable won't be "interfered with"
Boris Johnson's opening quip that (unlike their wife) they are not a Berliner did little to improve a rather frosty joint press conference after their first official bilateral meeting with their German counterpart Frank Walter Steinmeier.
It is Mr Johnson's first visit as foreign secretary to Berlin, where he's widely regarded - in some cases with contempt - as being directly responsible for Britain's decision to leave the EU.
This wasn't the outcome the German government hoped for. But now the decision's made they'd rather Britain just got on with it.
Mr Steinmeier - who looked unimpressed by Mr Johnson's assertion that Brexit represented an opportunity - emphasised the need for the British government to trigger Article 50 as soon as possible.
Their priority, they added, was to the remaining 27 member states.
Thursday's High Court ruling found that the government could not trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty alone, without the backing of Parliament - which would require publishing legislation to be debated by the Commons and the Lords.
It was met with furious newspaper headlines, with the Daily Mail describing the judges involved as "enemies of the people" - which in turn sparked a social media backlash.
Chantal-Aimee Doerries QC, chairperson of the Bar Council, told BBC News the "attack on judges" and their role was "extremely concerning": "The rule of law sits in our democracy as a cornerstone and it is important for our judiciary to rule on questions of the rule of law. If we do not respect the independent judiciary in that role we put at risk our democracy."
Labour's shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon called on Justice Secretary Liz Truss to speak out against the "hysterical headlines" while Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve told the Guardian the attacks on the judiciary were "entirely unjustified".
But UKIP leadership contender Suzanne Evans told the BBC's Daily Politics: "Judges are allowing pressure groups and campaigners to bring cases for judicial review and making rulings which would not stand up to scrutiny at the ballot box."
What happens next?
Image copyright Supreme Court Image caption The Supreme Court justices are all expected to preside over the government's appeal against the High Court's Brexit ruling
The government's appeal is expected to be heard in early December by the full Supreme Court for the first time in its history.
The judgement may not be handed down until January.
If the appeal fails, it is thought the government will then have to bring forward legislation - which would have to be approved by both Houses of Parliament.
The bill could be subject to amendments. MPs and peers may push for more details of the government's negotiating strategy or possibly for a second referendum.
The government wants to trigger Article 50 by the end of March 2017 so any legislation would need to be approved by then if the timetable is not to be pushed back.
The government has argued that it cannot "show its hand in detail" ahead of negotiations with 27 other EU member states, despite calls from MPs to clarify them plans.
For Labour, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said that while they thought "that in the end Parliament will vote for Article 50 to be triggered" the judgement meant the government would have to give MPs "some basic terms on which they are going to negotiate Brexit".
Editor's Note: Normal people might find some of this offensive. (We hope.)
Liberals don't believe in the double standard. They believe in one standard. Anything that the left does is great. Anything conservatives, Christians or even chefs, yes chefs, do is wrong.
It's really simple. If you're actor Emma Stone, liberals will freak out when you play a Hawaiian/Asian, but mostly Swedish character in the forgettable Aloha. Slate called the title “cultural appropriation” and using Stone “a preposterous casting choice” even though both the actor and character were mostly white. Stone even had to apologize for “whitewashing.” Horrors.
Amazing actor Zoe Saldana, a person of color herself, was criticized for playing the role of Nina Simone because Zoe isn't black enough. Even faux dreadlocks are controversial.
Then there's the popular Broadway hit Hamilton. In it, people of color play the Founding Fathers -- to make them appear cool. Founding the United States wasn't cool enough for liberals and the media. I'll let The New York Times tell you about that:
“‘Hamilton,' the mega-buzzy bio-musical about Alexander Hamilton and the founding fathers, opened to glowing accolades unlike any in memory. It received 11 Tony Awards, including the best musical, and 16 Tony nominations, the most nominations in Broadway history. It won the Pulitzer Prize and a Grammy Award. In their review, Ben Brantley writes: ‘Yes, it really is that good.'”
Hamilton had such an impact it's one of the reasons why we are keeping Alexander Hamilton on the $10. While I'm fine with that, it's is a ridiculous way to make policy.
When Hamilton was criticized for an openly racist casting call, the entirety of the left rose to its defense. Here's The Atlantic, ever clueless.
“In an era when the lead Republican candidate is frequently understood to voice the resentment of whites who see their longstanding supremacy in American society threatened—an era where comments sections roil with apocalyptic mentions of ‘reverse racism' and ‘black privilege' — the notion of America's founders de-whitened for a blockbuster Broadway show would seem like inevitable cause for a round of cultural warfare.”
Never fear, it's OK to cast white people as People of Color, but anything white people use or do that they didn't invent is CULTURAL APPROPRIATION.
Which takes us to our latest outrages:
The Foes Of Faux Pho: Bon Appétit's readers might have noticed a recent piece that was originally called: “PSA: This Is How You Should Be Eating Pho.” The story included a video of Philadelphia's Stock chef Tyler Akin. Stock serves Southeast Asian food and Tyler has a problem, he's white. The video showed how they eat Pho. And that's a no-no. The HuffPo thought police responded with, “Why The Outrage Over Bon Appétit's Pho Article Is Completely Justified.” Not just “justified,” but “completely justified.” They proceeded to quote every idiot they could find who was angry that a white guy might be an expert in something that white people didn't invent. One site even called it “whitesplaining.” Bon Appétit went grovelling and responded “how we screwed up and what we can do about it.” Actual quote: “While Akin mentions in the video that he's demonstrated their personal, preferred way of consuming pho, the outlet's packaging still positioned them as an authority.” This is America 2016. It's controversial to have a white chef make ethnic food. But no one on the left refuses to use electricity or the telephone because scary old white men were involved in their invention.
“The Case Against Pets”: The left is why we can't have nice things: ethnic food, decent movies (OK, I didn't mean Aloha.), football or a national anthem. Now it's pets. This might be the most ridiculous piece I have read in a while. This is Fusion-level insane. The authors are naturally professors at Rutgers. They also wrote the page-turner: Animal Rights: The Abolitionist Approach. They have six dogs, but they don't call them dogs exactly. “These dogs are non-human refugees with whom we share our home. Although we love them very much, we strongly believe that they should not have existed in the first place.” Here's another actual quote: “A morally just world would have no pets, no aquaria, no zoos. No fields of sheep, no barns of cows. That's true animal rights.” This is like the Peta version of John Lennon's Imagine. I can imagine this future, too. Imagine no cute puppy videos. Imagine lefties showing up at your door seizing your pets and setting them free like they do at research facilities or mink farms. Rutgers has clearly outlived its usefulness. h/t Matt Philbin.
Dying To Get Your Death Suit: Forget the coffin. Skip that pair of pennies on your eyes, those aren't recyclable. No, you need an environmentally friendly death suit. It's only $999. You only wish I was kidding. The whackjobs who brought you Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth produce all sorts of lefty propaganda. Their site Take Part wants your whole life -- even your death -- sustainable. I'll let the author's actual quote help me out. “With the rise of electric cars, sustainable architecture, eco-friendly diets, composting, and countless other options, forging a sustainable life is often as easy as it is trendy. Now it's even easy after death thanks to a bodysuit made from a decidedly old-school material: mushrooms.” But wait, there's more! Your death suit isn't just a way to turn your carcass into a mushroom farm, it's fashionable, too! Actual quote: “Although the mushroom suit provides a cost-effective alternative, the goal is to do so without losing the beauty of the process. The suit itself is a work of art thanks to designers such as Daniel Silverstein, who has designed clothing for Jennifer Hudson and Kristen Bell.” And you thought you were only kidding when you said you were dying to wear clothes just like the stars.

Apes paid more attention to film clips of an infant chimp being killed by its own kind than other acts of violence
Violent videos show apes may have sense of right and wrong
Chimpanzees may have a sense of right and wrong that echoes human concepts of morality, a study has found.
Two groups of the apes paid more attention to film clips of an infant chimp being killed by its own kind than clips showing other acts of violence.
That they singled out this attack suggests the animals viewed it as being outside the boundaries of normal behaviour.
Scientists believe the research may help to shed light on how human morality and social norms evolved.
The study involved 17 chimps housed at two Swiss zoos in Gossau and Basel.
They were observed as they watched film clips of chimpanzees unknown to them either engaged in neutral activities such as walking or cracking nuts, or displaying aggressive and violent behaviour.
One of the movies showed chimpanzees killing one of their own infants. The zoo animals spent four times longer looking at this clip than any of the other films, including those showing a colobus monkey being hunted and killed by chimps, and socially aggressive behaviour between chimpanzee adults.
The scientists ruled out the infanticide scene attracting more attention because of “striking” features such as screaming, which could also be heard on other videos.
Nor was there any difference between the extra attention paid by male and female viewers.
The researchers, led by Dr Claudia Rudolf von Rohr, from the University of Zurich, wrote in the journal Human Nature: “We found that chimpanzees discriminated between a video clip depicting severe aggression against an infant and video clips depicting other forms of social aggression or neutral behaviour.
“Specifically, they showed significantly longer looking times in the infanticide condition than in the control conditions.
“This result is consistent with the idea that severe aggression against infants did not match chimpanzees' social expectations of a certain tolerance normally afforded to infants.”
The team found that despite viewing the infanticide scene for longer, on the whole the chimpanzees did not become more emotionally aroused by what they saw.
This could be because as uninvolved “bystanders” they failed to empathise strongly with a victim not from their group, said the scientists.
“The results suggest that chimpanzees detect norm violations both within their group and in a group of unfamiliar individuals, but that they will only respond emotionally to such norm violations within their own group,” said Rudolph von Rohr.
The researchers concluded: “This fruitful topic for future research might provide us with important insights into the evolution of specific social norms in humans and why some of them are widely accepted and others more difficult to establish.”
US photographer Joel Sartore is spending a decade taking portraits of the 12,000 species in captivity worldwide – with an emphasis on those facing extinction
As the world goes through what scientists have called its “sixth great extinction”, with animal species vanishing at a rate unheralded since the dinosaurs were wiped out 66 million years ago, the sense of helplessness can be acute among those who revere nature.
Joel Sartore spent several years taking evocative photographs of endangered species for National Geographic before realising they needed to change tack if they were to drum up public concern about Earth's diminishing wildlife.
“All I did was photograph animals in a natural habitat, which often looked great but, in terms of making a difference, didn't really do anything,” they said. “But for some reason people have really got into Photo Ark . People relate to it in a way they wouldn't get from shooting in the wild. It's a better way of getting the public to care.”
Photo Ark is Sartore's decade-long project to capture intimate portraits of the estimated 12,000 species in the world's zoos and aquariums. So far, he's up to 5,500, with a heavy focus on those in danger of dying out in the wild.
Their approach is relatively simple – they place individual animals, or small groups, in front of stark white or black backgrounds, mimicking a classic studio shoot. The compelling eye contact of the animals, stripped of their habitats, has proved so popular that Sartore's images have been projected on to the Empire State building and St Peter's basilica.

It is perhaps Sartore's primates that hold the most attention. The stares of humans' evolutionary cousins are piercing, whether it's an orangutan glancing up while resting its rusty red chin on a hand or an over-the-shoulder look from a Celebes crested macaque.
Primate experts warned in November that half of the world's apes, lemurs and monkeys faced extinction, with loss of their arboreal habitat, hunting and the illegal wildlife trade the primary threats.
Thousands of other species, including the pollinators and oxygen suppliers, such as plants and phytoplankton, that allow for humans to live on Earth, are also at risk, with the extinction rate accelerated up to 100 times by man's impact. But primates move us in ways that few other species can. Saving them means protecting habitat that's home to many other vulnerable species.
“Primates are fascinating. They are ambassadors for their environments,” said Jennifer Mickelberg, curator of primates at Atlanta zoo, Georgia, in the southern US, which has hosted Sartore for their portraits. “People may not get motivated to save a snake or an insect, but people can relate to primates. They inspire people to take action.”

Needless to say, a primate's natural environment isn't an improvised photographic studio, which has made life difficult for Sartore at times. Backgrounds are painted or hung in cloth at zoos. Treats such as fruit hold the attention of the primates, while lighting cables are placed outside the set so as to not tempt curious hands.
“We tend to paint the backgrounds now because the cloth can get torn down,” Sartore said. “The larger primates have less to fear in the world, so they are more calm. The gorillas and bonobos were OK, the baboons were pretty good too. But when the food is finished, the shoot is over.
“The small monkeys move quickly, like birds. They are very interested in the camera, it's hard to keep them away from it. They are so interested in their own reflection that they fog up the lens with their noses.”
Some of the images look stylishly posed, such as a pair of perfectly placed Gee's golden langurs or a couple of gibbons that appear to be jumping in synchronicity. But Sartore insists the framing is mostly a matter of luck.
“The animals aren't looking at me much, they are looking for food,” they said. “They may look like they are posing as steadfastly as a human but they aren't trained. They look at me a couple of times in five minutes. The best shot usually stands out quite clearly.”
A notable absentee from Sartore's collection is the chimpanzee. An early attempt backfired badly when the chimps tore down the background and retreated. “It was kind of depressing,” they said. “The chimps were having a great time, they were laughing at me. It shows I don't always win. I'll find the right chimp one day.”
Joel Sartore's lecture about photographing endangered wildlife.
Public awareness generated by Sartore's pictures does, of course, need to translate into effective conservation if threatened primates are to survive.
Indonesian forests cannot continue to be razed for palm oil and timber at current rates if we want to keep orangutans. Small, new-world monkeys are threatened by clearing the Amazon for agriculture. The mountain gorillas of central Africa are being hemmed in by an increasing human population, bushmeat hunters and even the threat of oil drilling.
But there cannot be too many reminders of the majestic, curious relatives that we risk losing forever in the wild.
“People need to put real value on wildlife,” said Mickelberg. “Discovering that connectivity between us and them is important. What Joel is doing is remarkable for species. We are going to see extinctions, without a doubt, but all of us are working hard to mitigate those threats. I'm hopeful, but I have to be realistic too.”
Sartore expects Photo Ark to occupy them for a few more years. They will not be sparing us the unflinching stares until they document each captive species.
“Once you look an animal in the eye, it eliminates all distractions,” they said. “Putting them in that setting is quite an equaliser. You can't compare size, so a mouse is every bit as magnificent as a polar bear.
“The old saying that eyes are the window to the soul is so true. It's important we don't see animals as foreign but very much like us. If they go, so will we.”
One of North Korea's most senior diplomats warned on Monday that if any effort was made to charge the country's leader, Kim Jong-un, with crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court, the North would take unspecified “countermeasures.”
The United Nations envoy, Jang Il-hun, also denied that the country had political prisoners.
The statements by Mr. Jang came in a rare and sometimes heated hourlong discussion of the country's reaction to a United Nations report in February — which included satellite photographs of a network of prison camps, and interviews with dissidents who had escaped from them — as well as North Korea's nuclear policies. While they hewed to Pyongyang's official talking points about the report, they did not rule out allowing outside inspectors to visit the sites in the future.
“In my country we don't even know the term ‘political prisoners,' ” Mr. Jang, a 32-year veteran of the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a session with about 40 members of the Council on Foreign Relations. They insisted that the camps in the satellite photographs were “reformatories” and denied that anyone had been forced into labor. “It is a normal prison,” they added.
That was not the conclusion of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which was created by the United Nations Human Rights Council. In its report, the commission detailed conditions in the camps and concluded in its February report that “these crimes against humanity entail extermination; murder; enslavement; torture; imprisonment; rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence; persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds; the forcible transfer of populations; the enforced disappearance of persons; and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation.”
- Detectives showed FOX 4 surveillance video they used to link a woman to the murder of their husband.
Maria Montalvo is a fugitive and police in the Dallas suburb of DeSoto believe they are in Mexico.
They said they killed their husband in their home nearly three years ago. Simon Montalvo was shot six times.
Newly released surveillance video shows Maria dragging something wrapped in trash bags and blankets. Police said it was Simon's body.  They are also seen burying something in the backyard and carrying rocks to cover something up.
Police believe the murder happened while the couple's two children were sleeping.
“To think that your own children are in the house and even in the video all this is transpiring knowing that the children are in the home is quite disturbing,” said Det. Will McGraw with the DeSoto Police Department.
The Montalvo children are now living with relatives in Indiana.

Stephen Merchant has landed a guest-starring role on The Big Bang Theory.
The co-creator of The Office and Extras will be joined in one episode of the hit comedy by actor Analeigh Tipton, an ex-America's Next Top Model contestant who cameoed on the show in 2008 as herself.

The Big Bang Theory season 9 episode 5 review: O-fence-ively bland
It's rumoured Merchant and Tipton will play love interests for Amy (Mayim Bialik) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons), who recently split up.
The episode in which this all goes down is expected to be the ninth of the current ninth season, so it should air later this year in the US.
Merchant's last TV role was their HBO comedy Hello Ladies, which was cancelled last year after a full season and feature-length finale.
Their West End play The Mentalists came to a close one month earlier than planned back in August. They starred alongside Steffan Rhodri in the two-hander production.
The Big Bang Theory airs on CBS in the US and E4 in the UK.
One weekend in 1979, a cancellation at the home recording studio of New Jersey producer Tommy Marolda left them with two free days. So Marolda challenged themselves to write and record as many songs as they could, as fast as they could — all by himself. Over the course of the weekend, Marolda finished 40 tracks, releasing their favorite twelve as a full-length album, titled simply The Toms. More than 30 years later, Marolda — as writer, producer, and arranger — has worked with the likes of the Killers, Rod Stewart, the Smithereens, Richie Sambora, Frank Stallone, Elton John, Cher, and Harry Nilsson; their work on the soundtrack to the film Staying Alive even netted them a Grammy nomination. But Marolda never gave up the Toms moniker, occasionally pulling it out of mothballs to release handcrafted pop in the vein of their cult power pop debut.
“Fake Christmas” rounds up a killer holiday pop song, originally appearing as a bonus track on Marolda's album of Beatlesque Christmas tunes, and a 1985 re-recorded demo of “It's Needless,” which originally appeared on the debut Toms album. Out of print for much of the last decade, both tracks have recently made it to iTunes, but this is the first time either has seen wax.
Right before Passover, 230 new immigrants from Ukraine landed in Ben Gurion Airport early Tuesday as part of the Freedom Flight organized by the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews (IFCJ) headed by Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein.

For many of them the upcoming Passover holiday will be the first celebrated in Israel. Part of a recent wave of Aliyah (immigration to Israel), 78 families arrived, with the majority expected to settle in the north and center of the country. Among the olim (new immigrants) are four Holocaust survivors and more than 40 children.

Some of the olim came from embattled areas in Ukraine where in recent years they lived as refugees in their own country. For many of them the last two years, during which the country experienced an intense economic crisis, was a challenge filled difficulties.
Olski and Irina L. came to Israel with their daughter from the city of Dnipropetrovsk. According to them, "Life in Ukraine has become life without a future, especially for families with children. Because of the continuing war, the economic situation is also terrible. For us it was clear, if we are looking for a future for our children, it is better to do it in the land of Israel."

Yitzchak B., a Holocaust survivor, remarks, "The world war began when I was 12. The Jews were asked to gather to register. My family heard a German soldier yell out 'Death to the Jews' and immediately understood the source of the urgent registration. In a split second decision, my family left the place and asked Polish friends to please hide us. They agreed and we hid throughout the whole war. Now that I am making Aliyah to Israel, I feel a strong sense of mission and commitment to the State of Israel. I am happy and excited to reunite with my son who already lives in Israel."
When the olim descended from the airplane, Minister of Immigration and Absorption Sofa Landver was waiting for them with a festive ceremony in the airport.

"I am very happy about the continued wave of Aliyah and am sure that together we will provide the olim who just arrived with the best possible care and optimal absorption in every part of life so that they will immediately feel at home," the minister said.
Jeff Kaye, Executive Vice President of the IFCJ, turned to the olim and told their own personal story. "I also made Aliyah to Israel more than 30 years ago, and in all honesty I can say that it was not always easy, but I never regretted it. The land of Israel is my home and it is home for all of us. I want to thank all of you personally for giving us, at the IFCJ, your trust and the opportunity to bring you to Israel."

Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, President of the IFCJ said, "The new olim that have joined us today are carrying with them a burden that is not at all simple—the burden of a political war and no less than that, an economic war. The open opportunity for the olim to come here and begin a new life, living in a strong and independent country, constitutes a rescue for them. The holiday of freedom that we will all celebrate soon is a significant expression of the concept of freedom that the olim will feel in Israel for the first time. I call to all of the people of Israel to remember the olim and invite them to their homes for the seder meal and to celebrate their freedom with them."

This flight was made possible due to the support of IFCJ's 1.6 million Christian donors in America and around the world, who are committed to briniging Jews from all around the world back to their historical homeland.
Since the IFCJ began its independent program to bring olim to Israel in 2014, olim from 19 different countries have come to Isarel through the organization. Out of these, 5,179 olim came from Ukraine.
The olim in IFCJ's last few flights, like the rest of the olim who came through the IFCJ, will receive assistance of $800 for each adult and $400 for each child from the IFCJ, in addition to having their flights financed. This support given by the IFCJ comes as an addition to the "Absorption Basket" (sal klitah) and the benefits the olim receive from the Ministry of Immigrant Absorption.
On November 26 President Donald Trump warned that Democrat Doug Jones would be “bad for our 2nd Amendment.”
Jones is running against Republican Roy Moore for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama.
Trump tweeted:
The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military and our great Vets, Bad for our 2nd Amendment, AND WANTS TO Raise TAXES TO THE SKY. Jones would be a disaster! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2017
On November 21 Breitbart News reported that Jones has been mum on their gun positions, but that has not prevented reporters from learning that they support more gun control for gun shows. The Washington Post reported Jones saying that expanding background checks to gun shows “would be helpful.”
Jones' overarching belief is that the Second Amendment has “limitations.” Moreover, they also believe that every natural right protected by the Bill of Rights is limited, and open to government regulation.
The Alabama Political Reporter quoted Jones saying, “We've got limitations on all constitutional amendments in one form or another.”

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other government agencies have no right to “resist disclosure” if a requester fails to adequately describe records they are seeking in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. They also must make a “good faith” attempt to define a request properly, a federal appeals court ruled.
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a decision by a district court, which maintained a FOIA request for records on CIA personnel or affiliates that engaged in torture “constituted a question” instead of a legitimate request.
Stephen Yagman sent the CIA a letter on August 2, 2014, for records on “the names and company/organization affiliations of any CIA employees, agents, operatives, contractors, mercenaries, and/or companies who are alleged to have engaged in torture of persons.” Yagman specifically referenced President Barack Obama's statement, “We tortured some folks,” which was uttered on August 1.
“Who are the individuals whom the word ‘we' refers to?” Yagman asked in their request.
Before the twenty-day deadline for responding to FOIA requests, the CIA told Yagman “federal agencies are not required to answer questions posed as FOIA requests.” They declined to process the request. Yagman filed a class action complaint to force disclosure of records on torturers.
It was not until after Yagman filed suit that staff at the CIA offered to help rework the request so it could be processed. Two messages were left for Yagman that instructed them to call the CIA's “FOIA hotline.”
The appeals court agreed [PDF] with the district court that Yagman did not “reasonably describe,” but it sent the case back down to a lower court and instructed Yagman and the CIA to rework the request.
“While we have rarely reviewed an agency's refusal to respond to a records request on the ground that it poses a question,” the appeals court stated, “applying the duty to liberally construe records requests easily resolves this initial issue.”
“Liberally construed, Yagman requested ‘[r]ecords/information' identifying CIA employees or affiliates who have engaged in torture after September 11, 2001. The fact that Yagman's request references President Obama's August 1, 2014, statement does not transform Yagman's request to a question.”
“I don't think this is a departure from the kinds of tactics agencies use to evade requests. However, claiming that a request is overly broad is a common way that they dodge requests. So, this is a pretty good illustration of that,” journalist and Shadowproof contributor Ken Klippenstein said.
In 2013, a federal judge scolded the CIA for “inappropriately” keeping records from requesters.
The case involved a lawsuit by the firm, National Security Counselors, which sought “documents concerning compliance with open records laws,” according to McClatchy Newspapers.
Judge Beryl Howell said the CIA was engaged in a “shameless twisting of the factual record” and denounced the agency's assertions about its routine handling of requests.

The time difference with Brazil has hurt TV-viewing levels for the Rio Olympics across Europe in comparison with the London Games in 2012, and migration to alternative digital platforms has also taken its toll. But interest remains strong in key countries and could increase as local heroes emerge at the Games. A look at key markets:
BRITAIN
Ratings in Britain for the start of the Rio Olympics are down from the London Games in 2012 primarily because they aren't in London. The lead-up to the last Summer Olympics generated so much anticipation locally that the bar was set impossibly high for the Rio Games to match.
The total linear TV audience on the BBC, which has exclusive British rights, for the first days of the Games (from the opening ceremony late Friday night until 2 a.m. Monday local time) was 24.6 million, compared with 39.2 million in 2012.
Also affecting viewership is the four-hour time difference between the U.K. and Brazil, which puts many of the events into the small hours of the morning in Britain. This included the first medal win for “Team GB,” a gold for swimmer Adam Peaty.
Related TV Ratings: Ledecky, Phelps, Biles Slow NBC's Olympics Bleeding
A third cause for the drop was the BBC's increased emphasis on viewing on its digital platforms. The digital audience for the opening ceremony this year totaled 8.8 million, far more than the 6.3 million in 2012. The first day of competition drew 12.9 million digital viewers compared to 7.8 million in 2012, and the second day attracted 14.9 million versus 8.3 million in 2012.
Many of the events are being shown on the linear service hours after they take place, which occasionally backfires as viewers, thinking they are watching an event live, are disappointed to stumble on the results on Twitter.
The human-interest stories are catching the most attention. Peaty's grandmother became an overnight (literally) media sensation in Britain thanks to their Twitter feed, and 18-year-old Syrian Yusra Mardini, who swam Saturday for the Olympics Refugee Team, also became an instant media star.
Peaty's win fanned local interest in the Olympics, but so, too, did the social media debate sparked by the dress worn by one of the BBC presenters. For some on Twitter, Helen Skelton's dress was too short, but others defended their choice of attire.

FRANCE
The Olympics are traditionally France's most-watched sports event, and this year air on both pubcaster France 2 and pay-TV operator Canal Plus. Ratings for the first weekend in Rio were lower than those for the London Games four years ago.
The opening ceremony Friday night drew 1.6 million people to France 2, for a 26% market share. Those numbers fell to 17.6% market share Saturday and 14.4% on Sunday. By comparison, the opening weekend of the London Games on France 2 scored 18% and 20.1% shares.
Meanwhile, Canal Plus notched 2.2% and 2.4% market share over the two days.

SPAIN
In Spain, the Olympics opening ceremony, broadcast by pubcaster RTVE's core channel La 1, dominated TV ratings with a 19.4% audience share and 1.3 million viewers Friday night. But the results were far lower than the London Games, whose inaugural ceremony snagged a far stronger 46.1% share and 5.7 million eyeballs.
The question is to what extent the far lower viewership was a consequence of the time difference. The London Olympics started transmissions in the middle of Spanish TV primetime, whereas Rio's opening ceremony began after midnight in Spain.
RTVE is reserving Rio's top competitions for La 1, while its dedicated free-to-air sports channel, Teledeporte, is broadcasting 24-hour-a-day coverage of the Games. RTVE plans to offer 4,500 hours of live sportscast, on up to 19 live TV signals simultaneously and on its Internet service rtve.es and a dedicated app.
On Sunday, the major attraction was the debut in Rio of Spanish tennis players Rafael Nadal and Garbiñe Muguruza, and Spain's basketball team. With TV slot Conexion Rio, La 1 won the primetime battle, with a 14.7% share and 1.3 million viewers. In late-night, the defeat against Croatia of the Spanish basketball team led by NBA star Pau Gasol topped the charts, earning a 21.6% share and 1.7 million viewers for La 1.
Five Teledeporte transmissions led the list of most-watched TV programs among Spain's niche free-to-air TV channels on Sunday.

GERMANY
The Olympics have drawn top ratings in Germany, where they are airing on pubcasters ARD and ZDF. According to Quotenmeter, the Games proved the most-watched program on ARD on Saturday evening: 4.23 million viewers tuned in for the cycling competitions, 4.34 million for swimming, 4.4 million for gymnastics and 4.71 million for rowing. On average, the Games drew an average of 3.74 million viewers and a strong 17.3% share among all viewers and 17.6% among the key 14-to-49 demographic.
On Sunday, audiences dropped slightly for ZDF, with the Olympics beaten by ARD's hit crime drama “Tatort,” which drew 4.81 million viewers and a 17.2% share among all viewers. By comparison, 3.88 million tuned in to ZDF for Olympic swimming, followed by 4.2 million for cycling. More than 5 million viewers watched Germany's 3-3 match against South Korea in men's soccer, resulting in a 19.2% share among all viewers and 17.1% among 14-to-49-year-olds.
A fire scare near ZDF's Rio studio forced the network's Olympic broadcast off the air early Monday, Quotenmeter reported. The pubcaster was about to show German table-tennis star Timo Boll in action around 1:30 a.m. when correspondent Katrin Müller-Hohenstein announced that the crew had to evacuate the studio after a fire alarm went off. ZDF replaced the Olympics with an episode of the hit British mystery series “Midsomer Murders,” but went back to Olympic coverage about 15 minutes later when the ZDF crew returned safely to the Rio studio.
Despite the time difference, this year's viewing figures are not so different compared with the 2012 London Games. Primetime ratings in 2012 ranged between 3.64 million and 4.6 million during the first weekend, resulting in shares of 16.4% and 17.7%, respectively. The first Monday (July 30) saw 5.58 million viewers tune in for swimming and hockey (including a German team match), resulting in a 22.5% share.

ITALY
The Olympics appear to be faring well in Italy, where the opening ceremony scored a nearly 40% audience share, albeit at 2 a.m. local time. The figure dropped to 22% on Saturday during primetime, but shot back up to 33% in primetime Sunday as Italian athletes scored five medals, including golds in judo and foil fencing.
The early audience numbers, provided by state broadcaster Rai, appear to be roughly on par with those for the 2012 London Olympics.
The Games are being aired exclusively on Rai, which is making the most of the fact that it gained Olympic rights back exclusively after having had to share them with pay-TV outlet Sky for the past eight years.
Rai has added the slogan “sports are for everyone” under the Rio 2016 logo, and is providing coverage of unprecedented scope for Italy, beaming the Games on three channels: on generalist station Rai-2, plus dedicated sports outlets Rai Sport 1 and Rai Sport 2.
Rai has also launched 36 dedicated online Olympic TV channels providing the Games live or through a catch-up on-demand service, plus an app to view them via smartphone and tablet. Like other broadcasters around the world, they are also offering Italian audiences a virtual-reality viewing experience.
Rai has not yet issued numbers on its online and mobile Olympic audience.

In recent years the expected standard for facial animation and character performance in AAA video games has dramatically increased. The use of photogrammetric capture techniques for actor-likeness acquisition, coupled with video-based facial capture and solving methods, has improved quality across the industry. However, due to variability across project pipelines, increased per-project scope for performance capture, and a reliance on external vendors, it is often challenging to maintain visual consistency from project to project, and even from character to character within a single project. Given these factors, we identified the need for a unified, robust, and scalable pipeline for actor likeness acquisition, character art, performance capture, and character animation.

Online casinos increased spending on adverts by 97 per cent over five years GARETH FULLER/PA
Children are being bombarded with a record number of gambling adverts as betting websites embark on an unprecedented spending spree to attract new customers.
Figures show that the industry has spent £1.4 billion on advertising since 2012, with online casinos doubling their marketing budgets over the past five years.
Britain's biggest charity to help addicts is so concerned about the increasing volume of advertising that it is urging ministers to introduce stricter rules. Writing today in The Times, Kate Lampard, the chairperson of GambleAware, says: “With the average age at which children start to watch post-watershed TV unsupervised being 11¾, restrictions based on a 9pm watershed may offer little protection.
“We need to balance the array of [commercial gambling] advertising with information about the risks…
The United States on Wednesday called on the international community to cut all diplomatic and trade ties with North Korea - including Chinese oil shipments to Pyongyang after a groundbreaking missile test by the pariah regime.
Washington urged tough action as emergency talks on the North's latest provocation opened in the UN Security Council - and after US President Donald Trump derided Kim Jong-Un as a "sick puppy" and threatened "major" new sanctions.
Pyongyang on Wednesday tested its third intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) - which it claimed was capable of striking anywhere in the United States - snapping a two-month pause in missile launches.
North Korean leader Kim said the test of the Hwasong-15 weapons system had helped their country achieve the goal of becoming a full nuclear power, as the international community expressed outrage.
"We call on all nations to cut off all ties with North Korea," Washington's ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, told their fellow envoys.
Haley said Trump had called Chinese President Xi Jinping and urged them to "cut off the oil from North Korea.
"That would be a pivotal step in the world's effort to stop this international pariah," they said, issuing a stern warning to Kim.
Anytime you step on the brakes, the generator collects power that it stores in an on-board battery. A sensor in the wheel's hub can tell when your ride becomes strenuous, like when you're heading uphill. The sensor then triggers an electric motor that boosts your forward pedaling power. The next time you hit the brakes the cycle starts all over.
The innovation slingers from MIT Senseable City Lab have shown up at the Copenhagen Conference, and they've brought an idea with them that's actually worth talking about. The Copenhagen Wheel – named not just for the city of its unveiling but also for Copenhagen's role in a biking renaissance over the past several years – employs regenerative braking, an electric motor and even a Bluetooth connection to your iPhone for real-time data display.
But this next-gen bike doesn't stop at regenerative braking and electric helper motors. A Bluetooth connection in the wheel can speak to an iPhone that fits snugly into the mount on your handlebars. From there it feeds you all kinds of information through an app, including map and traffic info, heightened pollution alerts, speed, distance, fitness data, etc.
The app then lets you share your data with friends through social networks, helping you keep track of your friends throughout the city. It also allows riders to anonymously share urban and environmental data collected by sensors in the wheel with other riders around the city, creating a centralized information hub that's constantly fed real time info by bikers spread across the landscape. It even lets you rack up "green miles" as you travel about, a system not unlike a frequent-flyer program that rewards you for logging time on your bike rather than a car, bus or train.
All of the sensors, instrumentation, batteries and motor are packed in the Copenhagen Wheel itself (which is actually just the hub), and a spoking method devised by the team allows the hub to mount on any bicycle rim, though there's no mention of how much weight it adds to your ride. The Copenhagen Wheel should hit the market within a year, retailing for between $500 and $1,000.

Immigration minister shares awkward open mic moment with PM after Pacific islands fail to convince Australia to aim for a global warming target of 1.5 degrees
The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has shared an awkward open mic moment with the prime minister, Tony Abbott, where they appear to joke about rising sea levels in the Pacific.
Abbott and Dutton were discussing the recent Pacific Islands Forum in Papua New Guinea before a community roundtable at parliament house in Canberra on the resettlement of Syrian refugees. Television cameras had been invited to cover the opening statements of the roundtable.
Pacific island leaders fail to shift Australia and NZ on climate target Read more
The ministers noted that the roundtable attendees were running late, which Dutton labelled “Cape York time”.
Abbott said that meetings in Port Moresby did not run to schedule, either. To which the immigration minister replied: “Time doesn't mean anything when you're, you know, about to have water lapping at your door.”
The social services minister, Scott Morrison, who was also in attendance, then pointed out that there was a boom mic – an extendable microphone used to capture sound at a distance – above the ministers.
Pacific leaders voice frustration over Australia's position on climate change Read more
Dutton refused to be drawn on the nature of the conversation, when asked about it at a later press conference. “I had a private conversation with the prime minister. I don't intend to comment,” they told reporters.
Leaders of neighbouring Pacific nations had put pressure on Australia and New Zealand to do more to stop climate change. The leaders wanted Abbott and their Kiwi counterpart, John Key, to adhere to a limit of a 1.5 degrees celsius temperature increase.
The president of Kiribati, Anote Tong, said stopping climate change was “a matter of survival” for several low-lying Pacific island nations.
Pacific island environmentalists are calling for Dutton's head. “We request that minister Dutton resigns and that Tony Abbott issues an official apology to all Pacific islanders. We also hope that Australia will offer proper support for and recognition of the impacts that your climate inaction is having upon our culture and our livelihoods,” Koreti Tiumalu, Pacific coordinator of environmental group 350.org, said.
A joint statement issued by the shadow foreign minister, Tanya Plibersek, and their shadow parliamentary secretary, Matt Thistlethwaite, said. “For many in the Pacific islands rising sea levels are having profound effects on their lives, it is destroying crops, and threatening their homes and their very existence.
“Their plight is desperate and all this prime minister can do is laugh about it. Our Pacific island neighbours deserve an apology from Mr Abbott. Their future isn't a joke, this government is.”
Larissa Waters, deputy leader of the Greens, said: “What else are these clowns saying when the microphones are off? Imagine what cabinet meetings must be like.
“What we've seen today is raw contempt for the survival and safety of our Pacific island neighbours and our own coastal communities. We're talking about peoples' lives, and this government is laughing.
“It's a huge diplomatic blunder that will enrage our Pacific island neighbours, who have been calling on Australia to save their homes. What an insult for them to now hear the Australian prime minister laughing at the prospect of their homes going underwater.”
Helen Szoke, the chief executive of Oxfam, said: “As I saw recently with my own eyes in Kiribati, rising seas are a real and present threat to Pacific communities and already a source of immense hardship and anxiety. It beggars belief that minister Dutton and prime minister Abbott would see this as something to joke about.”
Last week two prisoners made a daring escape from a Greek prison by helicopter - their second airborne jailbreak. Convicted drug trafficker David McMillan, who spent two years plotting their escape from a Bangkok jail in 1996, told the BBC how much planning this kind of operation takes. I had been planning [my escape] from the moment four police officer came into a travel agency and arrested me in Chinatown, in Bangkok. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. As soon as I actually got to the prison about a week later I started looking at bars and walls and electric fences and I began looking for the best place to be. I went to building six simply because it had the thinnest bars in the windows... There were not a lot of prison guards per prisoner. Probably one prison guard to 120 prisoners. So it was really run by the trustees, who had their own little uniforms with epaulettes and aviators' wings and things like that. The entire essence of [the escape] was secrecy. No-one in there was capable of keeping a secret I would say... Planning is everything The first thing to do was to get what you could call a private cell. Most of the cells would be the size of a family garage and had 25 people in them, often sleeping like sardines packed into a tin, literally. FROM THE BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.
More from BBC World Service And if they had chains on, which everybody did, there would be the rattling of the chains, lights would be left on all night. I paid for a light switch which was another little luxury. It sounds like I was doing a lot of paying, I mean I had an office, a cook and a cleaner and that kind of thing, but it's not an awful lot of money - for £500 a month ($708) a person could live well. But we have to bear in mind that most of the people in there were abandoned people. People who'd lost hope in a lot of their lives and had very few friends left. Most people got excited about the prospect [of escape], of course, but quite soon realised, 'hang on a minute, what am I doing here?' They remembered very quickly the five inmates who'd tried and failed. They'd got as far as the outside wall. They were all put in the punishment cell, which was really a tin box the size of a small coat locker, and dragged out every day in elephant chains and slowly beaten to death. Four of those five died. I knew that here were 12,000 people absolutely lost in this world, and sentenced to a life of pretty much misery, and I thought, if nothing else I have to do it
I started at midnight with hacksaw blades that had been sent over in a care parcel, carefully hidden, so I took those out and began working on the bars. In fact only one bar was cut, and only partially at that. So my Swedish friend, they were built like a Viking, they had to stretch the thing out, as I squeezed through, oiled up, wearing nothing but my underwear and a pair of trainers.
Final stretch I just got outside, and then I used a plank to get out and across the yard. It was a bookcase, in fact everything in the room had been built to assist the escape. Furniture turned into stepladders and shower curtains disassembled into long bits of rope. I had six walls to go over. I assembled a ladder by breaking into a factory, and taking down some long bamboo pole and then I began the arduous haul over a number of these walls. It was most eerie, I knew where all the guards were, they generally slept at night, but they could wander around, and in fact one did. I had to hide in the shadows while that was going on. I had a few tricks to deal with that. I was so exhausted by about 0330-0400 in the morning, that I didn't really feel anything, except wanting to keep going. And I think that it was only that final thought as I looked around me, I knew that here were 12,000 people absolutely lost in this world, and sentenced to a life of pretty much misery, and I thought, if nothing else I have to do it. I went across the road and looked back for a few minutes at this huge prison from an angle I'd only seen from that prison van
As I got to the very top wall where the electric fence was, and dawn was creeping up, that soft orange glow was coming through. That meant that I was late. But I was tangibly outside. [It was] a feeling I guess I haven't had since I was a child when you wake up and you know that there's something good in the world. And then I more or less slid down the piece of rope I had. Burning my hands, I lost a bit of skin, but I was on the ground, I was outside. And I went across the road and looked back for a few minutes at this huge prison from an angle I'd only seen from that prison van where a couple of hundred people had been squashed inside wearing the chains and prison uniform, and took a taxi.

In just over a months time the 2017 Game Developer Conference (GDC) will be taking place in San Francisco as well as its sister event, the Virtual Reality Developers Conference (VRDC). The event is one of the biggest in the gaming calendar, with plenty of announcements usually taking place – last year for example the PlayStation VR price and release date were revealed. As it is a conference there will be plenty of talks being held, one of which will be from Home Box Office (HBO) discussing virtual reality (VR) project WestWorld: A Delos Experience.
Taking to the stage will be HBO creative lead, Colin Foran, in a session called WestworldVR: Combining Linear and Interactive Content to Tell Character Centric Stories. He'll be covering the general production and solving the issues around transforming traditional linear content into an immersive experience.
The official description for the session notes: “Over the last two years, an internal team within HBO has worked closely with showrunners to prototype storytelling experiences using compelling new technologies. The result, “WestWorld: A Delos Experience” is a room-scale VR installation that tells a coherent, character centric story using several new technologies. Combining realtime rendering, 360 video, interactive props and a physical set buildout staffed with actors, the piece represents a strong statement of intent to embrace new storytelling methods.”
Innistrad Block Constructed was recently dramatically altered with the banning of Intangible Virtue and Lingering Souls, which were just too oppressive for the format to handle. Before the banning, the major decks in Block were W/B/g tokens (splashing for Gavony Township and Garruk Relentless) and R/W/b tokens (splashing for Lingering Souls), which forced out basically any other strategy—other decks were just not able to keep up with the card advantage created by Lingering Souls and the damage output Intangible Virtue could provide.
The post-ban format is still defined by two cards, but rather than being the two defining elements of a single strategy, these two cards lie on the opposite end of the spectrum from one another: Hellrider and Huntmaster of the Fells. Hellrider is the MVP of the new hyper-aggressive R/W tokens strategy and it can essentially be seen as making up for the lost Intangible Virtue, whereas Huntmaster is used by the controlling strategies of the format, most notably Jund (B/R/G) and R/U/G. The post-ban format is probably still not mature, but this overview of the format will provide a snapshot of the format as it is right now on Magic Online.
The Block Metagame
Block right now is not a particularly diverse format mostly because of cost. A play set of Huntmasters is around 100 tickets, making the decks that rely on them much more expensive than the Hellrider deck, which is a leading cause for R/W to be almost half the field. Another reason for R/W's popularity is that it's relatively easy to play (attack, then cast Brimstone Volley and/or Devil's Play), making the format much more accessible than Standard, where the learning curve is high due to having to either play Delver or play against Delver.
The premier deck of the format is once again a white-based agro deck. The deck seeks to play a number of low-drop creatures and maximize the damage dealt during the early turns and close out the game with Hellrider, Rally the Peasants, and/or the eight burn spells. The deck has an incredible amount of reach thanks to Brimstone Volley's morbid and has the most powerful nut draw in the format with turn-one Champion of the Parish, turn-two Gather the Townsfolk, turn-three Fiend Hunter (if the opponent has a threat) or turn-three Midnight Haunting, and turn-four Hellrider (which is lethal).
The deck is relatively simple to play and your goal is to maximize early damage with creatures in order to enter the (as PV calls it) burn phase and quickly close the game out. The deck has no long-term game plan, and it becomes significantly weaker as the game goes on. More recent versions of the deck have adapted to do better in the mirror by playing cards such as Stromkirk Noble.
The most-played Huntmaster deck of the format, Block Jund is as quintessentially midrange as you can get. The deck plays undercosted removal (Geistflame is especially good against the R/W decks) to make it past the early stages of the game where its threats can swing the tide. Jund also plays the same eight burn spells as R/W, but they are used mostly as removal to survive the early game rather than as a way to close out the match.
Jund is also not particularly hard to play—all of its cards grant incremental advantage that eventually adds up to take the game. Huntmaster is the most powerful card in the deck, and it is hard for other decks to catch up if it transforms even once.
The Block R/G agro deck is a port of the Standard version. The deck is significantly slower than the R/W aggro deck, but it theoretically has a higher quality of creatures. However, this deck is awful (as you'll see in the results section below), and you should just not play it. If you have a set of Huntmasters, just play Jund or R/U/G.
This deck is fun, cheap, and surprisingly good. There's not very much to say about it, but your goal is to maximize the number of creatures in your graveyard, play one of your very undercosted fatties, and win with them. The deck even has Gnawed to the Bone in order to ensure that it can make up for all the time it takes to put cards into the graveyard.
My favorite deck to play in the format, R/U/G has the most diverse threat selection as well as the best long-game plan thanks to Snapcaster Mage. It also has the unique ability to play Ranger's Guile in order to protect Daybreak Ranger or Huntmaster and increase the probability that they transform, which is a major plus—one transformed Werewolf can essentially take over the game. Post-sideboard, it is able to play a much more controlling role against the other Huntmaster decks (as their actual threat density is so low). Unfortunately, the deck is also the most expensive deck in the format, so that probably limits the ability of people new to Magic Online to play it.
From my experience with the deck, I have been unimpressed with the Thought Scours, and I have replaced them with Faithless Lootings, although removing the ability to play Snapcaster Mage as a cantrip does come at a cost.
Have you ever just wanted to tell your opponent to go fuck himself? I f so, this is the deck for you. The deck is a combination of the most efficient and hard-to-answer creatures in the format combined with enchantments that speed up the clock. If you've never been on the controlling end of a Stromkirk Noble with a Spectral Flight on it, it's just as good as it sounds. The deck has some issues with Geistflame, but it's a solid deck overall. If you don't own a set of Huntmasters, this is the best deck to play, and if you don't enjoy playing this style of deck, you should play Dredge instead.
Results
I recorded the results of five Daily Events (by recording the result of every match—I have no life after all), and the results are below. As you can see, R/U/G is the best-performing deck overall, and Stalker is the best-performing non-Huntmaster deck. (And your winnings can let you save up for Huntmasters!)

Name one British thrash metal act from the Golden Age of Thrash that kicks ass and makes newcomers Evile look like prepubescent chipmunks. Do it. Xentrix? Cerebral Fix? Hellbastard? No, no, and no. OK, we're way off. The Brits had their share of awesome. Sabbat, Onslaught, Lawnmower Deth, Sacrilege, Seventh Angel, and Acid Reign were all part of England's attempt to top Americans and Germans. Luckily, metalheads the world over didn't have to pick countries over bands. They just liked what they liked. And that included Xentrix, Cerebral Fix, and the unsightly stylings of Hellbastard.
For Evile, however, they're part of the new vanguard of thrashers. Informed by history but not a slave to it, the Yorkshire-based act have not just moved units since their 2007 debut, Enter the Grave, but transformed kids with bad musical taste into discerning heshers, who are bound to do what metalheads have done since like, uh, 1980. They've gone on to heavier things. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Evile's shown no signs of weakening or slowing down. The group's new album, Skull, is every bit as intense as anything—young or old—on the market. How do we know? We've heard it. And so shall you, at least eight of nine tracks.
So, it's with great pleasure (of the flesh) that we present Evile ripper “Underworld.”
** Evile's new album, Skull, is out May 27th on Earache/Century Media Records. It's available HERE. Or, you can skate and go home, which isn't very fun 'cause the Zorlac Double Cut deck you got from the kid down the street has a tailbone and a pair of Z-Rollers.

Phil Spencer, Microsoft's Xbox chief. Matt Weinberger Microsoft's Xbox boss admitted "we've lost our way" on PC gaming, but the company wants another chance.
At the Game Developers Conference on Wednesday, Phil Spencer took the stage and reaffirmed that the company sees Windows 10 as the company's big chance to get back its shine and its market leadership.
They also committed to building games for HoloLens, the futuristic augmented reality goggles that Microsoft promised would be out in the Windows 10 time frame.
"We see this as a full Windows 10 device," Spencer said.
Microsoft also announced it was giving game makers their first look at a toolkit for integrating Xbox Live into Windows 10 games.
PC gaming used to be synonymous with Windows — games were played on Windows, using the DirectX APIs for graphics, and often controlled with Microsoft mice, keyboard, and hardware.
Then, 15 years ago Microsoft rolled out the first Xbox and everything changed: Suddenly, all of Microsoft's video gaming focus was on the new console. The Xbox franchise, along with games like Halo, became a decent business for the company. But in the meantime, competitors overtook the PC gaming market. For instance, Valve's Steam platform captured the hearts of gamers with a successful app store and integrated social networking features.
Games for Windows Live, an early attempt by Microsoft to bring the social features (and copy-protection against piracy) of Xbox Live to the PC, was buggy, unreliable, and a laughing stock among people who play video games.
Spencer specifically called out the existing Windows 8 App Store, which they acknowledged wasn't a huge revenue driver for any of the developers there, including Microsoft itself.
The way forward, then, is in changing how Microsoft thinks about its customers: They're not people who play games on Windows PCs, or tablets, or consoles. They're customers of the Xbox Live service. That means that games can and should work across multiple devices, with the same friends list and the same high scores, and people should be able to play each other no matter what device they're on.
"Xbox" no longer means consoles, said Spencer. It means "gaming with Microsoft."
As for HoloLens, Spencer says that it's a natural extension of Microsoft's new philosophy towards Windows 10, and will receive the same level of support and multi-platform cohesion.
The takeaway for the developers at the conference: They can reach a broader audience (and make more money) without having to go through the hassle of developing for multiple screen sizes and operating systems. After all, every single Windows 10 device is going to have the built-in Xbox app.
Since a lineup-sized portion of the FanGraphs team will be in New York City for Sabermetrics Day at the Staten Island Yankees, we thought it would make sense also to run a meetup. Just another chance to come and hang out and talk baseball, except this one with (perhaps, if you're into that sort of thing) a craft beverage in your hand.
So come visit on Saturday, June 18th, at Rattle N Hum West, from 7 to 10 pm. We'll have free appetizers for everyone, baseball on the screens, and time to talk with some of your favorite writers, FanGraphs or not. It's an all-ages event.
Details below.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - A British vote to leave the European Union would give a boost to separatist and nationalistic forces across the bloc, Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said on Friday.

Sobotka also told the Reuters Eastern European Investment Summit that any easing of EU sanctions on Russia, introduced over Moscow's role in the conflict in Ukraine, must be tied to implementation of a peace agreement.
Joining a chorus of European leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, the Czech prime minister said the EU had done what it could to accommodate Britain's wishes for special arrangements.
A vote to exit “would be a signal for separatists and also a certain signal for radical nationalists who have a program of breaking up the EU,” Sobotka said.
Opinion polls suggest Britons are almost equally split on whether to vote to leave the EU on June 23.
“I wish for Britain staying in the union and I think we as Europe have done the maximum for it by being able to agree and accept some demands of Great Britain,” Sobotka said.
European and British leaders agreed in February on measures giving Britain a special status in the bloc, aiming to avoid the uncertain repercussions of a vote to leave.
Sobotka said a Brexit vote could encourage breakaway groups in places such as Catalonia, which has long sought independence from Spain.
But they did not see a British exit adding to already widespread grumbling about the EU in central Europe, where some governments resisted pressure from Brussels to take in people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.
“I don't think there will be another wave in central Europe, here refugees have played a role and handed populists and nationalists a relatively hefty amount of ammunition,” they said.
RUSSIA SANCTIONS TIED TO MINSK AGREEMENT
The EU must also decide whether to extend sanctions against Russia, adopted after the annexation of Crimea, which expire in July.
Sobotka said sanctions should only be lifted hand-in-hand with progress in meeting the Minsk peace agreement, a similar stance to that taken by Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski at the Reuters summit.
“Apart from a swap of prisoners, which is positive and encouraging, I do not see any other significant progress,” Sobotka said.
“That can of course change in several months and I would be glad if it changed. However Europe should respect some principles, and if we connected the economic sanctions with the Minsk agreements, we should keep that connection.”
The EU is trying to preserve unity on sanctions, which have been questioned by Hungary, Greece and Italy. An adviser to German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday it was “far to early” to discuss an easing of the sanctions.
