Nigeria's hope of having a new national carrier anytime soon may be dashed as LEADERSHIP Weekend investigations have shown that internal scuffle between the planning team is threatening the whole process.
It was gathered that there is no clear-cut decision on whether or not to establish a national carrier at the moment.
Findings show that since last year, the minister of state for aviation had always said the “national carrier will commence soon,” however, some experts' projections show that the commencement of the national carrier will take time since there are no aircraft and no personnel on ground for the commencement of the national carrier.
LEADERSHIP Weekend reports that while addressing journalists in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, recently, the minister of state for aviation, Hadi Sirika, had said Nigeria would soon have a privately-owned national carrier.
Sirika spoke at the sidelines of the 30th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union (AU).
He said the government would provide an “enabling environment and support”, and would take advantage of the Single Air Transport Market launched by the African Union.
He said apart from Nigerian entrepreneurs, the African Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank and the Chinese Exim Bank, as well as countries like Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, Morocco, Egypt, Rwanda, Namibia and Niger Republic, would participate in the initiative.
“We are very close to having a national carrier at the moment. We are at the stage of transaction services. We have affiliations, which will be dealt with. I hope, within this week, you will hear from me on where we are. It will be soon,” he said.
Sirika added that he had been holding discussions with several bodies regarding the establishment of a national carrier for Nigeria and that once everything is concluded “the prices of tickets and the efficiency of service will be much better”.
However, while speaking with LEADERSHIP Weekend, a worker at the ministry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said in as much as there are plans to kick-start the national carrier, internal scuffle on the basis of appointment is threatening to delay the project.
According to our source, after appointing a foreign transaction adviser, the Nigeria government also appointed Nigerian team to work with him.
This appointment, our source noted, did not go down well with the foreign adviser, who insisted on appointing his team from Nigeria by himself and threatened to withdraw his services if government did not yield to his demand.
Our source further noted that this situation stalled all plans for the national carrier for now, and except one side agrees to shift ground, plans for a national carrier coming into being soon are under threat.
LEADERSHIP Weekend recalls that this was what played out in January 2017 when the minister promised that Nigeria will have a viable national airline before the end of 2017.
Sirika said the project would be private-sector driven and that the federal government may only own three percent of the airline, a promise yet to be fulfilled.
On the aircraft proposed, the federal government had said that two major internationally renowned aircraft manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing, had indicated interest in Nigeria's national carrier.
Sirika explained that the manufacturers had expressed willingness to discuss their interest with the government.
In a tweet on his Twitter handle, @hadisirika, the minister said, “Boeing said they can't wait to discuss their proposal for the Nigerian national carrier).”
In another tweet, he stated, “Airbus signified interest in our national carrier and our MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul). Will discuss further during the upcoming ICAO forum.”
Meanwhile, as the plan to commence a national carrier in the country by the federal government gathers momentum, stakeholders in the nation's aviation sector have urged the authorities to thread with caution so that the new plan would be successful at the end of the day.
Foremost aviator and president of Aviation Safety Roundtable Initiative (ASRTI) , Mr Gbenga Olowo, has equally prescribed necessary and sufficient conditions for efficient and reliable flag carriers which, he advised, may not necessarily be named national carrier.
In a chat with LEADERSHIP Weekend yesterday, Olowo stated that a sizeable aircraft fleet that would guarantee undisrupted schedule and maintenance of airport slot was required by Nigeria, along with a minimum fleet of 20 at a growth rate of five per annum in the first five years.
Olowo pointed out that South African Airways, a much smaller country, parades a fleet of 52 aircraft and warned that if the authorities were not ready to provide the needful, the carrier should not commence International operations in order not disgrace the flag.
The aviation expert stated that for the proposal to work effectively, there is also urgent need for good liquidity that would guarantee payment of bills when due.
He advocated membership of IATA, Global Distribution System and so on that would shore up credibility and international best practices.
According to him, also important to the success of the flag carrier is the deployment of technology to save cost, prevent wastages and enhance efficient service delivery all the time.
Speaking on the national carrier, a member of the national carrier committee and former president of the National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE), Comrade Isaac Balami, said that government's intention of running a privately owned national carrier was a welcome development.
Balami disclosed that his committee looked at three or four different reports in the past to come up with new recommendations.
He said, “The government doesn't need to have a maximum of 10 percent or even five percent in it. However, government presence is very important because it is key to the success of the national carrier. To achieve this one, an important government official such as the minister of aviation or a director in the aviation agencies should be made to represent the federal government on the board of the national carrier.”
The committee member also pointed out that for a successful national carrier, care should be taken to ensure adequate provision of support services like aviation fuel, training, world-class catering services, aircraft maintenance and others.
Bulama said his committee was “looking at adopting the Singapore Airline (model) because it is the world's most profitable airline in the world.
“It is an airline that makes over $1 million net profit daily. We also studied Qantas Airline which is the world's safest airline”.
He, however, expressed worry that with the harsh operating environment in Nigeria, if an airline is given 20 brand-new aircraft with $10 million capital, there is likelihood that the airline could collapse 10 years after just like Arik and others.
But the secretary-general of the Association of Nigerian Aviation Professionals (ANAP), Comrade Abdul Rasaq Saidu, does not see any seriousness on the part of the government in terms of establishing the national carrier.
According to Saidu, if the government was serious about the establishment of a national carrier, the issue would have been at the front burner during the last Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting instead of airport concessioning.
“President Buhari wants the national carrier but it looks as if the aviation ministry is not pushing hard enough. At the moment, there is no clear-cut decision on the issue because it was not mentioned in the last FEC meeting. I don't think they are serious with the national carrier. I have not seen anything visible to show they are serious”, he said.
Before now, members of Aviation Safety Roundtable Initiative (ASRTI) had urged the federal government to initiate a new national carrier plan that is 100 per cent private sector-driven and funded. According to them, having such a project premised on government's funding, like the Nigerian Airways of old, is a recipe for another failure.
ASRTI, which is the think-tank group of the industry, aligns with the government's initiative to revive the national carrier on the condition that it is independent of bureaucracy and unresolved issues of the defunct Nigerian Airways.
LEADERSHIP Weekend recalls that the current administration last year revealed a master plan for aviation, with priority given to airport concessioning and revival of national carrier among others.
Earlier this week, aviation minister, Hadi Sirika, had re-emphasised that Nigeria would get a national carrier soon in order to take full advantage of the newly launched single African air transport market.
Speaking on the sidelines of the African Union Summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, following the launch of the new regional aviation initiative, the minister said that the national carrier would be private sector driven.
But this is not the first time the minister would be making such promises.
Early last year, Sirika had equally said that federal government would ensure that the establishment of a national carrier takes place before the end of 2017.
And to speed up the national carrier establishment, the government had few years ago appointed advisers to help it set up a national airline and develop its aviation infrastructure – currently seen as a barrier to economic growth – to create a hub for West Africa.
Sirika said a group of six firms including German carrier Lufthansa would advise the government on setting up an airline, an aviation leasing company and a maintenance hanger, and on creating concessions to run the country's airports.
A cabinet meeting chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo had approved N1.52 billion ($4.99 million) of funding for the project, he added.
Stakeholders say they hope the government matches word with action this time around.
The Governor of Osun State ‎Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola has urged civil service in Nigeria to strive and be more productive and efficient in carrying out their duties.
Aregbesola who stated this at the Public Servants Award Presentation Ceremony organized to honour outstanding civil and public servants in the state honoured 170 workers in the state for being productive, efficient and diligent to duty.
Aregbesola attributed some of the challenges facing the country to lack of productivity, noting that a country's ability to develop its economy depends on how efficient and productive its workforce can be.
He lamented low productivity of workers in the country particularly in the civil and public services which according to him has affected all, particularly the citizen's national daily lives.
Aregbesola called on Nigerians, especially the ‎bureaucrats to rise to the challenge by prioritizing efficiency, productivity and competence in all they do, saying the success of a nation lies in its productivity capacity.
He said, “it is unfortunate that as big as we are, and as famous as we are as a nation, we still lack the required productivity and efficiency to succeed as a country.
“Our level of productivity as a people in Nigeria is abysmally low just as the menace has had negative impact on our economy as a nation. We have the resources but we are not productive.
“A country's ability to develop its economy is dependent on how efficient and productive its workforce can be, so our productivity as a people in Nigeria is very low and this is affecting us.
“And very unfortunately our environment typifies the low level of our productivity and we have a lot to do to improve it.”
The governor added that his drive to improve the economy of the state is not about himself, but rather because of the masses, saying the public servants are in the best position to support his administration at making life better for the people.

The most expensive homes sold in North Lincolnshire in 2017 can now be revealed.
Data from the Land Registry shows the highest priced property sold in our area during the year was a detached house on Godnow Bridge in Crowle, which went for £627,500.
The five most expensive homes sold in the region across the year are as follows:
Willow Brook Farm, Godnow Bridge, Crowle, which is a detached house, sold for £627,500 on November 6
(Image: Google Maps)
Waterville, Cliff Road, South Ferriby, which is a detached house, sold for £600,000 on August 25
Fairfield, Gravel Pit Lane, Yaddlethorpe, which is a detached house, sold for £585,000 on August 4
Windsor, 26 Church Street, Elsham, which is a detached house, sold for £520,000 on October 13
Craigellachie, Vicarage Gardens, Scunthorpe, which is a detached house, sold for £495,000 on October 30
According to the Land Registry, 850,282 residential sales have been registered across England and Wales in 2017, down 3 per cent from the 877,307 registered at this point last year for 2016.
There were 15,885 sales at £1 million or more, up from 14,999 in 2016. This included 2,974 sales at £2 million or more, down from 3,039 a year before. There were 369 sales at £5 million or more and 77 at £10 million or more.
The most expensive property sold in 2017 was Apartment 1101 in the Knightsbridge Apartments at 199 Knightsbridge in Westminster, with the flat going for £90 million in April.
The most expensive residential sale taking place in December 2017 was of a terraced property in the City of Westminster for £10,075,000.
The cheapest residential sale in December 2017 was of a terraced property in Llanelli for £15,000.
The Land Registry lists the price paid for every property bought at market value. The data also includes sales under a power of sale/repossessions, buy-to-lets (where they can be identified by a mortgage) and transfers to non-private individuals. It may take several weeks for sales to be registered after completion so some sales from later in 2017 may not be listed yet.
"Cut! Paper Play in Contemporary Photography," a delightful teaser of a show at the Getty Museum, divides neatly into two complementary halves.
Three of the six artists in the show photograph collages or constructions they've made out of paper. Their works present as straight pictures, even if they've been composed through circuitous means.
The other three artists start with more or less conventional pictures and then set to dismantle the veracity and transparency that photography implicitly carries.
Curator Virginia Heckert gives the show a bit of historical ballast by including some precursors from the museum's collection: a luscious, shadowy print by Francis Bruguière and another by Manuel Álvarez Bravo, whose curled sheet could easily pass as a model of a Frank Gehry bandshell.
The Bravo plays nicely with a 2012 triptych by Thomas Demand. He so tightly frames details of the creased walls and angled edges of a John Lautner architectural model that scale and context drop away nearly entirely, leaving fields of pure color and texture.

Each artist in the show is represented by just a few pieces, often from different bodies of work. Variety overrides depth, but the disparate bites amount to a satisfying meal.
In each of his three large prints, Matt Lipps visualizes a new physical or intellectual space through a montage of reproductions culled from reference books. He interjects an image of the great American West smack into the middle of a family home in one provocative piece; in another, he lines the shelves of an imagined archive with visual quotations from canonized photographers.

The most engrossing piece in this first section is Daniel Gordon's "Clementines" (2011), a tabletop still life with a charismatically funky sense of space. Gordon fills a crumpled paper basket with the fruit of his hands, scissors and internet searches. He sets these little orbs with patchwork photographic skins against a background that poses multiple-choice options for defining place. This glorious ode to the unsettled nature of two-dimensional representation is what Cezanne might have made, had he used Photoshop.

Blades come out more flagrantly in the second part of the show.
In the shimmering beauty "Mountain XXIX" (2017), Christopher Russell scrapes and nicks the surface of a blurred, overexposed photograph to draw, in the underlying white of the photo paper, a geometric hallucination more viscerally persuasive than the vague landscape it hovers within.
Soo Kim slices through and layers multiple photographs of buildings in Reykjavik in a piece from 2007, cutting out solid walls and temporally unwinding the structures back to their framed, incomplete state: the cityscape as impossible, wondrous lattice.
Ironically, the most overtly sculptural works here, Christiane Feser's prints with cutout loops and folded flaps, feel the thinnest. They reduce photography's innate illusionism to fun but facile one-liners.
As a show about process, and the performative potential of photography, "Cut!" does its job with a light touch and an open spirit. Depending on where you enter the Getty's Center for Photographs, the show makes for either an enjoyable prelude or refreshing postscript to "Paper Promises," the historically rich, more sober, subject-driven neighboring exhibition of early American photographs.
J. Paul Getty Museum, Getty Center, 1200 N. Sepulveda Blvd., L.A. Through May 27; closed Mondays. (310) 440-7300, www.getty.edu

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Want the world's best, up-close view of a rocket launch without being right there at the pad?
For the first time, cameras will provide live 360-degree video of a rocket heading toward space.
NASA will provide the 360 stream Tuesday as an unmanned Atlas rocket blasts off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, with a capsule full of space station supplies. The stream will begin 10 minutes before the scheduled 11:11 a.m. liftoff and continue until the rocket is out of sight.
WATCH: NASA: One of Saturn's moons supports life
The four fisheye-lens cameras are located at the periphery of the pad, about 300 feet (100 meters) from the rocket. A computer in a blast-proof box will stitch together the images for a full, in-the-round view. There will be about a minute lag time.
It will be shown on NASA's YouTube channel.

“It's great, I mean, to be able to get in there and experience that 360-degree view,” said Vern Thorp, a program manager for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. Combining that with virtual reality goggles, “it really gives you a new perspective that we've never been able to do before,” he said at a Monday news conference.
United Launch Alliance has released 360-degree video of two previous launches, but later — not live.

Orbital ATK, one of NASA's main delivery services for the International Space Station, opted to use an Atlas V for this supply run from Cape Canaveral versus its own smaller, Virginia-based Antares rocket in order to haul up more items. The supply ship is known as the Cygnus after the swan constellation, and in this case has been named the S.S. John Glenn.
Glenn became the first American to orbit the world in 1962 — launching on an Atlas rocket — and the oldest person to fly in space in 1998 aboard the shuttle Discovery. He died at age 95 in December. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery earlier this month.
“It's an honor to launch the spacecraft which has been named in memory of John Glenn,” Thorp told reporters. Given that Glenn flew on an Atlas rocket and Tuesday's rocket is an Atlas, “I feel like we're bridging history.”

After you're done picking up your outfits for the wedding season ahead, shopping for accessories needs to be next mission to you need to tick off your checklist. Whether you're the bride or a part of the bridal crew, finding the right pair of shoes for each ceremony is crucial. Between running errands for your best mate who is getting married and endless nights of dancing, weddings can take a toll on your feet, especially if your festive footwear is the kind that will leave you with blisters or worse, a twisted ankle.
The smart way to survive a wedding knows when to alternate between towering stilettos, block heels and flats. If you're hesitant about wearing strappy sandals and will have to be on your feet for longer than four hours, it's best to avoid them because the day is only going to end in discomfort. For smaller events like the mehendi or haldi ceremony, go traditional with a pair of embroidered juttis. If you don't have much of a role to play during the pheras, give your soles some time to recover in a pair of dressy slides. Save the stilettos for the reception, and opt for chunky heels to dance at the sangeet.
Given that most wedding wear is bound to be embellished or bear a touch of metallic hues, avoid recycling evening shoes from your party wardrobe for the occasion. A pair of shoes in gold and one in silver are a must-have in your arsenal. You can also look at rose gold, pale pinks and glitter shoes for the wedding season. If you really want to take things up a notch and have your Cinderella moment, go for a pair of shocking pink satin slides or something with pearl detailing.
From sensible block heels to dangerously tall strappy ones, scroll through our edit of must-have shoes for the wedding season.

Despite the fact that technology can today help people to work from anywhere, nearly half the people in India want more "mobile-free" time to devote to their friends and family, showed results of a survey.
Nearly one-third of the respondents in India reported spending more time at work in the last two years with 38 percent of them attributing technology as the cause, showed the findings of the "Live Life" survey by American Express and research firm Morning Consult.
There is growing interconnectedness around the world, in both personal and work life as well as real and virtual interactions, the study said.
"The 'Live Life' survey highlights the shift from work-life balance to work-life integration," said Manoj Adlakha, CEO, American Express Banking, India.
For the study, Morning Consult, on behalf of American Express, conducted a series of surveys in eight markets— India, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Britain and the US.
In India, the firm interviewed around 2,000 respondents in an online survey conducted between 7 to 14 March, 2018. The findings showed that younger respondents were more likely than older respondents to want more mobile-free time.
Respondents from Telangana and Kerala reported the highest levels of integrated work and life in India, the study said.
More than 90 percent of the respondents in Tamil Nadu said personal relationships were of paramount importance as against 69 percent on an average.
Premier Doug Ford made it official Tuesday with his announcement that his government is scrapping Ontario's cap and trade program.
The debate about the environmental efficiency of cap and trade has become a hotly contested issue, with the pro and anti sides firmly entrenched in their positions, but what concerns many Ontario voters now is the financial cost of Ford's move.
READ MORE: Ontario Premier Doug Ford to officially wind down green programs funded by cap and trade
Some of the number crunchers have estimated that Ford's decision could cost Ontario about $420 million in federal transfer payments that were targeted for environmental programs.
Then there's the concern about companies that purchased permits under the cap and trade program.
It's estimated that the province, and that means you and me, could be on the hook for about $3 billion to refund those purchases.
Whether or not we believe that cap and trade or carbon taxes or whatever, actually improves the environment is a moot point; we should be concerned that the government is running up a huge bill to nix the programs.

Some critics compare this to the outrageous price tag for the McGuinty government's gas plant cancellation.
That may or may not be a fair comparison, but it does seem odd that a Ford government that promised a better deal for taxpayers, seems to be digging a deeper financial hole to get there.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's steel output is expected to rise by a record 10 percent during the next fiscal year starting on April 1, a government official said on Friday, driven by a budgeted increase in infrastructure spending in the world's third-largest producer of the alloy.
Indian steel production is expected to be around 103 million tonnes in the fiscal year to March, and rise by 10 percent in the 2018/19 fiscal year, said Steel Secretary Aruna Sharma.
“These are conservative estimates. Last year's budgetary allocation to infrastructure gave an impetus to domestic steel consumption by 5.7 percent. At least we hope we should touch 6 percent growth in consumption next year,” Sharma told Reuters.
India, which aims to nearly triple its production over the next decade, will see increased demand largely in housing, roads, construction of railway stations, and airports, Sharma said.
India's crude steel production rose to a record during the calendar year 2017, jumping 6 percent from a year ago to 101.23 million tonnes.
Sharma was cautious about the impact of possible trade measures by the United States.
On Thursday, U.S. steel companies and industry groups urged President Donald Trump to impose the measures to curb excess steel capacity and rising imports they say are undermining the domestic industry.
The U.S. is the world's biggest steel importer but India only exports 4 percent of their alloy there. However, Indian companies have been trying to raise high-end steel sales to U.S. buyers.
“We are not dumping,” said Sharma, the top civil servant in the steel ministry. “Even if the U.S. imposes duties, we will have to see how much it is and so we will wait and watch.”
Top Indian steel companies are also in talks with Canada's Teck Resources Ltd, the largest North American producer of coking coal, for long-term purchase agreements, Sharma said.
India, alongside top buyers China and Japan have been scouring new markets for the key raw material in steel making, after a powerful cyclone hit Australia last year leading to slower output and firmer prices.
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Strong airline profits and higher defence spending have boosted the outlook for aerospace firms gathering for next week's Singapore Airshow, but after a surge of activity in 2017 the event is expected to produce few big-ticket deals.
The biennial show, the largest in Asia, will bring together buyers and sellers against the backdrop of China's attempt to play a bigger role in a realigning global aerospace industry.
The Chinese push into the commercial jet and military drone markets comes amid regional insecurity in Southeast Asia over its rising power while the United States is retreating toward “America First” oriented policies.
China was looking to get a leg up in commercial jet technology through a deal with Bombardier Inc over the advanced C Series last year, but the Canadian company instead chose to partner with Airbus SE.
The Airbus-Boeing duopoly could be further solidified if Boeing and Brazil's Embraer SA agree to a tie-up that could involve their commercial and defence divisions.
China, with its narrow-body C919, is not the only country trying to carve out space in the tightly controlled commercial market. Russia's Irkut MC-21 and Japan's Mitsubishi Regional Jet are also seeking to become serious competitors, and will be represented at the airshow like their Chinese rival.
But all three projects have faced delays, and significant question marks remain over whether any will gain a solid order base outside their home markets.
The C919, which has received 785 orders to date, looks the strongest because of its backing by Chinese airlines and lessors, said DVB Bank head of aviation research Bert van Leeuwen.
“They have the market, the money and the ambitions,” he said of China.
FASTEST GROWING AVIATION MARKET
Manufacturers are targeting the Asia-Pacific region for product sales and services because it is the world's fastest growing aviation market.
Airbus and Boeing are sending the heads of their services divisions to Singapore as they look to increase their presence in the maintenance, repair and operations industry.
But on the sales side, a final push late last year by legendary Airbus commercial sales head John Leahy before he retired has pulled orders forward and is expected to result in a weak start to the year.
“I‘m not expecting much,” DVB Bank's van Leeuwen said of Singapore Airshow orders. “I wouldn't be disappointed if there are few orders or if the whole year in 2018 doesn't bring many orders because this is an industry where there is an eight-year backlog of production.”
The buzz around product launches - a big sales driver at airshows - is expected to be missing at the Singapore event as Boeing's keenly watched decision on introducing a potential new mid-market airplane is not expected until later in 2018.
BIG AIR FORCE BUDGETS
On the military side, Southeast Asian countries are bolstering their air forces amid insecurity over China's rise and its increasingly assertive stance in the South China Sea.
The Republic of Singapore Air Force, Southeast Asia's biggest spender and a potential future Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 customer, celebrates its 50th anniversary this year and will launch the festivities at the airshow.
North Korea's ballistic missile programme and potential internal instability in some Southeast Asian countries are also lifting budgets, although in other cases political events, such as an upcoming election in Malaysia, could push back buying decisions.
China's Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group will be displaying two versions of its Wing Loong reconnaissance and strike drones at the show in hopes of penetrating the Asian market. However, it may be too early for Chinese products to gain much traction at a time when the Trump administration is calling on military attaches and diplomats to boost U.S. arms sales.
The United States is, for the first time in years, sending its diplomat responsible for foreign military sales to the Singapore Airshow to promote U.S.-made weapons as part of a new “Buy American” initiative, a U.S. official said on Thursday.
“I think few countries are going to buy much from China,” said Richard Bitzinger, a senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.
“Partly it is a reliability thing and partly it is ‘if you really want to keep the United States engaged, you buy their weapons systems'. In a sense it is still the U.S.'s market to lose.”

Legendary rock guitarist Joe Walsh, WB6ACU, of the Eagles is featured in a just-released set of ARRL audio and video public service announcements promoting Amateur Radio. ARRL will provide the 30- and 60-second PSAs to Public Information Officers (PIOs) to share with their Section's television and radio stations. The ARRL Media and Public Relations Department also will provide these announcement files directly to interested television and radio outlets. The announcements are available for downloading from the ARRL website for members to use in promoting Amateur Radio at club meetings and public presentations, such as ARRL Field Day June 23 – 24 (PSAs specifically for ARRL Field Day also are available).
Walsh, who visited ARRL Headquarters last year for taping, wanted to deliver two main messages in his PSAs: get involved in Amateur Radio, and become a member of ARRL. The messages highlight the tremendous service that radio amateurs provide to communities, and convey how ARRL advocates on behalf of Amateur Radio on a wide range of legal and political issues.
An ARRL Life Member and long-time radio amateur, Walsh personally has been a strong supporter and advocate of ARRL and Amateur Radio, and his ham shack is just as impressive as his home recording studio. “I want to give back to the hobby that has given me so much enjoyment,” he said.
The setting for the PSAs was W1AW, which Walsh was especially eager to revisit. The occasion also offered him with an opportunity to see equipment he'd donated to W1AW years earlier. Walsh's past on-the-air forays on W1AW have always attracted enthusiastic pileups. While at W1AW, he spent some chatting with station manager Joe Carcia, NJ1Q, about the station's operations. Walsh is a well-known collector of vintage Amateur Radio equipment.
Creating the videos were Media and Public Relations Assistant Michelle Patnode, KC1JTA; freelance videographer/photographer Chris Zajac, and former Media and Public Relations Manager Sean Kutzko, KX9X, who also recorded a tag line for ARRL Audio News with Walsh.
Tips for getting audio PSAs on the air are available on the “Placing Audio PSAs” web page.
Chief says it comes at a good time for fire department
By Dave Fidlin
Correspondent
Village of Waterford officials recently signed off on a hefty expenditure that will bring the local fire and rescue department's vehicle fleet back up to full force.
The Village Board on July 24 gave the green light to go full steam ahead on purchasing a pumper tanker from Appleton-based Pierce Manufacturing Inc. The vehicle comes with a $689,755 price tag.
The board had previously approved the purchase of the pumper, but Village Administrator Rebecca Ewald said she wanted to bring the final purchase agreement to the board because of the size of the expenditure.
Fire Chief Rick Mueller said the purchase is coming at just the right time for Waterford's firefighters.
One of the department's fire engines was in the shop the first half of the summer, undergoing a list of repairs that are expected to cost between $20,000 and $30,000 to fully remedy.
“We're at bare bones right now in getting a fire engine out the door,” Mueller said at the July 24 meeting.

A $100 million bridge project along Interstate 84 and the $24.75 million Elmhurst Dam renovation could revive a 13-year-old plan to create a rail trail through the North Pocono area — even if it takes a while.
The North Pocono Rotary Club, Lackawanna River Corridor Association and Lackawanna Heritage Valley Authority spearheaded a feasibility study in 2004 to create the North Pocono Greenway Trail along 10-plus miles of conservation land Lackawanna County bought in 1980.
The corridor, once used as the Pennsylvania Coal Co. Gravity Railroad light track, runs along Roaring Brook, Elmhurst Reservoir and White Oak Run through Dunmore and Roaring Brook, Elmhurst, Madison and Jefferson townships.
The plan never came together because organizers couldn't line up finding, but a state Department of Transportation project to replace a massive pair of I-84 bridges in Dunmore west of the highway's Route 435 interchange could breathe new life into the plan.
PennDOT plans to rehabilitate an old railroad trestle so crews can get access to the bridges, and when the agency is done with it, the span could serve as a pedestrian walkway for the trail, said Kevin Atkins, the PennDOT project liaison engineer.
The cost of re-decking the old trestle and fixing other bad components is likely to be about $1 million, Atkins said.
Marc Gaughan, a Moscow borough councilman and member of the North Pocono Trails Association, described fixing the old trestle as one of the project's most expensive barriers and saw the greenway plan as a key component of a regional interconnected trail network.
In a letter to the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, county commissioners described the PennDOT project as indirectly creating more momentum for the greenway idea.
“The county intends on using costs associated with the improvements to the rail trestle and approach as leverage for additional funding for development of a large portion of the remaining sections of the trail,” commissioners wrote.
The idea gets another boost from Pennsylvania American Water's Elmhurst Dam project because the utility had to create an access road as part of the project that will connect to the trail when the rehabilitation is finished, utility spokeswoman Susan Turcmanovich said.
Bernie McGurl, executive director of the Lackawanna River Conservation Association, thinks the project would be a “great value” to the region for recreation, but also because the area has problems with unregulated ATV use that causes erosion to the river bank.
It will still be some time before the project can move forward because the PennDOT bridge project is expected to extend into at least the mid 2020s.
Joan Foytack, a former president and current member of the rotary club, was nonetheless happy to see the plan generate new interest after she started advocating for it again about two years ago.
“It was a dream I had, and I tried like heck to get it through,” she said.

LAS VEGAS (AP) — Fire engineer Brian Emery was driving his station's engine back from a call for a minor car crash when hundreds of hysterical people began swarming the vehicle near an outdoor country music festival in Las Vegas.
“Then, suddenly, we heard automatic gunfire,” Emery recalled Thursday after his crew became the first to respond to the deadliest shooting in modern American history.
It was pure coincidence that the Clark County Fire Department crew members on Engine 11 — Emery, team leader Capt. Ken O'Shaughnessy and two firefighters, including a rookie — were the first on-duty emergency personnel to arrive on Sunday night.
Emery said the surge of people forced him to stop the firetruck just a few blocks from the outdoor venue where Stephen Paddock unleashed gunfire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino just after 10 p.m.
“There were so many people around us, initially I couldn't drive out of there,” Emery said.
Finally, there was a break in the crush of people and he inched the engine to a parking area. The crew began treating patients brought by concertgoers, which including off-duty emergency workers.
“After my 15 years as a paramedic, it was just automatic,” he said. “You just go to work and do what you know how to do.”
Over the next hours, the crew treated some 30 people with a range of injuries, including those who had been stepped on and crushed in the frantic crowd but largely gunshot victims struck by high-caliber fire.
They put the wounded in whatever vehicles passed by — patrol cars or private vehicles.
Meanwhile, the Clark County Fire Department started getting the first of 32 calls from multiple locations about people with gunshot wounds — from different hotels in the area, hospitals, a restaurant.
Fire Chief Greg Cassell said it took dispatchers a few minutes to understand that all the calls were connected to the same incident, “so that complicated our response.”
Cassell said that some 160 fire personnel arrived before long. Some, like Deputy Fire Chief Joe Klassen, were called in from home, in his case awakened by text messages from the department and a frantic call from an ambulance driver friend. Once there, he helped lead arriving teams on the ground.
“Fortunately, I had my uniform pressed and ready for Monday morning,” he said.
After setting up, Klassen said many off-duty firefighters and police officers approached him to offer help, hailing from places such as California, New Mexico and New York.
Emery's engine crew, meanwhile, kept working on the wounded until after the sun came up, heading back to their station just 400 feet from the iconic Las Vegas sign around 7 a.m.

California Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye said Monday that she has had her own #MeToo moments during her legal career, being addressed as “sugar and honey and dear” and one of the “girls.”
During a meeting with reporters, the state's top judge also confirmed that a state appellate justice who resigned Oct. 31 had been under investigation for improprieties.
Presiding Justice Conrad Rushing of the San Jose-based Court of Appeal faced allegations of bigotry, sexual harassment and discrimination against women when he retired, the San Jose Mercury News reported last week.
Cantil-Sakauye confirmed that justices on the 6th District Court of Appeal asked the state Judicial Council to investigate complaints against Rushing.
The Judicial Council, which Cantil-Sakauye heads, hired an outside law firm to look into the charges and then forwarded a report back to the judges.
They in turn sent the report to the Commission on Judicial Performance, which has the power to publicly censure or remove state judges.
The San Jose newspaper, which said it obtained a copy of the confidential report, said it showed that Rushing looked at images of nude women in his chambers, made personal comments about the appearances of female employees and disparaged some people on the basis of their ethnicity, religion or national origin.
Rushing, 80, appointed by former Gov. Gray Davis, could not be reached for comment Monday.
Rushing also favored male lawyers on the court's staff, allowing them to telecommute and giving them more complex legal cases, and once asked female lawyers to pack his belongings before his apartment was fumigated, the report allegedly said.
The chief justice said she received a short letter from Rushing announcing his departure from the court. He retired Oct. 31.
The investigation of complaints against him occurred this year, she said, and the San Jose newspaper said it involved allegations made over a 10-year period.
Cantil-Sakayue, a former prosecutor, trial court judge and state appellate justice, suggested she may have suffered more serious gender discrimination than being called “honey” and “sugar” but declined to discuss it.
“I've had a few ‘me-toos' in the past, but I'm not telling them, at least not on the record,” said Cantil-Sakauye, 58, who met with legal reporters in her chambers.
She said the court system has ethics instruction for judges and that includes education about sexual harassment.
The basic instructions are what children are taught in kindergarten, she said.
“Keep your hands to yourself, don't say anything you wouldn't want said to yourself and behave,” she said.
She said the Judicial Council did not make public its report on Rushing because the council was acting as a lawyer giving confidential information on a labor mater to the 6th District justices.
If Rushing had not resigned, the allegations might have eventually been made public by the Commission on Judicial Performance, the watchdog agency for judges, she said.
Women across the country in recent weeks have made public many sexual harassment complaints against men in a wide variety of positions, from the entertainment industry to Congress.
On Friday, the Washington Post reported that six former clerks and externs of U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Alex Kozinski complained he had made improper comments to them and showed pornography to one.
Nancy Rapoport, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas law professor, wrote on her blog two days ago that Kozinski made inappropriate comments to her in the mid-1980s when she clerked for a different 9th Circuit judge.
Rapoport wrote that Kozinski invited her to join him and his clerks for drinks after work. She agreed.
“When I showed up, none of his clerks were there,” she wrote. “Just him.”
She said he asked her what single women in San Francisco did for sex. The 9th Circuit is based in San Francisco. Kozinski's chambers are in Pasadena, but he travels to San Francisco to hear cases.
When she told him she had to go home to absorb news that her mother had just been diagnosed with breast cancer, he offered to “comfort” her, she wrote.
As a result of that encounter, she has told female law students she would not write them letters of recommendation for clerkships with him because they would be at risk of being sexually harassed, she said.
Rapoport, reached by phone Monday, said she was 26 at the time and chalked up the encounter to an “awkward situation.”
Rapoport's blog comments were first reported by the Daily Caller.
Kozinski, in an interview Friday with The Times, said he had no recollection of the incidents reported by the Washington Post. He declined to comment Monday about Rapoport's allegations.

Sydney - Detainees at an Australian asylum-seeker camp in Papua New Guinea won millions of dollars in compensation for “degrading and cruel” treatment Wednesday, in a decision hailed as an important human rights victory.
Abuse, self-harm and mental health problems are reportedly rife in offshore processing centres, with detainees resorting to desperate protests like sewing their own lips together to raise awareness of their plight. Wednesday's AUS$70 million (US$53 million) conditional settlement, to be shared by 1,905 people who have been held on Manus Island since 2012, averted a public trial against the government and security providers Transfield and G4S.
A class action had sought damages for what claimants said was suffering due to the harsh conditions in which they were held. It also called for a payout for false imprisonment after the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court ruled last year that holding asylum-seekers on Manus Island was unconstitutional and illegal.
Law firm Slater and Gordon said they believed it was the largest human rights class action settlement in Australian history, with the defendants also agreeing to pay more than Aus$20 million in costs. “The people detained on Manus Island have endured extremely hostile conditions, but they will no longer suffer in silence,” said the firm's Andrew Baker.
“While no amount of money could fully recognise the terrible conditions the detainees endured, we hope today's settlement can begin to provide them with an opportunity to help put this dark chapter of their lives behind them.”
The Manus detention facility opened in 2012 to hold people trying to enter Australia by boat, under a tough immigration policy that sends them offshore to be processed.
They are blocked from resettling in Australia even if found to be refugees.
Conditions in the camp, and another one on Nauru in the Pacific, have been widely criticised by refugee advocates and medical professionals, with reports of maltreatment and neglect, leading to serious health problems.
Amnesty International called the decision “historic” and “a major crack in the Australian government's crumbling system of abuse”.
“It must be a turning point towards a better solution for refugees - one that is grounded in protection, not abuse,” said Amnesty Pacific researcher Kate Schuetze.
Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said the payout was not an admission of liability, but to avoid a costly six-month trial.
“In such circumstances a settlement was considered a prudent outcome for Australian taxpayers,” he said in a statement.
“The Commonwealth strongly refutes and denies the claims made in these proceedings. Settlement is not an admission of liability in any regard.” Slater and Gordon lawyer Rory Walsh said the government and its contractor's defence “was that it was the PNG authorities doing the imprisoning and detaining and not them”.
“The denial of liability allows the Commonwealth and the defendants to run those positions in any other cases and maintain that position,” he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
Lead plaintiff Majid Kamasaee, an Iranian, welcomed the settlement as an overdue acknowledgement of the suffering he and others endured.
“This case is not just about me, it is about every person who has been trapped on Manus Island,” said Kamasaee, who was held there for 11 months “I left my home in Iran in 2013 because of religious persecution and I came to Australia seeking peace, but I was sent to Manus, which was hell.
“The way we were treated at the Manus Island detention centre was degrading and cruel.”
While the Manus camp needs to close following the PNG court decision, Dutton has made clear those housed there would not be moved to Australia but instead relocated to third countries such as the United States and Cambodia, or resettled in PNG. The government has not revealed any plans to shut down the Nauru facility.

Top of manager Stuart McCall's priorities in the January transfer window is to find an answer to Bradford City's goal-scoring problems.
The Bantams have netted just 29 goals in 24 league matches and McCall, who takes his side to Northampton today for their third holiday fixture in eight days, was again left frustrated at seeing Bradford held to their fourth successive draw, against a Bury side without a win in 14 matches, including 12 defeats in a row.
He said: “There are a lot of good things about our squad and our team, but the most important thing we are looking to improve is in the striking area. That said, we haven't got a magic wand that turns chances into goals.
“It's not often we've been disappointed with the players, but at half-time we got into them a little bit. We were poor all over. There was a better response in the second half, but we still haven't capitalised on some good opportunities.
“The longer it goes on the more tense the players get, the fans get and we get. We get anxious and snatch at opportunities.
“We've had enough opportunities, but we have not been clinical enough again. That's down to a bit of confidence and belief, but we keep going.”
Scott Burgess put Bury ahead after 39 minutes, coolly lobbing the ball over the head of the advancing Colin Doyle after latching onto a long clearance just moments after Jordy Hiwula had seen his close-range shot blocked at the other end.
Bradford applied pressure from the start of the second half and were rewarded with an equaliser after 62 minutes.
James Hanson, who had seen visiting goalkeeper Rob Lainton make a diving save to keep out his downward header in the 25th minute, headed the ball into the path of Hiwula. His shot was blocked, but the ball rebounded to Nicky Law, who fired into the empty net.
City continued to dominate, but could not turn pressure into goals and have now gone five matches without a win.
Bradford City: Doyle, McMahon, Vincelot, Knight-Percival, Kilgallon, Marshall (Vuckic 81), Devine (Dieng 72), Cullen, Law, Hanson, Hiwula (McNulty 72). Unused substitutes: Sattelmaier, Darby, Meredith, McArdle.

After the US moved World Trade Organisation (WTO) against India for not doing away with export subsidy, the Union Ministry of Commerce is likely to come up with a new foreign trade policy in the first half of 2019.Under normal circumstances a new foreign policy was due in 2020. The present policy is valid for five years starting 2015.“We are working on the new policy with a deadline of 2019. With the US moving WTO it is imperative that India comes up with an alternative incase the WTO doesn't go India's way,” said a senior official from the ministry of commerce, speaking under conditions of anonymity.This comes after Trump administration had on 14 March 2018 dragged India to the WTO. In its request to hold consultations with India, the first step before legal action, the US had argued that India wrongfully avails export subsidy. Trump administration had alleged that India violates WTO agreements as they are no longer below the economic benchmark of $1,000 per capita gross national income (GNI).According to WTO's rules, only those countries are allowed export subsidy who's GNI is below $1,000 per capita.Ministry of commerce has formed an informal committee under the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) to deliberate on ways to do away with export subsidy. “The idea is to identify the non-compatible provisions and to look for alternatives assuming that India's eight-year phase-out period argument is not accepted,” a government official aware of the development told News18.The informal committee consists of industry bodies like FICCI and CII, exporters' body FIEO and the Commerce Ministry's think-tank, Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT).The committee has identified three major ways to do away with export subsidy in its new policy.First, the ministry is looking to move to production based subsidy from the current method of export based subsidy.“The ministry is deliberating on providing subsidies on production now. This means that products meant for export will be incentivized. Rather than providing monetary benefits post export,” said the official.Second, the ministry has identified 356 clusters that will be subsidized by the government.“We are also thinking of subsidizing via clusters. We will group certain products that we think are most important for export. We will subsidise the entire production, manufacturing and sale of that product,” said the official, part of the team formulating the policy.Third, the ministry is contemplating on providing subsidy based on quality standards.“We are also deliberating on providing subsidy to only those products that reach a certain quality standard. Say a product reaches an ISO:9000 then we will subsidise it,” said the official.The informal team is also deliberating on the policy having standards on e-commerce.Additionally, “we are right now in the process of rectifying the lag in the export and manufacturing sector. We are looking at the services sector taking lead. For development to rise at a steady rate, the manufacturing and services sector need to foster,” said the official aware of the development.Sources from the ministry of commerce told News18 that US-India consultations were held on 11 April, 2018.“The US did not agree to India's proposition of continuing with export subsidy. They've said US will move to legal action if India does not alter its foreign policy and does away with subsidy immediately. Indian representatives have said that they must be allowed an eight year phase out period,” said a second official from the commerce ministry talking under conditions of anonymity.While the ministry is internally preparing for a new policy and looking for options to do away with export subsidy, on the exterior it still maintains its stand of WTO allowing the country a phase out period of 8 years.Indian authorities argued that like other countries in the past, India should be allowed a transition period of eight years. “When the WTO was set up, developing countries that had a GNI of over $1,000 per capita were allowed eight years to wind up their export promotion schemes,” said the official.Earlier commerce secretary Rita Teaotia said, “Our presumption is that India also has a similar period of eight years to graduate out of the subsidy regime and this is what we will be placing before the US. We are hopeful that they will recognise this time frame and during this time frame we will commit ourselves and meet our obligations.”
Demonstrators toppled a statue of a Confederate soldier in North Carolina, two days after violence erupted during a protest by white nationalists against the planned removal of another Confederate monument.Local television networks in Durham, North Carolina, broadcast images of the statue outside the old Durham County courthouse being pulled down as dozens of protesters cheered on Tuesday.A demonstrator could be seen climbing a ladder and looping a yellow strap around the statue, the Confederate Soldiers Monument, which was erected in 1924 to honor the southern dead in the 1861-1865 Civil War.After the statue came crashing to the ground, demonstrators could be seen spitting on it and kicking it."We are the revolution," they chanted. "No KKK, no fascist USA.""The people, united, will never be defeated," they said.The toppling of the statue in Durham came two days after clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, between anti-racism protesters and white nationalists opposed to a plan to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a park.One woman was killed and 19 other people were injured when a suspected white extremist drove his car into a group of counter-protestors.Two policemen assigned to the rally were killed when their helicopter crashed.President Donald Trump, after initially blaming the Charlottesville violence on "many sides," singled out white extremists yesterday saying they were "repugnant."
On Tuesday, Corus Entertainment‘s four Edmonton radio stations — 630 CHED, CISN Country 103.9, 92.5 Fresh Radio and iNews880 — were named the official radio partners of the 2018 Grey Cup Festival.

CHICOPEE - A Holyoke man was arrested and charged with assault and battery after two city residents confronted him and accused of breaking into their son's van.

There will be 2,400 athletes, 400 coaches, and countless supporters in Langley this weekend.

The best of the best high school track and field athletes from throughout the province are converging on Langley this week.
Langley, and specifically the McLeod Athletic Park (MAP), are a preferred location for the BC High School Track and Field (BCTF) Championships that are happening Thursday through Saturday.
While the local track and most of its competition amenities are pretty standard, it's the covered stadium and media booth used for staging, as well as the jumbotron that keep organizer Andrew Lenton and the team from the BCTF's commission coming back to Langley again and again.
“The media tower makes a great staging area for the event, for us, from an organizational perspective,” he said.
“But the feedback we get from the spectators is that the jumbotron is something they're really wanting to keep, so we've come back here.”
He said the Township's parks and rec staff have been “great to deal with.” And the commission's long-standing relationship with the Langley Mustangs track and field club has made it possible to facilitate “an event of this magnitude” year after year.
“It's a really great facility. The Township of Langley is great to work with, their parks and rec. The facilities are great,” said Lenton, who is assistant coach at Maple Ridge Secondary and commissioner for the B.C. High School Track & Field Commission.
In addition to complimenting parks and rec, he said partnering with the Langley Mustangs track and field club to facilitate an event of this magnitude has been key.
“It's just a massive event,” Lenton said Wednesday afternoon from MAP.
It's one of the largest high school competitions of any kind in the country, comparable only to the Ontario track and field event, he said.
It will be a full house, added Lenton, noting that once again there will be 2,400 students from 335 high school throughout the province competing.
“We cap out. We limit and restrict who can come into the championships,” he explained. “There are many thousands and thousands more who have not been as lucky as to qualify or get a berth into the championships.”
In addition to all the athletes expected, there are another 400 coaches, and countless parents and supporters coming to Langley this weekend.
“This is a huge undertaking,” Lenton told the Langley Advance, explaining that these annual championships takes more than a year of prep time to arrange.
Speaking to that, he and the other commission directors started preparing for 2019's competition last summer.
The championships are primarily held within the Lower Mainland, because of facilities and logistics.
Only on rare occasions does it get moved to the Island or Interior.
It was hosted at the Apple Bowl in Kelowna in 1972, and Nanaimo in 2015, Lenton recalled. But he confirmed it will be back in Kelowna again next year, and he's already making plans for their return to Langley in 2020.
This is year six for Lenton at the helm.
“I thought I would do it for one year, and somehow I'm finding myself in year six. I don't know how that happened,” he said.
It's primarily the calibre of athletes he sees participating year after year, and their insatiable quest to better themselves, that keeps him coming back.
This year's competition includes 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1,500-metre races, long jump, shot put, high jump, javelin, triple jump, steeplechase, race walking, discus, and hammer for students Grade 8 through 12.
“This really is, in terms of high school track and field competition, as good as it gets,” he said.
“In fact, We have some of the best athletes in the world competing,” he added, encouraging sports enthusiasts to watch the performances.
“They're going to be exciting,” Lenton said of the various showdowns. “For a lot of the kids, this is what they've been practicing and training for months and months.”
While Thursday's action runs from 3 to about 8 p.m., Friday and Saturday are full days. Friday will see meets and competitions running from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to about 5 p.m.
That's long days, Lenton admitted. But to make it more palatable for spectators, most of the finals have been arranged between about 2 and 5 p.m. on both Friday and Saturday.
“We've loaded in all the finals in those times,” or at least as many as they could accommodate.

WASHINGTON (AP)  It took less than 15 minutes for newly minted Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch to ask his first questions from the bench.
Gorsuch and his colleagues were hearing arguments Monday for the first time since President Donald Trumps pick was sworn in April 10.
The case before the justices involved a procedural issue in a federal workers employment discrimination claim. Gorsuch asked lawyer Christopher Landau four questions in a row, saying he was sorry for taking up so much time.
The high court is back to its full contingent of nine members after being short-handed since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia more than 14 months ago.

The session started with Chief Justice John Roberts welcoming Gorsuch and wishing him a long and happy career in our common calling.
ALLEN PARK, Mich. -- Seven Detroit Lions starters are questionable and wide receiver Kenny Golladay has been ruled out for Sunday's game against the Carolina Panthers.
Linebackers Jarrad Davis (neck) and Tahir Whitehead (pectoral), defensive linemen Haloti Ngata (shoulder) and Ezekiel Ansah (knee), and offensive linemen Travis Swanson (ankle), Rick Wagner (ankle/shoulder) and T.J. Lang (back) were all listed as questionable.
Of those seven, most are expected to play. Swanson practiced fully on Friday -- a good sign for him -- and only Davis missed last week's game. Davis practiced every day this week on a limited basis.
Editor's Picks Lions' goal for Sunday? They 'want to contain' Cam Newton The Panthers' QB is again looking like a dual threat. But if the Lions can take away his ability to run, their secondary is good enough to have a shot.
Golladay has not practiced this week due to a hamstring injury but was spotted running off on the side on Thursday.
In addition to Golladay, the Lions have ruled out running back Dwayne Washington (quad) and linebacker Paul Worrilow (knee). None of the three practiced this week, and Worrilow sprained the MCL in his left knee on the first defensive play of Sunday's win over the Minnesota Vikings.
With Golladay and Washington out, wide receiver TJ Jones and running back Zach Zenner should get more work.

Perth: The WACA ground, where the third Ashes Test will be played this week, has been described as ramshackle, frozen in time, evocative and a veritable graveyard for visiting teams.
The minimalist venue on the edges of Perth's CBD is hosting its 44th and final Test match from Thursday before future games are switched to the swanky new 60,000-capacity Perth Stadium across the Swan River.
The Western Australian Cricket Association (WACA) ground is well past its use-by date as an international cricket venue and has been left behind by refurbished venues in other capital cities throughout the country.
The lead-up to the Ashes Test has conjured enduring memories of iconic cricketers and their daring deeds in its open-air theatre.
It ranges from Adam Gilchrist's 57-ball hundred pyrotechnics to Curtly Ambrose's spell of seven for one, Doug Walters hooking the final ball from Bob Willis for six to complete a century in a session and button-down shirted Dennis Lillee thundering in to bowl with the wind at his back.
The WACA Ground once boasted it was the fastest pitch in the world until a relaid wicket in the late 1980s slowed it down a tad.
West Australian Test great Justin Langer recalls facing Pakistan's express bowler Shoaib Akhtar on a flyer of a WACA pitch in 2004.
"Ricky Ponting and I were just laughing our heads off, because we could have got a single every ball given how far Moin Khan, the wicketkeeper, was standing back," Langer said.
"I was very happy letting the captain take the strike. When you're batting at the end with the sea breeze behind the bowler, you feel alive.
"You need to leave a lot of balls and if you leave well then you can have great success.
"Fast bowlers usually come here and get carried away," he added.
"They have heard about the WACA so they bowl it far too short.
"It flies through to the keeper and the bowler thinks 'Ah ...', and the batter thinks, 'Come on, keep on doing it baby.'"
Cherished memories
A large part of the fondness towards the WACA is the prevailing afternoon sea breeze, dubbed "The Fremantle Doctor", which provides respite for fielding sides from the scorching heat or those frazzling in the old stands that offer little shade.
But to visiting English teams, the WACA is a nightmare as history bears out.
England last won a Test in Perth in 1978 and touring Ashes sides have lost the last seven encounters there, and heavily.
It has always been iconic fast bowlers who wrought the destruction, whether it was Lillee and his partner in crime Jeff Thomson terrorising touring batsman –- David Lloyd had his protective box spilt in the 1974-75 series -- or Mitchell Johnson and Ryan Harris taking 18 wickets between them in the thumping 2010 win.
It's little wonder one English journalist describes the WACA as England's Ashes necropolis, the cruellest of grounds, a theatre of nightmares.
But there will be some sadness to see the back of a ground first used as a Test venue in 1970.
Opener Graeme Wood cherishes the memories of his home ground, which include a brilliant 111 against the fearsome West Indian bowling attack in 1988.
"It's known worldwide, so as a homegrown boy it is very dear to me," he said.
"It's going to be the last one here. It'll be a little bit sad to see it go to the new stadium."
The in-car delivery option, available to Amazon Prime members, is an attempt by Amazon to overcome the hesitation that many feel about remotely opening their homes for couriers. It's integrated with Amazon's Key service, launched last year to enable customers to automatically open doors for delivery people. Although the service has been touted as a way to reduce package theft, security concerns may still be an issue, as 69% of Americans say they wouldn't want to use Amazon Key to let couriers into their home, according to a survey by InsuranceQuotes.com.
Jammu: It is a rare moment when politicians of Jammu and Kashmir, cutting across the mainstream political spectrum, openly express their helplessness to influence a change in the state that has been torn apart by turmoil and militarisation over the last three decades. That moment came on Friday when the former chief minister and Leader of Opposition Omar Abdullah stood in the state Assembly to launch a scathing attack on Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti.
Invoking the legendary German character Faust who, despite being highly successful yet dissatisfied with life, makes a pact with The Devil for exchanging his moral integrity and his soul in exchange for worldly gains, Omar compared the alliance of Peoples Democratic Party, of which Mehbooba is the president, with the BJP, as a pact of Faust with The Devil.
"Let us be honest," Omar said in the Assembly during his 45-minute speech, "What sort of logical conclusion will you give to Shopian case when 47 out of 50 requests for prosecution of armed forces (allegedly involved in gross rights abuses, including murder, according to Jammu and Kashmir government probes) have been rejected by Centre since 2000 and three are pending."
While Omar's admission of guilt on the floor of the house is an indictment of the failure of the elected governments in Jammu and Kashmir in giving justice to the people victimised by the 'black sheep' in armed forces over the last three decades, it also explains why the ‘impotent' regional mainstream players don't enjoy a whiff of credibility or faith among the people.
The revocation of Armed Forces Special Powers Act, which gives sweeping powers to the army during counter-insurgency operations, also provides them with impunity from prosecution in civilian courts, if they were found to be involved in rights abuses. Omar's remarks in the Assembly only reaffirm the common belief that when it comes to dealing with the rogue elements in the armed forces deployed in the state, their hands are tied.
In his wax-eloquent speech, Omar squarely blamed the coalition government for the recent civilian killings, particularly in Shopian district, which he said is a “stark reminder of the reality of our time in which we live”. Omar said it has become a new routine of government to cage people in their homes on every Friday by imposing curfew and restrictions, “People have been barred even from offering Eid prayers.”
In her defence, Mehbooba again reiterated that the law will follow its own course. “We have lodged an FIR but I want to say this here that if there is someone who makes a mistake, there is a law for them. That doesn't mean everyone in the army is same or every soldier is an offender. These are the same forces who have brought a sense of security among people,” Mehbooba said.
But it's not the AFSPA alone that has exposed the inability of the mainstream parties, like the ruling PDP and National Conference, in ensuring justice for the victims by punishing the culprits in uniform. There have been others occasions also where the state government has been literally forced to eat its words in the face of the pressure mounted by the armed forces to have their wishes granted while operating in Jammu and Kashmir.
Take the issue of the high ground in south Kashmir's Anantnag district, for example, where the army occupies more than 2,000 kanals of land. While the decision to free a fertile 454 kanal patch at Fatehgarh from military occupation was taken years back with the then chief minister Mufti Sayeed even setting up deadlines and the Prime Minister's Office also intervening, the army refused to oblige and has not even paid the rent to the landowners.
The sheer powerlessness of Kashmir's political class is also reflected in their dealings with the governments at the Centre. While the PDP may have found it convenient to form an alliance with the party which is ruling at the Centre, its proposals for the social, political and economic empowerment of the state have not evoked much enthusiasm from the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.
From the refusal to return two key power projects to the state government, presently under the operational control of the NHPC, to the “deliberate cuts” in power infrastructure development component in the prime minister's Rs 80,000 crore plus package, the war of words between Mehbooba and Omar is also an indicator that the Centre puts its interests ahead of the interests of people of Jammu and Kashmir.
Kashmir's politicians may squabble inside and outside the Assembly, and bring each other down for petty gains, but in the process, they are slowly shredding the trust of those people who elected them in the first place. If Omar and Mehbooba can't give justice to victims of abuses by armed forces, pray, who will? This should worry us all.

Data showing strong job creation and wage gains in the United States fed expectations of interest rate hikes, sending the dollar and US bond yields higher on Friday, while stocks slumped.
With 200,000 jobs added to the US economy last month, more than analysts had forecast, expectations are mounting that the Federal Reserve will push forward with more intest rate hikes.
The Fed's concerns about tepid inflation will likely be salved by data showing wage growth of 2.9 percent, the largest 12-month increase in more than nine years.
The greenback snapped higher after the announcement, as did the yield on US government bonds. Bloomberg reported the rate of return on 10-year US Treasury hit a four-year high of 2.84 percent.
“Rising wages are a good thing for the economy, but what is good for the economy isn't always good for the stock market if it drives up rate-hike expectations,” said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare. – Jobs crutch for dollar – “The dollar clearly needed support this week, and January's impressive US jobs data has come to the rescue,” said research analyst Lukman Otunuga at FXTM online currency brokerage.
But analyst Craig Erlam downplayed the size of the gains by the dollar gains.
“Not an overly large move in USD when you consider size of beat on earnings and a small beat on NFP. Sign of USD unpopularity right now?” he tweeted.
The dollar has been struggling against its major peers recently.
With dealers betting on tighter monetary policy at the European Central Bank and preferable terms for Britain when it leaves the European Union, the euro and pound have been making gains against the dollar the past couple of weeks.
The dollar has also been weighed down by political worries, including over a US government shutdown and earlier today by reports that the new head of the FBI could resign if Trump approves the release of an explosive secret memo at the centre of a political firestorm in Washington. – Goodbye Goldilocks? – Meanwhile, stocks fell, as higher interest rates are not usually good for consumers and companies. The Dow was down 1.3 percent in late morning trading.
London Capital Group's Jasper Lawler said rising bond yields had put stock markets on high alert. “A three percent 10-year treasury yield is the big kahuna for a larger stock market correction,” he wrote in a client note.
“Rising interest rates mean the ‘Goldilocks' scenario for markets is warming up to ‘daddy bear',” he added.
With the Federal Reserve already in the midst of a rate-raising cycle—it is now tipped to hike at least three times this year—there is increasing concern about the impact on growth and world markets.
Eurozone stock markets also slumped on Friday, with the Frankfurt and Paris stock markets down over 1.5 percent. Outside the eurozone, London's losses were less acute at 0.6 percent.
“The global equity selloff has gathered pace, with European markets taking the brunt of the selling,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG trading group. – Bitcoin heads down – Asian markets swung Friday with some recovering from early losses but traders remain on edge as over the rise in US Treasury yields. —AFP
The AFC champion New England Patriots are set to take on the NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. This is the Patriots' tenth appearance in a Super Bowl. Rob Gronkowski is cleared to take the field, Tom Brady is focused on the biggest game of the year, all while the Patriots cement another record or two in football history.
Gronk is ready
After some time in concussion protocol after a hit to the head by Barry Church in the AFC Championship Game, Rob Gronkowski returned to practice on Thursday. According to Ian Rapoport, the doctors were more cautious with Gronk's injury. He is cleared and will be ready to play in the Super Bowl.
Gronk said doctors “were more on the cautious side. Officially got the word today from the doctors that I was cleared. I'll be ready to go.” pic.twitter.com/uTxU47DyRQ — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) February 1, 2018
Will Tom Brady retire?
The question has come up whether Tom Brady will retire after the Super Bowl. Brady addressed the question in his media appearance this week.
“Why does everyone want me to retire so bad? I don't get it. I'm having fun. The team's doing good,” Brady said, via to NFL.com. “I know I'm a little bit older than most of the guys, but I'm really enjoying it. Obviously, I enjoy the experience of playing in this game. This has been obviously a dream come true many times over. It takes a lot of hard work to get here, and I think our team is working hard…We're playing against a great football team. So I'm not thinking about retirement. I'm thinking about the Super Bowl and trying to win the most important game of the year.”
Patriots dynasty
The Patriots set plenty of records along their road to creating this dynasty in New England. They have nine consecutive AFC East division titles, which is the longest streak in the NFL. This is the tenth Super Bowl for the franchise, which is the most in the NFL. This appearance is the eighth for Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, which is tied with the Steelers, Cowboys and Broncos and more than the remaining teams in the NFL.
Tom Brady will be the first 40-year-old quarterback to play in a Super Bowl. He is competing for his sixth ring, which would make him the first quarterback to earn that honor. Meanwhile, Coach Belichick is competing for his eighth ring, which would make him the first person to have that many Super Bowl wins.
Needless to say, if the Patriots take home the Lombardi again, this dynasty being built will continue to grow.
Cycling season is around the corner, and that means more chances for bikes to be stolen.
The City of Winnipeg announced it was bringing its bike registry online on Monday, and as of 9 a.m. Tuesday, 116 people had uploaded their bike's information to the database.
It's a good idea to also have a strong lock if you plan to park your bike outside for any amount of time.
Tim Woodcock, owner of Woodcock Cycle Works, said he recommends a sturdy U-shaped lock.
“If you spend more on a bicycle, then you should probably spend more on the lock,” he said.
“But ideally, the U-locks — they're D-style locks — are your safest bet.”
Woodcock said you do get what you pay for when it comes to bike locks — the higher the cost, likely the better the lock.
“The lower end ones usually use a carbon steel — so it's easier to cut through, sometimes [it] isn't hardened,” he said. “Also the internal mechanisms that actually hold the clamp in are really important. So your highest levels will clamp on both sides of where the U goes in, whereas your lower-end locks will only clamp at one end.”
“So the benefit of the dual one is even if they were to cut through there with a grinder or something, they wouldn't be able to open the lock up at all — they'd have to grind both sides off — so it's going to be a lot slower, harder for them to get through the lock.”

He also recommended taking off the front wheel and attaching it to the back wheel when threading the lock through. So that means the lock is going through both wheels, the bike frame and whatever the bike is being locked to — typically a strong rack.
“Really, the lock's only as good as what you're locking it to,” Woodcock said, noting he tries to discourage people from locking their bikes to street signs or poles, which can be easily pulled out of the ground by cunning thieves who then walk away with the bike and lock intact.
“With some of these locks, they'll come with a cable as well as the U-lock,” he said. “A lot of bikes nowadays will have quick-release wheels so the wheel can easily be taken off, then you want to lock it to the side of the bike, and you always want to make sure you lock the front, the back wheel and especially the frame all together.”
Locking simply the front wheel to the rack isn't enough — Woodcock said it's easy to separate the front wheel from the frame and leave the lock untouched.
But if cyclists aren't comfortable taking the wheel off and strapping it to everything else that's going to be locked up, he encourages a second lock or a cable to anchor the front wheel to the frame.
And while Woodcock admits some cables can be cut, he said better quality ones feature better weaving that makes it hard for wire cutters to effectively shear through the cable.
“A lot of times if you lock your bike up with a good lock and a cable and everything's locked secure, they'll usually walk past the bike and go to someone who hasn't locked their bike up,” Woodcock said.
LANSING, Mich. (AP) — A new report says peregrine falcons are making a comeback in southeastern Michigan.
The state Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service say the region's population has grown from five young birds introduced in 1987 to 15 nesting pairs that reared 30 young birds last year.
The peregrine falcon is still an endangered species in the state, although it's been removed from the federal list.
The population became imperiled as the pesticide DDT accumulated in the falcons and made their eggs fragile.
The report says there were 54 peregrine falcon nest sites across Michigan in 2016.
Peregrines are crow-sized birds with prominent cheek marks on either side of their head. They feed on smaller birds and can reach speeds of 180 mph when diving at prey.

Morgan City police have arrested a California woman on 135 counts of possession of pornography involving juveniles, a news release said.
De'Nika Turner, 25, of Barranca Way in Victorville, California, was arrested at 8:25 a.m. Tuesday on 135 counts of possession of pornography involving juveniles.
On April 10, investigators with the Morgan City Police Department Detectives Division initiated an investigation in regard to child pornography in the Morgan City area. During the investigation, an Egle Street home was identified and a search warrant was obtained.
On Tuesday, the Morgan City Police Department Detectives Division, with assistance from the Louisiana Bureau of Investigations Unit and the Lafayette Police Department, executed the search warrant. Turner was located and identified as a suspect. During a forensic review of Turner's devices, she was found in possession of 135 separate files of pornography involving juveniles, the release said.
Turner was arrested and transported to the Morgan City jail where she was booked and incarcerated. The investigation is still ongoing.
Philadelphia Eagles star quarterback Carson Wentz has a torn left ACL and will miss rest of the season and playoffs, coach Doug Pederson confirmed.
Wentz, a favorite in the NFL MVP race, had an MRI on Monday that revealed the severity of the injury. Wentz was hurt late in the third quarter Sunday at Los Angeles. Backup Nick Foles rallied the Eagles (11-2) to a 43-35 win over the Rams that secured the NFC East title and put them in first place in the conference with three games remaining.
The Eagles have overcome several key injuries and now have to move forward without their most indispensable player. Nine-time Pro Bowl left tackle Jason Peters, return specialist/running back Darren Sproles, star linebacker Jordan Hicks and special teams captain Chris Maragos already went down for the season.
“If there's ever an opportunity for me to rally the troops as the football coach, now might be the time,” Pederson said. “You can't lose faith. This has been a resilient football team all season long.”
After starting all 16 games as a rookie, Wentz made a giant leap this year. He passed for 3,296 yards and set a franchise single-season record with 33 touchdown passes while only tossing seven interceptions.
Foles led the Eagles to a pair of field goals on consecutive drives against the Rams. He is 20-17 as a starter in six seasons with the Eagles, Rams and Chiefs.
Pederson insisted the offense won't change with Foles.
“He's a highly intelligent football player,” Pederson said.
A third-round pick by former Eagles coach Andy Reid in 2012, Foles is in his second stint in Philadelphia. He replaced an injured Michael Vick in 2013 and led the Eagles to an NFC East title during Chip Kelly's first season as coach. Foles tied an NFL record with seven TD passes in a game at Oakland in November 2013 and finished that season with 27 TDs and only two picks. The Eagles lost at home to New Orleans in the playoffs. Foles went to the Pro Bowl and was the offensive MVP.
But Kelly traded Foles to St. Louis for Sam Bradford after the 2014 season. Foles spent a year with the Rams, a season with the Chiefs and returned to Philadelphia as a free agent this season.
Second-year pro Nate Sudfeld is Philadelphia's No. 3 quarterback. Pederson said he hasn't spoken to personnel boss Howie Roseman about adding a third quarterback yet.
The B.C. government is changing real estate laws in an effort to prevent flipping of condos from one buyer to another before they are built.
Finance Minister Carole James presented legislation Tuesday to require real estate developers to collect and report information on pre-sale condo assignments, to enforce the collection of property transfer tax on buyers.
“For too long, people who resell condos before they have been built have been inflating real estate prices, without necessarily paying taxes on their gains,” James said. “We are making it fairer for people who want to buy a condo, by making sure those who flip pre-sale condos pay their fair share.”
James said the information will not be publicly available, but will be shared with the Canada Revenue Agency, to make sure that capital gains tax as well as provincial property taxes are paid.

India and the US cannot be "fighting everyday on trade issues while cooperating on defence, former US Ambassador to India Richard Verma has said, highlighting the need to "fire on all cylinders" to move ahead their strategic relations.Verma said Washington and New Delhi want an "ambitious relationship" and to become natural allies for that they need to be "firing on all cylinders", including economic and military."We need a full scale relationship, not just the defence relationship, not just the strategic relationship. We need to focus on the economic side too. We somehow need to navigate America First with Make in India," Verma said here on Monday."We can't be fighting everyday on trade, cooperating on defence and think we are just going to have a great relationship. We need to be firing on all cylinders, that means economic, that means military," he said.He further stressed that the US needs to take its defence relationship with India to the next level."That means we ought to be providing India with the most advanced technology, we ought to make sure that if India is in trouble they have the means to win, if they are challenged, he said.Delivering the third New India Lecture' organized by India's Consulate General in New York, Verma spoke at length on a wide range of topics pertaining to India-US relations, including H1B work visas, immigration as well as geo-political issues relating to China and Pakistan.Verma, Vice Chairman and Partner at the Asia Group and a board member of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), said the India-US relationship has been a "slightly underperforming" one for decades."We have got some history that weighs us down. We still have some trust issues and neither side wants to be in an alliance," he said in his address on 'US-India: Natural Allies -- Absent the Alliance'.Responding to a question on concerns among Indian workers over the H1B visa, Verma said last year about 1.1 million visas were issued to Indian nationals to come to the US in every category and out of these, about 50,000-60,000 were H1B visas."A very small percentage of the visa pool is for H1 B visas," he said.Verma, who had served as the US Ambassador to India from 2014 to 2017, said he had conveyed to Indian CEOs and software companies that they have to be aware of the "political realities" in the US.Verma, who has previously served as the Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs, noted that "some reforms are probably necessary", adding that the H1B visas are an important but "small part" of the overall people-to-people relationship between India and the US."I think US-India trade relationship is one relationship where you can get distinct wins on both sides," he said.Highlighting the critical role of the diaspora in strengthening relations between India and the US, Verma said "we have to increase our people-to-people connections and we should be celebrating and standing up for the immigrants who come into this country and not looking at ways to shrink the pool of people coming here".On the trajectory of India-US relations under the Trump administration, Verma said looking at Washington's all other bilateral relations, the one with India is "still on a pretty good trajectory"While things have been moving along on the strategic side, on the economic side there are some growing pains. However, he said he is "more concerned about how we treat people who may not necessarily look like and sound like the rest of middle America and that's the part I keep the most eye out for in this environment".Recalling the journey of his parents from India to the US, Verma said that immigrants and immigration have played a hugely important role in America.It is not just one group of immigrants or immigrants who look a certain way but immigrants from all over the world and it's really important that we stand up for that group of people.

New Delhi: A man was stabbed to death by the family of his lover, police said on Friday. The mother, father, brother and uncle of the woman have been arrested.
Ankit Saxena, 23, a photographer by profession, had been in a relationship with Shehzadi, 20, for the last three years.
"The woman's family was against their relationship as they belonged to different communities and had told him to end it," Deputy Commissioner of Police, Vijay Kumar, said.
The attack took place around 9 p.m. and was reported to the police by a hospital staff, the police said. Ankit's father Yeshpal Saxena said it was a case of honour killing as the accused were carrying knives and had planned to kill his son.
"We did not know about the relationship of Ankit and Shehzadi. We asked Ankit once but he denied it...Shehzadi's family came here on Thursday and told Ankit to come out of the house. When he did, they started beating him up on the street," Sexena said.
"When his mother came to his rescue, she too was beaten up mercilessly. Then Shehzadi's brother slit Ankit's throat as the other family members held him. They fled before police reached the spot," he added.
In a bid to avoid any untoward incident since the deceased and the accused belonged to different communities, police have tightened the patrolling in the area, the officer said.

No one should have been surprised when the giant Westlands Water District voted Sept. 19 against joining the state's equally imposing $17-billion water infrastructure project.
After all, the Central Valley district — at 600,000 acres, the largest agricultural water district in the state and the nation — had been signaling its uneasiness about the California WaterFix for months. The district accepted that the reliability and volume of the water supply for Southern and Central California could be enhanced by the plan to build two 30-mile, four-story-high tunnels to carry water under the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. But questions were mounting about how much more reliable and how much larger the supply would be, and whether the gain was worth the price.
A staff report prepared in advance of the vote cast a shadow. The report warned that “a business case … cannot be made” for a project that could increase Westlands' cost of irrigation water by nearly $1,000 per acre-foot. The economics of the project deteriorated sharply for the district in July, when federal officials made clear that the government wouldn't pick up the tab for environmental refuges or districts whose historic water rights were so senior to all others that they'd get almost all the water they needed even without the tunnels.
There are a couple of possible paths forward, and then there's just giving up and not building the project. — Metropolitan Water District General Manager Jeffrey Kightlinger
The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation said that while districts that wished to obtain water through the WaterFix were welcome to opt in, the government would contribute nothing to the project's cost. The opt-in users, therefore, would effectively be subsidizing the refuges and the so-called exchange districts by shouldering an estimated additional $4 billion.
Yet Westlands had expressed support for the WaterFix in principle. Many observers expected the board to signal that it was open to negotiation over its financial share, or to a less ambitious and cheaper tunnel project. Instead, the board's 7-1 vote not to participate delivered what could be a mortal blow to the whole project.
The California WaterFix is about to enter a make-or-break phase. The board of the Metropolitan Water District, which serves 19 million residents of Southern California, is scheduled to vote Tuesday on participating in the project. But that vote is based on the expectation that the MWD would pay only 26% of the total project cost, or about $4.4 billion, a figure that has been thrown into doubt by the federal government's position and the Westlands vote. Additional Central and Southern California users of Delta water will be voting over the coming weeks.
Things weren't helped by the release Thursday of a negative report by state auditor Elaine Howle, who found that the project's “unexpected complexity” already has led to “significant cost increases and schedule delays.”
The state's options if the tunnels can't secure adequate funding are few.
“There are a couple of possible paths forward, and then there's just giving up and not building the project,” MWD General Manager Jeffrey Kightlinger told me. One option is to “push aggressively to see exactly what Westlands and others would be willing to fund,” he says. Another option is to try to jawbone the federal government into funding at least some of the tunnels' cost. Barring that, the state could decide to build a smaller, cheaper project now and phase in additions over the decades to come.
None of these options is especially palatable for the project's supporters. The two-tunnel option, which would carry as much as 5 million acre-feet per year (one acre-foot can supply the annual needs of up to two average California households) captures economies of scale that would be diminished in a slimmed-down version. The project's claimed virtues, which include protecting the state's water supply from climate change or earthquake damage while reducing environmental stress and strain on the delta, would be reduced commensurately, supporters say. The consequences, they say, would be the continuing shrinkage of the water supply from Northern California, higher local bills, and more urban purchases of water from growers and a decline in agricultural output.
Critics maintain that these virtues and drawbacks have consistently been overstated, or can be addressed more cheaply for less via smaller local projects. “You can have a lot of bottom-up innovation in water supply by local water districts that you might not get from a top-down system,” says Doug Obegi of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Adds Jeff Michael, an environmental economist at the University of the Pacific, “If they don't go ahead with this project, there's $17 billion in capital expenses that could be deployed by water agencies in other ways.”
The California WaterFix is in trouble because the fragmentation of water interests in the state renders agreement on major statewide water projects difficult, perhaps impossible. Through much of the 20th century, regional and economic conflicts over statewide public works could be papered over by the impetus of rapid economic growth. The projects also required the drive of visionary leaders such as Gov. Pat Brown, who in the 1960s oversaw some of the initial construction of the State Water Project, which aimed to secure exports of water through the Delta to Central and Southern California.
But regional conflicts never lay far below the surface. In 1982, voters rejected the Peripheral Canal, a proposed upgrade to the State Water Project championed by Gov. Jerry Brown, Pat Brown's son. The outcome reflected a sharp north-south divide, depicted by The Times' Pulitzer-winning editorial cartoonist, Paul Conrad, in graphic fashion. The delta tunnels, of which Gov. Brown is a leading supporter, are the latest iteration of that project.
Supporters of the delta tunnels try to be philosophical about the blow by Westlands. “It's understandable,” Kightlinger says. “Just as my board's been saying they don't expect to be subsidizing agriculture, Westlands is saying they don't expect to be subsidizing exchange contractors or the refuges.”
It's hard to see how anything on the scale of the California WaterFix can be built without some cross-subsidy, however. In a 2015 analysis for state officials, agricultural economist David Sunding of UC Berkeley calculated that the project would pass a cost-benefit test for California in the aggregate. But when the calculations were broken down, it was an economic winner for residential, or “urban,” users but a close call or a loser for agriculture. Sunding based his conclusions on the assumption that the federal government would chip in $3.9 billion for the refuges and exchange contractors; if it did not, “the net benefits of the project are even more negative for agricultural contractors.”

Nicki Minaj, Quavo release new remix of Ella Mai's summer love jam Boo'd Up
Dubbed as this year's summer love jam, ‘Boo'd Up' by R&B singer Ella Mai just got one upped with a feature from Nicki Minaj and Quavo. The 'Anaconda' rapper kicks off her verse with references to the Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, American artist DeJ Loaf, and even her own song 'Super Bass.' Quavo steps in with an auto-tuned verse whereas Nicki keeps it natural and impromptu. She wraps up the new remix by saying: “Babe, can you come and get me?” on a call to Quavo.
Just before the track hit the market, Nicki took to Instagram to tease her followers about the release of her version.
This isn't the first time that Minaj and one-third of Migos are collaborating, they worked together on 'MotorSport' and 'She For Keeps' previously. Also, 'Boo'd Up' has received a remix treatment on two different occasions from Plies and Fetty Wap in the past. Co-produced by DJ Mustard, Ella's single from the third extended play, Ready, the original cracked the top 10 on the Hot 100 and went platinum recently.
6th week in the top 10. blessed. — Ella Mai (@ellamai) July 2, 2018

Mike Dutkewych is a tall and well-sideburned gentleman who you've seen around town — at shows, at record stores, or perhaps DJing your friend's wedding. He also runs a down and dirty monthly soul dance party in Wyandotte. Soul Deep happens every third Friday at the Rockery.
Last month, the night celebrated its lucky seven-year anniversary, so we caught up with Dutkewych, who grew up Downriver, who "was a musician in a former life," and fell in live with soul music when he heard "Heat Wave" as a teen (a story he relayed to us last month when we posted a list of top dance-floor movers from his night).
Metro Times: How did the night get started?
Mike Dutkewych: Soul Deep actually started by accident, as the best things often do. My friend Marybeth was bartending Sunday nights at this dive in Wyandotte. It was her slowest shift so she invited me to come play some soul records, so long as I promised to drag all of our friends out to her bar. That was January 2010 and what was supposed to be this one-off soul night has been going on in Wyandotte ever since. In 2012 I moved from that shithole dive bar to a way cooler one a few blocks away called the Rockery, where I host Soul Deep every third Friday.
MT: What kind of music do you play at your night?
Dutkewych: 1950s and '60s soul, rhythm and blues, early rock 'n' roll. Some garage. Of course, a lot of Motown. All played at glorious 45 rpm.
MT: Why did you choose that name?
Dutkewych: I put basically zero thought into the name. It's actually not in reference to the Box Tops song, but a BBC documentary series on black music I'd seen a few years earlier. I just needed a title for that first Sunday night so I could promote it, and somehow "soul deep" was the first thing that came to mind. I had no idea it would even go 'til last call, let alone seven years and counting. I might've chosen a name more carefully.
MT: What separates your night from other soul nights?
Dutkewych: First, let me say I'm really happy to be a part of this tight community of music enthusiasts and collectors in Detroit. How lucky are we to live in a place that was not only ground zero for some of the best, most important American music of the 20th century, but one that still has multiple events every month dedicated to showcasing and celebrating it? Pretty lucky, I think. So, shout out to Stoke-on-Campau Soul Club and Motor City Soul Club. Richie and Adam from Stoke play records with me at Soul Deep quite often. Brad and Erica from MCSC have too.
As far as what makes Soul Deep different, I think the key component is Downriver. It's hard to explain the singularity and steely charm of that area, especially to people from other parts of town who wouldn't normally drive that far south on 75. Downriver is no frills. The working-class, underdog thing just permeates everything — even a bar full of twentysomethings dancing to some dude's soul record collection. After having grown up there and escaped it, I've developed a more romantic perspective on the place. The things I love about the MC5 or the Bad Boys-era Pistons are the same things I love about Downriver.
And I hadn't really considered this before, but I think the records I play at Soul Deep are a total reflection of the environment it's grown in over the last seven years. You hear a lot more down-and-dirty, one-wailing-sax R&B at Soul Deep than you would at one of the other soul nights in Detroit. I don't play much Northern Soul. Not a lot of pretty strings or polished horn sections on my records. I mean, that stuff is great, but it doesn't often hit me on that primordial level, so I usually don't reach for it. My playbox is Downriver as hell.
MT: Are DJs musicians?
Dutkewych: Well, let me make one obvious distinction: Even though what I do falls in line with the traditional definition of a disc jockey — selecting and playing recorded music for an audience — I think now the term applies more to hip-hop artists, turntablists, etc. I would definitely consider those DJs to be musicians. Me and my friends, not so much. Having good taste in music and the equipment to play somebody else's song in front of a crowd doesn't really make you a musician.
MT: How does your work in the field of archives relates to music work for you?
Dutkewych: By day I work for Wayne State University Libraries, where I recently earned a master's degree in information science. I landed there in large part due to these extracurricular pursuits in music. Very quickly, collecting records expanded into a serious interest in preservation, particularly the digitization of analog formats like vinyl and magnetic tape.
Even though these days most anything is a few clicks away online, there is still an immeasurable amount of audio history that is sitting locked on old media that is rapidly deteriorating. Tape in particular is reaching the point of no return, not only because the physical artifacts are degrading more with each passing day, but because there are fewer and fewer people who can operate and maintain the obsolete equipment required to play them. So digitization is vital to the long-term preservation of this material.
For me, there are few things as fulfilling as being able to contribute in some small way to the protection of these cultural works that I find so much value in. Preserving them and making them accessible to people who couldn't have appreciated them otherwise, it's a great feeling.
It's the same feeling I get watching a bar full of strangers dances to my favorite forgotten soul records.
Soul Deep dance parties take place the third Friday of every month at the Rockery; Starts at 10 p.m.; 1175 Eureka Rd., Wyandotte; facebook.com/souldeepsunday; no cover. The next one is this Friday, Feb. 17.

Banks in the state were closed to customers on Wednesday as bank employees went on a two-day strike demanding wage revision.
Over 5,500 employees in the state working in 21 public sector banks and few private sector banks were reported to have participated in the strike, bringing banking services to a halt.
Local bank unions claimed that the strike was 100 per cent successful even as they reiterated that the strike would continue on Thursday also. “The strike evoked good response as all bank employees participated in it,” said A Pereira, general secretary, Goa Bank Employees Association. He said that cash and clearing transactions came to a grinding halt.
Large private sector banks such as HDFC, Axis, ICICI, PMC, however continued to function normally as they are outside the ambit of the strike call. With most banks topping up their ATMs on Tuesday evening there were no complaints of shortage of cash or ATMs running dry.
Santosh Haldankar, state convenor of United Forum of Bank Unions, said the strike was observed by all employees as none reported for work. He however said that few scale-IV officers and higher may have attended office although no work was done due to absence of cashiers and other staff.
According to local bank unions, the staffs of nationalised banks wholeheartedly helped the government in making the Jan Dhan Yojana, demonetisation, MUDRA scheme successful but in return the government (Indian Banks Association) proposed only a two per cent increase in salary.
Public sector banks are on a nation-wide strike demanding wage revision that is due from November 1, 2017. The unions' charter of demands include wage revision for all officers and not just scale I, II and III officers. On Wednesday morning, members of different bank unions held protest rally from Azad Maidan in the city.
Wildsight is concerned about the commercial harvesting of wild huckleberries in this area, something new that hasn't occurred before. In a press release from the environmental group, it is stated that roughly 30 harvesters are working in the Yahk area, picking hundreds of pounds of berries per day, while crews in the Bountiful area are removing entire huckleberry bush branches to pick the berries off at home.
There is no regulation governing commercial harvesting in general, although an investigation into the removal of plants under 46 of the Forest and Range Practices Act has begun, according to the press release.
The release goes on to say that thousands of pounds of huckleberries per day are crossing the border at Kingsgate, with roughly half that quantity coming from the Yahk camp, according to Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resources staff.
Wildsight believes the harvesters plan to follow the berry crop in the East Kootenay until the first frost, clearing out entire areas, and leaving few berries for bears or people picking for their own use.
The chief concern is the health of the grizzly population in the area, which relies on huckleberries. The Yahk grizzly population is listed as threatened.
“With grizzlies eating well over a thousand pounds of berries per year to fatten up for their winter hibernation,” said John Bergenske, Wildsight Conservation Director. “We're worried that some bears might struggle to find enough berries in their territories because of the scale of the commercial harvest.”
“This commercial harvest is not respectful to the spirit of the berries and not respectful to the other animals who could be eating the berries,” says Bonnie Harvey of the Ktunaxa Nation, who saw a large bin of culled berries rotting in the sun at the Yahk camp.
“If we respect the spirit of the berry, it will be able to feed people, feed the bears, and feed all living things,” says Harvey, “but if we disrespect the berry, it won't provide in future years.”
“Picking your own huckleberries is a long-standing part of our culture, balanced with people and other animals on the land, but large-scale commercial harvest threatens to throw the system out of balance,” said Bergenske. “We need to stop or at the very least regulate commercial harvest of wild foods to make sure there is enough for everyone. Just as hunters cannot sell wild meat, people should not be harvesting unlimited quantities for sale.”

Nokia which had slipped from the heights of mobile handset business in the country, has become profitable again in just over a year of relaunch of its phones, a top company official said here today.
"We are already profitable in India," Amit Goyal, the global business head( north & east) of HMD Global, which is the global licensee of Nokia brand, said here today at the launch of three handsets in the east.
However, he did not elaborate and did not divulge the number of handsets the Finland-based company shipped to India, where the distribution of Nokia phones is handled by the company's affiliate entity TNS Mobile India.
HMD Global is the global licensee of the Nokia brand for a 10-year period.
Goyal said globally 70 million units were sold in 2017 and feature phones accounted for a major share of it. The company will continue to focus on this segment as 50 per cent of the domestic market is ruled by it.
Nokia has five feature phones and eight smartphone models which have been either launched or announced. More models will follow to strengthen its foothold in India, one of the top three markets globally.
"We want to be present in all the segments of the phone market. The future rollouts will also cater to diverse segments," he said adding Nokia aspires to be one of the top three handset brands in India and globally but did not give any timeframe.
He said it was an exciting journey to create an infrastructure of 550 distributors that serves about a lakh retail points in such a short time.
The company is yet to firm up any exclusive Nokia store strategy.
The new Nokia 6, Nokia 7 Plus and Nokia 8 Sirocco were launched today.
Only Nokia 8 Sirocco is not made in India, Goyal said.
He said the company would follow one price strategy for both online and offline.
"We will sell online through own company site and tie-ups with major e-tailers," Goyal added.
The University of Iowa is proposing a 7 percent increase in tuition annually for five years.
The Iowa City Press-Citizen reports university President Bruce Harreld told a Board of Regents Tuition Task Force on Monday that the school was recommending the annual 7 percent increases. If approved, the increases would raise tuition from $7,486 for the upcoming year to $10,537 by the fall 2022 semester.
Harreld also proposed raising nonresident undergraduate tuition by just over 2 percent annually for the next five years.
Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa also have proposed tuition increase to meet rising costs at a time of falling state support.
Snapchat is on track to hold the biggest-ever initial public offering of stock for a Los Angeles company, yet none of the region's major start-up investors stand to profit.
Of the nearly $3 billion that Snap Inc. has raised from investors for technology and hiring ahead of next month's expected IPO, almost none of it has come from Los Angeles financiers.
The county's leading venture capital firms — the investors that technology entrepreneurs often turn to for money and advice — knew the photo-messaging app had become a hit among teenagers. But for a variety of reasons, they passed on financially supporting the company.
Between Snapchat's founding at Stanford University in the spring of 2011 and its rise to the global stage in 2013, Los Angeles firms had a short window to get a sizable piece of the company.
At Upfront Ventures, the largest start-up investor based in Los Angeles, associate James Bailey urged managing partner Mark Suster to take a meeting with Snapchat. But Suster dismissed the app as tool for sexting and furthering marital infidelity.
CrossCut Ventures and Clearstone Venture Partners didn't have enough free cash to make a bet on Snapchat. For many firms including Baroda Ventures, CT Ventures and Rustic Canyon Partners, a chat app with no business plan in sight didn't fit the profile of a company they'd back.
“We did not see the real revenue potential back then,” CT's Alex Suh said.
The missed opportunities don't amount to a damning indictment of the region's ability to spot world-changing start-ups. If anything, they illustrate how much of an anomaly Snapchat maker Snap Inc. is by technology industry standards.
But the lack of local representation means that hundreds of millions of dollars in possible investment profits, as early shareholders now become free to sell their holdings, will instead flow through Silicon Valley, bolstering the region's booming start-up scene.
“You'd have to be an idiot to say I'm not bummed, but we're very positive on the emergence of Snapchat,” Suster said.
Stanford University fraternity brothers Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy began working while students there on what would become one of the world's most used photo-and-video-sharing apps.
The university has long bred start-ups and connected students to the tech industry. Spiegel and Murphy took advantage. One of Spiegel's classes introduced him to top industry leaders, including Alphabet's Eric Schmidt. And Murphy worked at a San Francisco start-up during the early days of Snapchat.
In 2013, the pair planted corporate headquarters in Los Angeles, where Spiegel grew up and saw potential for Snapchat to benefit from its cultural diversity and Hollywood connections. But their acquaintances and roots remained in the San Francisco Bay Area, said William Quigley, a managing partner at Clearstone.
The ties included the company's first funding — a nearly $500,000 check from Silicon Valley shop Lightspeed Venture Partners that valued Snapchat at about $4 million. Lightspeed partner Barry Eggers had heard that the app was taking off in Southern California high schools (Spiegel's young cousin in Orange County had been among early promoters).
Eggers shared the tip with his colleague Jeremy Liew, who tried repeatedly to get in touch with Spiegel before sending a Facebook message and getting a quick reply. Spiegel responded in part because Liew's profile picture with President Obama made him seem legitimate. Needing cash to expand the company to keep up with huge usage growth, Spiegel accepted Lightspeed's investment.
As part of the IPO, Lightspeed could generate a 5,000-fold return on its initial investment. A 20-times return is enough to be considered a success.
Snapchat wanted more money at the end of 2012, and Liew and other Bay Area connections had already made the start-up the talk of the town despite its base in Los Angeles.
“They had the luxury of picking who they wanted to work with,” said Peter Lee, managing partner at Baroda Ventures.
Spiegel also held a “a relatively dim view of Los Angeles venture capitalists' ability to understand the opportunity and advise on tactical choices,” said Bailey, now managing partner of Velos Partners. “Right or wrong, he felt they were out of touch on social and mobile platforms.”
Silicon Valley venture capital firms held stronger reputations, longer track records and deeper pockets, now with several $1-billion funds compared to L.A.'s none.
“Los Angeles firms couldn't compete in that realm,” Lee said.
CrossCut Ventures was managing about $5 million, a pittance compared with the $425-million fund of Benchmark, Snap's eventual investor in its early 2013 financing. CrossCut was telling potential investors in its fund that there would be a big company in Los Angeles someday, not realizing it would be the one already down the street, managing partner Rick Smith said. But he's among those who say Snap is an aberration because of its move from Stanford, the timing and its unique service.
Clearstone's Quigley knew that the Snapchat investment would be expensive and didn't try to get a meeting with the company.

At Upfront, Bailey saw his two brothers — one of whom was in Spiegel's Stanford fraternity — open the app 15 times a day during vacation. Bailey told Suster of the rabid usage and Snapchat's key differences from Facebook.
But Suster felt troubled about backing a company associated with sexting, since the self-destructing messaging app first gained attention as a way to more securely send nude photos. In the back of his mind was a pitch he'd recently heard from TigerText, a disappearing text-messaging app he said was named after golfer Tiger Woods, whose philandering had been documented in raunchy texts.
Though people still use Snapchat for those reasons, the company added photo editing and entertainment features that turned the app into much more than a sexting service.
“I thought Snapchat was picture-based TigerText,” Suster said. “I wrote it off and didn't take it seriously. But I don't feel too badly about it. It was just a wrong judgment call.”
Snap declined to comment for this story.
Other Los Angeles investors passed because their aversion to “a moonshot mentality” encourages safer investments, said David Siemer, managing partner at Santa Monica investment group Wavemaker Partners.
“You will miss a Snapchat but you will also miss a whole bunch of zeroes," he said, referring to exciting start-ups that flame out and don't produce profits for investors. “It would be very unlikely that we invested in a company that needs $100 million to get to one penny of revenue.”
Silicon Valley funds with more cash to spend and powerful industry relationships can afford a different mentality.
A chemical that can be used to make the nerve agent sarin was exported from Switzerland to Syria with the approval of Swiss authorities, the economic affairs department in Bern acknowledged Tuesday.
The shipment of the chemical isopropanol to a private Syrian pharmaceutical firm seemed plausible at the time of the approval in June 2014, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) told Swiss news agency sda, confirming a report by French-speaking public broadcaster RTS.
SECO added that it has since changed its position.
"Following the latest events related to reported chemical weapons use, and the massive deterioration of the situation in recent years, such an export would most likely be halted," it said.
Isopropanol, which is freely available in Europe and often used as a solvent, can also be used to manufacture sarin, a nerve agent which has killed more than 100 people in the Syrian war.
In May 2014, a joint mission of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the United Nations confirmed that all of Syria's state-owned stocks of the chemical had been destroyed.
However, the international treaty that bans chemical weapons does not ban isopropanol, RTS reported. Stocks held by Syria's pharmaceutical industry were not covered by the treaty and were not destroyed, according to SECO.
Exports of the same chemical from Belgium have triggered an investigation into possible illegal foreign sales against three companies, Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said last week.

It says something about Travis Green's readiness to run an NHL bench that the focus is on how he can coax a transitioning Canucks roster to reach the next level of development and who his assistants may be.
And he doesn't even have the gig — yet.
Unless management serves up a curveball, its pitch to land a replacement for the fired Willie Desjardins to work with youth in a firm-but-fair manner is right in Green's wheelhouse.
He's the right coach at the right time. After four seasons of directing the Utica Comets — including a Calder Cup final appearance in the 2014-15 season and being considered for NHL head-coaching vacancies in Anaheim and Denver last summer — he can point to two examples of why he meets the criteria here.
They're named Sven Baertschi and Jake Virtanen.
As a WHL assistant coach, Green had a good book on Baertschi, when he put up 34- and 33-goal seasons with the Portland Winterhawks between 2010-12. It was before the winger's falling-out with the Calgary Flames and before Desjardins showed patience that allowed Baertschi to become a top-six fixture with a career-high 18 goals this season.
“You have to give players the opportunity and it should be a prolonged look to give the player confidence that you believe in him,” Green said after Baertschi had seven goals and eights assists in 15 regular-season AHL games and then eight goals and seven assists in 21 games en route to the Cup final.
“I have a lot of belief in Sven. He has a chance to be a top-six forward and play on your power play because he deserves the chance. Of all the kids I've had, there are a handful who I have said should play in the NHL and he's one of them.”
That was two years ago.
Baertschi was taught how to be safer with the puck, when to make the right pass coming out of his own zone and how to be just as effective without the puck. Today, Baertschi is a more confident and complete NHL mainstay and the 24-year-old Swiss native shouldn't have any trouble buying into what Green may be selling next fall.
It should be the same with Virtanen.
Despite just nine goals and 10 assists in 65 games with the Comets this season, the right winger made two giant leaps. He played a more complete game, so he can become more responsible and effective at this level. And he made a commitment to conditioning to get his weight down to 213 pounds from 231 at training camp.
It wasn't an easy exercise for the teacher or the pupil. But if Virtanen can start the climb back to Canucks roster prominence on the fourth line next season and eventually become that trustworthy power forward the franchise is craving, then what Green accomplished in Utica shouldn't be undersold.
“Jake is still a young guy (20) and people forget that,” stressed Green. “He went through a stretch where I know he was getting frustrated because he wasn't getting the points. And that was a good time to break it down to him that the goals and assists will be a byproduct of doing things to be a difference in a game.”
And when that sunk in, it resulted in a two-goal game April 1.
“When young players don't have success it can sometimes look like they really don't want it,” added Green. “And for some, it's hard. They're in and out, and their compete levels go up and down. They tend to take their foot off the gas and you have to make them accountable.”
Accountable on and off the ice. It wasn't unusual for Green to have Virtanen riding the bike after games to drive home performance and conditioning points.
“It hasn't been all roses for Jake,” said Green. “We've been very honest with him, but he's confident his game is going in the right direction even though it's hard sometimes. It can help a player play outside his comfort zone.”
What's of comfort to any head coach knows he has familiarity and a collective focus behind the bench. If Green gets the head Canucks' job, that will mean gaining a working relationship with assistant coach Doug Jarvis, who was retained, and finding the right replacements for the departed Perry Pearn and Doug Lidster.
Lidster and Desjardins worked together for two seasons with the Texas Stars of the AHL. Green and Nolan Baumgartner have been on the same Utica staff the last four seasons and the former NHL defenceman — Baumgartner was a first-round 1994 pick of the Washington Capitals — might make a good replacement to run the back end.
There could also be a connection that allows Dave Lowry to serve as a Canucks assistant or run the bench in Utica. He not only played in Vancouver with current Canucks general manager Jim Benning and director of collegiate scouting Stan Smyl, he also served as a Calgary Flames assistant for three seasons and the last five as bench boss of the Victoria Royals of the WHL.

1909
Look out for your cattle and dogs … The Pound and Dog Tax Bylaw will be rigidly enforced on and after the 27th inst. It is up to the citizens to see to it that they pay their dog tax and that cattle and horses are kept from wandering about the streets. The Herald is informed that the authorities will enforce these bylaws to the limit and it hopes they will.
Curfew will ring … On April the first the curfew bell will ring and it will ring with a purpose. All children who are on the streets, unaccompanied by their parents, or guardians, will, after nine o'clock, be made to go home. The Herald hopes that the curfew bylaw will be rigidly enforced.
Appleland … Chance for People of Small Means to be Independent.
Westward the course of empire takes its way, but by the rule of contraries the fruit growing industry of the Okanagan moved westward to Nelson and its vicinity, invaded, profitably invaded, Creston and its neighborhood and is now entrenched still further east around Cranbrook where what was open, park-like, timbered land of a few years ago is now opening out in stretches of clearings where the apple tree will soon entirely replace the pine and the larch.
It seems to be an axiom of men skilled in fruit culture that a soil which carries a top growth of heavy timber with an undergrowth of wild gooseberry, Oregon grapes and wild currant is the ideal home for the apple, pear, plum, cherry and prune. That principle was not so clearly recognized when the Kings started their first mill close by the C.P.R. tracks and about two miles outside the city, some eight or nine years ago; but the other day the surveyors were busy on a sub-division of the half section surrounding the old mill site.
The mill is moved elsewhere long since, but the shacks are still in place with a lot of open ground about them.
Formerly it was Lot 3575 of East Kootenay, better known as Kennedy's pre-emption, but in future, so the Herald man was informed, it will be known as Appleland.
It will certainly prove worthy of the name.
Appleland is just two miles southwest from Cranbrook with the tracks of the C.P.R, cutting across one corner of it.
Beside the tracks is the siding of the King Lumber Mills Co. and their own logging railway runs for quite a distance through the lot following the course of Smith's creek up to Smith's lake, where they have their big sawmill and logging camp.
The lake sits in a wide basin amongst the low foothills.
The only sound of the axe as it falls on the timber one hears around there is the snick and the whine of the big saws down in the mill.
The creek runs from the lake and tears bravely down a little valley of its own through land that has been all cleared of the heavier timber and is now being cleared of the smaller stuff.
The entire 320 acres of Appleland has been sub-divided into 5 acre lots, each lot having its own water right from both lake and creek.
Jackson creek, to the northeast of the land, can also be placed under requisition if necessary, but it is astonishing how little artificial irrigation is required for the foothills running north and south from Sunnyside.
It is well to have it, but it is not essential, as water can be got any place at a depth of ten or twelve feet.
The general exposure of the land is southerly and westerly, assuring in the summertime some 15 or 17 hours of maturing sunlight.
Clearing is easy, the railway tracks are literally at the door, trails and wagon roads are everywhere through the lots and Cranbrook with its unfailing market is within two miles.
The ideal home which William Hamilton has made for himself at Sunnyside can be duplicated fifty times over in peace, ease and comfort at Appleland.
At the pictures …Since the advent of the new machine the pictures at the Edison have been far superior to anything before shown in Cranbrook. “Mr. Fuzz”, a beautifully colored film, and the “Fireman” have been the leading features this week. Tomorrow and Saturday night the pictures of the Italian earthquake will be the main subject.
Board of Trade … Every man who owns a lot or a house or lot in Cranbrook should be a member of the Board of Trade. Men whose time is worth several dollars a day are devoting a good deal of that tune for the advancement of Cranbrook and the district without any remuneration whatever. The least that a property owner can do is to pay his $2.00 to help those men in their work.
Fink going into furniture … The Fink Mercantile Co., Ltd., one of the best, known mercantile houses in the district, have decided to add the furniture line to their business. This means a whole lot to the people of this district.
Whenever the Fink Mercantile company attempts to do anything they accomplish results.
With this new departure in view they will immediately start to change the arrangements of their big store to accommodate this new line.
Mr. Fink, the manager of the company, will soon go east for the purpose of making the selections of stock, and it goes without saying that it will be one of the best ever offered for sale in this district.
Not only will the idea to place the prices of stock be one of the best, but this new line on a basis that will prove attractive to every family in Cranbrook and the district.
“We can sell furniture at low prices in this town and still make a reasonable profit,” said Mr. Fink.
“Cranbrook is growing and the need of furniture is also growing. We want to supply the demand and at prices that will suit the conditions of the community.
“Our stock will be complete in every respect and we simply ask those who contemplate buying furniture to wait until our invoice arrives and I feel assured that we can satisfy the people.”
Spring … One of the greatest harbingers of spring is the inauguration of the game of golf. They are playing in Cranbrook now.
Baseball … There are not many places in British Columbia or Western Canada where they can play baseball at the beginning of March. Yet a game was played in Cranbrook the other day. Yes, this is the banana belt.
New stock … Patmore Brothers are adding to their stock of bicycles, a complete line of high grade baby coach carts, reclining and folding go-carts and English perambulators. Also the genuine Glasscocks baby walkers. These goods are extra quality and are to be sold at a price that you cannot afford to pass up. Leave your order today, for perambulators with them. You will be satisfactorily served.
For sale … Seven-roomed House, with woodshed, workshop, cellar, well with pump, good water, good stable, three hen pens and yard; stands on one acre of ground, newly fenced, next to Sash and Door Factory and Golf Grounds. Price $1,000. Apply to Wm. Slater. Also furniture for sale.
Creston news … John McLeod, superintendent of Fisheries, came in from Nelson Monday. His visit is in connection with the recent law enacted that will prevent the owners of sawmills from dumping sawdust and other waste in the rivers and lakes, thus killing off large quantities of fish and severely damaging one of the principal assets of the province.
The home of up-to-date tailoring … in spring Nature creates anew in field and forest. What more fitting time to discard the somber dress of winter and array oneself in clothes which fittingly reflect the joy of life outdoors under sunny skies. Your careful review of our spring exhibit will suggest an appropriate selection. Leask & Henderson, the Up-To-Date Tailors.
One of the renowned Malawi Hip Hop artists known by the name Martse (real name Martin Nkhata) is set to release his first album since he ventured into the music industry.
The album which is tittle “Truth only” is expected to be released end of March, will comprise almost 14 songs.
Speaking in an interview earlier, Martse said the journey to the album production has been so good.
“I am happy I will release an album. I had chances of releasing it earlier but due to some other business that kept me busy, I did not. This time all is set for the debut album,” said Martse.
Martse is one of the well-known Hip Hop artists who have shown much interest in going deep with the Hip Hop genre, he has been releasing songs like “Mwano ” which he featured Kelly Kay.
He also produced Anyapapi which featured Sonye. He also produced many other songs which became popular on different media platforms across the country.
“My fans should expect good music from this album as I have tried my best to give out the best music that I can manage, and I hope they will enjoy it as they know what type of music I have been singing,” said the Hip Hop star.
The Department of Space has been allocated Rs 8,936.97 crore in the Budget for various space-related projects. It has also been tasked to achieve certain targets — deliver three earth observation, two communication satellites — next fiscal.
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on 1 February presented the 2018-19 Union Budget.
The total allocation for the Department of Space for next fiscal is around Rs 10,783 crore (including the Rs 8,936.97 crore) — up from Rs 9,155.52 crore allocated for 2017-18 net of recoveries and receipts.
The space department has been tasked to deliver three earth observation spacecrafts ready for launch; four Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) flights; one each of Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle MkII and Mk III. A sum of Rs 6,576.02 crore has been allocated for this purpose next year, as per the budget papers.
For the purpose of completion and launch of two communication satellites next fiscal a sum of Rs 411.60 crore has been allotted.
Under the design and development of applications for earth observation, communication, and disaster management scheme for which Rs 1,746.25 has been allocated, the Department of Space has to deliver nine earth observation/communications payloads; information support for five disaster events; 8,500 maps to support national missions and users projects and 300,000 value-added products disseminated to users.
A sum of Rs 230.10 crore has been allocated for undertaking space science missions and interplanetary expeditions under which the Department of Space has to deliver: Indian lunar mission/Chandrayaan-II; readiness of two sub-systems for Aditya-L1 mission; 35 publications from space science missions; release of two terabytes of space science-related data to public utilisation; 250 research projects in academia supported through Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) programmes.
According to the budget papers, the medium term tasked outcome for Department of Space are — augmentation of space infrastructure for providing continuity of earth observation services with improved capabilities; ensuring operational launch services for domestic and commercial satellites; self-sufficiency in launching four ton class of communication satellites into Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit; self-sufficiency in launching 2.5- 3 ton class of communication satellites into Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit.
The Department of Space has to develop an indigenous capability for design and development of space infrastructure for the better understanding of the universe.
According to the Economic Survey tabled in Parliament recently, the country's share in the global satellite launch services revenue went up to 1.1 percent in 2015-16 from 0.3 percent in 2014-15.
The survey states that Antrix Corporation — the commercial arm of ISRO - foresees greater utilisation of rockets like PSLV, GSLV-MkII and GSLV MkIII by the international community for launching their Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites.
In the case of satellite launching, as on March 2017, PSLV successfully launched 254 satellites. Foreign exchange earnings of India from the export of satellite launch services increased noticeably in 2015-16 and 2016-17 to Rs 394 crore and Rs 275 crore from Rs 149 crore in 2014-15.
In a recent interview with IANS, ISRO Chairman K. Sivan said India will be using its own rockets for launching communication satellites and reduce the use of satellite launch services of foreign space agencies.
This, in turn, would reduce the outgo of foreign exchange.

Cristiano Ronaldo scored and was sent off as Real Madrid beat a Barcelona side missing Neymar by winning 3-1 in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Sunday.Ronaldo, only introduced as a second-half substitute, was shown two quickfire yellow cards after blasting Madrid into a 2-1 lead with 10 minutes to go.However, Real extended their advantage with 10 men thanks to a sumptuous late strike from Marco Asensio.Earlier, Lionel Messi's penalty had cancelled out Gerard Pique's own goal as Barça failed to get the early season boost they needed from Neymar's departure for Paris Saint-Germain.The sides meet again in Madrid for the second-leg on Wednesday."I am proud of the players because even with 10 men they played great," said Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane, who was hopeful Madrid could appeal Ronaldo's red card to free him up for the second leg.The World Player of the Year was booked for taking off his shirt in celebration after scoring and just two minutes later saw a second yellow card when referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea adjudged he had dived in attempting to win a penalty.However, Ronaldo could be in more trouble as he pushed the referee in the back after being shown the 10th red card of his career."He didn't feign anything at any moment," protested Madrid captain Sergio Ramos."You have to appeal because to send off a key player with 10 minutes to go in a Clasico (the referee) had to evaluate the situation in a different way."Without Neymar, Barça struggled to find their rhythm going forward as Gerard Deulofeu failed to impress in the role alongside Messi and Luis Suarez up front."It's a very adverse result and we have to accept that they are the favourites now," admitted new Barça boss Ernesto Valverde as his reign started in disappointment."But we need to play the second game. Everything doesn't just come to an end after one defeat."The game exploded into life after the break, following an uncharacteristically quiet first 45 minutes.Madrid immediately upped a gear at the start of the second period and were rewarded with the opening goal in a manner that would have delighted most Real fans.Pique is often Madrid's chief aggravator, but the Spanish international was left embarrassed as he turned Marcelo's delivery past the helpless Ter Stegen into his own net.Only an incredible goal line clearance from Jordi Alba then prevented Dani Carvajal from doubling Madrid's advantage seconds later as the game began to open up.Ronaldo had been kept in reserve by Zidane, having missed most pre-season after his participation in the Confederations Cup with Portugal, but was finally introduced for an action-packed cameo appearance on the hour mark.With Mateo Kovacic also replaced by Asensio, Messi was given more licence to create and led Barça back into the game as Sergio Busquets somehow blazed over from close range before Messi stung the palms of Keylor Navas.The Argentine eventually got on the scoresheet from the penalty spot after Navas brought down Suarez inside the area 13 minutes from time.However, Madrid took just three minutes to retake the lead in stunning fashion as Ronaldo cut inside Pique before curling into the top corner.And with Barça pushing forward, Madrid picked the hosts off on the counter-attack when Asensio blasted into the top corner from the edge of the box as the game entered stoppage time to all but assure they will lift the Super Cup for a 10th time.
As Lainey posted earlier, Katy and Orlando were spotted at an Ed Sheeran concert. I was ready to post about the concert because you know that song, that Ed Sheeran wedding song?

Maybe Kristen's #nokidspolicy should expand to commenting on #otherpeoplesmarriages.
Liam Gallagher has been doing loads of press for his new solo album, and the interviews always have a Noel aspect. Sometimes he is nostalgic, sometimes he is angry, most of the time it's downright funny. In an interview with Noisey, Liam was asked about Noel chatting up Brad Pitt backstage at Glastonbury and he said, “Oh f-ckin' hell. He's like a f-ckin' stalker him, man. ‘Quick! Grab me a famous person!' F-ckin' cringe, man. Bradley f-ckin' Cooper and sh-t like that? F-ckin' sit down, mate. Working class traitor. Go on.” Later in the interview, he said: “I'm living in the f-ckin' real world. I've got my kids, I've got my rock'n'roll, I've got my vibe. You've got Bradley Cooper, you c-nt.” He called Brad Pitt Bradley Cooper. TWICE.
Pushed by its new Republican chairman, Ajit Pai, who seems to have never met a regulation he didn't want to kill, the Federal Communications Commission has proposed repealing the tough net neutrality rules his predecessor, Democrat Tom Wheeler, adopted in 2015 and replacing them with … well, that part's not clear. One possibility Pai floated is to have the FCC punt oversight of broadband providers such as Comcast and AT&T to the Federal Trade Commission, which can do little more to first-time offenders than tell them they'll be punished if they transgress again.
Pai's retreat would be the fifth pivot by the commission since phone and cable TV companies introduced always-on, high-speed Internet connections in the late 1990s. The regulatory gyrations haven't damaged the open, innovative nature of the Internet, at least not yet. But the uncertainty isn't helpful, and it isn't likely to end if Pai gets his way. The next time a Democrat takes the White House, a new FCC chairman will almost certainly push more vigorous efforts to prevent Comcast, AT&T and company from putting their thumbs on the Internet scales.
The obvious answer — and it has been obvious for years — is for Congress to prohibit broadband providers from picking winners and losers online by monkeying with the data on their networks, and to give the commission clear authority to enforce that prohibition. But lawmakers have been unwilling to arbitrate the dispute between broadband providers, which have toyed with the idea of extracting tolls from websites and services to support new business models, and Internet-based companies, which don't want to face any new barriers to competing online.
The heat generated by Pai's proposal — the commission has received 20 million public comments thus far, albeit many of them form letters generated by advocacy groups — and by congressional Republicans' controversial move to repeal the FCC's broadband privacy rules in March, might finally get Congress moving. Leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced last month that they would hold a hearing in September on “ground rules for the Internet.”
Pai's hands-off approach is the wrong answer.
“With almost everyone in agreement about fundamental principles to prevent anti-competitive behavior such as throttling and blocking, I think we are closer than ever to achieving a lasting resolution,” Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) said in a statement.
As encouraging as that may sound, the initial witness list for the hearing betrays a dismaying ignorance about why net neutrality is an issue. The committee set the hearing up as something of a clash of titans, inviting the chief executives of the largest broadband providers and the biggest Internet companies, such as Google, Facebook and Netflix. The only thing missing was a steel cage.
The point of having net neutrality rules isn't to protect multibillion-dollar Internet companies. It's to give other companies a chance to join or topple them. The rapid pace of technological change makes even companies with enormous economies of scale vulnerable to disruption, especially when consumers can easily switch from one shiny online object to the next.
No question, Facebook and its ilk would prefer not to have to pay Comcast or Verizon for priority access to its customers if broadband providers were allowed to impose such fees. But if push came to shove, those are the companies that could and would pay. The start-up trying to be the next Facebook could not.
Curiously, Pai and other Republicans have voiced less concern about the prospects of these smaller online businesses — the ones likely to inject a crucial dose of innovation into the 21st century economy — than the ability of giant, consolidating broadband providers to invest in faster, more widely available services. Better broadband connections in rural America, poverty-stricken inner cities and other underserved areas is a most worthy goal. But those connections shouldn't come at the cost of net neutrality.
Leading broadband providers insist that they support an open, neutral Internet. The problem, they say, is the utility-style regulations the Wheeler-led FCC imposed to achieve that end. The Democrats on the commission voted to do so, however, because a federal appeals court said it was the only route to enforceable rules that would prohibit broadband providers from blocking or slowing connections to lawful sites and services, or to prioritize connections for a fee.
Pai's hands-off approach is the wrong answer. If Republican lawmakers don't like applying decades-old utility-style regulation to broadband providers, they need to work with Democrats to give the commission explicit new authority to protect the open Internet from interference. Otherwise, the fight over how to do that will be always-on too.

Will Sushant Singh Rajput, Bhumi Pednekar's Sonchiriya revive forgotten Bollywood genre of dacoit films?
The unkempt scruffy bearded appearance coupled with red tilak on the forehead, a 303 resting on arms and cartridges adorning the Khaki attire will be actor Sushant Singh Rajput's look in his upcoming film Sonchiriya.
Guess his three week stay in the ravines, before the shoot, has worked magic in acing the look. The description defines the look of dreaded dacoits who once roamed the Chambal ravines and their very name spelled terror in the '70s and the '80s.
Abhishek Chaubey's Sonchiriya, which will feature Sushant in the role of a dreaded dacoit, will also be a tryst with the past. It would be after a gap of six years when Bollywood will step forward again to narrate the fictional story of a dacoit rooted in the Chambal of the '70s. The film becomes significant not for Sushant's transformation but for a wholly another reason. Sonchiriya also brings back a genre of film that have always been admired but somewhere got lost and deviated when Manmohan Singh unleashed his own ‘Perestroika and Glasnost' in the form of liberalization in the early 90s.
It is peculiar to know that Bollywood's previous rendezvous with the life of a dacoit was six years ago when Tigmanshu Dhulia's Paan Singh Tomar in 2012 hit theatres after a long wait. It might come as a surprise to many that the film which went on to garner both the Filmfare and the National Award spent sizeable years cooling its heels in cans on account of no buyers before UTV Motion Pictures rescued it. The story of an athlete-turned-dreaded Chambal dacoit was arresting from the word go and audiences reciprocated their love by flocking to theatres.
One reason which could also be attributed for Bollywood distancing itself from such stories could be the disappearance of dacoits themselves from the ravines. When their terror peaked in the '70s and the '80s, the government had no option save curbing their activities. With the surrender of dreaded dacoits like Mohar Singh, Malkhan Singh and Phoolan Devi, the ravines were not the same again. Consequently, news of their activities too took a hit in terms of reportage giving no fodder to writers. By the mid '90s, the bloody history of Chambal had become a footnote in the annals of modern Indian history. For Bollywood, with the emergence of a new world order, such stories were relegated to the background and entered villains who looked sophisticated with their impeccable clothing style.
The opening of the country or the liberalization unleashed by the then-government also saw the demise of this beloved genre. It is astonishing to know that the last great film that hit silver screens was way back in 1994 when Shekhar Kapur, with his film on Phoolan Devi, turned around the way with which films were viewed. The uncompromising attitude in its making and the undiluted portrayal of the stark reality of lives in ravines became the benchmark of films to come. Bandit Queen, based on author Mala Sen's acclaimed book, paved a way and defined a grammar sheet for future films.
In the '60s, '70s and '80s, this was one genre that guaranteed and spelled sure shot success. While the '60s was defined by Pran's unforgettable performance as Raka in Jis Desh Mein Ganga Bahti Hai, the following year it was the turn of tragedy king Dilip Kumar to redefine the genre once again with his stunning portrayal of Gunga in the evergreen Gunga Jumna. No one had a clue that a gun-totting Dilip Kumar would be as effective as a jilted lover.
With the advent of filmmakers like Raj Khosla and Sultan Ahmad, the dacoit genre truly garnered respect and standing. Films like Mera Gaon Mera Desh and Kuchhe Dhaage brought forward stories of dacoits that were rooted in the rural India and gave a sense to Indians that they were familiar with the milieu. The legacy of Raj Khosla was taken forward by Sultan Ahmad. Though his repertoire is made of just six films, most of them told saga of dacoits. It was Sultan Ahmad who first saw Amitabh Bachchan as a dacoit in Ganga Ki Saugandh.
With the mega success of Ramesh Sippy's Sholay, the wheel seemed to complete its circle. The story of two goons hired by a retired and handicapped police officer to catch a dacoit responsible for his family's death still remains the best this country has ever seen. It is also interesting to note that the superstars form the '60s and the '70s at least had one dacoit role that propelled them to dizzy stardom.
It was only in the '80s that the response towards films that had dacoits as the backdrop become delicate. It was also the era when parallel films had pulled people towards a different sort of reality and the VHS impact helped them expose an environment which was in tune with the changing world. The number of dacoit films drastically fell in the '80s. The old order was making way for the new order and new kids on the block were interested in telling stories that they themselves related to.
After the release of Bandit Queen, the number of such films that hit theatres can be counted on fingertips. In the new millennium, it was Rajkumar Santoshi who thought of putting life back into dacoits after the '90s was captured entirely by urban crooks in suave clothing. He brought back the element through China Gate and Lajja.
Abhishek Chaubey and Ronnie Screwvala, through Son Chiriya, have only made a feeble attempt to revive a genre which can only be considered as moribund. Success in Bollywood spawns many things, one only hopes Sushant and Bhumi Pednekar are able to pump life into the otherwise silent celluloid ravines.

A renowned professor raised in Hartlepool is set for a trip to Buckingham Palace today as she is awarded an MBE.
Professor Jane Nixon, who is deputy director of the Leeds Clinical Trials Research Unit, is being made a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for groundbreaking health research.
Professor Jane Nixon, from Hartlepool, who is to be awarded an MBE.
Despite now living in Leeds, Prof Nixon's roots remain firmly embedded in Hartlepool, having grown up on the Headland with parents Geoff and Margaret Bridel who ran a manufacturing company, Sleepmaker Ltd, for over 20 years in the town.
She began her career as a nurse at Hartlepool General Hospital and to this day still talks of the fact that her interest in health research was inspired by colleagues who set such a high standard in nursing care in her early days of nursing.
Prof Nixon fondly remembers Margaret Vasey, a matron at Hartlepool, who led major change and an environment of improvement in nursing care, Rosemary Bullmer who was an inspirational nurse tutor, Val Rhind a senior nurse manager who was a great influence and Roger Kirby, general surgeon who supported Jane in her early research career.
She remains friends today with Jan McVitie and Janet Baggett who worked as part of a fantastic theatre team at Cameron Hospital.
It was during these early days in nursing that as a ward sister in Hartlepool, working with older patients, she noticed some patients who went to the operating theatre would return to the ward with painful skin ulcers.
She gained a Masters in 1996 and PhD in 2001 whilst a senior nurse in the NHS, and moved to the University of Leeds and became deputy director of the Clinical Trials Research Unit in 2002.
From the start, Prof Nixon's research has been driven by challenging conventional thinking to improve the wellbeing of patients and looking at ways of reducing the risk of patients developing pressure ulcers while in hospital.
Since those early days, she has created a long-standing career in clinical trials research, first as an NHS-based chief investigator and since 2002 as deputy director of the Clinical Trials Research Unit.
During her career Prof Nixon has secured over £5million in research funding for multiple pressure ulcer prevention research trials and projects.
Her work has provided the foundation for practice change in critical areas such as patient safety, serious incident investigation and patient management.
She said: “I am delighted and honoured that my work is being recognised in such a prestigious way in the Queen's Birthday Honours.”
For the first time, this offseason, Los Angeles Chargers coach Anthony Lynn showed his tough guy demeanor.
The first-year Chargers coach put his players on blast after the team wrapped up their first day of a three-day minicamp on Tuesday.
“It didn't look very good today,” Lynn said, per the team's website. “(I) wasn't very pleased with the standard today . . .We just looked sluggish” Lynn said.
Lynn made another smart move yesterday as nothing but greatness should be tolerated. If the team wants to be a winning football team, they must expect everyone to be focused and ready to work every time they step on the football field.
With today's rules, fewer practices are making each one that much more valuable and important.
Fortunately, Lynn's frustration on Tuesday was more than enough for the Chargers to turn it up a notch today.
HC Anthony Lynn says today was "much better". Energy was back and defense had a really good day. — Los Angeles Chargers (@Chargers) June 14, 2017
Lynn thought that the team bounced back nicely after a sluggish day and looked “much better,” per the Chargers' official Twitter account.

(Reuters) - Breitburn Energy Partners LP (BBEPQ.PK) has received a $1.8 billion full cash offer from Lime Rock Resources, according to court papers filed on Friday, a surprise bid that could blow open the oil and gas producer's bankruptcy reorganization plan.
A four-day bankruptcy confirmation hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan ended last month after a bitter valuation battle between Breitburn and its shareholders.
Parties were awaiting a ruling from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein, who is overseeing the case, when Breitburn revealed in a letter to the judge that it had received the bid from Lime Rock, an oil basin acquirer and producer.
“The Lime Rock Resources team seeks to bid aggressively and to remain patient and flexible in negotiations,” the company said in a Jan. 31 letter to Breitburn that was filed with the court on Friday.
Houston, Texas-based Lime Rock's $1.8 billion “stalking horse” offer, which is an initial bid on a bankrupt company's assets, tops a $1.6 billion enterprise valuation by Breitburn's investment bank.
The official committee of equity holders said they believed Breitburn was worth $3.8 billion following a spike in oil prices since the company filed for bankruptcy in 2016. They argued in court that Breitburn had low-balled its valuation in order to favor creditors who stood to gain control over its assets.
Breitburn's reorganization plan envisioned splitting its assets into two companies, one created through a $775 million rights offering and the other through a debt-for-equity swap.
A group of unsecured creditors led by Elliott Management Corp and WL Ross & Co were set to own Breitburn's Permian Basin reserves in Texas through their participation in the rights offering, while creditors with $793 million of debt would own a second company with oil reserves in California, the Rocky Mountains, the U.S. Midwest and Southeast.
Following news of the Lime Rock bid, the equity committee asked the court to reopen the record to submit the new evidence and called for a hearing on Feb. 13.
The stakes are high for the equity holders because Breitburn is structured as a “master limited partnership,” which provides tax advantages when the company is profitable.
But when such companies file for bankruptcy, investors who hold their units can lose an entire investment and still be hit with a tax bill because the debt canceled in the bankruptcy is treated as income.
Breitburn said it has given Lime Rock until March 9 to complete due diligence.
Turkish airspace had the busiest day in its history on Sunday, July 1, as 5,087 flights crossed the country's airspace.

"I am very grateful to all my dear colleagues who have successfully managed the near 1 million kilometers of Turkish airspace," Ocak added.
SABİHA GÖKÇEN SEES ALL-TIME HIGH IN PASSENGER NUMBERS
Moreover, another record came for Istanbul's Sabiha Gökçen Airport, which was used by only 47,000 passengers when it was commissioned in 2001. The airport saw an all-time high in the number of passengers using the airport in one day. On Monday, July 2, 113,744 passengers landed at and departed from the airport occupied by 710 planes. This figure has been recorded as the highest number of daily passengers using the airport to date. On July 2, 75,157 passengers used the domestic lines, followed by 38,587 international passengers. The number of passengers using the airport, which hosted 31.3 million passengers last year, increased by 13 percent in the first five months of this year to 13.4 million in total, compared to the same period last year.

BJP president Amit Shah on Monday dismissed the calls for heads to roll in the Uttar Pradesh government over the death of 63 children in a government hospital in Gorakhpur, saying “this is not the first time such a tragedy has happened in our country.”Speaking at a rally in Bengaluru, Shah called the deaths an “accident” and said that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has already ordered a probe into the incident. “The state government has ordered a time-bound investigation into the deaths. We won't spare the guilty. We will fix accountability,” he said.The BJP chief also took pot-shots at the Congress, which has been demanding the resignation of Yogi Adityanath for the lapses at the hospital, saying that unlike the Congress, their government would not assign blame without a thorough probe.“It is Congress's job to ask for resignation. In a big country like India, there have been many such incidents in the past. This is not the first time,” he said.He also said that BJP's sincerity towards working for the poor should not be doubted based on just one incident. “Our intention to serve the poor must not be doubted based on just this one incident,” he said.Sixty three children suffering from Japanese encephalitis have died at BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur since August 7, including 30 kids within a span of 48 hours, allegedly over the lack of oxygen supply as the hospital failed to clear pending dues of Rs 68 lakh. The National Human Rights Commission has also sent a notice to the state government over the deaths.An under fire Adityanath, as well as union health minister JP Nadda, had visited the hospital on Sunday and promised exemplary action against those found guilty. The government has sacked the hospital's principal as well as the nodal officer for the encephalitis ward.To cool frayed tempers, the Narendra Modi government announced it would set up a regional medical centre at a cost of Rs 85 crore in Gorakhpur for conducting research on ailments that afflict children.

A revolutionary pilotless drone that can rescue casualties from battlefields has completed its first test mission.
Israel-based Tactical Robotics said The Cormorant could replace helicopter rescue missions - which currently puts pilots at risk.
As part of the demonstration at at a remote airfield in northern Israel earlier this month The Cormorant initially took off with a full cargo of military supplies then descended vertically, landing on the grass.
The cargo was then offloaded and the team put the patient in its place, then watched it take off again.

The Cormorant can fly at 112mph, has a mission weight of 1,520kg and can fly for 2.6 hours.
This milestone was announced at the Israel Combat Rescue and Emergency Medicine conference.
The test was carried out for the Israel Defence Force at Megiddo Airfeld in the Galilee on May 29 and offers huge hope for the future of rescue missions among warzones.
A monitor supplied by the IDFs chief surgeon Trauma Branch transmits vital information to the crews on the ground, in addition to a video camera for two-way communication with the patient.

Tactical Robotics explain the demonstration, a combination of cargo delivery and casualty evacuation, "rejects Cormorant's unique dual-role capability as the only UAS recognised by NATO to fulfill both cargo delivery and CasEvac missions."
They add: "As such, the aircraft is designed to exceed the standard reliability and handling qualities required of a typical, tactical UAS in order to meet the requirements to safely ferry human cargo back from the battlefield."
The Cormorant is one of the most functional autonomous drones to date and there are several other companies looking to give a more civilian approach to flying autonomous vehicles.
In January, AirSpaceX debuted its autonomous vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft called MOBi ONE and the autonomous air taxi Vahana -is set to hit cities as early as 2020.
New Delhi: The government on Monday strictly asked TV channels not to air advertisements selling and promoting condoms because these are "indecent especially for children" and can create "unhealthy practices" among them.
"It has been brought to the notice of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting that some channels carry advertisements of condoms repeatedly which are alleged to be indecent especially for children," an advisory from the ministry said.
The advisory invoked Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994, banning an "advertisement which endangers the safety of children or create in them any interest in unhealthy practices or shows them begging or in an undignified or indecent manner".
"In view of the above, all TV channels are hereby advised not to telecast the advertisements of condoms which are for a particular age group and could be indecent/inappropriate for viewing by children. Indecent, vulgar, suggestive, repulsive or offensive themes or treatment shall be avoided in all advertisements."
It said such advertisements may be telecast between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. to avoid exposure of such material to children.
"Any failure will attract action as per provisions of the rules," said the advisory.
The missive comes after the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) requested the ministry earlier this month to take a call on such ads and their telecast timing.
In September, a condom advertisement featuring Sunny Leone drew protests from a Surat-based group. The ad, which was displayed on hoardings across the city and carried a message in Gujarati "play but with love" was shared on social media by people. City-based group Hindu Yuva Vahini staged a protest at one of the locations where the hoarding was displayed.
During his opening speech, UAE's minister of finance Al Tayer stressed the need to develop sustainable government revenues by depending on alternative resources, controlling expenditure and adjusting financials to drive economic growth, while maintaining global financial and economic stability.
“The decline in oil prices in the UAE led to a number of opportunities for the economic restructuring, promoting economic diversification policies, which were laid down since the early eighties by the late Shaikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, followed by the guidance of His Highness Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan. These policies play an important role in promoting sources of income, building a knowledge based economy, with a strong spirit of excellence and innovation,” Al Tayer said at the meeting.

CRAWFORD
WILKES-BARRE — Despite winning a new sentencing hearing because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, a drifter convicted of murdering two people when he was a teenager should still get life in prison without parole, prosecutors argue in a recent court filing.
Kenneth Carl Crawford III, now 33, appealed his prison sentence, arguing that he is entitled to a new hearing because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that held mandatory life terms for juvenile murderers unconstitutional. Crawford was 15 at the time of the double murder in a trailer at a campground in Hollenback Township in July 1999.
Last April, Luzerne County Judge Fred A. Pierantoni III granted Crawford a new sentencing hearing. The proceeding is now set for Sept. 18.
Earlier this month, prosecutors filed a memorandum arguing that Crawford should again be sentenced to life without parole. The filing notes that while the Supreme Court found mandatory life sentences for juveniles were unconstitutional, the court did not outright forbid them.
A judge must take into account how “children are different” in considering a sentence, prosecutors wrote.
The filing details Crawford's level of criminal sophistication — he was using a false identity prior to being caught and at one point had a plan to escape the Luzerne County Correctional Facility — as well as the planning involved in the crime, which involved using a soda bottle as a silencer, and Crawford's lack of remorse.
Prosecutors also note that Crawford's entire sentence has not been vacated — he is also serving a consecutive sentence of 50½ to 101 years in prison on other counts including robbery and conspiracy.
“Judge (Patrick J.) Toole's intent should be clear to anyone, let along a reviewing court,” prosecutors wrote. “The court intended that (Crawford) remain incarcerated for a very long time for the heinous murders of Diana Algar and Jose Molina and the accompanying crimes for which (Crawford) was convicted.”
According to prosecutors, Crawford and an accomplice, David Lee Hanley, who was 18 at the time, were convicted of first-degree murder in the beating and shooting deaths of Algar, 39, and Molina, 33.
Prosecutors said Crawford and Hanley were drifters making their way through Pennsylvania when Algar picked them up on the side of the road in Sugarloaf Township. She brought them back to her trailer at the Paradise Campground, where she and Molina, her friend, offered them shelter, food and help getting bus tickets.
Instead, prosecutors say, Crawford and Hanley beat, shot and robbed the pair, whose bodies were found two days later in a back bedroom.
In a letter filed in court, Crawford's attorney, Sara Jacobson, says Crawford is a changed man. The letter cites mitigating factors including that Crawford's mother abandoned him to his alcoholic father, who was later accused of molesting his sister.
When he was 12, Crawford ran away to find his mother, an “itinerant carnival worker,” according to the letter. From then on, Crawford was on his own, travelling with carnivals and sometimes reuniting with his mother until she chose a “boyfriend-of-the-moment over Ken,” the letter says.
“Mr. Crawford's tumultuous upbringing, of course, cannot excuse what happened to Jose Molina and Diana Algar,” Jacobson wrote. “Nothing can do that. Mr. Crawford's lack of parental care and support do, however, begin to explain how he ended up at the age of 15 hitchhiking across the country in the company of his 18-year-old co-defendant and without parental supervision.”
Hanley, now 36, pleaded guilty in August 2000 to two counts of first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
As he awaits re-sentencing, Crawford continues to serve his time at State Correctional Institution Greene.

New York (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened flat on Monday after news of an explosion in New York's busy Port Authority commuter hub, while stocks rose around the world on continued solid global economic growth indicators. Tokens of the virtual currency Bitcoin are seen placed on a monitor that displays binary digits in this illustration picture, December 8, 2017. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 26.79 points, or 0.11 percent, to 24,355.95, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 3.91 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,655.41 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 18.88 points, or 0.28 percent, to 6,858.96. “When you see one of these events in a major city, you get a little cautious tone. But it's never enough to really rout a stock market intraday,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.34 percent. “There's somewhat of an enthusiasm that global growth is more synchronized than it's been in a long time, and it's synchronized in the right direction,” said Scott Wren, a senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri. MSCI's emerging market stock index .MSCIEF rose 0.89 percent. Its broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.84 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose 0.56 percent.

A quick-thinking store owner and a crime-fighting app helped catch a jewelry thief in downtown Kingston. On Jan. 26, 2017, a man walked into Frontenac Jewellers on Princess Street, claiming he wanted to purchase a $9000 engagement ring, when store owner Peter Dafnas says the unthinkable happened.
“During the transaction, getting his name, number and email address, he grabbed the ring he was looking at and then ran for the door.”
Dafnas tried to stop the thief by pushing a display case over to trap him, but the suspect managed to escape and took off on foot. Dafnas chased after him down Princess Street yelling to inform people he had been robbed.

A sales clerk next door at Vandervoort General Store heard the commotion and grabbed her phone. Only she didn't call 911.
“I got on Group Me,” said Lorna Carroll, “and notified the downtown merchants that there was a serious incident at Frontenac Jewelers and that was that. I just turned to look outside and fellow merchants had come to Natasha and Peter's aide.”
Group Me is a crime prevention app administered by Kingston Police. It's like a group text that connects downtown businesses with one another as well as police. The app has been around for a few years but has really taken off the last year with more than a hundred members.
“We've noticed a real big sense of community now with the different stores that are on it. They're able to get to know each other as well and help each other out,” said Const. Filip Wisniak, adding that the app is not a tool to replace calling 911.
While Carroll was sending her message, Dafnas was chasing the suspect down four blocks. He managed to get the license plate of the suspect's vehicle and reported it to police. Officers were able to catch up with the ring thief within two hours of the crime. The suspect was arrested at charged with theft.
At the time of the robbery, Dafnas didn't have the app, but is on it now and says it's nice to know store owners are there for each other.

Up to 600 more units planned for Vancouver with help of $66 million from the provincial government
Stack them up. Take them down. Move them around. Repeat.
What could easily pass as a description of the children's toy Lego could also be a portrait of British Columbia's latest tool in the fight against homelessness.
The province is turning to modular housing to help with a critical lack of short-term accommodation. Temporary modular housing involves the construction of small, self-contained living quarters, which can be shipped directly from a factory and quickly assembled.
Proponents applaud the technique not only for its cost savings, but also because it slashes delivery time from years to months.
“I liken it to being six months from idea to occupancy,” said Luke Harrison, CEO of the Vancouver Affordable Housing Agency.
Harrison's organization has assembled 40 units, each about 23 square metres, in Vancouver as part of a pilot project.
Up to 600 more units are planned for the city with the help of $66 million from the provincial government. Another 2,000 modular units are planned across B.C. over two years.
Permanent housing can take years to get approved and built, but prefabricated modules can quickly be moved to new locations and reassembled in new configurations depending on local needs. As a result, vacant sites waiting to be developed are suddenly candidates for temporary complexes that can house 50 or more people.
“It's not a solution for everything, but it's a great tool that we have in our arsenal now to deal with things like the homeless population that requires an urgent and critical response that just doesn't come as easily through traditional forms of construction and development,” Harrison said.

A recent homelessness survey of Metro Vancouver communities between 2011 and 2016 found the number of people without shelter grew by 40 per cent, to 4,211 people. That's four times faster than general population growth over that same period, the survey said.
Ethel Whitty, Vancouver's director of homelessness services, said the initiative marks a shift in the city's approach to helping the homeless that promotes finding accommodation as a priority.
“Up until recent years, it was thought that you had to house people who were ready for housing. They had to be dry and sober and, say, they had to have their goals organized,” she said. “Actually, people who are housed are much more likely to be able to organize their life plan.”
Where to place modular complexes depends on a number of factors, including access to health care and transit, zoning, environmental factors and community consultation, she added.
Kathleen Llewellyn-Thomas, who oversees community services for the city, said housing is only one element of a broader overall program, which will include support workers and other resources for tenants.
Part of the inspiration for the project came from temporary camps and catering facilities used in the resource industry to house workers in remote locations. Vancouver's pilot project used expertise from Horizon North, which operated in the industrial sector for years before expanding to residential and commercial development.
Scott Matson, the company's chief financial officer, said the key to modular housing is the timeline.
“Imagine Lego blocks being completed in a controlled and closed environment, in a manufacturing environment rather than an outdoor construction environment, shipped to site and assembled on site,” Matson said.
The company builds the modules in Kamloops, B.C., transports them on site by truck and assembles them using a crane.
He estimated the typical lifespan of a module to be as long as 25 years and said the aesthetic of residential projects are “very, very different” from work camps.
“Once constructed, … you'd be unable to tell that it was anything different than a regular apartment building or hotel complex.”

A day ahead of the verdict in the rape of a 16-year-old girl five years ago, self-styled godman Asaram Bapu on Tuesday appealed to his followers to not throng Jodhpur Central prison and maintain peace and harmony.Rajasthan's Jodhpur has been placed under a tight security blanket as a local court is expected to deliver its verdict on Wednesday.A press note from Sant Sri Asaramji Ashram Trust in Delhi said any person who indulges in anarchy cannot be a devotee of Asaram. The note impressed upon his followers to exercise restraint and do nothing that creates an obstacle in the process of justice.The note advised people to not believe the information circulating on social media and to consult the nearest ashram or the one in Ahmedabad for the real news.It further said that “visitng Jodhpur would be a waste of time, money and energy” and stated that “Bapuji is innocent and will soon be among us” again.The trial in the case has been marked by a string of deaths and attacks on witnesses.Even police officers who investigated the case say they faced constant threats.

It only took hours for the statue of Edward Cornwallis to be removed in Halifax . But the differences in opinions surrounding the debate — and the strong emotions that go with them — have lasted well after the dust settled.
According to figures provided by the municipality, since Thursday, the city received 21 official complaints against councillors.
The municipality is not able to disclose which councillors the complaints are against.

However, Thursday saw two councillors engage in a heated spat after one retweeted a a letter from a white supremacist organization.
Mayor Mike Savage says he'd like everyone to show a little bit more respect.
“When I spoke at council on Tuesday in support of removing the statue for now, the last thing I said is we need to all treat each other with respect as we have this conversation, no matter what our point of view. So, it disturbs me when people go public attacking each other,” Savage said in an interview on Friday.
The mayor was responding directly between the war of words between Matt Whitman, councillor for District 13, and Waye Mason, councillor for Disrict 7.
Whitman retweeted a letter from ID Canada, addressed to Savage regarding the Cornwallis decision.
“Canadians expect the memory of our European founders to remain unpolluted by revisionist attitudes,” the letter read.
“This incident is a worrying manifestation of a brutal disregard towards the accomplishments of Canada's European founders.”
ID Canada describes themselves as an “ethno-nationalist and identitarian youth movement” that says Canada was “never meant to be a melting pot of third-world migration.”
Many of the tweets on ID Canada Twitter account link to videos or images with anti-Islamic and anti-immigration messages.
Whitman deleted the retweet after being questioned by Global News, saying that he did not know who the organization was before retweeting their letter.
But that wasn't before Mason questioned him over Twitter.
“You are retweeting a neo-nazi hate group,” Mason tweeted. “What the hell is wrong with you?”
@matlantivex You are retweeting a neo-nazi hate group. I am speechless. What the hell is wrong with you? —
Waye Mason (@WayeMason) February 01, 2018
Whitman has since blocked Mason.
WATCH: Are this Halifax councillor's comments racist or ignorant?
Reconciliation and moving forward
Savage says the threats received by some councillors, and the dispute between councillors is the antithesis of the city's decision to remove the Cornwallis statue.
“The whole purpose of this debate is around reconciliation and about education and about respect and I'm seeing things that are not respectful,” said Savage.
He says that the role of council is to deal with contentious issues, but that they also have the responsibility of being mindful of their online opinions.
“Everybody's entitled to their point of view, nobody's being muzzled, but you have to be responsible for what you say.”
This isn't the first time that councillors have taken heat over public comments.
Council is set to undergo sensitivity training after 13 complaints were reported in a three-month period last year that saw tempers flare between councillors at council meetings and on social media.
Former provincial politician and political science professor Leonard Preya says there is a benefit for citizens in seeing all sides of their elected officials, even if it isn't the best one.
“It's important that people know what people think, however bad that might be. I look at those things and I think ‘I can't believe that he said that.' But it's important for voters to know if their candidate is a racist, or sexist, or child abuser, whatever. I'd rather it is flushed out rather than live in the shadows and under the rocks.”
A guardian angel guided Arellano University when it swept San Sebastian College (SSC) in the finals of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Season 92 women's volleyball tournament Tuesday at the Philsports Arena in Pasig City.
The Lady Chiefs destroyed Lady Stags' thrice-to-beat advantage in a stepladder finals series to clinch its second title in three years.
Arellano showcased great team effort as it routed San Sebastian; 25-15, 22-25, 25-23, 25-15; in Game 3.
Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) Jovie Prado, skipper Ria Sante and Andrea Marzan led the well-balanced offensive attack, finishing with 14 points apiece while Anne Esguerra contributed 12 markers.
Tournament MVP Gretchel Soltones, on the other hand, produced 25 points for San Sebastian on top of 14 digs and 17 receptions.
But the Lady Stags' sluggish net defense and countless errors hurt their chances, allowing the Lady Chiefs to conquer the crown.
Arellano head coach Obet Javier said an angel was guiding him throughout their journey to the title.
It was his lost wife, Amy Marie, who recently lost her bout with lung cancer.
Greatest motivation
Amy Marie served as the Lady Chiefs' greatest motivation to be extra hungry.
“Napakalaking bagay para sa amin nito kasi talagang pinaghirapan namin ito.” “Napakalaking bagay para sa amin nito kasi talagang pinaghirapan namin ito.” “Noong eliminations na down kami sa Baste, nag-set kami ng goal na dapat hindi na ulit mangyari sa amin yun. So, natupad naman at naging maganda rin yung motivation namin kasi sabi nga ng mga player ko: Coach, yung unang-unang motivation namin ay para kay Tita.”
Javier said he felt the presence of his wife in Game 1.
He asked for her guidance while the Lady Chiefs took care of the rest en route to winning the crown.
“Actually, noong Game 1 pa lang, alam ko na nandoon yung misis ko. Kasi talagang lagi kong sinasabi sa kanya na i-guide mo kami kasi alam ko na gustong-gusto mo ulit na manalo tayo dito sa NCAA.” “Actually, noong Game 1 pa lang, alam ko na nandoon yung misis ko. Kasi talagang lagi kong sinasabi sa kanya na i-guide mo kami kasi alam ko na gustong-gusto mo ulit na manalo tayo dito sa NCAA.” “Nagpapasalamat ako sa mga player ko kasi alam ko na sa ganoong bagay, dinamayan talaga nila ako.”
He said more than their team effort, it was the eternal love of his wife which led them to victory.
And the golden crown was his wife's sweetest Valentines Day gifts to him and his team.
: Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye! famed actor Manjot Singh, excited about his upcoming film Fukrey Returns, says the Hindi film industry is changing its attitude towards actors with a turban and that the acceptance of Diljit Dosanjh is a prime example.He was 16 when he featured in Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye! in 2008 and received a Filmfare Critics Award for the Best Actor category for it.In a chat here, Manjot spoke about how his dream is coming true slowly but surely.Asked if he feels the pressure of having limited roles in the Hindi film industry because he wears a turban, Manjot said: "No, not really, because I can see how things are changing. For instance, Diljit paaji is opening the door for us with films like Udta Punjab and Phillauri."People loved him everywhere. So I know, even I will get my share of opportunity, and no, I did not think of cutting my hair or removing my turban for a role."Having made his debut in 2008 with a Dibakar Banerjee film, Manjot has worked with filmmakers like Vikramaditya Motwane, Anurag Kashyap, Karan Johar and Tony D'Souza for films like "Udaan", "Student Of The Year" and "Azhar", apart from "Fukrey" that won him appreciation from the audience.Reflecting upon it, he said: "When I started acting in films, I made a wish list of being associated with a film that will become such a big hit that producers will make a sequel of that. With ‘Fukrey', Babaji ne meri sun liya (God heard me). I am so fortunate."He has a new wish."I know I am young and have a long way to go, but I am a huge Diljit Dosanjh fan and I so wish to work with Diljit paaji."Asked if his success and a long list of fan followers made any change in his personality, Manjot said: "No, I am to an extent like Lali (his character's name from 'Fukrey'). I am still the simple and to an extent an innocent guy. Perhaps that is why I can relate with Lali so much and play him on screen easily."But yes, now I have grown up and changes have come not only on my face but also in personality. I was a shy child and very introvert as you know, but now I am better... At least I talk if not start the conversation. Earlier, I used to observe and listen. I am in a learning process."As an actor, Manjot wants to experiment with more shades of different characters and he will soon be doing one of such films."I personally believe that I can play a serious role, but people mostly offer me comedy. Last year, I did a film with Abhay (Deol) sir. I hope that releases soon. I have played a very different character from all my previous work. The working title of the film is 'Situation Normal All Fucked Up (SNAFU)' where I am playing a different character and the director told me why others have not explored the actor side in me."I just hope the film releases and people get to watch me like that," said Manjot.Fukrey Returns will release on December 8.

After six months of negotiations, the Quebec government is turning a deaf ear, the Fédération Interprofessionnelle de la santé du Quebec (FIQ) union said at a press conference on Wednesday.
The five CIUSSS union representatives from the Montreal region led by FIQ vice-president Denyse Joseph spoke about the difficulties their employees face.
The union officials representing 17,000 health-care workers from the Montreal area say the two sides are at an impasse.

A total of 26 items are being tossed around between the two parties but the major sticking point, union representatives say, is employees' hours.
The provincial government is asking for more flexibility from its employees in terms of hours while the unions want the province to hire more full-time workers instead of forcing overtime.
“These hours of paid overtime represent so much money that they could create full-time permanent positions,” Joseph said.
Among the five CIUSSS centres, 1.1-million hours of overtime were forced on health-care workers, the FIQ says.
Joseph says a constant scheduled work environment at the same unit or hospital is beneficial to the employee and the patient.
Joseph added that Alzheimer's patients “need to have the same professional so that they can recognize and establish a link with that worker.”

In this file photo, Chicago Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta talks during a news conference before Game 3 of baseballs National League Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers in Chicago. Agent Brodie Van Wagenen, co-head of CAA Baseball, said Friday that baseball players should consider boycotting spring training because of the slow free-agent market. J.D. Martinez, Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas, Jake Arrieta, Alex Cobb, Greg Holland and Lance Lynn remain among the dozens of unsigned players with the Feb. 14 start of spring training less than two weeks away. Charles Rex Arbogast  The Associated Press file
NEW YORK >> A prominent baseball agent said players are angered over the slow free-agent market and suggested they consider boycotting spring training.
Brodie Van Wagenen, co-head of CAA Baseball, floated the idea in a statement released Friday, less than two weeks before spring training workouts are to start in Florida and Arizona. He also raised the possibility of a collusion grievance, as did another agent, Seth Levinson of Aces.
The players are upset. No, they are outraged. Players in the midst of long-term contracts are as frustrated as those still seeking employment, Van Wagenen said. I would suggest that testing the will of 1,200 alpha males at the pinnacle of their profession is not a good strategy for 30 men who are bound by a much smaller fraternity.
J.D. Martinez, Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas, Jake Arrieta, Yu Darvish, Alex Cobb, Greg Holland and Lance Lynn remain among the dozens of unsigned free agents.

A boycott of spring training may be a starting point, if behavior doesnt change. Players dont receive their paychecks until the second week of April. Fine them? OK, for how much? Sue them? OK, theyll see you in court two years from now.
CAA represents more than 150 baseball players, including Robinson Cano, Yoenis Cespedes, Buster Posey, Shohei Ohtani, Adam Jones, Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard.
Van Wagenens free agents this offseason include Todd Frazier. Van Wagenen said he chose to speak out now because spring training was approaching.
The sentiment that Im hearing from players is that something radical may be necessary to show the other side there is unity and strength in in their frustration, he said in a telephone interview.
Spring training workouts begin Feb. 14, but participation is voluntary until the mandatory reporting date on Feb. 24  the day after major league spring training games are to start.
Levinson praised Van Wagenen and agreed with his conclusions.
It is disconcerting, and disheartening for clubs that are awash in revenue and or are fully capable of improving its product to choose to do otherwise, he said. Further, it is deeply troubling to encounter that almost all clubs are operating in a strangely similar fashion. There are no coincidences in a monopoly.
Large-market teams, including the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees, are cutting payrolls to get under the $197 million threshold for luxury tax payrolls.
Every markets different. Theres different players, different quality of players, different GMs, different decisions, new basic agreement, different agents who have particular prominence in a particular market in terms of who they represent, Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday. Those factors and probably others that I cant tick off the top of my head have combined to produce a particular market this year. Just like theres been some markets where the lid got blown off in terms of player salary growth, I think I can honestly suggest that occasionally youre going to have some that are a little different, not quite as robust.
New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson, speaking to fans at Citi Field on Thursday, said analytics contributed to the slow pace of negotiations.
Big data is the reason weve seen so little movement in the free-agent market, because as data becomes more pervasive in the game, as it has, it tends to narrow the range of different evaluations, he said. The evaluations become much uniform.
The average salary, according to the players association, rose 3.3 percent last year to nearly $4.1 million following an increase of just 0.35 percent in 2016, the lowest rise since 2004. The new collective bargaining agreement, the first since Tony Clark succeeded Michael Weiner as union head, added surtaxes to the competitive-balance tax and additional penalties for high payrolls, including lesser choices in the amateur draft.
The CBT is designed to be a restraint on the spending of high-payroll clubs, Manfred said. I think that the system, without singling out the CBT, actually is working pretty well in the sense that the standard deviation of our payrolls that are being projected next year has actually gone down significantly, suggesting that our payrolls are more compressed, top-down, the bottom-up, which we feel is important in terms of preserving the competitive balance in the game.
Clark issued a statement that did not address a boycott or a grievance.
For decades free agency has been the cornerstone of baseballs economic system and has benefited players and the game alike, he said. Each time it has been attacked, players, their representatives and the association have united to defend it. That will never change.
Baseball has enjoyed labor peace since a 7½-month strike in 1994-95 led to the first cancellation of the World Series in 90 years, and the labor contract runs through the 2021 season.
The players association won three collusion grievances against the clubs for behavior toward free agents following the 1985-87 seasons, cases management settled for $280 million. Van Wagenen, a former Stanford baseball player, says current behavior by teams feels coordinated, rightly or wrongly.
Many club presidents and general managers with whom we negotiate with are frustrated with the lack of funds to sign the plethora of good players still available, raising further suspicion of institutional influence over the spending, he said. Even the algorithms that have helped determine player salaries in recent years are suggesting dramatically higher values than owners appear willing to spend.

The United States is not contemplating military action inside Pakistan, the Pentagon has said, refuting such reports appearing in Pakistani newspapers.
Instead, the US seeks Pakistan's cooperation and assistance in various operations under its new South Asia strategy, Lt Gen Kenneth F McKenzie told reporters at a news conference Thursday.
We actually don't contemplate military operations inside Pakistan. On the other hand, we recognise, because the strategy is inherently regional and Pakistan is geographically located at a critical nexus of a lot of different things, Pakistan is a fundamental part of the strategy.
‘Through a variety of measures, we look to gain Pakistani cooperation and assistance as we pursue operations in Afghanistan. But we're not planning to conduct military operations inside Pakistan,' he told Pentagon reporters in response to a question.
Under the new South Asia strategy, Pakistan has an opportunity to be a partner in fight against terrorism, Pentagon's Chief Spokesperson Dana White said.
It (Pakistan) has been a victim of terrorism, and it has supported terrorism. We are looking for Pakistan to actively join, it can do the things we need them to do to confront terrorism.
‘So it's an inflection point, it's an opportunity, and we hope Pakistan will take it,' she said in response to a question.
White refuted impression that there is connection between the recent attacks in Kabul and the US' decision to suspend aid to Pakistan.
The Taliban is desperate. They're murderous and they attack innocent civilians. As the general said, these were flashy but it shows their disparity.
‘For every attack that's carried out, many, many, many are stopped, many are prevented from occurring. So to think that you're going to have exquisite timing on when an attack occurs is probably a bridge too far for the Taliban to have,' White said.

ISLAMABAD - Sugar prices are continuously increasing in the country as the government and sugar millers are holding each other responsible for the current hike in commodity prices.
Sugar prices have now reached to Rs60 per kg from Rs49 per kg of few weeks before. “The prices are increasing as millers are not supplying sugar in the market, as they want subsidy on exporting the commodity,” said an official of the commerce ministry. He further said that the Ministry of Industries and Production last week has written a letter to the chief secretaries of Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for taking steps to stop hoarding in the provinces.
However, prices could not come down. “Ministry of commerce is likely to convene an inter-ministerial committee in next few days to review the sugar crisis,” said the official on the condition of anonymity. On the other hand, Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) blamed federal government for the current sugar crisis. “The government could have earned $1 billion foreign exchange by exporting sugar few months back when PSMA asked to export the commodity,” said PSMA vice chairman Iskandar Khan while talking to The Nation. He further said that sugarcane crushing season would not start by October this year due to the current situation.
Another PSMA representative said that the country has abundant sugar stock. The country has production of 6.986 million tons of sugar which is far in excess of domestic requirement of about 5.1 million tons. However, the prices are increasing only due to the government's policies, he added.
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar has also taken notice of increasing sugar prices in the country. However, the prices are still increasing instead of controlling.
It is pertinent to mention here that sugar prices had started increase after Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet gave approval to export 0.3 million tons of sugar last month. In June 2017, an inter-ministerial committee headed by then commerce minister Khurram Dastgir had recommended the ECC to allow further 0.6 million tons exports without giving any subsidy to the exporters. In view of abundant surplus sugar stocks available in the country, the committee recommended to the ECC an export of 0.6 MMT of sugar, in addition to the 0.425 MMT already allowed for export, subject to the condition that the price stability in the domestic market is maintained. In case of any abnormal increase in the domestic price of sugar, the committee would recommend to the ECC the stoppage of further exports. Once 0.45 MMT out of the allowed quantity of 0.6 MMT is exported, the inter-ministerial committee will meet again to review the stock/export situation and recommend enhancement of export quantities, if deemed appropriate.

Winning and Losing at auctions – By William de Ora (de Silva)
Ria at the auction “This is the first time we've been to an auction. It would have been so daunting if we were on our own”
Just over two months ago, out of the blue Sunila called me. At that first phone call I didn't know who she was or why she was calling me. One of her friends has given my name. Without even introducing herself Sunila launched into what was on top of her mind.
“We are losing out at auctions” there was desperation in her voice. “A friend said you would be good to bid for us.” There was no room for me get a word in. “Are you available tomorrow? The auction is at 2.30pm?”
As a buyer's agent I get asked to bid at auctions or negotiate with real estate agents on behalf of clients.
Why people like Sunila and Rohan keep losing out at auctions is because they are up against professionals. The auctioneer is a hired professional, there to work with the team of selling agents on the day to get every dollar they can out of your pocket. They do this day after day. In comparison Sunila and Rohan are pure amateurs.
Auctions are highly emotional environments, and not the best environment for buying a major asset in. You could be out of your depth if you haven't successfully bid at auction recently or indeed never before.
During this initial phone conversation I managed to gather why they were loosing out at auctions.
Bidding at auction is like a game. It's not just about getting the highest price, there is a psychological battle taking place. All good sporting teams have done countless hours of practice and have a game plan before they go into the field.
At the end, there are winners and losers. And, you don't want to be on the loosing side. At auctions there are two types of losers. There's Sunila and Rohan who leaves the auctions empty handed. Other losers end up paying far more than what they should.
Sunila's and Rohan's game plan was just turning up with a price limit in mind and calling out some numbers. They didn't realise there is actually a lot more strategy, endurance and psychological game play involved.
Sunila and Rohan would stand at the outer perimeter of the auction. Never knowing when to bid or how to bid. They would have been fearful even to put their hand up to bid.
When there is a momentum, where the auctioneer's role is to get that buyer to continue bidding. Without a game plan Sunila and Rohan weren't able to act quickly and make fast decisions. Think of like this, even if you weren't successful by attending auctions will help you in the future as to identify what to do and what not to.
However, Sunila and Rohan resented putting time into attending open houses and auctions because they felt they were neglecting the kids. Instead they wanted to spend Saturdays with their kids. From parent's perspective this is understandable.
There is another way to bid at auctions. That is to hire someone who has the expertise with auctions. A buyer's agent. This is what, another client of mine Ria and Kamal did.
ANOTHER WAY TO BID AT AUCTION
“Yesterday I experienced my first auction. I had mixed emotions driving to the property. I was nervous. A little curious. And, in a strange kind of way excited.” Ria said.
Ria and Kamal is a young couple who has embarked on building their property portfolio. Unlike most young people Kamal had the good sense to ask for help. Ria says, “At the beginning I was against having a buyer's agent. I said we should save the money by doing all by ourselves.”
One of the properties I was recommending in Rooty Hill NSW was going under the hammer. I was bidding on behalf of Ria and Kamal.
“We pulled in front of the house. There were tents, banners, cameraperson; even a drone with camera on it's under belly. Instead of an auction, this quite street in Rooty Hill had turned into a mini circus” Ria described her first auction experience.
The first clients I mentioned, Sunila and Rohan often say auctioneers intimidate them. The whole auction process is designed to get the adrenaline going and ending up far more than what the property is worth.
Personally I never like auctions. Typically I would negotiate a price and purchase the property prior to the auction. The reason I don't like auctions is because it's a place people put their hands up to say “pick me, pick me, I want to pay more.” Then they end up paying unrealistic prices. Only people, in most cases end up winning are the vendor and the agent. Not you.
The circus atmosphere Ria is describing is simply to disarm the unsuspecting buyers. They get lulled into a false sense of gayety, theatrics. For an inexperience buyer then you need to learn to step over carefully over the auction minefield. If you were to make a mistake or two it can cost you an arm and a leg.
At the end of this chapter I will outline seven basic tips that will not only help ensure your real estate dream doesn't turn into a nightmare, it could mean you walk away having saved thousands of dollars.
“This is the first time we've been to an auction. It would have been so daunting if we were on our own” Ria smiled,
WORLDS APART
Sunila and Rohan's approach is world apart from Ria and Kamal. The later couple knew they need help. They didn't wait until the eleventh hour.
It's only human to be concerned about failing. No one wants to lose their hard-earned money on a risky venture. Sunila and Rohan's fear is very real to them. And I am honoured that Sunila trusts me enough to call on a Sunday morning and tell me how she's feeling.
She poured her heart out. That is difficult for most individuals, especially for immigrants from the Indian subcontinent. We are proud people. Showing our vulnerable side is not something we do in public.
Gavin Larkin, my friend and the founder of “R U OK?,” told me on his deathbed: “William, 95% of things we worry about never come to fruition.” I didn't repeat Gavin's words to Sunila, though they came to mind at the time.
Literally, my clients who are from the Indian subcontinant are alone in this country. They no longer have the support network they had back home. Their extended family is gone along with their old familiar community. Australia feels like a world apart. Sunila knew any mistakes she and her husband made, they would have to manage on their own. That awareness made her feel vulnerable, and added to the understandable fear she felt as a new investor. So the thought of not having tenants or getting taken for a ride was frightening, even if the fear was unfounded. I understand. I've been there.
Buying a property at an auction is not something you do everyday. So, being fearful is perfectly normal.
SEVEN TIPS TO HELP YOU AT AN AUCTION
Here are seven tips you need to watch when you are going into an auction.
1 – Get a lawyer to review the contract before the auction. If you're the successful bidder you are bound by the contract. There is no cooling-off period for auctions. On the day of the auction read the addendum sheet on the day of the auction as this reveals any mistakes or changes
2 – Sort out your finance in advance. You only have limited number of days after the hammer falls to pay the balance of the bid. You'll also need insurance lined up since you become liable for any damage to the property as soon as your bid is accepted.
3 – Don't believe everything the real estate agent say. They will say what you want to hear. Do your own due diligence.
4 – If it's not a knockdown and rebuild, then, know exactly what you are buying. Get a pest, building and (if required) strata reports. If the building is old then it's worth investing in a structural survey to check for hidden problems before you bid at auction.
5 – If the property seems a bargain, there's probably a good reason. It's worth a visit to the council to check on if road widening or a possible freeway flyover affects the property. Or, if it's within a flood zone
6 – At the auction, agree on the maximum you're prepared to pay and stick to it, because the auctions get the adrenaline going and sometimes difficult to keep the emotions in check as a buyer. Stick to the price you agree, not a dollar more. Be disciplined.
7 – During the auction, you will see the agents running between bidders, nudging you to raise the bid. It's understandable as they act for the seller to the highest possible price. Don't be intimidated. They are simply doing their job, so decline their assistance. After all, you are capable of making your own mind up. Stay in control.
This property at Rooty Hill eventually got sold for $715,000. Far more than what we wanted to pay.
“I saw for the first time how the auctioneers could rattle and bully people.” Ria said. “What a good buyer's agent can bring is unemotional sound judgment” was Kamal's take as we headed back to our respective cars.
As a buyer's agents can help their client's to save time, money and daunting experience in buying at auctions. Or, not if the prices are unrealistic. Lessening their chances of making an ill-informed investment decision. In doing so, they make thousands upon thousands of dollars difference.

I didn't tell very many people that my first husband cheated on me. Even now, years later, I don't talk about it much. It's so embarrassing, especially because I was cheated on when I was pregnant. It's not that I still think it was my fault that he cheated or that my pregnancy had anything to do with his infidelity, it's just that I know there are people out there who will blame me for his transgressions, and that's something I don't want to deal with. Ever.
For better or worse, people don't straight up tell me the demise of my marriage was all my fault. Instead, whenever I read that some celebrity cheated on their pregnant partner, someone will question if the person who was cheated on was at least "a little bit to blame." People speculate about their sex life, criticize her pregnant body, or even say they don't blame him for cheating because of x, y, and z. It's unfair and devastating and, unfortunately, the misconceptions about women who've endured that kind of disloyalty don't stop there.
In my experience, most people tend to think of cheating in terms of sex — the cheater isn't getting enough sex from their partner so they "are forced" to get it somewhere else. This is all kinds of offensive, because no one forces someone to cheat, no one owes sex to literally anyone else, and interpersonal relationships are never that simple. In fact, I don't think cheating is about sex at all. For my ex, it was about women making him feel like the center of the universe. He believed I was way too wrapped up in being pregnant, parenting our toddler, and doing my job to treat him how he wanted to be treated: like a god.
To make matters worse, when you are cheated on while pregnant you feel so much guilt. I wondered if it happened because I was uncomfortable, moody, and didn't feel like having sex. Or maybe my partner didn't want to have sex with me because I was swollen, sweaty, vomiting, and "fat." As a pregnant woman I was already so vulnerable, and his infidelity only filled me with more self-doubt.
People think they get what it's like or know what they'd do in my pregnant shoes, but I think this is a horrible situation you can't adequately understand unless it has happened to you. And since I wouldn't wish being cheated on when you're pregnant on my worst enemy, I know so many people get things wrong about me and this situation, including the following:
It Wasn't My Fault My first clue that he was unhappy was a Facebook messenger exchange I saw on accident. He told the woman that I wouldn't have sex with him, and she (a childless person, by the way) replied, "Poor baby. I thought pregnant women were horny all of the time. What's wrong with her?" At the time I did think there was something wrong with me. I now know that it wasn't my fault, though. I couldn't control his actions. Besides, he never once talked to me about my libido or our sex life. How could I fix something I didn't know was broken?
I Knew Giphy When I found out that my husband had been sleeping with multiple women throughout my pregnancy, I wanted to throw up. I remember the day that my midwife asked me if I had unprotected sex with any new partners. I thought to myself, "What if I have an STD?" but I was and too embarrassed to ask her for a test, and too afraid it would be positive.
I Wished I Didn't Know A little part of me wished I hadn't found out. I was so ashamed that my husband was lying to and cheating on me while I was pregnant with a baby we'd planned. I knew he'd cheated on me in the past, and I thought he'd changed, but I was wrong. And knowing made it worse, because I felt trapped and I thought I would fail at single parenthood. I later found out that being a single parent would be way easier than being married to him. I just wish I knew then what I know now.
I Didn't Owe Him Sex Giphy I was so sick during my pregnancy that, for months, I threw up 10 or more times a day, couldn't keep food down, and was exhausted beyond belief. It made it hard to function, let alone want to have sex. But, even if I hadn't felt like garbage, people don't owe their partners sex. Ever. Not even when they are married, or when their partners are used to a more robust sex life. Me not having sex with him didn't make it OK for him to have sex with other people.
I Didn't Hate Him Immediately It's weird how people expect you to hate someone who cheats on you. I mean, I did... eventually. But my love for him wasn't built in a day, so it didn't go away in a day either. It's so hard to watch someone you love deliberately do something they know will hurt you, especially when they are also the father of your kids.
I'm Not Who He Said I Was Courtesy of Steph Montgomery If you believe what he said about me, I was a stereotypical nagging wife who didn't treat him right and forced him to look for sex and love elsewhere. That wasn't true. At least, it wasn't from my perspective. My nagging was pretty much reserved for things like asking him to help when I really needed it, or wanting him to stop lying to me. I just wanted him to grow up, because we were parents and about to have another baby and I needed a partner. The thing about toxic people is that they try to taint your reputation and gaslight you and control the narrative. I was cheated on and people thought I deserved it.
It Felt Way Worse Than When I Was Cheated On Before I think because we'd planned our pregnancy, and I was seriously excited to have a second child with my husband, his cheating hit me that much harder than his previous discretions. I was alone, pregnant, and scared. I had no idea what to do or how to go about doing it. My baby was coming no matter what I did, so I just tried to move forward.
Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez were watching the Golden Globe nominations Monday morning when news hit of a pipe bomb explosion in Manhattan. Then, after they were nominated in the original song category for “Remember Me” from the animated feature “Coco,” the wife and husband took their 11-month-old kitten, Finn McCool, to the veterinarian to have him put down. He was dying of a terminal illness.
“So, it's been a day,” Anderson-Lopez said by phone from New York.
The songwriters are not strangers to awards season, having won an Oscar for their “Frozen” anthem “Let It Go.” But they said getting nominated is never anything you expect, or get used to.
“It's such a cliché, but just being nominated is such a huge honor,” said Anderson-Lopez, adding that now they have to figure out what to wear to the big party in Los Angeles. “We've been in writing mode, with all of the eating and drinking involved.”
“Coco” and “Remember Me” were a long time coming. Lopez remembered that when they were first pitched on the project, the story brought tears to their eyes. They dove deep into researching the vision of creator and co-director Lee Unkrich, including themes revolving around Dia de los Muertos. Two years passed before they put pen to paper.
“It was so inspiring, and the way they've realized it is so marvelous,” Lopez said of the film. “We're so grateful and blessed to be a part of this project.”
When they finally did start writing the song, Anderson-Lopez remembered her husband coming up with the melody while noodling on the piano in his pajamas one morning. She recorded it on her iPhone and listened to it over and over again until the lyrics came to her on the subway.
The couple always test their songs on their children, ages 8 and 12. “Remember Me” went over big.
“They are our little focus group,” Lopez said.
Tonight the family plans to celebrate — and decompress — by seeing “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.”
“Talk about highs and lows,” Anderson-Lopez said.
Michigan man, 63, killed in Lee County crash
A 63-year-old man died in a crash Monday afternoon on Alico Road near Gator Road, the Florida Highway Patrol said.
The Nissan Versa was hit by a 2001 Volvo TTL driven by Radel Garay Gonzalez, 35, of Lehigh Acres. David Joseph Fons, 63, of Brighton, Michigan was approaching Gator Road in the left turn lane, and Gonzalez was traveling westbound in the inside lane. According to the crash report, both drivers were approaching a red light.
Fons attempted to make a left turn at the intersection while Gonzalez continued traveling westbound on Alico Road. Therefore, Fons struck the front of Gonzalez's vehicle.
The Nissan Versa rotated counterclockwise and came to a final rest facing southwest in the westbound lanes of Alico Road. The Volvo departed off of the Nissan Versa and traveled northwest on the outside grass shoulder. The Volvo came to final rest facing west on the north shoulder of Alico Road.
The crash happened around 2:05 p.m., the FHP said. The lanes west of Lee Road were closed for 4.5 hours.
At this time, no charges have been given.
It's every parent's nightmare, finding out your child has been abused by someone you thought you could trust. And it's a nightmare the parents of hundreds of Larry Nassar's victims are living through right at this moment. Knowing your child was harmed, was frightened, was victimized on this level... it's unspeakable. When one father simply couldn't handle the horror for a minute longer, other parents quietly understood his pain. And now, there's a fundraiser for the dad who attacked Larry Nassar in court.
Randall Margraves, a father of three daughters who were assaulted by Nassar, lunged for the disgraced doctor after listening to his daughters' impact statements in court on Friday. After becoming "distraught" hearing his daughters' tell the court about how Nassar's sexual abuse had affected them, CNN reports that Margraves asked Eaton County, Michigan Judge Janice Cunningham:
I would ask you, as part of the sentencing, to grant me five minutes in a locked room with this demon. Would you give me one minute?
When the judge responded that she couldn't do that, because that's simply not how the legal system works, Margraves muttered, "Well, I'm going to have to," and lunged for Nassar (who hid under a desk looking terrified).
Margraves are detained by officers of the court, even as he continued to say while handcuffed on the ground, "I want that son of a b**ch." He asked the officers what they would do if this happened to them as Michigan Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis reprimanded him:
You cannot behave like that. No one can behave like this. I want to make sure it's crystal clear.
He was removed from court, and has since admitted to the court that he lost control because he hadn't known what his daughters would say... and because Nassar was shaking his head during his youngest daughter's victim impact statement as though denying her story.
I lost control. I apologize a hundred times. I'm definitely calmed down. I'm embarrassed. I'm not here to upstage my daughters. I'm here to help them heal.
The judge accepted his apology while noting that violent behavior is simply not the answer:
We cannot and I cannot tolerate or condone vigilantism or any other type of action that basically comes down to an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. That's not what's best in this situation. What's best here is that we take this horrible tragedy and we learn to educate people.
In the wake of Margraves frustrated attempt to attack Nassar, social media has since branded him something of a folk here. So much so that a Go Fund Me page was initially set up for Margraves by his friend Aaron Pangborn as a way to help him out if he had to pay any legal fees. While Margraves was released without penalty, it didn't stop people from donating quickly; although the page was set with a goal of just $1,000, within one day more than $30,000 had been donated by people who understood this dad's motivation. Donations have since been closed, and Pangborn wrote on the Go Fund Me page:
Wow, thank you all for your support.I initially started this gofundme campaign as way to help cover any legal and court costs that Randy may have after this mornings news.As we all know, Randy was not charged after the fact.I will work with him and his family to ensure the funds collected will go to a good cause to help victims of sexual abuse.
Violence is obviously never the answer. But I think there are few parents out there who would fail to understand the frustrated, impotent rage Margraves must have felt listening to his daughters in court.
While there is nothing positive to be said about the horrific case of Dr. Larry Nassar, hopefully the money raised will make a difference in the lives of victims.
NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A judge has dismissed a lawsuit by a federal credit union in Manhattan that sought to block U.S. President Donald Trump from installing Mick Mulvaney as acting director of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
In a decision made public on Friday, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan said the Lower East Side People's Federal Credit Union lacked legal authority to sue, rejecting what he called the plaintiff's “fear-based theory of standing.”
Gardephe said the credit union failed to show that any actual or expected policy changes under Mulvaney would undermine its ability to fulfill its mission of improving the health of underserved communities.
“Organizations advocating for a particular policy goal who have alleged no injury to themselves as organizations may not establish their standing simply on the basis of that goal,” Gardephe wrote. His decision is dated Thursday.
Lawyers for the credit union did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The U.S. Department of Justice, which represented Trump and Mulvaney, did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Trump appointed Mulvaney as temporary head of the CFPB in November, replacing Richard Cordray, an appointee of President Barack Obama.
Mulvaney, a critic of the regulator, has since taken steps that may herald a rollback of some of Cordray's policies.
The credit union had sought to have the court declare CFPB Deputy Director Leandra English, who Cordray designated as his preferred interim successor, as the acting director.
English in November filed her own lawsuit in the federal court in Washington, D.C. to block Mulvaney from taking charge.
In seeking to dismiss the credit union lawsuit, the Justice Department said forcing Trump to appoint English would be an “extraordinary intrusion into core Executive Branch operations” and upend the “consensus view” that Mulvaney deserved the job.

“Better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of hard work and chasing after the wind” – Ecclesiastes 4:6.
Whenever these individuals grace the covers of magazines, they smile. They exude confidence and poise on every cover, screen, and platform that they appear on. They are mentors to the people that know them, and to those that will never meet them. Some even idolise these particular individuals.
They are the shining stars in our societies; they have distinguished themselves in their chosen paths. Even though their admirers may not know about what happens behind the scenes, a lot of hard work, sweat, and pain goes into their endeavours before success can be claimed.
The truth is that although these people are idolised and looked up to as symbols of success, they are people too. They have the same aspirations, emotions, and sentiments that are present in all other people; however, they are also intense under pressure either to maintain the status quo, or the up the notch and push the boundaries of success. While constantly redefining what success means with their achievements, they are still able to relax.
Weighing U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord, President Donald Trump declared on Tuesday that if the Iranians "restart their nuclear program, they will have bigger problems than they've ever had before."
Trump issued his warning alongside French President Emmanuel Macron in the Oval Office, where the two allies discussed the multinational nuclear agreement, the war in Syria and trade issues during a day of meetings at the White House.
Speaking at a joint news conference Tuesday, Trump appeared to be more in line with Macron's push for a longer-term U.S. presence in Syria. Trump, who announced weeks ago that he would withdraw American troops, said Macron reinforced the idea of a potential Iranian takeover of territory liberated from the Daesh terror group.
"We'll be coming home," Trump said, "but we want to leave a strong and lasting footprint."
Macron told Trump that together the U.S. and France would defeat terrorism, curtail weapons of mass destruction in North Korea and Iran and act together on behalf of the planet, a reference to Macron's work to revive a U.S. role in the Paris climate accord.
As for Iran, Trump was asked by reporters if he might be willing to stay in the Iran agreement. He replied, "People know my views on the Iran deal. ... It's insane, it's ridiculous. It should have never been made."
One of Macron's main objectives during his three-day visit to Washington is to persuade Trump to stay in the accord, which is aimed at restricting Iran's development of nuclear weapons. Trump, skeptical of the pact's effectiveness, has been eager to pull out as a May 12 deadline nears.
Trump remains publicly undecided, saying Tuesday "no one knows" what he'll do at the deadline he set to determine America's position. But he reminded his French counterpart of what he sees as flaws in the agreement, which he said fails to address ballistic missiles or Iran's activities in Yemen or Syria.
Macron told reporters that he and Trump would look at the Iran deal "in a wider regional context," taking into account the situation in Syria. "We have a common objective, we want to make sure there's no escalation and no nuclear proliferation in the region. We now need to find the right path forward," Macron said.
Trump suggested he was open to "doing something" on the Iran agreement as long as it was done "strongly." He told Macron, "We could have at least an agreement among ourselves very quickly." But when he was asked by reporters what that agreement would be, Trump said, "You'll find out."
During the press conference, Macron added that he and Trump discussed pursuing a "new agreement" with Iran on the broader regional concerns, including Syria. But it was not clear whether Trump would be willing to keep the U.S. in the current deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in the meantime.
U.S. military and intelligence officials have urged Trump not to pull out of the agreement, arguing it has halted Iran's nuclear program.
Trump also informed Macron that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un wanted to meet "as soon as possible." The president, who once derided Kim as "Little Rocket Man," said the North Korean dictator had been "very open" and "very honorable" so far.
Domestic concerns were also near the surface for Trump. He refused to answer a reporter's question as to whether he is considering a pardon for his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, whose office was raided by the FBI. Trump called it "a stupid question." Cohen has not been charged in the case.
As Trump hosted the French president for the first official state visit of his administration, he and Macron lavished praise — and even a pair of kisses — on one another Tuesday. "It's an honor to call you my friend," Trump said, after predicting Macron would be a historic leader of France.
In a lighter moment, Trump and Macron demonstrated some of the chemistry that has marked their relationship. The U.S. president brushed something off Macron's suit jacket, saying, "We have a very special relationship, in fact I'll get that little piece of dandruff off." Trump added, "We have to make him perfect — he is perfect."
The meetings followed a pomp-filled welcome ceremony on the South Lawn. Trump said before an audience of U.S. soldiers and members of his Cabinet that the relationship he forged with Macron at the start of his presidency was a testament to the "enduring friendship that binds our two nations." He thanked the French leader for his "steadfast partnership" in the recent missile strike in response to the chemical attack in Syria.
Macron said, "History is calling us. It is urging our people to find the fortitude that has guided us in the most difficult of times. France and with it, Europe, and the United States have an appointment with history."
The social highlight of Macron's visit comes Tuesday night with a lavish state dinner at the White House. About 150 guests are expected to dine on rack of lamb and nectarine tart and enjoy an after-dinner performance by the Washington National Opera. On Monday night, the leaders took a helicopter tour of Washington landmarks and had dinner at the Potomac River home of George Washington in Mount Vernon, Virginia.
Tuesday's meetings follow the collaboration by the U.S., France and Britain in missile strikes in Syria earlier this month to respond to the alleged chemical weapons attack. The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria assisting local Arab and Kurdish fighters against IS, though Trump has resisted a deeper U.S. involvement and is eager to withdraw completely from Syria.
Macron's three-day visit to Washington underscores the importance that both sides attach to the relationship: Macron, who calls Trump often, has emerged as something of a "Trump whisperer" at a time when the American president's relationships with other European leaders are more strained. Trump, who attaches great importance to the optics of pageantry and ceremony, chose to honor Macron with the first state visit of his administration as he woos the French president.
Trump ended his first year in office without receiving a foreign leader on a state visit, the first president in nearly 100 years to fail to do so. He was Macron's guest last July at the annual Bastille Day military parade in the center of Paris. Macron and his wife also took Trump and first lady Melania Trump on a tour of Napoleon's tomb and whisked them up in the Eiffel Tower for dinner overlooking the City of Light.
Macron was welcomed back to the White House on Tuesday with a traditional arrival ceremony featuring nearly 500 members of the U.S. military and a booming 21-gun salute. He was also attending a State Department lunch hosted by Vice President Mike Pence.

A court in central Vietnam sentenced video journalist Nguyen Van Hoa to seven years in prison on November 27, 2017, for reporting on environmental protests in central Vietnam as part of an ongoing crackdown on citizen journalism.
Only three days later, blogger Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, widely known as Me Nam or Mother Mushroom, saw a court uphold her 10-year prison sentence for Facebook posts about human rights and environmental issues involving the police and other state forces.
Hoa, 22, was accused of "conducting propaganda against the state" under Article 88 of Vietnam's Penal Code. The charge was related to his reporting on protests that followed an environmental disaster which led to tonnes of dead fish washing up across Vietnam's central coast in April 2016.
Hoa was the first person in Vietnam to use a flycam drone to broadcast live footage of protests outside the Formosa Ha Tinh Steel plant which was revealed to be the cause behind the toxic spill. His footage of more than 10,000 people outside the Formosa gates went viral across social media.
A security trainer and regular contributor to Radio Free Asia, Hoa was detained in January 2017 and initially charged with "abusing democratic rights to infringe upon the interests of the state". The charges against him were changed in June without reason, according to his family.
Human rights and digital groups signed a statement calling on the Vietnamese government to release Hoa in time for the World Press Freedom Day in May. The joint statement said:
Repressing citizen journalists is not only a violation of human rights but also a major impediment to Vietnam's aspirations to become a tech and innovation hub.
When local police originally arrested Hoa, they physically attacked him and confiscated his equipment while he was on assignment in November 2016, according to Radio Free Asia spokesman Rohit Mahajan.
His family informed Loa, alternative news podcast that reports about Vietnam, that they were only told of the trial a day before the public trial.
(Editor's note: Loa, a partner of Global Voices, is a project of a political organization called Viet Tan that promotes democracy in Vietnam. The author of this post is also a Viet Tan organizer.)
In a deal with the Vietnamese government, Formosa agreed to pay 500 million US dollars, which many have criticised to be insignificant relative to the damage caused. Thousands of affected fishermen have continued to protest the unfair compensation despite authorities trying to stop the demonstrations.
Citizen journalists and bloggers who reported on the Formosa disaster have also faced lengthy sentences. One of them is blogger Mother Mushroom, who was arrested in October 2016 and charged with "conducting propaganda against the state".
In June 2017, she was ordered to spend 10 years in prison for her writings, a sentence that was confirmed on November 30 in an appeals trial that lasted only a few hours.
One of her lawyers, Vo An Don, a prominent human rights lawyer, had his law license revoked by the Phu Yen Bar Association on November 26, four days before her trial. He was barred from representing her during the appeals trial.
Vo An Don spoke out against the decision on his Facebook:
This decision is effective immediately, ends my dream of being a lawyer defending the poor and leaves many unjust cases open.
The two cases are part of the Vietnamese government's wider crackdown on free expression. More than 25 activists have been arrested, issued arrest warrants or exiled since January 2017. The harsh prison terms handed down by the courts to activists like Hoa and Mother Mushroom are troubling signs for the state of human rights in Vietnam.

(Corrects ages for Cubs Scouts to 5 to 10 years old, not 7 to 10 years old. Corrects enrollment of girls to 4,500, not 3,000.)
By Katharine Jackson
MCLEAN, Va. (Reuters) - On a front line of the gender equality battle in the United States is Den 13, a suburban Virginia Cub Scout unit made up of girls on their way to next year becoming the first female Scouts in the Boy Scouts of America.
The girls, who are 8 to 10 years old, say they appreciate the outdoor challenges of scouting: finding the route to a waterfall on a wrinkled map, crossing a creek and encountering a snake.
After more than a century as a bastion of boyhood, the Boy Scouts of America announced in October that this year it would begin letting girls join the 5- to 10-year-old Cub Scouts. More than 4,500 girls joined an Early Adopter program this spring.
In 2019, the girls of Den 13 in McLean, Virginia, will be among the first female members of the newly named "Scouts BSA" program, which until the change will still be called "Boy Scouts" and only admit boys aged 11 to 17.
Scouting alongside boys is no issue for 10-year-old Dani Hyder.
"I don't really mind as long as I get to do it," she said. "I don't care what gender the people I'm doing with are."
Like others in her den, 10-year-old Lilly Rumpf went on hikes and family camping trips, but watched from the sidelines as her brother rose through the ranks of the Boy Scouts.
"It was like he got to do all the cool things, and I didn't," she said. "So when I got involved in this, it was really cool."
Boy Scouts of America said admitting girls is making life easier for families with brothers and sisters who want to follow the same path.
"I think our program offers both genders exactly what we want young people to learn and embrace as they grow up," said Les Baron, scout executive for the Boy Scouts National Capital Area Council.
The move comes as attitudes toward gender change and after decades of declining membership. Boy Scouts of America now has about 2.3 million members, a drop of about one-third since 2000. The organization decided to admit openly gay scouts in 2014, and last year welcomed transgender members.
As Boy Scouts of America widens its scope, the Girl Scouts of the USA is reaffirming its commitment to girls.
"Girl Scouts has always proudly owned the 'Girl' in Girl Scouts, and our programming is, and always will, reflect the fact that we are girl-led and girl-centric," the organization said in a statement.
The Boy Scouts held annual meetings in Dallas last week with many awaiting news of a uniform change with different cuts for girls and alternatives like Capri pants and "skorts," or skirts with shorts inside.
For now, the Den 13 girls wear shirts embroidered with "Boy Scouts of America," standard olive shorts, resting their ponytails and braids on plaid neckerchiefs.
Heading to the waterfall, Den 13 took a wrong turn down a dead end trail.
"I kind of like that we got lost," said Hiro Rose, enjoying the river view. After consulting their map, the girls quickly found their way.
For Dani, the best part of the hike was obvious. "Actually having a snake crawl, like slither across my shoe."

Moscow: Australian Open champion and World No 1 Caroline Wozniacki lost 7-6 (2), 6-3 to local player Daria Kasatkina in the quarter-finals of the St Petersburg Ladies Trophy on Friday.
Fresh from her first ever Grand Slam title the Dane had raced to the quarter-finals but had been expecting the Russian to give her a difficult time.
"It's gonna be difficult but I'm excited about it," the 27-year-old said ahead of the clash with the sixth seed Kasatkina.
Fourth seed and defending champion Kristina Mladenovic of France made an important step to retaining her title with a straight-sets win over Czech Katerina Siniakova on Friday.
Mladenovis, ranked 10th in the world, prevailed 6-4, 6-3 to book a semi-final spot and to record her second win over the 21-year-old Siniakova in their fifth head-to-head meeting.
Mladenovic will face Kasatkina.
"It was a very good match as she (Siniakova) has been on great all season," Mladeniovic said on-court after the match. "I'm very happy with the intensity that I've put into the game today.
"No doubts the semi-final will be extremely difficult as Dasha (Kasatkina) is such a talented youngster and she always plays at her top in front of her home crowd."
Meanwhile, Czech two-time former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova cruised comfortably into the last four losing just two games in her 58-minute match with reigning French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia 6-0, 6-2.
In the match for a place in the final Kvitova, who appeared in the main draw courtesy of a wild card, will clash with Germany's Julia Goerges, who ousted another Russian Elena Rybakina 6-3, 6-3.
"At this tournament, every opponent is very hard to beat and I will need to show my best tennis to win the semi-final," Goerges said.

DECEMBER 11, 2017 — BIMCO's Secretary General & CEO, Angus Frew, is extending his contract to the end of 2022. He has held the position since September 2013 and is also a director on the board of Global Ship Lease Inc. He is a former Chief Executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping.
BIMCO's Executive Committee decided to ask him to continue in his leadership role for another five years at i November 2017 meeting.
"Right now, is a very interesting time for shipping, and I am very happy to be offered the opportunity to extend my contract," he says. "I can continue to lead an organization that has the practical expertise and the scope to make a real difference on crucial industry issues, for example, the current environmental discussions and the establishing of a greenhouse gas strategy and objectives for the shipping industry."
"Angus has been a strong and able Secretary General. He is hardworking and has driven BIMCO in the right direction, with more focus on value for our members. I'm very happy that BIMCO has secured his continued service," says BIMCO President Anastasios Papagiannopoulos.
Frew's main priorities for the coming years will be the industry's environmental policy, adding value for BIMCO members and ensuring that the industry speaks with a clear and united voice.
"The most important thing on BIMCO's agenda is the environment. We have the implementation of the 2020 sulfur cap to contend with, and we want a clear strategy and reduction objectives on carbon emissions," says Frew. "Being proactive in these environmental discussions is the only way to make sure that we, as an industry, are regulated in a way that makes practical sense."
At 16-10 and sitting in fourth place in the league, Washington is currently in position to earn at least a first-round bye after missing the playoffs entirely last season.
However, the Mystics still have games remaining against each of the top-three teams in the league, beginning with the Sparks on Wednesday (ESPN2, 7 p.m. ET). Washington will also face the Liberty and Mercury, both of whom are above .500 and within 2½ games of the final bye.
Race for a playoff bye Team Record Games back vs. Mystics Lynx 21-4 + 5 1/2 Sept. 3 Sparks 19-8 + 2 1/2 Wednesday Sun 17-9 + 1 Aug. 29 Mystics 16-10 Liberty 15-12 1 1/2 Aug. 25 Mercury 14-13 2 1/2 Friday
The Mystics are 5-8 against the Western Conference this season and trail the Sparks by 2½ games for the second double-bye. ESPN's WNBA Basketball Power Index gives Washington a 14 percent chance of receiving a double-bye, which would rise to 24 percent with a win.

Volatile Storm in race for eighth
According to WNBA BPI, the Storm currently own the best offense in the Western Conference, predicted to contribute 1.5 points per game more than the average WNBA team. However, Seattle's defense is undermining the work of the offense, which is negatively affecting their scoring margin by a predicted 4.7 points per game (11th in the league).
Sunday, the Storm face the Sky, who currently own the tiebreaker for the final playoff berth. The meeting marks the first of two remaining games between the Sky and Storm, and BPI gives the Sky a 31 percent chance to win both. Although these teams have identical 11-16 records, BPI indicates that Chicago is a more balanced team. On a neutral court, BPI predicts that the Sky would beat the Storm by 3.9 points.

A mother and daughter team are on a mission to teach parents, caregivers, educators and children how to communicate without words.
“My Smart Hands is a company that teachers parents with hearing babies how to sign,” said Laura Berg, founder of My Smart Hands. “It's a way to communicate before the words come in.”
In 2005, while pregnant with her daughter, Berg used the skills she had as an eighth grade teacher, her knowledge of American Sign Language (ASL) and extensive research to design the curriculum for My Smart Hands.
“The beauty about signing with babies is that they can communicate through gestures and sign before they can talk,” said Berg. “It just makes your life so much easier as a parent.”
But she is not alone in this, her daughter Fireese has been helping mom out since she was a baby.
“I do think that I'm creating change and it's the most amazing feeling to think that I'm helping other people,” said Fireese, host of My Smart Hands.
This baby sign language company has more than 200 instructors in North America that teach classes, but where Laura feels she's now made the biggest difference is with her own channel.
” I never imagined that it would be so impactful on peoples lives in such a meaningful way,” said Laura. “But it is and that's why I continue to do it and I continue to make it for free so that everyone can benefit.”

It's almost impossible to get a rise from my favorite farmer, Joe Del Bosque, who grows almonds, melons and asparagus here on the perpetually water-challenged west side of the San Joaquin Valley.
After years of drought, suddenly everything is green. It's raining like crazy, the infamous pumps of the Sacramento Delta are working overtime to fill reservoirs to the south and all over the state, dry fields have become muddy lakes.
“So what are you Westside farmers whining about now?” I asked Del Bosque when I visited him Monday in his office, a modest double-wide trailer on the edge of an almond orchard off Interstate 5.
He chuckled. Farmers are always complaining about something. If they aren't complaining, it's because they're too busy worrying.
Del Bosque is, as usual, worried about water.
But he's also worried about immigration, and about President Trump's vow to deport people who are here illegally. Del Bosque, and just about every grower he knows, depends on migrant labor for harvests.
“We need a workforce,” he said. “We can't have immigration come here and round everyone up and deport them. Coupled with building a wall, it will ruin us. It will ruin the whole fruit and vegetable industry.”
::
Del Bosque's water comes from the Central Valley Project, run by the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which provides much of the water consumed by farms and people in the Central Valley.
In the past few years, he and other Westside farmers have gotten absolutely no water, or a tiny fraction of their normal, subsidized federal allocation. Even though this year has brought a record amount of rain and a boffo snowpack, he thinks he will get shorted again at the end of this month when the feds determine 2018 water allocations.
His need for water will be pitted against the needs of endangered Delta fishes like smelt and salmon. Usually, the fish prevail.
But because nothing is simple when it comes to water, Del Bosque has to worry about too much water, as well. The place he stores his supply — San Luis Reservoir — will soon fill to capacity, putting him in the position of possibly losing expensive water he has already bought. (Federal water costs $220 per acre-foot. Last year, Del Bosque was able to find some water districts willing to part with water at a steep $1,000 to $1,300 per acre-foot.)
He estimates he has more than a million dollars worth of water sitting in the San Luis right now. The reservoir is at 92% capacity, well above its historical average. If it fills to the brim, the Bureau of Reclamation will not be able to pump any more water in from the Delta.
Due to the complexities of water law, the federal government then has the right to take ownership of the farmers' expensive water.
“They say, ‘Hey, your water is taking up space that we need.' I knew this could happen, but after four straight years of drought, I wasn't expecting it,” Del Bosque said. “This is just the risk that we farmers have to assume.”
::
San Joaquin Valley growers tend to be politically conservative. Many were enchanted when Donald Trump came to Fresno last May and announced “there's no drought,” playing right into their favorite narrative: If the government (abetted by environmentalists) didn't insist on shutting off the Delta pumps, there would be plenty of water for agriculture.
“A lot of farmers liked that he said that,” Del Bosque said. “Of course we've been in a natural drought, but yeah, there are some regulations that are making it worse, and maybe that's what he was talking about.”
But even if they liked Trump's stance on water, his harsh immigration policies — and vows to deport people in the country illegally — could make harvesting the fields impossible.
“I think a lot of them thought he was just blowing smoke,” Del Bosque said. And then, of course, Trump assumed office.
California agriculture simply cannot work without migrant labor. For example, the main towns around Del Bosque's 2,000 acres — Dos Palos, Firebaugh, and Mendota — have a combined population of about 20,000, children included.
“When I start harvesting my melons,” Del Bosque said, “I need 300 people. And there's like six other melon guys who need 300 people, and one probably needs 900. So we need around 3,000 people to harvest. Then, the tomato guys need people, the grape guys need people and the garlic guys need people. There are not enough people in these little towns for that seasonal surge in labor needs. That's why we're dependent on people who come from somewhere else.”
Like Mexico.
In 2014, on a lark, Del Bosque, as @WestsideFarmer, tweeted an invitation at President Obama after learning that he planned to visit the Central Valley. “President @BarackObama, I humbly invite you to Del Bosque Farms for a discussion on the effect of the drought on California and its people.”
A week later, Del Bosque and his wife, Maria, strode across a fallowed field with the president and Gov. Jerry Brown. Obama focused on climate change. Farmers were disappointed. “That won't help us for 50 or even 100 years,” Del Bosque said. “How about relaxing the laws to get us a little more water?”
Now he's thinking about tweeting an invitation at @realDonaldTrump. But not about water.
“I would focus on immigration,” Del Bosque said. “I would wait till we have some people working in the fields, picking asparagus or melons, and invite him to come see what kind of work this is, and why we need these people. I don't know if he would get it. A billionaire guy who lives in a penthouse and the only place he goes to work is in these humongous buildings? To come out to the country to see a guy from Oaxaca working in the fields? I don't know if he could relate to it.”
Mexican laborers, after all, put fresh fruit and vegetables on all of our tables. I wonder if President Trump even knows where his food comes from.

Listen up, city dwellers: A farmer's straight talk on the drought
There are science fictions that give you an overall immersive experience of a magnificent (and mysterious) outer world and then there are films that make you question the technology and the kind of world we might end up becoming. But Ridley Scott's 1982 classic, Blade Runner, belonged to none. The film carved its path in the sci-fi genre and dealt with something more substantial than just lasers, aliens, and hi-tech droids. Luckily and thankfully, Blade Runner 2049 carries forward the same legacy and gives a clearer narrative to the replicants' conscience.The story begins almost 30 years after Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a bounty hunter tasked with “retiring” renegade android slaves "replicants", runs away with one of them, to start a new life on his own terms. Now the focus is on a younger and unequivocally robotic model, officer KD6-3.7 (Ryan Gosling), a “synthetic” human who's 99 percent perfect, but still a bit off. That subtle flaw serves the actor well as “K” is a rule-abiding Blade Runner who takes orders from plausibly tough LAPD Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright). Going through with a routine mission to eliminate an early-model Nexus-8, K makes a startling discovery — one that threatens to undermine the delicate sense of order between humans and the now million-fold class of android slaves. As it is, the replicants' submission depends on their built-in expiration dates and the understanding that they were created to serve their masters. Anything could throw this system into turmoil, though Joshi has a reason to fear that this one will incite a replicant uprising, and so she orders K to destroy the evidence.Except K disobeys, returns to the remote protein farm where the opening fight takes place and discovers a clue that ties him to characters from the original film (while the signature object in Blade Runner was an origami unicorn, here it's a carved wooden horse). However, the links are hazy, since a huge electromagnetic pulse wiped out nearly all digital records a quarter-century earlier — the so-called Blackout of 2022 — forcing K to do some old-fashioned sleuthing that leads him to Deckard himself, hiding out in what remains of the city of Las Vegas.The film serves as a fulfilling sequel to the original classic wherein the story is delved deeper and the sci-fiction part is kept in the backdrop. Director Denis Villeneuve has given a rich, artsy vibe to an otherwise laden with CGI genre, thus giving the film a much-needed soul. In the age and stage, when one has seen dystopian drama and sci-fiction stories like the Handmaid's tale and Westworld, Blade Runner 2049 still feels real and authentic. Villeneuve hasn't touched much of the 2019's world created by Scott, just a few upgrades. The futuristic world built in the original never needed much doing in any sequel, anyway. K's personal AI Joi is a pleasant addition and an important character in K's 'hopeful' life.It's perhaps the irony that plays the central part in the film where humans have lost their souls, while replicants know precisely what they want- to be human. There's a lot more layering and depth given to every character and the entire journey of 'finding self' that viewers take with K, is engaging and heartbreaking. Although, the 2 hours 45 minutes long narrative does take a toll on you right before and after the interval. But the moment K meets Deckard, things start to build up and the end consumes you to an extent that even after you leave the theatre, the effects linger on.Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel this classic deserved. It contributes to the world of humans and replicants build by Scott and Villeneuve carries on the legacy of delivering a heart-warming, thought-provoking story under the blanket of dystopian science-fiction. This is a sequel everyone ought to watch.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on Wednesday, issued a licence to the Bank of China (BoC), one of the four biggest state-owned commercial lenders in China, to operate in India, according to a media report.
Reserve Bank of India issues licence to Bank of China to operate in India.This was a commitment made by PM Modi to Chinese leadership: Sources — ANI (@ANI) July 4, 2018
The RBI approval follows Prime Minister Narendra Modi's commitment that India would expedite procedures to allow the BoC to set up branches in India. Security clearances for the bank were given earlier.
In early June, Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, in the Chinese port city of Qingdao. That meeting reportedly covered key aspects of bilateral engagement, reflecting a resolve by the two countries to reset relations and boost trust, which has taken a beating owing to several sticky issues, including last year's Doklam standoff.
According to News18, several foreign banks, including the Bank of China, have sought RBI's permission to set up operations in India. Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC) already has operations in India along with 44 other foreign banks, according to the RBI.
A Killiney Beach resident is desperate for help with water running through her property.
“I don't know what to do. I don't. I can't be responsible for all the water. I can't,” Tammy Woods said.
“Nobody will help me. I'm just trying to protect my house.”
Woods estimates there are 26,000 litres of water running through her driveway every minute.

She jerry-rigged a culvert system, digging a network of trenches, but it's not enough.
A four inch pipe blew out of its pail and water started spraying everywhere, Woods said.
The homeowner said she's also worried about the impact the water is having on her downhill neighbours.
“I don't know what to do. I'm going to need an industrial-sized culvert system, but then it's not going to fix what's below,” she said.

Woods said three runoff streams across the road end in a culvert that empties onto her property.
“There was never a drop out of that culvert apparently for 40 years,” she said. “Three years ago, it started to dribble.”
“The water has nowhere to go except into [the] culvert, which dumps into the middle of my property.”

Wayne Carson, Central Okanagan West's regional director, said it doesn't seem right for a culvert to empty onto private property.
There's a new culvert down the road that was installed after a mudslide last year, but it's running dry, he said.
“Obviously development upslope has got to be affecting where the water flows,” he said.

Woods said about 10 cm of water filled her garage last night, and she's worried it will get worse with warmer weather.
“The water is going to double, and I won't be able to control it. It's going to flood my house,” she said.
The Ministry of Transportation said it is investigating the situation and will determine next steps once more information is known.
Witnesses who were inside the car at the time of the shooting have said none of the officers tried to keep Yarber alive, according to Merritt and the witnesses' attorney, Dale Galipo. "He sat there bleeding to death," Galipo said of Yarber.
Vegetarianism, at its most superficial level, is the not eating of animal flesh. And should include milk which is liquid animal flesh. But do you keep track of what the industry feeds you by way of animal organs and glands in one form or another?
Different industries use the animal brain, spinal cord, pancreas, stomach, liver, lungs, kidney and ovaries, endocrine, pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid and adrenal glands.
The glands are extracted and frozen. The surrounding fat and connective tissue are trimmed off. They are placed on waxed paper and kept at −18 °C. When the glands arrive at the pharmaceutical plant they are chopped and mixed with different solutions for extraction, or placed in a vacuum drier. After drying, the glands are milled into a powder and made into capsules, or used in liquid form.
Brains and spinal cords are a source of cholesterol. This is the raw material to make vitamin D Cholecalciferol. Vitamin D is added to dairy products, juices, and cereals that are then labelled as “fortified with vitamin D.”
Cholesterol is a waxy fat-like substance, used in the formulation of eye and face makeup, shaving preparations, and shampoo.
Bile is obtained from the animal's gall bladder. It is used for the treatment of indigestion, constipation and bile tract disorders and to increase the activity of the liver. Bile from cattle or pigs is sold as a dry extract or in liquid form. Some ingredients of bile, such as prednisone and cortisone, are extracted separately, and used as medicines.
The liver is the largest gland in animals. The liver of mature cattle usually weighs about 5 kilograms, while that of a pig weighs approximately 1.4 kilograms. Liver extract is produced by mixing raw ground liver with slightly acidified hot water. The stock is concentrated into a paste in a vacuum at a low temperature, and is used as a raw material by the pharmaceutical industry as a source of vitamin B12, and as a nutritional supplement used to treat anaemia. Heparin, which is used as a blood thinner in humans, is extracted from the liver, lungs and the lining of the small intestines.
Progesterone and oestrogen are hormones extracted from pig ovaries and used to treat reproductive problems in women and in anti-wrinkle face creams.
Relaxin is a hormone taken from the ovaries of pregnant sows, and is used during human childbirth.
The pancreas of pigs and cows provides insulin, which regulates sugar metabolism and is used in the management of diabetes. If you are diabetic and have been injecting yourself, then you have been keeping yourself well (since 1921) with the use of cow and pig extracts. More than two tons of pig parts are needed to extract just eight ounces of purified insulin.
Glucagon, extracted from the cells of the pancreas, is used to increase blood sugar, and to treat insulin overdoses, or low blood sugar, caused by alcoholism. Chymotrypsin and trypsin are enzymes from animal or fish pancreas, especially cod, and used to improve healing after surgery or injury. Trypsin is used to dissolve blood clots, prevent common colds, and in the food industry to improve the workability of dough in baking, manufacture of sauces to add flavour, cheese, beer and non-allergenic baby food.
Adrenaline or epinephrine is extracted from the adrenal glands of hogs, cattle, and sheep. Injected, it increases blood flow to the muscles, output of the heart, pupil dilation, and blood sugar.
Arachidonic Acid is a fatty acid taken from animal liver and marketed as a bodybuilding supplement. It is also used in skin creams and lotions to soothe eczema and rashes.
Elastin and collagen is a protein taken from the neck ligaments and aortas of cattle or pigs and marketed as skin anti-agers (one of the many fake promises on the market).
Lipase and rennet are two enzymes taken from the stomachs and tongue glands of calves, kids, and lambs. They are used in cheese-making, as clotting agents and in digestive aids. Pepsin comes from pig stomach and has the same uses as rennet.
Palmitic acid and oleic acid are fatty acids which can be obtained from both animal and vegetable fats. Oleic acid is usually taken from tallow, which is animal fat (also used for candles). You will find it in candy, ice cream and some beverages and condiments, soap, shampoos, permanent wave solutions, creams, nail polish, lipsticks and skin creams.
Oleyl alcohol, sold under the name of Ocenol, is a fat found in fish oils which is used in the manufacture of detergents, as a plasticizer for softening fabrics, and as a carrier for medications.
Panthenol, also called pro vitamin B 5, is a common moisturising ingredient used in skin care products, including cosmetics, hair sprays, shampoos, conditioners, nasal sprays, eye drops, lozenges, and cleaning solutions for contact lenses. It is also recommended by tattoo artists as a post-tattooing moisturising cream. It is taken from animal liver and kidneys, lobster, fish shellfish and chicken, but can also be from vegetables, mushrooms, legumes and lentils. If the product does not specify that it is from non-animal sources then take it for granted that it is.
Squalene is the gooey oil squeezed out of shark livers. The beauty industry loves Squalene because it is easily absorbed into the skin without leaving a greasy residue, so you'll find it in many moisturisers, sunscreens, and oils, hair dyes. Pristane, obtained from the liver oil of sharks, from which its name is derived (Latin pristis, "shark"), is used as a lubricant, skin and hair conditioner and anti-corrosive agent in cosmetics.
Polypeptides are strings of amino acids linked together. Amino acids are the basic building blocks of proteins. Commercially they are derived from animal protein and are used for conditioning hair.
Polysorbate is an amber/golden-coloured viscous liquid made from dehydrated sugar alcohol and oleic acid, a fatty acid found taken from cows, sheep and pigs, but can be from vegetable fats if specifically said. Polysorbates 60 and 80 are the most commonly used in food production. The additive increases the shelf life of baked goods and improve its colour and volume. They are commonly found in baked goods, frozen desserts, and imitation coffee creamers. They are often used in cosmetics to make essential oils soluble in water.
Stearic Acid, when animal-derived, is a fat from cows, pigs, and sheep and, abroad, from dogs and cats euthanised in animal shelters. It is used in cosmetics, soaps, lubricants, candles, hairspray, conditioners, deodorants, creams, chewing gum, and food flavouring.
It is not just pigs, cows and sheep that are killed for their organs and glands. Male Musk deer produce a gland oil called musk, which is stored in a hairy pouch just the size of a golf ball, in front of the penis. They are killed for it. The dried gland is chopped into small pieces and left in high-strength alcohol to mature for months. Musk is still used by the fragrance industry. The perfume industry also uses castoreum, which is a secretion from the glands between the pelvis and the base of the tail of the killed beaver.
“Natural sources” is a very deceptive word. If vegetarian, the food writes clearly that it is from vegetable sources. But, most often in the health and food industry, especially in the cosmetics area, it means animal sources such as organs, glands, fat, protein, and oil. There is a reason that companies write their products in such small type that it is almost impossible to read them, but do try. Your one complaint and insistence on a non-animal alternative could save thousands of lives.

Farmers who have lagged behind in planting made up a lot of ground in the last week.
The U.S.D.A. crop report says farmers in the northern third of the state were able to plant 20 percent of their projected corn acres last week. The northwest and north-central areas of the state had been way behind due to wet conditions. The report says the northern part of the state now has just 10 percent of the corn left to be planted. That compares to 96 percent of the corn that's already in the ground statewide.
Seventy-seven percent of the corn has already emerged. Soybean planting statewide is now one week ahead of the five-year average at 81 percent — and 44 percent of the beans have emerged.

Suriya, KV Anand might join hands for third time; film to start shooting by 2018 second half?
After working together in popular Tamil outings such as Ayan and Maattrraan, actor Suriya and filmmaker K.V Anand is likely to reunite for the third time for a yet-untitled project which is currently in discussion phase.
Reliable sources have confirmed that talks have been initiated with respect to this project, which is most likely to be bankrolled by AGS Entertainment, the makers of Maattrraan and the company shares a long-standing collaboration with Anand.
“It's definitely not a rumour anymore. Anand and Suriya have discussed an idea and are interested to work on it sometime next year. Suriya will complete all pending projects before even commencing work on this project,” a source told Firstpost.
On Saturday, when news about the Suriya-Anand project made rounds on social media, the actor's fans asked the director to clarify the reports. Anand replied with a smiley to one of the fan tweets that wanted the announcement to be made official soon.
“The official announcement will be made very soon. Things are yet to be officially signed and hence the team doesn't want to react to any rumours on the project,” the source added.
Currently awaiting the release of Vignesh Shivan directed Thaana Serntha Kootam (TSK), rumoured to be a remake of Akshay Kumar's Special 26, Suriya's lineup in 2018 looks very exciting. He also has a project with filmmaker Selvaraghavan in his kitty and it's going to be the first film he'll take up next year soon after the release of TSK, slated to hit the screens for Pongal 2018.
During the announcement of the project last year, Selvaraghavan, best known for films such as Kadhal Kondein, Pudhupettai and Ayirathil Oruvan tweeted: “Super excited about working with Suriya, one of the finest actors in India and Dream Warrior Pictures, a young and energetic team.”
This project is expected to roll from February and the makers are kicked about the project.
Not long ago, reports emerged that a sequel to Ayan is in the offing. However, speaking to Times of India earlier this year, Anand clarified: “I'm not really keen on making sequels. Even if I want to do one, I'd do it as something different yet similar, like how I did with Kavan. So, my next project is not Ayan 2. I'm currently working on a new project, but it is in a very early stage to divulge details.”
Anand's last directorial was Vijay Sethupathi starrer Kavan, which was cut from the same cloth as his 2011 blockbuster Ko, which starred Jiiva in the lead.

Former Cape Coral Mayor fights to support domestic abuse victims
Fighting for domestic violence victims, former Cape Coral Mayor Marni Sawicki says the murder-suicide over the weekend hits close to home.
She says Madonna Pierce McGuire did everything right. She got a no contact order but her husband didn't stay away and it cost her life.
Sawicki said, “Law enforcement have to wait until something's done but when something's done it could be something like this”

Police found two people dead inside a Southwest Cape Coral home Saturday.
They say Jason McGuire shot and killed his wife madonna before turning the gun on himself.
But just two weeks ago police arrested Jason McGuire for threatening his wife with a hammer. She even told police she feared for her life and took out a restraining order on her husband.
So how did he get so close?
“We need an overhaul of the entire judicial system, how we handle domestic violence cases,” Sawicki said, adding, a case like this is personal. She herself a victim of domestic violence.

“For the most part, it's being aware of my surroundings looking before I get out of my car, all those things. But no, no one feels safe .” Sawicki like Madonna McGuire has a restraining order against her abuser. But she says more needs to be done. “Lobbying. Changing some of the laws at the federal level… Training for law enforcement.”
“It doesn't matter about the victim, it doesn't matter how many times they've gone back… What matters is why did he do it and we don't really have that conversation,” said Sawicki.

Malik Monk had 20 points and a career-high eight rebounds, Derek Willis had 16 points and No. 13 Kentucky made 10 three-pointers in the first half to roll past Tennessee, 83-58, on Tuesday night at Lexington, Ky.
Seeking to stay atop the Southeastern Conference, the Wildcats (21-5, 11-2) avenged last month's 82-80 road loss to the Volunteers with their best performance in a while.
Kentucky held Tennessee (14-12, 6-7) to 35% shooting. The Volunteers, who were outscored 18-0 in fastbreak points, got 17 points from Admiral Schofield.
No. 15 Florida 114, at Auburn 95: Canyon Barry scored a season-high 30 points and the Gators ((21-5, 11-2 SEC) rode a big second-half surge. Locked in a 50-50 tie at halftime, Florida went on a 13-3 run and never looked back. Auburn fell to 16-10, 5-8 in a game so dominated by offense that 13 players scored in double figures. Anfernee McLemore led the Tigers with 19 points.
at No. 16 Purdue 74, Rutgers 55: The Boilermakers (21-5, 10-3 Big Ten) pulled away in the second half, with center Isaac Haas finishing with 24 points and 11 rebounds, and power forward Caleb Swanigan getting 17 rebounds. Nigel Johnson scored 23 points for the Scarlet Knights (13-14, 2-12).
No. 25 Notre Dame 84, at Boston College 76: Bonzie Colson collected 20 points, and the Fighting Irish (20-7, 9-5 Atlantic Coast Conference) overcame a 13-point first-half deficit to send the Eagles to their 10th straight loss. Boston College (9-18, 2-12) trailed, 78-76, with just under a minute left, but Notre Dame's V.J. Beachem hit two free throws with 24.1 seconds to play. Ky Bowman led the Eagles with 29 points.
Nova Scotia RCMP are investigating what led to a home invasion in Lunenburg early Sunday morning.
Police were called to a home on Fox Street shortly before 7 a.m. AT, after receiving a call from the residents that a man and two women had entered their apartment and assaulted them.
The two residents suffered minor injuries during the incident.
RCMP arrested a 33-year-old man at a home on Kissing Bridge Road in nearby First Peninsula, N.S., a short time later.
Police do not believe this was a random act and say that the individuals involved in the home invasion are known to one another.
There is no word yet on if charges will be laid. Police say the investigation remains ongoing.
Rodney Smith Jr. is a mowing machine.
The native of the British island territory of Bermuda has cut lawns of various sizes in every state in the country. One of the biggest was in Vermont, where the founder of the nonprofit Raising Men Lawn Care Service said he used a push mower to single-handedly cut an acre's worth of grass in about two hours.
Rodney asked God to tell him his purpose. He found it when he saw an elderly man struggling to mow his lawn.

That's been just one stop in the second rendition (he completed the inaugural campaign last summer) of the 50 States 50 Lawns campaign, Smith's journey to cut lawns in every state for veterans.
The organization was born in 2016 during Smith's undergrad career at Alabama A&M. On his way home from school one day, he saw an elderly man mowing a yard. The man appeared to be struggling, so Smith decided to lend a hand. The rest is history.
See how Rodney is changing lives and lawns for military veterans with one small token of kindness.

Our Men in Blue are blazing quite the trail at the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy 2017 in England. Barring that one forgettable glitch against Sri Lanka, they have firmly established themselves as the team to beat. Incidentally, this team is the only one to have reached the semifinals in every single ICC tournament, dating back to the 2011 World Cup.
Not just on field, this current crop of cricketers is on point with their game off it as well. Be it Shikhar Dhawan, Ravindra Jadeja, Rohit Sharma or Hardik Pandya, their posts from London show they've got a stylish grip on every aspect of their appearance — from their clothes to their beards.
Grooming Game
Remember the #BreakTheBeard challenge from IPL 10? Well that's still going very strong.
Here's Jadeja taking the lead and posting his new look before heading out for the Champions Trophy:
Hardik Pandya followed suit, asking all those who'd taken the #BreakTheBeard challenge to keep up with his new look:
Shikhar Dhawan also revealed his #BreakTheBeard look just before the big India/Bangladesh semifinal:
Dapper Dressers
When they aren't sporting their team jerseys, these cricketers like to show off their personal style. Here, once again, is Hardik Pandya, who was spotted making his way around London:
His teammates, be it Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma, or Ajinkya Rahane and Jasprit Bumrah, are not far behind. Here they are, just before they set off for a dinner at the Indian High Commissioner's house:
This young team is winning hearts with their on-field game and turning heads with their style quotient off it. It's great to watch the boys have fun, look good and simultaneously #BreakTheBeard.
Changes are coming quickly to Evans Road in Waterdown, where 10-year-old Jasmin Hanif was struck and killed by a vehicle last month.
READ MORE: Girl, 10, dies after being struck by vehicle in Hamilton's west end
Hamilton City Council has approved Councillor Judi Partridge's motion to reduce the speed limit from 50- to 40-kilometres per hour on Evans Road, between Highway 5 and Parkside Drive.
Partridge adds that city staff have already implemented other traffic calming measures in the wake of Jasmin's death, including “knock down sticks” and signs that flash the speed that a vehicle is travelling.
READ MORE: Grieving father calls for traffic calming after daughter killed in Waterdown
Partridge notes that traffic counts taken recently by city staff, show close to 1200 vehicles each hour on Evans Road, which has two lanes and no shoulders.
She describes it as a “rural road that is being used as a bypass” by drivers who are looking to avoid Highway 5.
Jasmin was trying to cross the road on May 16, when a motorist in one lane waved her through amidst heavy traffic. She was killed when she stepped in front of a vehicle travelling in the opposite direction.
Two major events, one on dirt one on pavement, one in the Northeast, one in the South, vied last Saturday for the headlines.
In Georgetown, Delaware, where Dirt Modified racing got started this year, Ryan Watt out dueled Matt Sheppard to win it all.
Further down the eastern seaboard, in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Jon McKennedy drove Tommy Baldwin's Asphalt Modified to a hard earned win with Jimmy Blewett hounding him.
Nice crowds watched good fields of competitive cars contend for victory.
While both race winners drove excellent races, it is the timing of these events that gives these winning drives far greater meaning.
Watt and McKennedy got the Modified seasons off and running – making news for their wins as well as what they portend for the months of racing that lie ahead.
The Thar Link Express, the lesser known of two trains that link India and Pakistan, is a caravan of stories that spill across the border. This British era rail link was shut after the 1965 India-Pakistan war, but was revived in 2006 and serves as an alternative to the Samjhauta Express.
I will apply for a visa this year and travel to Pakistan. - Imad Khan
The journey from Jodhpur to Munabao takes over six hours by road. The topography changes rapidly along the route. Vegetation grows sparse and eventually vanishes. For miles, one sees nothing but sand. The famed virgin sand dunes of Barmer take over. If one was to step out of the car onto an empty stretch of the highway, he would hear nothing but silence. There is no one to be seen for several kilometres at end. Not a single shot has been fired on the India-Pakistan border in Rajasthan since 1971. But this was not always the case.In 1965, India and Pakistan fought their first major war and some of the older residents remember fearing for their lives. “I was a five-year-old living in Pakistan at the time. I remember hiding when we heard the sound of guns or that of fighter jets flying overhead. We knew we would never be safe in Pakistan, so we made our way to India,” says Bhootra.During the war, Pakistan Air Force bombed the Munabao-Khokkhrapar rail link. After this, the rail link was disrupted and remained shut for 41 years. But for those who had family ties across the border, not travelling to the other side was not an option. Imdad Khan, a resident of Padmana village, which is hardly a kilometer from the border, says, “My aunt lives in Pakistan. My father has always been close to her. So he had to go see his sister. Back when the Thar Link Express was not functioning, people from this region had to travel to Amritsar, cross over to Lahore and then make the long journey into Sindh.”Munabao and Khokhrapar are just 10-kilometre away from each other. But before the train began, a round trip would mean people would have to travel a staggering 4,000 kms. All this for a distance that could easily be covered on foot.In February 2006, the train once again made its journey from Jodhpur to Munabao. An old British-era rail link was revived and the Sind Mail was rechristened the Thar Link Express in India and Thar Express in Pakistan. It leaves from Jodhpur at 1 am every Saturday and chugs into Munabao at 7 am. At Munabao, the passengers are asked to de-board. After hours of immigration formalities, the train moves from Munabao and covers the remaining 500 meters of Indian Territory before entering Pakistan.When the Sind Mail ran before 1965, Pakistani custom officials used to conduct formalities at Khokhrapar station. In 2006, ahead of the grand reopening of the rail link, Pakistan constructed the brand new Zero Point Railway Station, which is just 50 meters from the pillars demarcating the International Boundary. For six months, the Thar Link Express crosses over to Zero Point Railway Station, where passengers alight and board the Thar Express, run by Pakistan Railways. For the other half of the year, it is the Pakistani train that crosses from Zero Point to Munabao. Passengers are only allowed to board at Jodhpur. Pakistani citizens who travel to India, are not allowed west of National Highway 68.But the last station on the Indian side of the border doesn't come without its glitches. There are no functional mobile networks here. When News18 asked immigration officer Kailash Meghwal whether the landline phones at the railway station worked, he confessed that they did not. In the event of an emergency, another official says, those at Munabao railway station would have no means of contacting the outside world for help.Akali village is nestled between two sand dunes, just 500 meters from Pakistan border. The first Pakistani village on that side, Sajan Jo Par, is visible from atop the dunes. Locals in Akali worship a deity called Jata Mata. There is a small temple in the village here but the main temple now lies in Pakistan. A village elder looks on sadly towards the border and says, “I have always wanted to visit the temple on the other side. But it would cost money to travel to Delhi for a visa and Jodhpur to board the train.”But for others, it gives them hope that travelling to that ‘foreign' land is now within their reach. “I have never been there (Pakistan). But my father has. I will apply for a visa this year and travel to Pakistan. I will take this train. Is baar apni bua se zaroor miloonga (This time, I will surely meet my aunt),” says Imdad Khan.Keshav Kohli's house in Amritsar's old town is a shrine to himself. The walls outside his house are plastered with posters declaring him as the candidate from Apna Punjab Party, a lesser known political outfit. He fought and lost the 2017 Punjab Assembly polls. Inside is a giant portrait of Bhagat Singh, his “idol”, although it is another matter that he confesses he hasn't read any of Bhagat Singh's writings. Kohli, who works as a physical education trainer in Amritsar city, set up the Independent Students Federation (ISF) to “articulate the demands of the youth”.As we walk through the village, a faint sound of news playing out from a television catches our attention. The voice of the female news anchor has this chaste Urdu tone to it.

The Ministry of Culture and Tourism has declared 2018 as the "Year of Troy" to mark the 20th anniversary of the ancient city's inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
As part of the celebrations, boat tours between Çanakkale's Ayvacık (Küçükkuyu) district and Greece's Lesbos Island are being organized by GESTAŞ and DENTUR AVRASYA, who also serve on the Dardanelles, Imbros, Tenedos and South Marmara lines.
The Küçükkuyu Customs Gate was recently opened after some restoration work. The boat tours will bring visitors from the Greek island to the ancient city of Troy.
This will also give Çanakkale an opportunity to tell the legend of Troy to tourists from Greece as well as other countries. The tours will be organized regularly through the whole summer.
Thanks to the tour, visitors coming to Lesbos from different places around the world will also be able to reach Çanakkale easily.
While the tours are expected to contribute to the city's tourism sector by boosting the number of tourists visiting the ancient city. The first tour between Küçükkuyu pier and Petra Port in Lesbos was organized on May 28. There will be two tours every weekday during this summer.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India likely retained the position of world's fastest growing major economy in the January-March quarter, surpassing China's growth of 6.8 percent, driven by gains in manufacturing and consumer spending.
FILE PHOTO: Employees work on an assembly line of Hero Motocorp during a media tour to the newly opened plant in Neemrana, in the desert Indian state of Rajasthan, October 20, 2014. REUTERS/Anindito Mukherjee/File Photo
The median in a Reuters poll on the latest quarter's annual growth INGDPQ=ECI was 7.3 percent, the best pace since July-September 2016, the quarter before the government unexpectedly scrapped high-value currency notes.
Forecasts for January-March ranged from 6.9 to 7.7 percent.
The government will release GDP data on Thursday around 1200 GMT. On Monday, Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said growth in Asia's third largest economy was expected to grow 7.3-7.5 percent.
The data, combined with April's higher annual inflation pace of 4.58 percent, could put pressure on the Reserve Bank of India to raise interest rates next week after keeping them on hold for a fourth straight meeting last month.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is expected to seek a second term in 2019 general elections, has launched a nation-wide goods and services tax and allowed foreign investment in defence and e-commerce businesses to boost economic growth.
However, a botched implementation of the GST nearly scuttled India's growth prospects in the near term.
Economists said a rise in capital investment growth to near 9 percent in the last quarter of the 2017/18 fiscal year compared with 2.4 percent a year earlier indicated a pick-up in the private investments.
Yet banking credit, a main source for corporate borrowing, remained weak following a surge in bad loans, as banks have been reluctant to extend new loans. The 21 state lenders hold two-thirds of banking assets, and accounted for the bulk of the record $150 billion of soured loans in the banking sector in 2017.
Consumption, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of the $2.5 trillion economy likely remained firm, supporting economic growth as reflected in the higher sales of consumer durables and vehicles.
“Corporate sector results and the industrial production readings have been better than expected. Hence, the industrial sector could pull the GDP growth number up,” said Tushar Arora, senior economist with HDFC Bank.
Growth is likely to get a boost from monsoon rains, which hit the southern state of Kerala a few days earlier than normal, potentially brightening the outlook for agricultural output.
RISING OIL PRICES
The biggest risk India faces is rising crude oil prices LCOc1, which this month hit $80 a barrel, their highest since 2014.
India meets 80 percent of its oil needs from imports.
Prices of diesel and petrol surged to a record high last week, stoking opposition criticism of Modi's administration.
Higher oil prices have already pressured the rupee INR=, near a record low last week and Asia's worst performer.
“Rising oil prices can weigh on the consumer demand and lead to higher borrowing costs for the government,” Arora of HDFC Bank said.
The government's Economic Survey, issued in January, estimated that every $10 per barrel rise in global oil prices cuts growth by 0.2-0.3 percentage points.
Still, some analysts expect India's economy to grow more than 7 percent in 2018/19, helped by a normal monsoon and a pick-up in private investment.
The International Monetary Fund expects economic growth could reach 7.4 percent in 2018/19.
An Indian Finance Ministry official told CNBC on Monday that estimated growth in the last fiscal year, which ended on March 31, was 6.7 percent, below 2016/17's pace of 7.1 percent.
The National Weather Service in Seattle has issued an Areal Flood Watch through 4:00 am Thursday morning. 1-2 inches of rain are expected to fall over the region today with more expected tonight. All low-lying areas of the county could be susceptible to ponding and pooling of water during this event. Small streams and rivers could overflow their banks due to the heavy rainfall rain and quick runoff.
The threat of Landslides is increased throughout the region, due to the rain saturated soils and heavy rain forecast for today. The threat will likely last through the weekend.
As of 5:30 am today, NONE of the area rivers are predicted to reach flood stage although they will rise today. Smaller streams and creeks in the county are at risk of filling quickly and overtopping their banks.
Grays Harbor Emergency Management urges all drivers to use caution while driving due reduced visibility during the heavy rainfall and for the possibility of ponding of water on all area streets and highways.

In time of war, where can you go to find sanctuary?
Sarah Franklin, who grew up in the Gloucestershire countryside and has had a lifelong fascination with the beautiful Forest of Dean, heard about the Second World War prisoner of war camps there from her grandmother who took in sewing for the inmates.
But it was an aborted 2012 plan to sell off a chunk of the publicly-owned forest's woodlands that set in motion her moving, tender but powerful debut novel which explores two very different and damaged young people finding solace in the forest's healing rhythms of work and nature.
In this enchanting, thought-provoking story we meet Seppe, a gentle Italian PoW haunted by memories of war and a brutal father, and chippy city girl Connie Granger escaping from secrets in bombed-out Coventry to find a safe harbour, and maybe even a new life, as a lumberjill with the Women's Timber Corps.
When they are thrown together amidst the calming beauty of the ancient forest, the two outsiders, Connie and Seppe, discover a liberating sense of identity in both their work and each other, but the fiercely independent Connie must decide if the price of freedom will be too great.
In the early spring 1944, Connie escapes her home in Coventry after the Blitz devastates the city. She must learn to survive on her own now but this endless war isn't all bad because it gives her ‘the chance to shift around a bit.' And that's useful when you have a secret to hide.
Unsure of what will be expected of her, Connie finds a job with the Women's Timber Corps in the Forest of Dean as a lumberjill and soon finds far more joy and satisfaction in felling trees, cross-cutting, bark stripping and shredding than her factory work which was merely ‘a way to get a wage packet.'
For her, this remote community is a refuge and an escape, a place where she can protect the secret she has brought with her from Coventry.
Meanwhile, Seppe feels ‘dishonourable relief' that for him the fighting is over. A ‘bad patriot,' he only pretended to support the fascist forces of Mussolini because he was beaten into submission by his father but he is anxious now about what lies ahead for him in England.
Connie and Seppe's meeting signals new beginnings. They find in each other the means to imagine their own lives anew and to face the things which each fears the most. But as they are drawn together, the world outside the forest haven is being torn apart. Old certainties are crumbling and then Connie's secret is revealed and both must now make a life-defining choice…
Franklin, a judge for the Costa Short Story Award whose creative non-fiction has been published in anthologies in the USA, has found fertile new ground in this warm, original and compelling literary fiction debut which is filled with vivid period detail, atmospheric charm and a richly imagined cast of characters.
Star players are Connie and Seppe, the two young victims of wartime, displaced by conflict but discovering that nature – ‘the scent of bud and blossom in every breath' – holds the power to heal wounds, give meaning and purpose to fractured lives, and bring the inner peace that had once seemed so elusive.
The forest – initially an alien and unfamiliar place in which to hide painful secrets – becomes a character in its own right, an eternal symbol of freedom, of belonging, of renewal and, most importantly, of hope for the future.
Connie and Seppe's intense and bittersweet journey is also a touching and overdue tribute to the Women's Timber Corps and the groundbreaking lumberjills whose hard work and skills earned a grudging acceptance from farmers and foresters that they were just as good as the men they had replaced.
Immaculately researched and cleverly crafted, this is a story to delight, inform and impress in equal measure.

Ten young teammates, ranging in age from 15 to 21. Six team personnel. All taken from their families too soon, from their loved ones, and from the tightly knit community of Humboldt, Sask. they called home.
The tragedy that unfolded Apr. 6, as the Humboldt Broncos Junior A hockey team headed to a playoff game, has resonated with all Canadians.
It's a ritual that every parent can relate to, whether it's sending your kids across the street to play a quick game of pick-up or packing their bags for a cross-country tournament. The shared experience of team sports, particularly hockey, speaks to who we are as a nation. It speaks to how we come together.
The city of Humboldt, with a population of less than 6,000, knew as much as any other community how sport can be the tie that binds. The Broncos were their team.
Their support for the team brought the city together. Whether it was cheering wildly for the boys or billeting players in their homes, they cared for the team. And the team cared for them, too. They volunteered in the community, worked with the local youth and were an all around happy face around town.
“Before games the team can often be found having a pre-game meal at Johnny's Bistro, a go-to spot where players get 50 per cent discounts on their meals,” a Postmedia feature on the team and city reports.
“The Humboldt Broncos were not about building hockey players but creating amazing young men,” team president Kevin Garinger said of deceased coach Darcy Haugan's approach. “That's what we had in our organization — was amazing young men. That was Darcy's belief and that through that process, they would ultimately become great hockey players too.”
Canada stands united in mourning with the families and loved ones of these lost athletes.
We mourn the players — Adam Herold, Connor Lukan, Evan Thomas, Jacob Leicht, Jaxon Joseph, Logan Boulet, Logan Hunter, Logan Schatz, Stephen Wack and Parker Tobin. We mourn the team personnel — Brody Hinz, Darcy Haugan, Glen Doerksen, Mark Cross, Dayna Brons and Tyler Bieber.
The reports make it clear: these players were loved, they will be missed, and they will not be forgotten.

Canada's blood supply dips as limits on gay donors persist, Aug. 11
Thank you for reporting on Canada's constant need for blood donations. As you know, blood and blood products are an integral part of Canada's health system, with patients across the country relying on these life-changing and often life-saving interventions.
As Canadian Blood Services works to collect the necessary amount of donations for Canadian patients, we also work to promote health and wellness of our donors. As noted in your article, eligibility criteria evolve. Canadian Blood Services is dedicated to being as minimally restrictive as possible, and maintaining the safety of the blood supply.
I was disappointed that your story was not completely reflective of that commitment, particularly as it relates to men who have sex with men. Canadian Blood Services, in partnership with Héma-Québec and with funding from Health Canada, is supporting research projects investigating eligibility criteria and screening processes for men who have sex with men.

“We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.” – William Casey, CIA Director 1981
Well Blue Jackets fans, you've made it. Your team is now just hours away from their opening night puck drop. After a pretty eventful offseason, training camp and preseason, it's time for the real stuff.
Before their season kicks off though, I'd like to present a handful of Jackets players to keep a close eye on in the early goings. Obviously, every player that laces up has an important role on the team. But based on the offseason moves and the overall state of the team, I believe there are five or six Blue Jackets that will be under the microscope through the first few games.
Pierre-Luc Dubois
Dubois was in the spotlight all the way through training camp and it probably won't go away anytime soon. The former third overall pick in 2016 has made the roster and will look to ride an impressive preseason into the regular season.
Because he was picked right behind Auston Matthews and Patrik Laine in last summer's NHL Entry Draft, he has been held to high expectations. A lot of people, myself included, were skeptical whether or not he would ever reach the potential the Jackets were looking for when they selected him. But he's here now and he's looking to make a name for himself in his rookie season.
Even though he was drafted as a centerman, he will play on the wing. It has been a consistent experiment through the preseason to see what he can do at the position and he looked pretty darn good which is why the Jackets will roll with it at least to begin the season. He has proven so far that he belongs but we'll see how ready he is for full NHL action in game one.
Nick Foligno
Of course, the captain is under the microscope. He always is. But I'll tell you why he will be a focal point from the beginning of the season. He's going to play at center. Foligno, who has spent the majority of his career as a left or right winger, will open the year as a centerman. This is the result of Dubois' switch to the wing and the lack of depth at centre the Jackets have at the moment.
Foligno was actually drafted by the Ottawa Senators as a center and has played the position with the Blue Jackets on occasion. To me, he isn't best fitted to play in the middle but as the heart and soul of the team, he'll do anything to help. I'm sure he will hold his own as a center but I'm wondering whether or not this is just a temporary move before they find extra help.
Josh Anderson
Finally, the extension holdout fiasco has come to a close. After missing camp, Anderson ultimately signed a three-year, $5.55M extension on Tuesday. It was a long staring contest between the front office and the Anderson party but now that an agreement has been made, it's time for everybody to move past it and look forward to what Anderson can do this season.
He won't start the year in Columbus as it was announced on Thursday that the Blue Jackets sent him down along with defenseman Markus Nutivaara to their minor league affiliate Cleveland Monsters on a conditioning assignment. This is a telling sign that the Jackets don't feel Anderson is in the physical shape he needs to be in to play at the NHL level.
Because he held out, he hasn't been practicing or skating with the team. Over the last few weeks, he's been skating overseas in Switzerland but he didn't participate in the John Tortorella training camp in Columbus, which is a big thing to miss. As of right now, his skating legs are likely not meeting Torts' standards.
This isn't a huge deal. He isn't quite ready for NHL action and the Jackets will give him the opportunity to work himself into game shape down in the minors. He will miss Friday night's game and most likely won't suit up in Chicago on Saturday night. It's possible that Anderson will make his season debut on Tuesday night against the Carolina Hurricanes.
Hopefully, any tension from contact negotiations or any physical rust will be worn off by the time his season starts. The Jackets are hoping to get a similar, if not better, Anderson from last season. The 23-year-old tallied 17 goals in his rookie season and will seek to prove that total was no fluke.
Brandon Dubinsky
The 31-year-old veteran is coming off offseason wrist surgery that held him from most of the preseason. For a while, Dubinsky was questionable to be ready for opening night but he suited up in the final preaseason game in Pittsburgh last Saturday.
In that game, he was flying around, throwing the body all over the place like he usually does. Maybe that's just because it was the Pittsburgh Penguins, a team he loves to play against but either way, it's good news to see him ahead of schedule out on the ice in actual gameplay.
I'll be giving him an extra look early on to see if he is truly fully recovered from surgery. He's also coming off a down year as far as point totals go. He played in all but two of the Jackets' 82 regular season games last season and only notched a line of 12-29-41.
Dubinsky isn't a guy that should be expected to fill the net. As an assistant captain, he's a phenomenal leader and will do anything to help the team win, whether that is being physical or blocking shots. However, 12 goals marks his lowest total as a Blue Jacket since the 2012-13 lockout shortened season.
I don't expect to see any major indications that Dubinsky isn't fully healthy or ready to begin the season but he is slated to be the third center behind Foligno and Alexander Wennberg. Is this because the Jackets are lacking center depth and need Dubinsky for opening night even if he isn't 100%? That's just a theory I'm throwing out there.
I think Dubinsky as the third line center gives the Jackets great balance throughout the forward group. Hopefully, he can provide some scoring to that third line on top of the grit that pours out of him from game to game.
Ryan Murray and Gabriel Carlsson
Because the two are projected to be a defensive pairing, I'll place them on my watch list as a package deal. Murray's presence on the Blue Jackets has been discussed across the hockey world. Is he a key member of the team? Why is he not living up to the expectations of a former second overall pick? Is he going to be traded? All of these questions have swirled around him for some time now and even though I can't speak for the player, it has to be difficult to avoid all that talk.
He now has a chance to swat all these discussions down with a solid performance to start the season. But how is it possible for him to live up to former second overall pick expectations when he's playing on the bottom pairing? We'll see what the future holds for Murray in Columbus. Perhaps his early play will have an impact on that future.
As for Gabriel Carlsson, this will be his first season start with the Blue Jackets. He came in basically out of thin air at the very end of last season and played solid minutes in the playoffs. His performance might not have blown anybody away but it was impressive for a guy who had no NHL experience to compete like he did.
After a strong showing in training camp, he forced management to give him a spot on the 23-man roster. It's pretty clear that his potential is very high and he has done well to squeeze himself into an already sturdy defensive group. He has a chance right away to showcase why it was a good move for the Jackets to trade up for a first round pick to select him in the 2016 Draft.
Final Thoughts
To clarify, I'm not putting on blinders to the rest of the team. I will follow all players as close as I possibly can. This is just a short list of players that, to me, deserve an extra spotlight because of where they're positioned on the squad right now.
Jackets newcomer Artemi Panarin should be an honorable mention on this list. It will be interesting to see if all the hype is too big for him. I'm not at all worried about him. He has already shown that he is as dynamic as advertised and will provide the Jackets with the scoring help they need.
Like I said before, every player for the Jackets has his own level of importance. As a team, they can do some incredible things. Last year was the best year in franchise history. Can the team build on that historic season and make a push for the playoffs? That's the big question that they'll attempt to tackle later on. Right now, it's all about winning game one.
Two boys, aged four and five, died of suffocation after being stuck inside a car for close to nine hours in outer Delhi's Ranhola area. The incident took place on October 3.According to the police, the two boys were playing in the car owned by the father of one of the boys. Around 1 pm, the car owner, a taxi driver, locked the vehicle through central locking, without realising that the children were inside, a police officer said.After a few hours, when the family members realised that the children were missing, they rushed to the police station in a neighbour's car to file a complaint.Meanwhile, one of the relatives of the boys unlocked the car door and found them in an unconscious state, the officer said.The boys were rushed to a hospital where they were declared “brought dead” by the doctors. The post-mortem report said they died due to suffocation. There were burn injuries on their body.
DETROIT (AP) — Taijuan Walker pitched five sharp innings in his return from the disabled list, and the Arizona Diamondbacks won their fourth straight game, 2-1 over the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday night.
Walker (5-3) allowed a run and six hits in his first appearance since May 19. He had been out because of a blister on his right index finger.
The Diamondbacks scored two runs in the first inning, and that turned out to be all they needed. Walker was lifted after 82 pitches, but Randall Delgado pitched three scoreless innings of relief. Fernando Rodney struck out the side in the ninth for his 18th save in 21 chances.
Jordan Zimmermann (5-5) allowed two runs and six hits in eight innings.
Arizona is 9-1 in interleague play this season. The lone defeat was at home May 10 against Detroit.
The Diamondbacks took the lead right away against Zimmermann. Gregor Blanco led off the game with a single to left that got past Justin Upton for an error. Blanco went all the way to third on the play and scored on David Peralta's sacrifice fly. Brandon Drury added an RBI single, but Upton redeemed himself by throwing Chris Owings out at the plate.
Detroit was hitless until the third, when Ian Kinsler managed a two-out double and scored on Alex Avila's single.
Walker struck out six and walked one, and Zimmermann was impressive as well. After Chris Hermann's single to start the second, Arizona didn't have another baserunner until the seventh.
It was the third straight quality start for Zimmermann and the first time this year he had gone more than six innings. He struck out six without a walk and lowered his ERA to 5.35.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Diamondbacks: After a one-out walk to Avila in the first, Walker committed an obvious balk when he began his motion to the plate but didn't release the ball. It looked awkward, but he was able to continue and there was no sign of an injury.
UP NEXT
Diamondbacks: Arizona has Thursday off before starting a three-game series at Philadelphia. LHP Patrick Corbin (5-6) starts Friday night for the Diamondbacks against RHP Aaron Nola (3-4).
Tigers: Detroit begins a four-game series at home against Tampa Bay on Thursday night. RHP Justin Verlander (4-4) takes the mound for the Tigers against RHP Alex Cobb (5-5).

For those who have never attended the DU Department of Theatre Senior Capstone Festival, it is a unique theatrical experience. During Spring Quarter each year, graduating theatre majors direct their own short plays that encompass ing the skills they have acquired at DU and showcase the talents of their peers. Capstones fall into three different cycles, and Cycle One concluded performances on April 16 after sold out shows and a phenomenal start.
Cycle One featured five short plays alternating between the JMac Black Box and White Box theatres. Changes between shows were smooth and short, allowing viewers to stay in “audience mode” while still taking a moment to revel in emotion and mentally transition to an entirely different play. Each was distinct and thoroughly enjoyable for audiences, whether they were left disturbed, confused, shocked or joyful at the end.
“Halfway”
The production began with Emily Schwend's play “Halfway,” directed by senior Katie Walker. It had a cast of only two, featuring Kat (Rhianna DeVries) and Melissa (Shelby Lynhall) working with a simple White Box set of a kitchen. The play portrays a conversation between the two women who, as dialogue progresses, we come to know more and more about: they are sisters who have not seen each other in quite some time, the visit takes place at a halfway house and Kat currently resides there as she recovers from a long history of traumatic substance abuse. They discuss past, present and future, and the audience learns the heartbreaking story of a woman on such a long and strict road of recovery that, according to Melissa, her young daughter no longer remembers who she is.
The words between them are incredibly authentic and true; the pair sits and eats Oreos—all that Kat has to offer Melissa as food and drink—and the audience members squirm in their seats during uncomfortably lengthy pauses and the awkward interactions of the sisters. DeVries and Lynhall were strikingly real. “Halfway” is the most realistic of the five shows in Cycle One, and the ideas of recovery, family and love really hit home.
“Variations on the Death of Trotsky”
David Ives's short play, “Variations on the Death of Trotsky,” hardly could have differed more from the first show. Senior Liz Butler took on directing this odd, humorous and thought-provoking play that stood out as a favorite for audience members. The show chronicles the assassination of Leon Trotsky, famous Marxist, politician and revolutionary leader, which was a rather strange affair. The real Trotsky had an axe split into his head by his gardener of the time, Ramon, and did not die for a full day after the almost-botched assassination attempt. The play conveys different versions of the day after. Trotsky (Jack Trembath) has an axe in the top of his head when his wife (Grady Hicks) reads in a modern day encyclopedia that the axe hit will kill him any moment. Puppet shows, plot twists and other strange occurrences take place, including the appearance of the killer, Ramon (Jose Serrano), a hilarious caricature of a “Mexican communist.”
The show was funny, dark and clever, switching tones between pure smark comedy to intense profundities. One particularly striking line was, “Gives you a little bit of hope, doesn't it? That a man with a mountain climber's axe in his head can go on to live another day?” There were audible reactions from the audience in both the hilarious and the serious moments of the play, and the wit and weight of it was overall indescribable.
“Mary, Mother of God, Intercede for Us”
DU senior Nicole Seefried directed Theresa Rebeck's “Mary, Mother of God, Intercede for Us.” The play stars Evan Monteith as Mary, the mother of God, as she reports a list of those who have prayed to God and for what. It's a one woman show, with Mary simply communicating with God as an unheard-from light spector above. She begins with simple requests like drought relief or war protection, which God makes no promises for. Then, she tells God of a woman raped by her step-brother and needing an abortion. God seems to scorn and rebel against this. Mary seems to be a bit frustrated, but moves on. The final case we hear is that of a priest asking to be transferred to a different church after molesting young altar boys; he “heartily apologizes” for what he calls an “indiscretion.” To Mary's shock, God grants the criminal priest his prayers, and the play ends.
“Mary, Mother of God, Intercede for Us” was hilarious and incredibly smart. For such a short play, it made some relevant commentaries about religion, abortion, assault and the overall corruption of the Catholic Church. The script itself was amazing, and all the students involved brought the uncomfortable and clever show to life.
“Please Report Any Suspicious Activity”
This play was both completely normal and entirely unreal. It opens to an unnamed man (Jack Anderson) on the bus as he sits and reads. Then, two dolphins (Mikah Conway and Erik Frederiksen) board the bus. Antonio and Dirk (the dolphins) are clearly in a pretty turbulent romantic relationship. They quarrel, one on either side of the awkward man, about their trip to the aquarium, Dirk's shark ex-boyfriend and other issues. The two dolphins argue heatedly but eventually work out their issues and get off the bus.
Rosa Wariner directed this play by Rick Park, and it was delightful to watch. Aside from the fact that the main couple in the show consisted of two male dolphins, it was rather normal. If you close your eyes and ignore the fish puns, it may have been an average, everyday couple. They dealt with issues like love, romance, jealousy and history as any couple would; they just happened to be homosexual dolphins. It sounds odd, but the cast was hilarious and heartfelt in both words and body language, and it was definitely worth the watch.
“Two Conversations Overheard on Airplanes”
The final play was senior Evan Mues's project entitled “Two Conversations Overheard on Airplanes,” a play by Sarah Ruhl. Set once again in the White Box, the play showed four people (Anthony Adu, Mary Grace Roach, Kevin Douglas and Danforth Webster) interacting, as the title implies, on an airplane. Four incredibly different people had two strikingly weird conversations, and their personalities are all revealed piece by piece until complications lead to the plane crashing.
Through a diverse group of characters, the short play tackled issues like race, politics and age rather fluidly, and it was something quite special to see the interactions between them. This play, out of all five, probably left the audience most confused and shocked, as Ruhl's plays are known for being somewhat eccentrically artistic. After the plane crashed, the lights rose again to the sight of all four characters wearing thick masks of flowers. They remove them one by one and shake hands with each other, feeling the silence of an audience struck with the beauty and strangeness of such a moment.
While Cycle One has ended, don't miss the upcoming performances and the chance to experience the students of the DU Department of Theatre at their finest. Cycle Two runs from May 3-7 and Cycle Three from May 23-28.
Detwiler's in Palmetto is scheduled to open at the end of June or the first of July. Over 100 jobs will be created, and the business is having a job fair next Thursday.
THE HAGUE/SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Costa Rica claimed victory over Nicaragua on Friday, after the United Nations' highest court awarded Costa Rica disputed territory along the coastal border shared by the two Central American countries.
Nicaragua was ordered by the International Court of Justice in The Hague to remove a military base from a contested coastal area near the San Juan river, which the judges said violated Costa Rican sovereignty.
The court's panel of 15 international judges also found that Costa Rica has sovereignty over the “whole northern part of Isla Portillos, including the coast,” but excluding Harbour Head Lagoon.
Costa Rica's President Luis Guillermo Solis called the decision “historic,” while Foreign Minister Manuel Gonzalez said it was very close to what the country had asked for.
In a separate case heard at the court earlier on Friday, Nicaragua was ordered to pay Costa Rica nearly $379,000 dollars - less than it had asked for - in reparations for environmental damage to parts of its wetlands at the mouth of the disputed San Juan river.
Costa Rica should be compensated by April 2 for damage caused, the cost of environmental restoration, expenses and interest, the court said.
“The amount is not what we hoped for, but we accept fully and respectfully what the court decided,” Gonzalez said. “Nicaragua has a valuable opportunity to rebuild trust between the two countries and close the chapters that have distanced us in recent years.”
Nicaragua's government called the environmental verdict a “major defeat for Costa Rica” in a statement. It did not comment on the other cases.
As part of the border settlement, the court drew a new maritime boundary between the states, who have had rival claims since 2002, when Nicaragua published maps detailing oil concessions. Some of those were in waters claimed by Costa Rica.
Costa Rica had filed the suit in 2014, asking the court to determine its borders with Nicaragua in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean.
In 2010, Nicaragua sent soldiers to open an artificial waterway to divert water from the San Juan River that divides both countries to a nearby Nicaraguan lake, in what Costa Rica saw as a move to shorten its territory. Nicaragua said it was dredging a natural waterway.
Top Modified Drivers Heading To Macon Speedway For 100 Lap Thursday Special
95Q Up On The Wheel Modified 100 Joined By 410 Sprints & Pro Lates
(Macon, IL) It may be in the middle of an extremely busy stretch on this year's Macon Speedway schedule but this Thursday's event is one that stands out. It's the inaugural 95Q Up On The Wheel Modified 100, an event for the Billingsley Elite Wash DIRTcar Modifieds, that will pay $3,000 to win and see some of the best drivers in the Midwest.

I found the first lump in my breast on New Year's Day, 2012. It was 2 a.m., and I was showering after a party at my best friend's boyfriend's house. We were juniors in high school and had stayed up half the night drinking soda and playing with fireworks (we weren't the kind of kids who threw keggers). I was trying to wash out the hairspray and thick, black eyeliner which made me feel more dressed up than usual, when I decided to try to do a self-breast exam. I have no family history of breast cancer, but I'm a bit of a worrier and my resolution was to be more proactive about my health, and a simple exam seemed like an easier start than quitting Diet Coke.
I felt up my left breast, just as I had been taught by various breast cancer awareness campaigns and fliers I'd seen in doctor's waiting rooms. Arm over my head, poking around the outside circumference and moving inward, everything seemed fine. Then I moved on to my right breast, got to my right nipple and I felt a lump. A rubbery, misshapen little ball rolling around under my nipple.
Oh my god, I thought, do I have cancer?
I tried to just go to bed when I finished my shower, but I couldn't stop my racing heart. I pictured myself in the hospital, losing my hair, losing my breasts. Terrified, I woke up my mother to tell her what I found. “Can I feel it?” she asked. I took off my pajama shirt and told her where it was, and her eyes widened as she rolled the lump around under her fingers. “I'll call my OB-GYN in the morning.”
As a preteen, I was obsessed with my breasts. I was a late bloomer compared to most of my peers, and I was afraid they would never grow, or they would be so small that it wouldn't matter if they were actually there. My mom bought me a copy of The Care & Keeping of You by the American Girl Library, and I read it more closely than my Bible. The illustrations taught me how to insert my first tampon, shave my armpits, and wash my face. But the illustration about breasts got most of my attention, as it showed what breasts looked like (on the outside) as they went through stages of growth. I would spend hours looking in the mirror, dissecting my breasts' shape, size, nipple color, feel and more, using the illustrated chart as a measuring stick.

By the time I was 17, I was finally confident in my looks. My breasts had grown to a satisfying C-cup, and I wore push-up bras to give them an extra boost. My womanly shape made me feel beautiful – sexy, even – and I felt as though I had achieved what my younger self had always wished for. When I found the lump in my breast, I felt like my body was betraying me.
It was all I could think about – in English class, at dance rehearsal, on my way to sleepovers – but I didn't tell any of my friends.
My mom called her OB-GYN as soon as the office opened, but the next open appointment was still a month away. I was shocked – “A month?!” I practically shrieked at her. I had no idea if the lump would grow in that time, or if more would show up. But our doctor assured us it was OK to wait that long to be seen — it's uncommon for 17-year-olds to have breast cancer, and my lump was probably nothing to be too concerned about.
Still, it was agonizing waiting on the time to pass, feeling like I had a ticking time bomb literally inside my chest. It was all I could think about – in English class, at dance rehearsal, on my way to sleepovers – but I didn't tell any of my friends. I was afraid to speak cancer into existence, and having them worrying about me would not have helped anyway.
To be honest, other than what I had read in the pamphlets, I didn't actually know much about breasts — how the tissue changes with our hormones and age, how one woman's breasts can just be naturally lumpier than another's. My mom didn't know a ton of this stuff either, and while she trusted the doctor that it was OK for us to wait a month for an appointment, she still spent most of her free time researching breast cancer and breast lumps, stress-eating case after case of Cutie oranges while she read. Her findings – that cancer would be rare in someone my age, that most masses in breasts are cysts and that cysts are fairly common – were comforting, but still didn't make me feel totally safe. Only the doctor could do that.
I don't remember much about the gynecologist appointment; I was so nervous. Your first trip to the gynecologist is stressful enough without a breast lump, and without your mom in the exam room with you. I do remember the odd realization that this OB-GYN office was located across from my pediatrician. I definitely wasn't a kid anymore, though. It was my first time in stirrups, and I was worried I might have cancer.

After the vaginal exam, the doctor palpated my breast and confirmed that she felt the same lump I did. When she said it was likely a cyst, I exhaled the enormous breath I'd been holding in for weeks.
Thank God.
Still, she recommended we schedule a breast ultrasound at the local hospital to be sure. A diagnosis of a breast cyst would make this not a big deal, but any mass or new abnormality on a person's body requires a doctor's care and attention.
I didn't have just one cyst, but rather a clump of them – maybe four or five, which is why it felt so lumpy rather than smooth and round.
The ultrasound appointment led to another month of waiting, with more Cutie oranges but a lot less stress. We trusted the advice and care of the doctor. When the appointment finally came around, the images confirmed that the lump was benign. Even more, I didn't have just one cyst, but rather a clump of them – maybe four or five, which is why it felt so lumpy rather than smooth and round. The cysts were caused by hormonal fluctuations, and the radiologist said the cysts might fluctuate in size throughout my menstrual cycle.
After wiping the gel off of my breast, the radiologist sat down with my mom and me to discuss my options. We could elect to deflate the cysts with a needle aspiration, sucking out the liquid filling inside each one with a needle, but that wouldn't remove the sacs. They would likely just re-fill with fluid later. Surgery wasn't recommended as an option either, since the cysts weren't causing any pain or other problems. The decision ended up being simple: To monitor the cysts with regular self-breast exams and get check-ups if there were any major changes.
As we walked out of the hospital, Mom and I relaxed. We could finally stop worrying. For now.
Over the next six years, I would come to know my breasts intimately. I did self-breast exams at least once a week, and oftentimes more if I couldn't remember the last time I did one. The frequent exams weren't necessary, but they made me feel in control. After a stint on hormonal birth control in college, my cup size grew more and my cysts shrank. They have been about half of their original size ever since.

About two months ago, I found something again, this time near my armpit in my left breast. Sh*t. I felt the familiar panic, and continued to feel the lump as I tried to calm myself down. This lump was small and had a similar rubbery texture to my other lumps, but it was teeny tiny. And it was stuck – I couldn't roll it between my fingers like the other lump. I decided to wait a while, to get through my next period to see if it grows at all, and then see about a doctor.
A month later, not only was the lump still there, but it had doubled in size, revealing a lump that felt just like my others. The familiarity was a relief, but I still needed to get it checked out. I knew the chances of it being cancer were super slim, but any sort of breast change that weren't consistent with normal fibrocystic breast change could be problematic. Now that I'm living in Chicago, I asked friends for OB-GYN recommendations and got an appointment. Thankfully, I only had to wait two weeks this time.
The visit went just like any other well-woman gynecological appointment. The doctor performed a regular vaginal exam, and then palpated both of my breasts to examine both my old cysts and the new growth. “Yep,” she said, pressing onto my new lump, “this feels consistent with fibrocystic breast change.” Again, she recommended an ultrasound to confirm, and I had another two-week wait for the appointment.
I was familiar with the routine: check in, change into the robe, wait on the radiologist, take off the robe, ignore how weird the gel feels on your skin, watch the radiologist read the images. But this time, we didn't see the little orbs. This time, there was nothing.
How could there be nothing? I thought. I definitely felt something, and so did both doctors.
The radiologist took the images, and my mind raced as I waited for the doctor to read them and get back to me. What on earth is it, I thought, if I feel something but can't see it. If it's not a cyst, is it a bad mass? Is it a weird complication?
The doctor told me that the new mass was a clump of dense tissue, and nothing to worry about. I breathed a sigh of relief, and my thoughts stopped racing. I had expected the mass to not be a big deal, but I couldn't have predicted what the doctor would tell me next: “Your boobs are totally normal.”
For the first time since that initial scare, I had a full understanding of my breasts.
She explained that having fibrocystic breast tissue is so unbelievably common that doctors simply call it “fibrocystic breast change” rather than a disease or condition. About 50 percent of childbearing women experience fibrocystic breast changes, which include symptoms such as tenderness before and during your period, cysts, and clumps of dense tissue – all of which I have. Some women also experience nipple discharge that is different from breast milk.
“But doesn't dense tissue increase your risk of breast cancer?” I asked, knowing that dense tissue is an independent breast cancer risk and makes it more difficult to see tumors on mammograms (understandably, I had been doing my research). “Only after age forty,” the doctor replied. “Everyone under forty has dense breast tissue. This clump is normal.”
I already knew about all the different ways a fibrocystic breast could present itself, but I had never heard that it wasn't a disease or a huge concern. When I wasn't interested in removing the cysts at 17, my previous doctors had just stopped there without informing me of this crucial information. Now, for the first time since that initial scare, I had a full understanding of my breasts.
Of course, I won't stop seeing doctors or doing self-breast exams (and neither should you), and I probably will grow a few more lumps and bumps in my lifetime. But now, my sense of body confidence includes a new appreciation of my fully grown, lump-filled, healthy breasts. They're the boobs pre-teen me always wanted.
“Functional art needs a new definition, I think!” says Lisa Schulte, aka the Neon Queen. We're speaking in her light-bending studio in an industrial area northwest of Los Angeles, where her empire Nights of Neon operates a hybrid business that encompasses high-end private and commercial commissions as well as a dedicated original and collaborative fine art practice.
“I'm both an artisan and craftsperson,” Schulte says. “I came from an understanding of the medium, and I always wondered, what is possible with this? What are its limitations? I learned it all for myself, I hit early roadblocks where people said, no that can't be done! And I took up those challenges. I had to prove it for myself.” And prove it she has done, as more than 25 years into her explorations of the neon genre, she's having a bigger moment than ever.
EXPAND Lisa Schulte studio view Shana Nys Dambrot
In her own signature designs for wall and floor, Schulte is after effects that build on the way painting and sculpture already function. Although there are crossover appeals with signage and other text-based art, with neon there is always an additional aspect of functionality. “Light goes in so many directions,” says Schulte. “It fills a space in a way conventional painting and sculpture can't.” And if, for example, her unique driftwood and white neon pieces also happen to function as lamplight, or her wall of vintage-inspired signage at Grand Central Market activates architectural design, then so be it.
Sebastien Normandin wanted for attempted murder in relation to a 2016 incident in Victoria
International police operation Interpol have listed a Victoria man as a person of interest.
Sebastien Jack Pierre Normandin, 47, was the suspect of a domestic violence incident in Victoria in late December of 2016.
Normandin fled at the time despite two counts of attempted murder, allegedly in connection with a serious vehicle collision involving a former girlfriend that occurred at 6:30 p.m. on Dec. 27 of 2016. Police were called to the collision in the 1000 block of Gillespie Place in Victoria.
The 1.9-metre-tall (6-foot-5), 200-pound Normandin has been reported as the same Normandin who missed bail in the fall and who posts semi-regularly to social media, has a PhD in history and makes philosophical posts.
Normandin has a red notice status with Interpol – an equivalent to an international warrant – and is believed to have fled Canada to another country.
He's wanted for attempt murder (times two), assault causing bodily harm, criminal harassment, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, assault causing bodily harm, assault and failure to comply with conditions.
President Donald Trump pumps his fist as he arrives at the Greenbrier Valley Airport in Lewisburg, West Virginia.
Evan Vucci, AP
A federal judge in Washington has tossed out a lawsuit claiming President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign conspired with Russian agents and WikiLeaks to publish emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee.
However, Judge Ellen Huvelle wrote that her ruling was "not based on a finding that there was no collusion between defendants and Russia during the 2016 presidential election."
The ruling came hours after the Senate Intelligence Committee said it agreed with U.S. intelligence agencies that the Russian government tried to undercut Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton while promoting Trump during the 2016 presidential election.
Huvelle, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, said the conspiracy claims in the lawsuit centered around meetings between Trump staffers and Russian operatives in New York, making New York the proper place for the lawsuit. New York, however, does not recognize the specific tort claims pressed in the suit.
The suit was filed on behalf of DNC donors Eric Schoenberg and Roy Cockrum and former DNC staffer Scott Comer. It claims the hack invaded their privacy, attempted to inflict emotional distress and violated their right to support the candidate of their choice.

More: House panel subpoenas FBI agent who wrote anti-Trump texts
The lawsuit alleges that computer hackers working on behalf of the Russian government hacked into the email systems of the DNC and obtained "voluminous amounts of data," including emails and other documents sent to and from thousands of individuals.
They claim the hack was "part of a deliberate campaign to interfere in the U.S. election and tilt its outcome in favor of Donald Trump" and that the Trump campaign, specifically former operative Roger Stone, conspired with unidentified Russian agents and WikiLeaks to publish hacked emails.
Almost 20,000 emails were published in July 2016, days before the start of the Democratic National Convention. Some suggested that the Democratic National Committee had been working behind the scenes to ensure Clinton was nominated over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz ultimately resigned under pressure amid the ensuing controversy.
Protect Democracy, which filed the suit, said it was examining its options regarding an appeal or refiling somewhere else.
"While we are disappointed in and respectfully disagree with today's decision from the District Court to dismiss this case on the grounds that it does not belong in Washington, D.C., this case is far from over," the group said in a statement.
U.S. intelligence agencies, in a 2017 report, wrote that Russian President Vladimir Putin "ordered an influence campaign backing Trump in the 2016 election. The report said Moscow had a "clear preference" for Trump and sought to undercut Clinton while also undermining the U.S. democratic process.
Trump has conducted an unrelenting social media attack on a separate, criminal investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into the allegations.

Ride-hailing company suspends all road-testing of such vehicles in U.S. and Canada
A self-driving Uber vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in a suburb in Phoenix, Ariz., in the first fatality involving a fully autonomous test vehicle, prompting the ride-hailing company Monday to suspend all road-testing of such autos in the U.S. and Canada.
Depending on who is found to be at fault, the accident could have far-reaching consequences for the development of self-driving vehicles, which have been billed as potentially safer than human drivers.
READ MORE: Self-driving Ubers could still be many years away, says research head
The Volvo was in self-driving mode with a human operator behind the wheel when a woman walking outside a crosswalk in Tempe on Sunday night was hit, police said. The woman, identified as Elaine Herzberg, 49, died at a hospital.
Uber suspended all of its self-driving vehicle testing in the Phoenix area, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.
The testing has been going on for months as automakers and technology companies compete to be the first with the technology.
Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi expressed condolences on his Twitter account and said the company is working with local law enforcement on the investigation.
The federal government has voluntary guidelines for companies that want to test autonomous vehicles, leaving much of the regulation up to states.
But Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao also has said technology and automobile companies need to allay public fears of self-driving vehicles, citing a poll showing that 78 percent of people fear riding in autonomous vehicles
The number of states considering legislation related to autonomous vehicles gradually has increased each year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In 2017 alone, 33 states introduced legislation.
California is among those that require manufacturers to report any incidents to the motor vehicle department during the testing phase. As of early March, the agency received 59 such reports.

Ali Akbar Velayati, senior foreign policy adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, has called on the U.S. to withdraw from all Syrian territory east of the Euphrates River, according to local media reports. Velayati made the assertion on Thursday evening at a conference held in the city of Mashad, Iran's Mehr news agency reported.In a speech delivered before conference attendees, Velayati pointed to alleged plans by the U.S. to break up several countries of the Middle East. "But the Americans will fail in their attempts to divide Syria," he asserted.
He also told the U.S. to withdraw all military forces from parts of Syria east of the Euphrates, otherwise, he warned, Iran would "force" them to leave.
In regards to recent allegations that Daesh terrorists had been transferred to Afghanistan from Syria and Iraq, Velayati said: "A Daesh presence in Afghanistan would threaten our 900-kilometer border [with Afghanistan]." "We cannot allow that," he added.On the subject of war-torn Yemen, Velayati warned that the country risked becoming "another Vietnam" if Saudi Arabia continued its four-year military campaign against the Shiite Houthi militia group. In 2015, Saudi Arabia and its Sunni-Arab allies launched a massive military campaign in Yemen aimed at crushing Houthi rebels who had overrun much of the country including capital Sanaa one year earlier.
The home-buying season is in full swing in North America — and flood season is still on.
After overflowing rivers ravaged communities in Newfoundland and British Columbia, the Town of Banff, Alta., received its own flood alert on Tuesday. And flash flooding turned the streets of Maryland's historic Ellicott City into rapids on Sunday.

So how can homebuyers reduce the risk that the biggest investment of their lives will at some point end up underwater?
You wouldn't necessarily know it from the headlines. With extreme weather events now happening with alarming frequency, flooding is becoming increasingly common, even for homes that are nowhere close to waterways. And a basement flooded by sewer backup after a torrential downpour wouldn't make the news.
READ MORE: Flooding, flooding everywhere – do Canadians have insurance for it?
Flooding has overtaken fire as the No. 1 cause of home insurance payouts, with claims for flooded basements averaging $43,000 in major cities. And yet, there isn't much in Canada that would help homebuyers assess that risk, says Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo.

Home inspectors aren't trained to spot flood risks
A home inspection, for example, will likely tell you little about whether you should waterproof the basement or regrade the perimeter of your future home so that the water flows away from the foundations.
“Home inspectors receive virtually zero training on flood risk assessment,” Feltmate told Global News.
And the process of changing that is just getting underway. Feltmate's own Intact Centre is developing a flood-risk crash course for home inspectors that will be rolled out in Ontario this September and throughout Canada at the beginning of next year.

Municipal flood plain maps are usually outdated
Large municipalities and conservation authorities across Canada generally have maps that prospective homebuyers can ask to see to check whether a property lies in a known floodplain.
But those drawings are often 25 to 30 years old and woefully out of date, Feltmate said.
The Trudeau government just released guidelines to harmonize flood maps across Canada last year.
WATCH: Here's why cities flood more easily than rural areas
Homesellers don't necessarily have to tell you about past flooding
Don't think your homeseller will let you know about past floods. Often, the onus of finding that out lies squarely with the homebuyer.
In general, homesellers have an obligation to disclose so-called patent defects, including those that “wouldn't be readily identifiable by a reasonable person doing an inspection of the property,” said Michael Abrams, an Ottawa-based lawyer at Kelly Santini.
“If [a home] floods every spring and [homebuyers] are looking at the property in July, it might not be readily apparent that there is a flooding issue. But if the seller is aware of it and it happens on a regular basis, then that's something they'd have an obligation to disclose,” Abrams said.
And homesellers can't lie if you ask them direct questions, he added.
“There's a duty of good faith that exists that you have to provide complete and truthful answers to those questions.”
READ MORE: Here's how much climate change can cost homeowners in damages
But homeowners don't have to volunteer information about properties that are located in a known floodplain or an instance of flooding, whether it was from overland water seeping in through doors and windows or old city regurgitating sewage into the basement.
Those, at least, are the common-law principles that apply throughout Canada, Abrams said. Each province has its own regulations on the matter, and private law in Quebec is governed by French-inspired civil law.
What homebuyers can do
Canada is catching up when it comes to flood insurance, with a growing number of insurers now providing both sewer-backup and overland insurance, which are generally treated as additional coverage.
But buying flood insurance is no substitute for doing your due diligence before signing on the dotted line. A growing number of homes throughout Canada are becoming uninsurable due to repeated instances of flooding, Feltmate said. And even a single instance of water seeping through your basement drains could lead to drastically higher insurance premiums or denial of further coverage, as Global News has previously reported.
Your best bet? Asking pointed questions of homesellers and their neighbours.
“Spend time in the community,” Feltmate said. The extra legwork could really pay off in the long term.

WARREN RUDA / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER The 2018 Plymouth budget summary includes closing Goodwill Hose Company No. 2, as of Jan. 1.
PLYMOUTH — It looks like one of three fire stations in the borough will close next year after all.
Plymouth borough council on Sunday decided to advertise a 2018 budget that calls for more police and fewer paid firefighters next year. Bolstering the borough's police presence to fight a sharp increase in crime is Plymouth's most urgent need, council members said.
At the end of a contentious meeting that saw residents and council members spar over how to provide essential emergency services without a large tax hike, council President Gary Kochinski said the budget council will advertise for adoption includes:
• A 7.4 percent property tax increase, which would increase by $26.66 the annual tax paid on a property at the borough median value of $63,481. The millage rate would increase from 5.70 mills to 6.12 mills.
• Hiring more police officers, with the goal of four full-time officers and eight part-time officers providing a 25 percent increase in police coverage in Plymouth.
• Laying off one full-time paid fire truck driver and reducing the work hours of part-time paid drivers, leaving nighttime and weekend shifts to be covered by volunteer drivers. Paid drivers currently provide around-the-clock coverage.
• Closing Goodwill Hose Company No. 2, the fire station on West Main Street, as of Jan. 1. Plymouth's other two fire stations would provide full coverage for the borough.
Sunday's decision reversed the course of the debate over whether council should close Goodwill Hose Company to save about $6,200 in next year's budget.
The first two 2018 budget proposals council considered called for closing the fire station. That sparked protests from borough residents worried about public safety. Following mostly negative reaction at a standing-room-only council meeting two weeks ago, council members submitted new budget proposals that called for Goodwill Hose Company to stay open.
On Sunday, Kochinski said council changed its mind again based on both the immediate financial savings and the long-term need to consolidate fire coverage in Plymouth.
Councilman Frank Coughlin said he agonized over whether to support the reduction in paid driver coverage and the potential closing of a fire station.
“If I had my way I would give these guys a raise and not cut anyone,” Coughlin said.
The spike in drug-related and violent crime makes hiring more police officers imperative, according to Coughlin.
“I see drug activity all over town,” he said. “Hard decisions have to be made. ... It comes down to hard choices.”
Firefighters and borough residents pleaded with council not to close the station or reduce fire coverage. Some urged council members to support an alternate budget proposal, that called for hiring more police officers but leaving fire stations and manpower unchanged, along with a 17.9 percent tax increase.
“We need more police and we need fire companies exactly the way they are,” said borough resident Charles Lewis. “If it takes more in tax money, that's what we have to do.”
Joshua Evans, a member of Goodwill Hose Company and a police officer in Larksville, for the second time in two weeks told council that closing the fire station would be a mistake. Evans urged council to make budget cuts anywhere else, if needed, but to keep all of the borough's emergency services running at full strength.
“You need a strong police department,” Evans said. “You already have a strong fire department. Don't minimize that.”
Council will vote on the final budget proposal on Dec. 31, Kochinski said.

WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) -- SpaceX rockets may return to flight as early as Sunday, according to the company.
The news comes following an in-depth investigation into the explosion of a rocket from SpaceX's September mission.
The company said in a statement Monday the botched launch was due to a failed pressure vessel in a liquid oxygen tank. The vessel buckled, causing liquid oxygen to accumulate. It believes this led to friction, sparks and the explosion.
SpaceX conducted the investigation along with officials from NASA, the Federal Aviation Authority, the U.S. Air Force and the National Transportation Safety Board.
The Federal Aviation Administration will have to sign off on the report and issue SpaceX a license to launch. SpaceX appears optimistic it will be launching rockets again soon.
To prevent such an incident from happening again, SpaceX will now load its rockets with warmer helium and revert to its older, proven method of loading helium. Down the road, it plans to change the design of its pressure vessels.
SpaceX originally intended to return to space by November. Shortly after the investigation begin, CEO Elon Musk called it the most difficult and complex failure of the company's 14-year existence.
The company has drawn praise for its low-cost rockets and wowed spectators by landing rockets on a platform at sea. However, the company has also been dogged by mishaps, such as this fall's explosion.
SpaceX holds a NASA contact to carry U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station, but for now, it plans to catch up on delayed launches.

Bauchi Nets of Bauchi and Kada Stars of Kaduna have replaced Mark Mentors and Defenders of Abuja in the ongoing Kwese Premier Basketball League Conference 6 playoffs holding at the Indoor Hall of Murtala Square Stadium in Kaduna. The competition which forms part of the last lap in the Kwese Premier Basketball League runs from August 14 to 20.
According to organizers of the league, the need to replace both teams from Abuja became necessary due to the failure of the teams to honour their invitation to be part of the Conference 6 after qualifying to participate during the regular season.
The League Director, Mr Ajibarede Bello, said the decision was taken according to the rules governing the league.
“The rules are very clear. Both clubs were invited and letters were duly sent to them. They are aware and fully informed as well as mobilized according to the rules but failed to show up. In other not to leave a vacuum since four of the six clubs invited were on ground and the competition must go on, we decided to apply the rules and upgraded the two teams in the Savannah Conference log to replace them. Also, we must realize that the games are live and for live games, we cannot begin to have walkovers when games have started.” Mr Bello clarified.
Meanwhile, Bauchi Nets coach, Abu Yuyu, said gaining promotion to play the Conference 6 is an honour that the team will not take lightly.
“It's an opportunity we won't take lightly because this could be a big opening for the players. My biggest task is to psyche them up not to take this opportunity with kid gloves”
With Mark Mentors and Defenders dropped, the six teams playing the Conference 6 are Kano Pillars, Niger Potters, Plateau Peaks, Gombe Bulls, Bauchi Nets and Kada Stars. At the end of the Conference 6 in both the Savannah and Atlantic Conferences, two teams will each drop in both conferences for the Final 8 grand finale in Kano.
Day One Results
Kada Stars 69 – 88 Plateau Peaks
Niger Potters 77 – 55 Bauchi Nets 55
Gombe Bulls 97 – 104 Kano Pillars 104

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Galatasaray have signed West Ham United winger Sofiane Feghouli on a five-year contract for 4.25 million euros ($5.01 million), the Turkish club announced on Monday.
The 27-year-old Algeria international spent one season at West Ham after joining the Premier League club on a three-year deal from La Liga side Valencia last year.
Feghouli scored four goals in 27 appearances for the Hammers, including one against NK Domzale in the return leg of a Europa League third qualifying round tie in West Ham's first match at the club's new London Stadium last July.
Paris-born Feghouli came through the ranks at French club Grenoble before joining Valencia.
An age-grade representative for France, he chose to play for Algeria and scored their first World Cup goal in 28 years with a penalty against Belgium in 2014.

Months after the 73-day-long standoff between China and India at Doka La ended, reports have emerged of around 1,600-1,800 People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops establishing a presence in the same area near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet trijunction. According to The Times of India, the Chinese troops have constructed two helipads, scores of pre-fabricated huts, shelters and stores to withstand the freezing winter in the high-altitude region.
A source told the newspaper that earlier, the PLA patrols would come to Doka La between April-May and October-November every year to mark their presence and lay claim to the area before going back but now, after the recent standoff, the Chinese troops have stayed put in what India considers Bhutanese territory for the first time this winter.
The report comes in after Army Chief Bipin Rawat cautioned that China is silently taking over territory and testing India's threshold. He had also warned of a two-front war on the western and northern borders.
"Salami slicing, taking over territory in a very gradual manner, testing our limits of threshold is something we have to be wary about and remain prepared for situations emerging which could gradually emerge into conflict...," Rawat said about China.
Meanwhile, Beijing maintains that Doka La belongs to China. "Doka La is Chinese territory," Colonel Wu Qian, spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Defence said, when asked about reports that PLA continues to maintain a sizable number of troops close to the standoff site, reported Business Standard.
More recently, Beijing accused New Delhi of invading its airspace. Chinese media said that an Indian drone crashed in Doka La and warned of the consequences.
'Indian drone invaded airspace'
China's defence ministry claimed on 7 December that an Indian drone "invaded" its airspace and crashed. Beijing voiced strong dissatisfaction and opposition to the "intrusion by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) belonging to New Delhi".
"The Indian move violated China's territorial sovereignty. We strongly express our dissatisfaction and opposition," deputy director of the army's western theatre combat bureau, Zhang Shuili, said in a statement.
While Zhang did not reveal details of where the incident happened, Chinese state media said that the drone crashed in Doka La near the Sikkim boundary, reported Hindustan Times. It also said the consequence of this "intrusion" could be far worse than losing a drone.
India, however, rejected Chinese claims and said the drone was on a regular training mission inside the Indian territory when it lost contact with the ground due to some technical problem. Indian officials alerted Chinese authorities over the missing unmanned aerial vehicle.
'Indian and Chinese troops present in Doka La'
Government sources had told The Indian Expressthat around 1,000 Chinese troops were still present on the plateau. The presence of PLA troops had thinned in the area after the disengagement process following the standoff but, one battalion of Chinese troops remained, the report added.
Rawat had said that both Indian and Chinese troops were present in Doka La, but were not in an "eyeball-to-eyeball" contact. "The PLA (People's Liberation Army) is still at Doka La, but they are at a reasonable distance from us and we are not in eyeball-to-eyeball contact," the army chief said.
A PTI report said that China has gradually been increasing its troop level in Doka La. Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa acknowledged this and said, "The two sides are not in a physical faceoff as we speak. However, their forces in Chumbi Valley are still deployed and I expect them to withdraw as their exercise in the area gets over."
It further said that Beijing had started widening an existing road at a distance of 12 kilometres from the site of conflict.
'China to continue building roads'
After the two nations ended the 73-day Doka La standoff, China remained non-committal on the issue of stopping road construction.
"In order to meet the needs of defending the borders, improving the living conditions, China has long engaged in infrastructure development including the road construction," Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said.
A Chinese daily further said that Beijing will continue to build the road in Doka La and New Delhi's strong reaction to the "logical" construction is "eccentric". The state-run Global Times said Doka La belonged to China and "during the Doka La face-off, Beijing intensified efforts to develop infrastructure in the region and road construction there will be a long-term trend".
The standoff
Indian and Chinese troops were locked in a 73-day standoff in Doka La since 16 June after the Indian side stopped the building of a road in the disputed area by the Chinese Army. Bhutan and India were in touch with each other during the course of the face-off that ended on 28 August.
As part of the disengagement, the Chinese troops left the disputed area of Doka La along with bulldozers and removed the tents which they had pitched, according to a top Indian government official.

By drinking this cocktail, the Pap Juc at Felix in Venice, you can help hurricane victims in Puerto Rico. Courtesy Felix
For an entire week starting tomorrow, chefs and bartenders across Los Angeles are teaming up to raise funds for hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico. That means Angelenos in every corner of the city will be able to help hurricane victims simply by drinking or eating at some of the city's best bars and restaurants.
Proceeds from dishes and cocktails on more than 85 menus will go to Unidos por Puerto Rico (United for Puerto Rico), a collaborative organization launched by Puerto Rico's first lady, Beatriz Rosselló, with help from the private sector, dedicated to the relief of the island after hurricanes Irma and María.
“It all stemmed from overwhelming frustration over the situation in Puerto Rico, but it has grown into an outlet for all of us to channel our feelings of hopelessness and rage into action,” says Andrea Sun, a hospitality industry veteran who with her colleague, Edward Allen, spearheaded the effort in L.A., called L.A. Loves Puerto Rico.
Here are few of the spots where you can take action (and the dishes and drinks they're offering):
Felix Trattoria | Venice
Best New Restaurant
Papa Juc: rum, lime, passionfruit, pineapple
Michael's | Santa Monica
Best Up-and-Coming Chef
Michael's Loves Puerto Rico: Don Q Puerto Rican rum, Mayalen Machetazo mezcal, lemon juice, St. Vincent orgeat syrup, housemade grenadine
Barbrix | Silver Lake
Crispy duck confit with braised white beans, bacon, escarole, fig gastrique
Rossoblu | Downtown
Best Dinnertime Scene
Aged rum negroni
Kato | Sawtelle
Live scallops, paste of capers and olives, tomato water vinaigrette
Here's Looking at You | Koreatown
Best Restaurant From Animal Expats
Banana dacquiri
“I think this is an important story about how one small community moved by compassion can band together in a moment of crisis and move the needle," Sun says. "Not only can we raise much-needed funds to help our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico, but we're able to challenge fellow Angelenos to contribute in some small way in their everyday lives.”

When I began fundraising for CircleUp six years ago, I encountered many investors whose eyes would glaze over when I mentioned “consumer.”
These investors would fidget uncomfortably or drop their gaze when I explained that our platform would only provide capital to small CPG companies. I would often hear the skeptical comments, such as, “an energy bar company can't really get that big,” “baby food isn't scalable,” and my personal favorite, “I can't name a single consumer company” (real quote from a VC).
Today, of course, the tone is much different. Scroll through tech news and you'll see everything from Greylock Partners singing the praises of CPG startups, Sequoia's Michael Moritz joining the board of Charlotte Tilbury, to Lightspeed Ventures coinvesting with VMG Partners, a top mid-market consumer firm.
Alongside blockchain and AI, “technology-enabled” CPG startups are now a bona fide trend for Silicon Valley VCs. The uptick in tech VC dollars going to the CPG market is partly because tech investing is brutally competitive and saturated, and largely because these VCs are awakening to the strong historical returns in CPG, especially with the trend leaning towards small brands stealing market share.
Consumer is a massive market – about 3x the size of tech, as seen below.
Despite the size of the market, the early-stage has historically been underserved by investors due to market inefficiencies like the geographic dispersion of brands and a lack of structured information sources (i.e. there is no Silicon Valley for consumer, and certainly no Crunchbase equivalents – yet). In theory, the recent trend of VC dollars going to fill a capital gap in CPG should result in a win-win. In effect, many of the tech VC investments into consumer are misguided, and sometimes even harmful. Investors may lose money, but entrepreneurs can lose companies they've spent lifetimes building.
There are a few things that VC investors should keep in mind to ensure they invest in a way that benefits both them and the entrepreneurs they work with.
One company won't rule its market
The heart of the problem with tech investors in CPG is that they operate under the assumption that one CPG player can rule its market. They believe this because in tech, it's largely true. When you look at Uber and Airbnb, it is likely that one or two players could own 70% of their respective markets. Holding this assumption in the CPG space, however, in fundamentally flawed.
There has been a secular shift over the past 5-10 years where people now favor unique, targeted products catering to personal preferences. Today, even the act of selecting a beer or hand lotion is a form of self-expression. The result is a fragmentation with many brands that are more targeted in their offering. Many of these products are inherently smaller in scale and never intend to be mass market—yet do frequently get gobbled up by public consumer conglomerates. The M&A in consumer and retail was over $300 billion in 2017 according to PWC, vs. $170b for tech.
While the market grows more and more fragmented with small to mid-sized brands offering diversified products, we're moving far away from the notion that one condiment or baby products brand can own 70% of its category.
Too-high valuations and large raises are harmful, not encouraging
Relatedly, putting too high a valuation on a CPG company and theorizing it could rule its market is counterproductive and unrealistic. It pushes the entrepreneur to unnatural and harmful tactics to meet this valuation, or to eventually fundraise again at a lower valuation – or at a higher valuation from whatever out-of-tune investor they can find to do – then seriously struggle to exit. Some of the spiraling is obvious, including inflated marketing campaigns that force growth, often long before the product is ready, and some are less obvious, including inflated numbers in investor decks behind the scenes.
Ask anyone knowledgeable in consumer about why Unilever bought Seventh Generation instead of the similar, but far more trendy Honest Company. It's largely because of valuation. By every account, the VCs involved in Honest Company put a valuation in previous rounds that made no sense relative to core metrics. Consumer companies shouldn't raise $30m in equity to grow, let alone $300m. The result: Honest Company couldn't get the exit it wanted, had to cut costs, and reportedly faced tremendous unrest among employees who were upset about the direction the company was heading.
Ultimately, CPG brands don't need that much money to grow. Capital efficiency is one of the beauties of CPG. Consumer companies can typically raise $4-8m to get to $10m in revenue, where they are often profitable. Tech companies typically raise $40-50m to get to the same revenue range, and often fail to make a profit even at that point. SkinnyPop, RXBar, Sir Kensington's and Native Deodorant are great examples of the lean operations characteristic of CPG.
A great brand isn't as simple as a D2C model and a sleek website
In the past year I've had 10-20 tech VCs call me and say some variation on this: “we want to get into consumer, but it has to be tech enabled, because we told our LPs we'd invest in tech companies.” This overfocus on D2C leads VCs to put too much money into the company at too high a valuation.
D2C is a channel. Just like the convenience store channel (i.e. 7/11), club (Costco), mass (Walmart) and grocery (Safeway). Like these other channels, DTC has pros and cons. It is not a Holy Grail. Too often, we see inexperienced VCs talk about D2C as “lower cost” when in reality the average D2C brand raises 10-30x the amount of brands in the offline world with massive overvaluations. Tell a D2C entrepreneur that their channel is cheaper than offline, and she will quickly explain to you that the Customer Acquisition Costs in the past 3-5 years have made that no longer true. If D2C is better margins, why did Bonobos raise $127m, Dollar Shave Club raise $164m and Casper raise $240m?
D2C is a channel, but it does not change the underlying fundamentals of what makes a successful CPG company. Those fundamentals, aside from margins and team, are brand, distribution and product differentiation. Product differentiation in consumer is necessary, but not sufficient, for success. The product must be unique relative to other offerings, and in a way that matters to people. Kind Bar looked like real food relative to Clif Bar, 5 Hour Energy was the only energy drink fit for on-the-go, and Halo Top gave you permission to eat a whole pint in one sitting. If those sound silly, they are all billions-dollar companies that each raised far less than the typical tech company, thus with less dilution.
The way forward
Consumer is an amazing market with massive depth and presents a wonderful opportunity for investors to help build the dreams of entrepreneurs with them. If VCs truly want to succeed in this market, they need to take the time to understand the fundamentals of consumer investing. I hope that more investors catch on to this so that wonderful consumer entrepreneurs can continue to get the capital and resources they need to thrive.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has raised around $7 billion for its new private equity fund, near the top of its targeted goal, according to two people familiar with the matter.The Wall Street firm, which was seeking to raise $5 billion to $8 billion for its first buyouts fund since the financial crisis, is expected to close the fund in the coming weeks.Called West Street Capital Partners, the fund has already invested around $2 billion in deals, the people added.
A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment on the fund.
The new fund is substantially smaller than Goldman's last fund in 2007 which raised $20 billion. It also comes at a time when private equity firms are raising record amounts of capital.

Edmonton's Grey Cup organizers have released more details on what can be expected at this year's festival surrounding the CFL's biggest game.
The theme is “Bring the Heat” and over 50 events are being planned to celebrate fans flocking to Edmonton.
The Nissan Street Festival will be on Jasper Avenue between 96 and 99 streets and will feature a number of attractions, three of which were announced Friday afternoon.
Returning from the 2010 festival is the zip line attraction. It will start from Jasper Avenue, just east of the Shaw Conference Centre, and will go down into the river valley.
There will also a street ski on the festival site. Final plans are still coming together, but it's described as a mini ski hill inside the festival space.
Finally, the Jiffy Lube Tube Slide will allow riders to slide down a snow track on an inflatable tube. Organizers don't have a final location for that activity yet, but are hoping it can go on Grierson Hill Road.
“A lot of people from out of town don't realize we have this river valley here, so we're going to show it off and we're going to play inside of it and everything else will all be around it,” Duane Vinneau said.
The festival's executive director was also on the board for the 2010 Grey Cup. He calls the event from eight years ago “the one to beat.”
“We have a lot of things that we've rolled out and, at the same time, we're building out our overall plan,” Vinneau said about what else is coming. “We'll do over 50 events. We're planning dinners, and we're planning awards events and we're planning festivals. The whole process is just sort of going at the same time.”
Those looking to attend the game will have to wait until June 1, unless they are Edmonton Eskimos season ticket holders. Those who renew existing season tickets or buy new ones have access to buy their ticket for Grey Cup now.

In 2010, Edmonton's Grey Cup sold out in only six days. Eskimos president and CEO, Len Rhodes, said season tickets sales are up compared to this time last year and that sales are on pace to beat the previous record.
“It's only February and the game takes place in November, but it really does reflect Canada's largest party and we really want to make sure it's Edmonton's party,” he said.
Tickets range from $99 to $325 to keep things “accessible” for the fans that support the Eskimos “day in and day out,” Rhodes said.
On June 1, the organizing committee will be holding a breakfast at the Shaw Conference Centre along with the Chamber of Commerce. CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie will be there as the keynote speaker.
The economic benefit in 2010 was about $80 million for the City of Edmonton. Organizers are hoping this year's festival will bring in more than $100 million.
Rhodes has an additional goal: seeing the Grey Cup in the Eskimos' hands at the end of the game.
“It's a bold, audacious goal, but that's what sports are all about,” Rhodes said. “We've won 14 Grey Cups, we've hosted four times in Edmonton for the Grey Cup since 1949, but there's one thing we've never accomplished is winning in our own backyard. The whole team knows this is the one we really want.”

England became the last team to qualify for the World Cup quarter-finals after a dramatic penalty shootout as favorites Brazil and fancied France trained their sights on their last-eight opponents. England's victory against Colombia takes Gareth Southgate's team into what looks like a winnable match against Sweden, who edged out Switzerland 1-0 earlier on Tuesday. Both teams are in the bottom half of the draw in Russia, along with the host nation and Croatia, with England the only former winners of the four teams. The top half contains more heavyweights, with 1998 champions France taking on two-time winners Uruguay and Brazil set to face Belgium. Eric Dier's spot-kick gave England their first-ever win on penalties at a World Cup at the fourth attempt - ending the jinx that has dogged them for so long. But Southgate said he was already looking forward to Saturday's quarter-final against Sweden in Samara, with a last-four clash against either Croatia or Russia up for grabs. "Sweden is another team we have a poor record against. We have underestimated them for years. They have created their own story and made history. I don't want to go home yet."
Janne Andersson's Sweden has recovered well from a heartbreaking group-stage defeat by Germany, seeing off Mexico before edging out Switzerland 1-0 in the last 16. RB Leipzig midfielder Emil Forsberg grabbed the only goal of a tight encounter midway through the second half to send his country into the quarters for the first time since the 1994 side who finished third in the United States. For all the drama around England, the winner of the tournament is more likely to come from the top half of the draw, where the teams can boast a combined eight tournament wins. Favorites Brazil will come up against Belgium's "golden generation" in Kazan on Friday while an exciting young France side spearheaded by Kylian Mbappe take on a shrewd Uruguay outfit in Nizhny Novgorod. Much of the focus surrounding Brazil's bid for a record-extending sixth world title has inevitably been on Neymar. But the world's most expensive player has hit the headlines as much for his perceived play-acting as for the on-pitch performances that have helped his side ease into the last eight without ever being seriously troubled.
Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio said the stoppages caused by Neymar's antics stalled his team during their 2-0 last-16 loss to Brazil, claiming the Paris Saint-Germain forward's reaction to Miguel Layun stepping on his leg was a "shame for football."
Belgium were on the brink of another major tournament failure when trailing 2-0 with 21 minutes to play, only for a magnificent breakaway goal by Nacer Chadli in the fourth minute of injury-time to cap a stunning fightback. Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku, Dries Mertens and Kevin De Bruyne are likely to give Brazil's defense the biggest test of their campaign so far, although the South Americans have only conceded once in four matches.
France never got out of first gear in easing through the group stage, but turned on the style as Mbappe dazzled in a classic 4-3 victory over Argentina which set up the clash with Uruguay. Uruguay's success has been built on a solid defence led by Atletico Madrid pair Jose Gimenez and Diego Godin, with the old-fashioned strike partnership of Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani doing the damage at the other end with five goals between them.
No South American side have won on European soil since a Pele-inspired Brazil 60 years ago, but in a World Cup of shocks and surprises, nothing can be taken for granted.
Teams from Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) on Sunday distributed hot meals and food packets in Afrin's southwestern town of Jinderes.
The aid agency has taken all means and measures in the scope of Operation Olive Branch, launched on Jan. 20 against PKK's Syrian affiliate in Syria's northwestern Afrin, AFAD's Hatay province Director Ömer Akbaş told Anadolu Agency (AA).
Hot meals and food packets were distributed to civilians returning to their homes in Jinderes and to the nearby villages of Deir Ballut, Mahmudiyah and Hajilar after the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and the Free Syrian Army (FSA) liberated the area, Akbaş said.
Speaking on the liberation of Afrin's city center from the People's Protection Units (YPG), which was announced on Sunday, AFAD Director Mehmet Güllüoğlu said that if de-escalation zones could be established in Afrin and Idlib, citizens who want to return to the region could then do so safely.
"We will monitor the restoration of agriculture, trade and other services there all together. However, for now, we are taking the first step [in the process]. Our work providing food, sanitary products, water and other needs continue in cooperation with the Turkish Red Crescent and other institutions," he said, while adding it is not clear how many people are planning to return to the Afrin region yet.
Emphasizing that for the ones who would like to return to their homes safely, it is crucial to provide an atmosphere that is livable with a functioning infrastructure, Güllüoğlu said after these are re-established, people will eventually want to return to their villages.
Güllüoğlu further expressed that they gained crucial experience from Operation Euphrates Shield.
"Thanks to Operation Euphrates Shield, approximately 160,000 people have been able to return to their own villages, towns and hometowns," he said, while adding that these returns started sometime after the operation ended due to lingering security concerns.
Turkey launched Operation Euphrates Shield in August 2016 against the Daesh terrorist group in northern Syria and liberated the northern Syria towns of Jarablus, al-Rai, Dabiq and al-Bab, enabling locals who fled to Turkey to return to their homes safely.
"We became familiar with this process through Operation Euphrates Shield. Citizens did not return immediately after the operation ended. A process is needed to clean up those places and to re-establish services like health, education, religious services, water and electricity," Güllüoğlu expressed, while underlining that they expect a similar process after Operation Olive Branch's completion as well. The U.N. has called the refugee crisis caused by the Syrian civil war, which broke out in March 2011, the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II. It is estimated that as many as 500,000 Syrians have been killed and 5.6 million displaced. As a neighboring country, Turkey has welcomed refugees fleeing the war and has called on the international community to recognize the urgency of the crisis. Currently, Turkey hosts more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees, making the country number one among the host countries in terms of numbers.
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition faces a weak adversary in an upcoming presidential election in the form of unpopular President Nicolas Maduro, but it must overcome the more formidable challenge of abstention in its own ranks.
Maduro's approval ratings are languishing at around 20 percent in a country that was once a byword in South America for oil-financed opulence but now faces a collapsing economy, runaway inflation and rising malnutrition.
Yet voter motivation is diminishing due to concerns about fraud, mistrust of the electoral authority and weak opposition candidates, which may help Maduro clinch a second six-year term.
The government has not yet set a date for the election but has said it must be held before the end of April.
Opposition leaders are calling for unity in the run-up to the vote but are conditioning their participation on demands such as the creation of a new electoral authority, something Maduro's allies appear unlikely to grant.
The most coherent message so far has come from fringe politicians who are insisting the opposition should walk away.
“There is only one answer: No,” said Maria Corina Machado, who has a significant media profile but little political influence. “(The opposition) cannot be complicit in a process that seeks to legitimize this regime.”
Optimists believe the official start of campaigning could create momentum and convince crisis-weary Venezuelans to vote for whoever faces off against Maduro, whom the Socialist Party formally selected as its candidate on Friday.
But skeptics insist that the electoral council is in the pocket of the ruling Socialists and is likely to alter the results of the vote.
“I wouldn't want to go out and vote for the opposition only to have the results show my vote went to the government,” said Manuel Melo, a 21-year-old graphic designer who lost a kidney in 2017 after being hit by a water cannon during a protest.
“Since there's going to be fraud, I'd rather not vote.”
Many have also accused opposition leaders of offering too many concessions to the government and, in some cases, of working as stalking horse candidates on behalf of Maduro.
The pro-Maduro Supreme Court last week blocked the opposition's Democratic Unity coalition from running a presidential candidate, requiring aspirants to run under individual parties.
Critics called it an effort to increase division within the opposition and weaken turnout.
JAILED OR BARRED
October's gubernatorial elections were a warning sign of how the Socialist Party can score electoral victories despite fury over the economy.
Even though polls showed the opposition winning most of the 23 governorships, Maduro allies took 18 of them as a result of low voter turnout.
Many insisted that participating in the election was legitimising Maduro's government following what they said was a power grab with the creation of an all-powerful legislature called the Constitutional Assembly in a July ballot boycotted by the opposition.
The governors' vote gave Maduro a political boost and left the opposition divided and squabbling. It boycotted elections for 335 mayors in December, further increasing abstentionism.
With the election at most three months away, the opposition still does not have a standard bearer.
And the field of candidates has been heavily limited by the government's aggressive moves to jail the best-known opposition leaders or bar them from politics.
Two-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles is banned from holding office. Former Mayor Leopoldo Lopez is under house arrest for leading protests against Maduro while his protege, Freddy Guevara, is holed up in the residence of the Chilean ambassador, seeking to avoid arrest on similar accusations.
However, former union leader Andres Velasquez has shown interest in a presidential bid, while ex-Lara state Governor Henri Falcon has called on the opposition to unite behind him. Former Congress chief Henry Ramos has also said he would run in opposition primaries.
Both Ramos and Falcon have done better in recent polls than Maduro, according to Datanalisis Director Luis Vicente Leon, adding that Venezuelans widely reject the president.
But doubts about the fairness of elections and limited motivation following the opposition's recent ballot box fiascos may make that irrelevant.
“The opposition is indeed the majority,” Leon said in a telephone interview, “but that won't matter if it can't mobilize its people in an election.”
The dad of Katrice Lee - who went missing in Germany more than 36 years ago - says he remains hopeful she will be found alive after a five-week search for clues uncovered ‘nothing of significance'.
Royal Military Police investigators carried out a forensic excavation of the bank of the River Alme, near Paderborn, where it was believed her body could have been buried.
Royal Military Police during the forensic investigation
A press conference in Germany yesterday heard investigators had found bone fragments but they are not believed to belong to Katrice, who went missing from a NAAFI supermarket on her second birthday on November 28, 1981.
Katrice's father Richie Lee, 68, who lives in Hartlepool, said that the result of the excavation confirms the family's conviction that Katrice was abducted to be a surrogate child for another family and that they will one day learn the truth of what happened to her.
Richie told the Mail: “The Royal Military Police turned round and said they found bone fragments they believe not to be that of Katrice, however, they have to send that for DNA testing and if necessary carbon dating.
“I told the media that I will get Katrice back if the correct information is put out there.”
Katrice had a condition known as “lazy eye” in her left eye which would have needed surgery to correct when she was a youngster and as a teenager.
Richie, who was based in Germany with the British Army when Katrice went missing, added: “You have got missing peoples bureaux that need to talk to each other across Europe and exchange information on children that are missing and maybe I will get the answers to where Katrice is.
“I get the impression the Royal Military Police are waiting for something to come forward. We can't do that because time is marching on.”
Richie earlier told BBC Breakfast: “You can't imagine what it is like until you have walked in my shoes.”
The Ministry of Defence said the excavation did not find anything of significance.
A spokesperson said: “We thank the Royal Military Police and the soldiers that worked tirelessly on this five-week excavation and share the deep disappointment and frustration that the Lee family must feel.
“This is not the end of the investigation and efforts will continue.”
Anyone with potential information is urged to call investigators on the UK helpline 0800 616888.
LONDON - Athletics greats Allyson Felix and Caster Semenya lit up the track to bring the curtain down on the world championships in great style on Sunday. However, not for the first time, but certainly the last as an athlete, Usain Bolt stole the show.
Retiring superstar Bolt put on one last appearance, the 100m and 200m world record-holder accorded a lap of honour in front of the 60,000 spectators who stayed on after the finals were over.
"It's been a rough couple of days, and this is a very emotional moment for me," said the 30-year-old Jamaican referring to his dramatic collapsing to the track with cramp in the anchor leg of the 4x100m relay final 24 hours earlier. "I always tried my best and gave 100 percent all the time and above all put on a good show."
Bolt then went on a lap of honour to the tune of "Reggae Nights" raising his arms and applauding the crowd, embracing his parents on the track and then finishing with a final flourish of his trademark 'lightning bolt' stance not once but twice. On the track, Felix ran a stunning leg in 48.7seconds in the women's 4x400 metres relay to set the United States up for an easy victory and take her record world medals tally to 16, two ahead of retired Jamaican duo Merlene Ottey and Bolt.
"It does mean so much to me every time," Felix said when asked whether medals motivated her. "I love this sport. I'm grateful to run with these amazing girls. They work so hard and deserve all their success. It's an honour to run in the relay for Team USA and I will always treasure these moments."
South African star Semenya, who seems to block out all the debate about whether she should be running or not, added a third 800m crown to her tally to put her alongside another African great Maria Mutola as the only women to have won the title three times.
Semenya hinted that it would now be time to tackle the world record of 1:53.28 set by Jarmila Kratochvilova back in 1983. "We need to clear 1:55 first and it will require a lot of hard training. I have Olympic, world and Commonwealth titles now so maybe it is time to target the world record," said Semenya, whose last defeat in the event dates back to 2015. "It's the next thing on the list. I know it will be difficult but I will have to attempt soon, maybe."
Kenya enjoyed a successful final blast with Hellen Obiri comprehensively denying Alamaz Ayana a double gold as the 27-year-old Kenyan burnt the 10,000m champion for pace down the back straight of the final lap to ease to the 5,000m title. Her compatriot Elijah Manangoi led home a 1-2 in the 1500m to turn his silver from 2015 into gold this time round but Asbel Kiprop never looked at the races for a fourth successive title and finished down the field in ninth.
"It was just such a good race and I'm so pleased to be a world champion. I had a difficult race as Timothy (Cheruiyot who is also his training partner) raced very well but I had that extra strength," said 24-year-old Manangoi. "We have had very good champions in the event over the years so it is a proud moment for me to win this title for my country."
The Americans may have dominated the 10-day competition but there was to be no final flourish as Trinidad and Tobago's men's 4x400m relay team ran superbly to take the gold and bring the curtain down on a championship that never failed to surprise.
It is an undisputed beauty classic, but could the red lip's days be numbered? Perhaps -- after all, the Autumn/Winter 2018 ready-to-wear shows had plenty of alternatives to offer this season.Vivid, primary colors were a surprising yet welcome theme on the catwalks of New York, London, Milan and Paris throughout February and March. In Milan, Annakiki stood out with some strikingly unusual shades, including a daring shamrock green and a sky blue hue, while Maison Margiela fell into step in Paris with a series of bold hues in shades of green, blue and orange (as well as a dazzling holographic glitter look created by makeup mogul Pat McGrath).Bubblegum tones also reigned supreme, with the models at Max Mara sporting bright lipstick in poppy tones such as hot pink and lilac.Moschino's beauty concept was both nostalgically retro and gloriously futuristic at the same time, featuring lots of body paint in avatar blues, bright greens and sunshine yellows -- with the lipstick tones to match -- while Chromat put a tangerine spin on the trend.Last but not least, there was a healthy dose of shimmer. Nicopanda debuted eye-catching hues such as gold and orange, both with a sparkly, metallic finish -- an approach echoed by Stella Jean, who championed the frosted look in ice-cool tones of pink and purple.
Iceland secured a resounding 3-0 victory in Turkey on Friday, ending the home side's hopes of reaching next year's World Cup and putting the visitors on course to qualify directly from Group I.With one game to play, the win put Iceland top of the group on 19 points, two ahead of Croatia, who drew 1-1 with Finland. Ukraine also rose to 17 points after beating Kosovo, while Turkey were left on 14 points and out of contention.Johann Gudmundsson put Iceland ahead in the 32nd minute, latching on to a cross from Jon Bodvarsson at the back post to fire the ball past Volkan Babacan in the Turkish goal.The visitors doubled their lead seven minutes later when Bodvarsson slipped the ball between two defenders to Birkir Bjarnason who fired the ball beyond Babacan, drawing boos from the raucous crowd in the northwestern Turkish city of Eskisehir.Turkey's hopes of fighting their way back into the game were dashed early in the second half when Kari Arnason knocked the ball in from close range in the 49th minute, after a corner was headed back across the goal mouth by Aron Gunnarsson.The pattern was set early in the match as Turkey's efforts to break down the solid-looking Iceland defence bore little fruit and the visitors repeatedly looked to hit Turkey on the counter attack.After the third goal, Iceland were content to sit back and absorb the pressure from Turkey for much of the second half as the hosts looked to salvage pride, but even a consolation goal eluded them.Iceland will host Kosovo in their final game while Croatia will play away against Ukraine. Turkey will travel to Finland for their last game.
Tour bus crashes off road and rolls on Te Anau highway, injuring 19
HAMISH MCNEILLY/STUFF A rescue helicopter lands at Dunedin Hospital after a tour bus crashed off the road in Te Anau, injuring passengers.
A tourist bus ploughed into a farmer's fence before rolling on its side on a Southland highway, leaving 19 people injured.
There were reports the 18-seat bus had rolled onto its side at the bottom of Gorge Hill on the Te Anau side of the Te Anau-Mossburn highway about 8am, police said.
St John spokesman Gerard Campbell said there were 19 patients.
Eleven of the passengers with minor injuries were being taken to Te Anau medical centre.
Two were being airlifted to Dunedin Hospital by helicopter - one in a serious condition, one in a moderate condition.
And another two were being airlifted to Invercargill Hospital - one with serious injuries, and the other in moderate condition.
It's understood the rest of the passengers suffered minor injuries.
The bus was completely off the road and there was the possibility more people were injured, the spokesman said.
Firefighters from Mossburn and Te Anau responded to the crash after they were alerted by St John.
A fire communications spokesman said no-one was trapped on the bus but emergency services were working to get three people out of the bus due to the nature of their injuries and the fact the bus was on its side.
Three helicopter crews had been sent to the scene of the crash.
A local farmer who lives near the crash site said it looked like the bus had been coming from the Te Anau direction, and done a 180 before running into his fence.
He said the road was very icy and there had been fog this morning, which was starting to clear. Conditions were "about as bad as it gets".
"It's just people in a hurry basically, they need to slow down."
He said the road was closed and at least 30 cars were lined up waiting.
Police ask motorists avoid the area as the highway is closed, and is expected to be for some time.

LAHORE - Punjab Agriculture Department has launched a Procurement Management Information System (PMIS) for transparent and efficient management of public procurement, leading to good governance and delivering value for taxpayer's money.
The launching ceremony of PMIS was held at a local hotel which was attended by Agriculture Secretary Wasif Khursid.
Addressing the event, Wasif said PMIS will improve performance, fairness, transparency, efficient economy, accountability and better service delivery in public procurement.
The ICT based platform, he said, was fully compliant with Punjab procurement rules. The system, he added, will offer top management to improve its procurement and financial planning and it will also provide real time monitoring and progress report of all procurement operations.
PMIS will reduce procurement cycle time and associated administrative costs, he said, adding it will strengthen internal control and reduces risks.
The spokesman for Agriculture Department says current public procurement regime in Punjab came into force in 2009 for improving procurement governance in the province. Despite the best efforts, enforcement of Public Procurement Rules has remained a challenge. On evaluation of audit reports and objection raised by PPRA on day-to-day procurements by procuring entities, a set of repetitive violations can be identified. These frequent mistakes are mainly due to capacity gaps and lack of understanding of Public Procurement Rules among public officials, which results in non-compliance, audit paras, and even allegations of misappropriation on the procuring entities.
A most viable solution is to ameliorate the situation is using an ICT tools to manage procurement.
ISLAMABAD, Jul 3 (APP):President Mamnoon Hussain Tuesday said that the general election was being held in Pakistan during this month, which would further strengthen the democratic and political system.
“I am confident that the upcoming democratic government will continue this process of economic development and welfare of the masses,” he said while speaking at the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry's Ambassadors annual dinner here.
By the grace of Allah Almighty, the President said, Pakistan was forging ahead on the path of development and prosperity after eradicating the menace of terrorism, adding that economic indicators were showing an impressive improvement and the country's stock markets were performing well due to the effective policies of the government.
“I can say with full confidence that Pakistan has become a most attractive destination for local and foreign investment and the vast improvement in law and order has enhanced the business activities and confidence of the investors,” he added.
Now, the President said, it was the responsibility of business community to reap optimal benefits from those opportunities and to further strengthen their commercial and economic relations internationally, with the cooperation of the diplomatic corps based in Pakistan.
Over the past few years, he said the government had painstakingly formulated economic policies for creating a business friendly environment in the country. As a result the process of making investment in Pakistan had been made easy due to the investor-friendly regime, which was one of the most flexible in the region, a fact recognized internationally, he added.
He said foreign investors could invest in Pakistan on the basis of 100% ownership and also repatriate profit without any unnecessary impediment. Likewise, Pakistani exporters had also been provided special incentive for loans on minimum interest rates and import of machinery and raw material, he added.
The President said the measures had made Pakistan one of the most investment friendly countries in the region. He hoped that diplomatic corps based in Pakistan would play a positive role in that regard by urging the investors, traders and industrialists of their respective countries to avail the opportunities.

Dear Amy: I was snooping in my son's basement and discovered he is growing weed. Should I confront him? He could lose his job, house, reputation and shared custody of his daughter.
I am a nervous wreck thinking about how to approach him. My husband would have a stroke if he found out. I know I should do something, but what?
-- Sad Mom
Dear Sad: Here's what you should do: Stop snooping in your son's basement.
Unless he has a sophisticated commercial marijuana ranch down there, you should assume this is for his own use, and leave it alone.
If you absolutely cannot stand it and must confront him about this, you will have to tell him the truth about your own behavior. One natural consequence of your admission would be for him to stop trusting you.
If you are ready to make this sacrifice, you should only urge him not to expose his child to his marijuana growing and weed use. Obviously, if you found this in the basement, so could she, and this would put his daughter in an even worse position than you are in, because involving her in this sort of secret could be ruinous for their relationship, and disastrous down the line.
State laws regarding marijuana cultivation seem to be quite convoluted. If he doesn't have a license to grow and is caught (by someone other than you) the consequences could be extreme in proportion to his crime.
Dear Amy: My daughter, 9, is in Girl Scouts. She loves it. I offer a lot of my time helping out the troop. Today, they went to an ice show in which the troop paid for the tickets, so this was not an out-of-pocket expense for us.
The parents were asked to either provide a snack for their daughters, or send money for the girls to buy a snack. We opted to send a snack instead of sending money, as we struggle financially.
Once they got there, they realized that you can't bring snacks in to the facility (understandable), so one of the troop leaders purchased popcorn buckets for each girl.
All the other girls brought money and were able to purchase their own drinks to go with the popcorn.
My daughter did not have any money with her, so her troop leader bought her a drink with a souvenir cup. My daughter thinks it cost around $15. I emailed the troop leaders and asked how much the souvenir/drink was and offered to reimburse them for it.
I felt like this was the right thing to do. However, my husband disagrees. He feels as though I shouldn't have offered, since we basically followed their initial instructions.
I know this is a small problem but every time someone purchases something on my kids' behalf without us asking, I feel obligated to at least offer to reimburse them when I have the funds. I know they can answer, "No -- don't worry about it." Am I wrong for offering to reimburse the troop leader? Or is my husband right?
-- Confused Girl Scout Mom
Dear Confused: You did the right thing. These troop leaders volunteer their time to help supervise the girls, and in addition to spending their time, they willingly spend money on all sorts of little (and large) things along the way. It was kind of this troop leader to purchase this treat for your daughter. You can assume that she did so very happily and does not expect to be reimbursed, since this was an unanticipated expense.
Of course you should acknowledge this and (if you're able) offer to reimburse her. You can expect her to turn down your offer, but your gesture is a nice way of acknowledging her kindness without making specific assumptions. She was being nice, and now you will be nice in return. That is the social contract your husband doesn't seem to understand.
Dear Amy: The man signing his letter "No Prior Precedent" described his wife's adult biological daughter, who she had surrendered for adoption at birth, entering their lives as an adult and wanting her biological mother to readopt her.
It is quite obvious that this person wants money. Once she is legally their child, she stands to inherit their money.
-- Seeing the Obvious
Dear Obvious: State laws differ, but generally children do not have an automatic right to inherit. And the prospect of inheritance does not always motivate people seeking a relationship with their parents.

PIQUA – A new mural depicting Piqua's early history soon will be visible on the former Atlantis Building at 101 E. High St.
The mural, said Ruth Koon, who chairs Mainstreet Piqua's Beautification Committee, is hopefully the first of more to be considered for the downtown area.
The artist, Eric Henn, is based in Franklin, just south of Dayton. On May 26, Henn began prepping the second-story area, which already featured a mural that had been in place for 40 years.
“This is a great little town,” Henn said. “I grew up in a small town like this.”
Henn's credentials include decorating water towers, industrial tanks and feature walls at malls and amusement parks across the country. “I've worked from Los Angeles to Australia,” he noted.
Henn began his artistic career painting surfboards and T-shirts in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He was “discovered,” he said, after painting a wall at a mall in Texas.
“An oil businessman saw the wall and hired me to paint oil tanks,” he said.
Henn's work took off. This past winter, he did a job for Knott's Berry Farm theme park in Los Angeles and he's currently finishing up a project in Nashville. Locally, his work can be found on Marathon tanks in Findlay — Flag City, U.S.A. — as well as murals similar to those he's doing in Piqua, Miamisburg and Franklin.
Henn said the Piqua job should take from four to six weeks. After he completes the initial drawing, his employees — his daughters and girlfriend — will fill in all the color. “I'll do the finishing touches,” Henn said.
The new mural design was a collaboration between Koon, Mainstreet Piqua Executive Director Lorna Swisher, and Brian Quinter, the owner of the building. A sketch of the design was then presented to the Mainstreet Beautification Committee for final input and approval.
It will depict Piqua's earliest settler, a Native American with colorful headdress and the Miami-Erie Canal.
“We've been talking for a couple years that we wanted to do something with that prominent wall in our downtown,” Koon said.
As a downtown business owner, Quinter is very excited about this visible improvement to the building and ultimately, the downtown.
The committee took a tour to see some of Henn's work south of Dayton. “He is so well-known and does beautiful work,” Koon said. “He came to Piqua and we met with him and described what we wanted.”
Koon said the committee wanted the mural to “be timeless, tasteful and colorful and represent Piqua's history. That was very important to us.
“It's going to be a colorful, tasteful and timeless mural — it checks all three boxes,” she said.
To help pay for the project, Koon said Mainstreet Piqua applied to several local foundations and support for the project was robust.
“We have been blessed with foundation support from several local sources and we are extremely thankful. We were also able to use funds from our ongoing beautification program,” Swisher said. “Each year, we raise funds for our downtown planter program and other significant beautification projects in downtown Piqua. We receive support from many, many households and businesses each year.”
Grant funders for this project include Miami County Foundation, Quatman Foundation, Hartzell-Norris Charitable Trust and the Neils A. & Ruth Lundgard Foundation.
After Henn completes the first mural for the Mainstreet Beautification committee, they are planning to ask him to walk around downtown and “come up with some other ideas,” Koon said.
”We don't want it to look cluttered or busy. We're not doing it to be trendy, but believe it provides a very positive image and memory of our town,” she added.
For more about Henn and his work, check out his Facebook page, Eric Henn Murals, or his website at www.erichennmurals.com.
Anyone wishing to contribute to an ongoing mural program in downtown Piqua is asked to contact Mainstreet Piqua at 773-9355.

PARIS-Scientists said Wednesday they had tracked down the oldest known lizard, a tiny creature that lived about 240 million years ago when Earth had a single continent and dinosaurs were brand new.
Scans of the fossilised skeleton of Megachirella revealed the chameleon-sized reptile was an ancestor of today's lizards and snakes, which belong to a group called squamates, an international team wrote in the science journal Nature.
This finding dragged the group back in time by 75 million years, and means that “lizards inhabited the planet since at least 240 million years ago,” study co-author Tiago Simoes of the University of Alberta in Canada told AFP.
That, in turn, suggested that squamates had already split from other ancient reptiles before the Permian/Triassic mass extinction some 252 million years ago, and survived it.
Up to 95 percent of marine- and 75 percent of terrestrial life on Earth was lost.
Megachirella, discovered some 20 years ago buried in compacted sand and clay layers in the Dolomites mountain range in northeast Italy, was initially misclassified as a close lizard relative.
But Simoes had questions.
“When I first saw the fossil I realised it had important features that could link it to the early evolution of lizards,” he said.
So he hooked up with colleagues to perform a more detailed analysis of the tiny skeleton, which included CT scanning.
The scans revealed previously unseen physical features, including the underside of the fossil, embedded in rock.
The team found a tiny bone in Megachirella's lower jaw that is unique to the squamate family.
“I spent nearly 400 days visiting over 50 museums and university collections across 17 countries to collect data on fossil and living species of reptiles to understand the early evolution of reptiles and lizards,” Simoes explained.
“I used this dataset... to conduct the phylogenetic analysis presented in this study.”
Phylogenetics is the study of how different species relate to one another in the tree of life.
Simoes' colleague and study co-author Michael Caldwell likened the Megachirella fossil to “a virtual Rosetta Stone in terms of the information it gives us on the evolution of snakes and lizards.”
The stone, dug up in Egypt, allowed scientists to decipher hieroglyphics.
There are 10,000 modern squamate species alive today, Caldwell added, “yet we've really had no real understanding of where they came from in terms of their evolutionary history”.
Until now.
For Simoes, the study is about more than the history of lizards.
“We currently suffer a crisis in the world of lack of confidence in scientific evidence and facts. Denial of scientific information has been increasing and replaced by alternative facts not backed up by science.
“This study, along with others that try to understand fundamental aspects of evolution... will hopefully draw back people's curiosity and attention to the natural world and how it has been changing for hundreds of millions of years.”
For fliers who've been lulled to sleep by sound of humming jet engines, there's now a recording of a pair of CFM56s to help bring you closer to Mr Sandman, but on terra firma.Low-cost carrier easyJet has released a charity album for insomniacs and aviation enthusiasts in general, featuring a single, extended-cut recording of a pair of CFM56 jets flying at 39,000 feet from London Gatwick to Nice.The project was inspired by research confirming that white noise can help the brain block out sleep interruptions by displacing interruptive sounds like traffic, snoring, and barking dogs, says easyJet."The soft, repetitive, ambient drone of white noise can drown out sounds, gently settle the brain and aid the on-set of sleep," said sleep expert Sandra L. Wheatley, who acted as a consultant."There is also strong evidence that it can dampen out disruptive noises that can disturb our slumber. The low throb of a powerful jet engine is ideal for this."In the UK, the Sleep Council estimates that 22 percent of Britons sleep poorly most nights.A recent survey conducted for Princess Cruises found that almost half (49 percent) of Americans don't get enough sleep."Jet Sounds" by easyJet as a single is available for 0.79p, while the extended cut is £7.99 on iTunes, Amazon and Google Play. All proceeds will be donated to The Children's Sleep Charity.
Lin-Manuel Miranda, top row from left, Rita Moreno, Jennifer Lopez, and bottom row from left, Camilla Cabello, Marc Anthony and Luis Fonsi.
“I was like every Puerto Rican with ties to the island, with family on the island. We all had a terrible few days of silence. For some, those days were weeks,” Miranda told the Associated Press . “For me, that helplessness turned into, ‘OK, well, what can I write that will help? Can I write a tune that we can monetize?'”
The Tony-winning “Hamilton” creator released the song at midnight Thursday night, featuring a murderers row of Latin superstars including Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Camila Cabello, Gloria Estefan, Fat Joe, Luis Fonsi, John Leguizamo and Rita Moreno.
Lin-Manuel Miranda's “Almost Like Praying” tribute to Puerto Rico is over and the fundraising song was worth the wait.
Inspired by "Maria" from "West Side Story" — a tune that shares a name with the hurricane that ravaged the island on Sept. 20 — "Almost Like Praying" mentions all 78 towns in Puerto Rico, from the coast, to the mountains, to the smaller islands along the shore.
Other artists featured in the song include Ruben Blades, Pedro Capo, Dessa, Juan Luis Guerra, Alex Lacamoire, Ednita Nazario, Joell Ortiz, Anthony Ramos, Gina Rodriguez (the "Jane the Virgin" star raps!), Gilberto Santa Rosa, Tommy Torres and Ana Villafane.
Ricky Martin and Daddy Yankee were also invited to take part but were already too busy assisting with hurricane recovery to participate.
Miranda was excited about how fervent people's desire to aid Puerto Rico has been, but couldn't say the same for the federal government.
“This was an unprecedented disaster and requires an unprecedented federal response. They have not yet gotten an unprecedented federal response,” Miranda said to the AP. “I am longing and waiting and jumping up and down for a federal response to match the response of our people.”
All proceeds from downloads and streams of "Almost Like Praying" go to the Hispanic Federation's disaster relief fund.
The song is available on Spotify, iTunes, Tidal and more.
The Hispanic Federation's disaster relief fund is accepting donations online.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — A DeVos family-funded nonprofit is working to redevelop vacant buildings on Grand Rapids' southeast side, specifically in the Cottage Grove and Boston Square neighborhoods.
Amplify GR says the development will be driven by the wants and needs of residents in the neighborhood, but some are skeptical.
There are people who are concerned that redeveloping these buildings could push out neighbors.
24 Hour News 8 spoke with residents who said they aren't worried about development, they are excited.
“I think it's a good idea, yup,” said April McFerrin. “It's just sitting there, you might as well use the building for something.”
McFerrin and her mom moved into the Cottage Grove neighborhood last year and is now raising a young son. She would like to see more places for kids to play.
Amplify GR worked with Rockford Construction to purchase roughly 20 properties. The nonprofit was created by foundations for Doug, Maria and Cheri DeVos.
“Downtown there has been a tremendous revival of the downtown area, but we also recognize that, that success has been uneven,” said Amplify executive director Jon Ippel.
Ippel, a former city planner in Orlando, says Amplify GR wants to change that.
“The hope is that we really begin working with residents to figure out what should happen on these properties moving forward,” he added.
Ippel says that could mean more parks, affordable housing or job opportunities. He says fears of gentrification are unwarranted.
The city commissioners for these neighborhoods are keeping a close eye on the plans.
“(Aplify GR) is asking us to hold them accountable and they are asking us to join them on their journey. So that's a good start in my book,” said Third Ward City Commissioner David Allen.
Third Ward commissioners Allen and Senita Lenear have stressed that pushing residents and minority owned business out will not be tolerated.
“I can't predict the future, but I would say all the indicators right now there is this big developer that say we bought this land, help us develop it. There are no plans,” said Allen.
Amplify GR says the reason the nonprofit was created is simple.
“We strongly believe strong neighborhoods are a key part of the success story of this community,” said Ippel.
On June 29, Amplify GR will be holding a meeting with the neighbors to provide more details about plans and get feedback. The meeting will take place at 6:30 p.m. at Living Word Church located at 1534 Kalamazoo Avenue SE.

When Cayden James, hacker extraordinaire, was first introduced on Arrow, he was a mysterious almost God-like figure with an incredible amount of smarts, money, and resources. But for whatever reason, he decided to put his trust in a Legion of Doom-like cabal of bad guys (and one bad gal) to take down the Green Arrow. In “We Fall,” it was revealed that Cayden's reason for hating Oliver was that Oliver killed his son — something Oliver could have easily done, but was essentially something the same family dynamic that fueled Prometheus to bring Oliver to account in Season 5. But this time, it turns out that Ollie didn't actually do it. He was in Hub City at the time that a fabricated video shows him as the killer of Cayden's son elsewhere.
In “All for Nothing,” we get to see that video (which made it even more improbable that the brilliant Cayden would actually believe it, as it's not the best doctored video, but perhaps he's been blinded by grief) and find out that the anonymous person who sent it did so in order to set Cayden on a rampage against Oliver. Further, this mysterious person was likely the one who also released the doctored photo of Oliver as the Green Arrow.
What this means is that, ostensibly, Cayden is not the Big Bad of Arrow Season 6 — he's either a pawn in someone else's game, or he's just been easily duped by another bad guy, possibly one in whom he has recently placed his trust. Keep in mind, by the way, that he's also not just going after Oliver and Team Arrow, but killing off a lot of innocent people and draining the funds of an entire city to strike back at him. So his motivations as a bad guy aren't particularly clear outside of being a psychopath who's bad at coming up with security codes, but it's also Michael Emerson so I think we're all willing to forgive a lot.
Still, the question remains: who is pulling the strings for Cayden in regards this photo and video? (Assuming of course that the video isn't some weird trick that Cayden is playing on Team Arrow). Below are a few possibilities, and why they may or may not be the mastermind. At the end you can vote in our poll with your pick, and for anyone not mentioned, let us know your guess in the comments!
Looking for a way to tune into the coming week's WWDC keynotes so you can get your Apple announcement fix? You're in luck! Today, the tech colossus has officially updated its Apple Events app for fourth- and fifth-generation Apple TV ahead of the approaching conference. Now, when you go to open the app, you'll see the telltale sleek, snow-white visual theme of this year's WWDC artwork, including an updated home screen icon. There hasn't been any change in the functionality of the app, however.
For those of you not already in the know, the event will run Monday, June 4, 2018 through Friday, June 8, 2018 at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California. It will commence at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, so if you live outside of that area, you're going to need to calculate your local time so you don't miss anything.
In addition to the Apple TV app, Apple's dedicated events page has also been updated to reflect the impending conference. If you don't own an Apple TV (or just don't want to mess with the Apple Events app), you can also stream the event live by tapping that link day-of.
If you'd like to know more about how we're prepping for WWDC and our theories regarding the event, give the pieces below a glance and check back for further updates!

Meek Mill has been granted bail.
The 30-year-old rapper was sentenced to two to four years in prison five months ago after he violated the terms of his parole stemming from a drug and weapons conviction in 2008.
And after having previously had his requests for bail denied in December by judge in his case, Genece Brinkley, the Supreme Court has overruled the judge's decision and granted the rapper with immediate bail.
In a statement from Meek's lawyer Joe Tacopina, the star said: "I'd like to thank God, my family, my friends, my attorneys, my team at Roc Nation including JAY-Z, Desiree Perez, my good friend Michael Rubin, my fans, The Pennsylvania Supreme Court and all my public advocates for their love, support and encouragement during this difficult time.
"While the past five months have been a nightmare, the prayers, visits, calls, letters and rallies have helped me stay positive. To the Philadelphia District Attorney's office, I'm grateful for your commitment to justice - not only for my case, but for others that have been wrongfully jailed due to police misconduct."
The 'All Eyes on You' hitmaker - whose real name is Robert Williams - also revealed he plans to continue fighting to have his conviction overturned, and insisted he would be returning to the studio to record new music soon.
His statement continued: "Although I'm blessed to have the resources to fight this unjust situation, I understand that many people of color across the country don't have that luxury and I plan to use my platform to shine a light on those issues. In the meantime, I plan to work closely with my legal team to overturn this unwarranted conviction and look forward to reuniting with my family and resuming my music career."
In December, Brinkley denied Meek's request for bail because she believed the 'Litty' rapper "is and continues to be a danger to the community in Philadelphia, New York, Missouri, and other locations throughout the United States".
She added: "He continues to be a danger to himself based upon a history of continuous use of illegal drugs, and is an increased and greater flight risk because he already has been sentenced to a term in state prison and gave false information to authorities when he was arrested in St. Louis, Missouri."

The provincial government said the new Improvement District 349 model is both fair and inclusive, while Mayor Craig Copeland maintains that Cold Lake wasn't consulted about the new I.D. 349 framework.
Since 2015, the City of Cold Lake had been actively involved in I.D. 349 funding discussions, said Chris Bourdeau, a spokesman for Alberta Municipal Affairs, denying Copeland's claims.
“The mayor has had multiple opportunities to meet with the current and previous Minister of Municipal Affairs to share his perspectives,” said Bourdeau in an email to the Cold Lake Sun, adding that it was made clear to Cold Lake representatives that a new funding model was going to be developed. One that was more equitable to the other communities in the Lakeland region.
Bourdeau said that during discussions, all the involved municipalities had an opportunity to share their ideas of how the money should be distributed.
“There have been multiple face-to-face meetings with the Mayor of the City of Cold Lake and the Chief Administrative Officer, along with other impacted elected officials and administrators,” said Bourdeau. “Consultation on this issue has been extensive.”
Bourdeau said the final decision regarding the new I.D. 349 distributions were based on the input of all the communities.
Before that decision was released, in August, Minister of Municipal Affairs Shaye Anderson met with Cold Lake CAO Kevin Nagoya and the other CAOs from neighbouring communities to share a draft proposal of the new I.D. 349 framework, which was then revised based on their feedback.
Still, the final decision around I.D. 349 was a shock to Copeland, who said the Alberta government told the city that Cold Lake would be getting 85 per cent of the Air Weapons Range money, which is estimated to be worth about $2.35 billion over the next five years.
“No one can say that the City of Cold Lake was consulted on the new arrangement, nor can anyone say we were forewarned about the impact these changes would have on the future of our city,” said Copeland in a Nov. 28 statement. “No one with a full picture of what happened would think Cold Lake was treated fairly.”
Newly elected city councillor Kirk Soroka said the new I.D. 349 framework was like a “kick to the guts.” Bourdeau said the government's decision on the new funding model balances the interests of all impacted communities and adheres to the government's principles of enhancing regional equity and collaboration.
“Our desire is to support cooperative development that will contribute to the well-being of all Albertans in the region,” he said, adding the new funding model still directs more than 50 per cent of the Improvement District revenues to Cold Lake, said Bordeau.
However, Copeland asserts that isn't enough money to keep the city afloat over the long term.
“If we move forward under the present set of circumstances, our concerns will increasingly shift from the Cold Lake Air Weapons Range Agreement to the outright sustainability of our community,” he said.
Before the city met with the minister in mid-November to learn its I.D. 349 funding would be decreased, Copeland said he and Nagoya were waiting to have some meaningful conversation around the future of the agreement.
Copeland insists the city was blindsided by the minister's final decision, but Bourdeau said Cold Lake should have expected the change.
“The City of Cold Lake has received the vast majority of benefits from I.D. 349,” said Bourdeau, adding that since the creation of I.D. 349 in 2011, the City of Cold Lake has received more than $120 million, which is roughly the same amount the city also collected in local property taxes over the same time period.
“No other municipality in Alberta has received external revenues at this level,” said Bourdeau. “These funds have helped address important challenges faced by Cold Lake.”
Bourdeau said it was in the best interest of the Lakeland region to begin to distribute the benefits of I.D. 349 more equitably.
“The city will still receive approximately $16 million dollars per year,” he said.
Previously, since 2012, Cold Lake has been receiving about $25 million annually through the I.D. 349 agreement.
Under the preceding I.D. 349 agreement, the M.D. received $600,000 in the first year to maintain the Resource Road, with funding increasing $100,000 annually, to a maximum of $1 million in the fifth and final year of the agreement.
In the original I.D. 349 deal, Cold Lake received most of the money to improve the viability of the 4 wing air base.
Under the new I.D. 349 formula, the Town of Bonnyville will get just over $4 million per year for five years.
“The dispersal of the funds will ensure that core infrastructure needs can be addressed within the region,” said Bonnyville Mayor Gene Sobolewski.
The village of Glendon will receive close to $500,000 per year as part of the new I.D. 349 funding formula.
Like Bonnyville, Mayor Laura Papirny said the money will go towards their “critical infrastructure funding needs.”
Lac La Biche County will get $1 million annually.
The Municipal District of Bonnyville will receive $1 million a year to cover the annual maintenance costs on the La Corey North Resource Road.
Additionally, the M.D. will receive $1.2 million over 15 years to cover the debentured costs of applying a much-needed asphalt overlay on the road.
In 2011, to improve the viability of the base, the provincial government created a new improvement district, I.D. 349, out of the Alberta side of the Air Weapons Range.
There are eight improvement districts in Alberta. Five of the eight improvement districts are located in national parks.
Improvement districts are municipal authorities formed by the Alberta government in sparsely populated areas where there is neither the population nor the tax base to support a local government. The provincial government functions as a local government for an I.D. through the levy and collection taxes.
Cold Lake has been getting the income generated from the oil and gas taxes collected by the province from the air weapons range.
Related Coverage Suspect charged after police discover body in Waikiki apartment
The man suspected of killing of his mother, whose remains were found in Waikiki apartment last week, is expected to appear in court Monday.
In a complaint released on the same day, the details of the suspected murder are coming to light.
Yu Wei Gong, 26, was arrested Tuesday after police say he confessed to dispatchers on 911 and stated, “I killed my mom,” on April 11, according to the court document.
The complaint also detailed that he then explained to dispatchers that he killed her in September at their residence on Launiu Street, and that it was an accident because he did not want to go to school.
Officers then arrived to the apartment complex to investigate what Wei had explained on the phone, and discovered him outside the building bleeding from his left wrist. The police then proceeded into the unit and checked all the room within the home and when officers asked where his mother was, he uttered she was “in the fridge,” according to the complaint.
An officer then checked the freezer and found human remains, including two arms with hands and a decapitated head, in numerous plastic trash bags.
Wei was placed under arrest for second-degree murder with his bail set at $2 million.
The complaint also details how Wei explained to others when confronted about the whereabouts of his mother Liu Yun Gong. The document says he told the woman's coworker that she was in China, then later said she was on a neighbor island and had left her phone at home.
A warrant for a search of Wei's home was executed Wednesday, and that's when investigators recovered evidence within seven plastic bags located in the kitchen freezer.
The remains were positively identified to the mother and the Medical Examiner's Officer determined her cause of death was caused by injuries sustained from blunt force trauma to her head. The manner of death was ruled a homicide.

DULER
An 88th minute goal from Nicolau Colaco enabled Guardian Angel SC open their campaign of the Goa Professional League on a winning note as they registered a solitary-goal win over SSC Cavelossim at Duler grounds here on Friday.
The rainy encounter played at a fast place between two teams from Salcete saw Cavelossim colts having better ball possession and a number of attempts at the rival goal in the first session of play.
In the 10th minute, a long-ranger from Semson Fernandes, Cavelossim's new signing from Churchill Brothers, was blocked by keeper Ram Sroop. Once again in the very next minute keeper Ram Sroop pushed the ball from Cavelossim's Semson for corner.
Another goal scoring opportunity for Cavelossim was wasted when Neville Fernandes's shot at the goal from close was timely cleared by Benzu Clemente on the goal line.
Guardian Angel had just one good attempt at the rival goal in the 39th minute when Perryson Rebello collected a through-pass from Rayman Fernandes and latched a power-packed shot at the goal but Cavelossim keeper Siddesh Morje collected the ball confidently.
On resumption of play, the Curchorem colts were a transformed unit pinning their opponents inside their territory and coming with repeated raids.
In the 49th minute, Aniston Fernandes stiff grounder from close was saved by Cavelossim keeper Siddesh, who once again flung to his right to parry the ball to safety off a deadly cross by skipper Anthony Brabosa.
In a counter attack, Cavelossim's Richard Fernandes moved dangerously from the right flank and flashed the ball at the Curchorem goal but overlapping Semson Fernandes was late to connect.
Cavelossim keeper came with two brilliant saves — first to block scorching freekick from Nicholas Rodrigues in the 61st minute and a minute later came with breathtaking back to back saves to block Myron Borges and Anthony Barbosa shots from close.
Once again keeper Siddesh came to his team's rescue as he collected a carpet drive from Perryson Rebello.
After much probing, finally in the 88th minute a curling corner from Nicholas Rodrigues was firmly headed into the goal by former Salgaocar defender Nicolau Colaco which turned out to be the match winning goal.
The lineup given by Guardian Angel team did not have the names of team officials nor the match officials. GFA's officials also failed to check the error before giving the line-up to the press.
Paris: Alexander Zverev eventually controlled his nerves to reach the French Open third round with a 2-6 7-5 4-6 6-1 6-2 win over Serbian Dusan Lajovic on Wednesday.
The second-seeded German smashed a racket in frustration before finding his groove and setting up a meeting with 26th- seeded Bosnian Damir Dzumhur.
Zverev has yet to reach the last eight at a Grand Slam but his huge talent told in the end against the world number 60.
The 21-year-old Zverev had to cope with the frustration of an error-riddled start of the match.
He dropped serve twice in the opening set as Lajovic kept his cool and held serve to take the lead on Court One.
Lajovic toyed with the German, who lost his temper when he was broken in the third game of the second set and crushed his racket in frustration.
Horrible unforced errors and ill-timed rushes to the net followed as Zverev struggled for control but he broke back for 3-3 and regained his composure to convert his first set point on Lajovic's serve to level the match.
There were more jitters, though, as he trailed 2-1 in the third when he dropped serve on a double fault. Lajovic went on to bag the set and Zverev had his back to the wall.
But the German, who leads the ATP Race, was fully focused as he raced through the fourth set by sticking closer to the baseline and he ended the match with an unreturnable serve.
Nishikori downs home favourite
Japan's Kei Nishikori staged a comeback on Philippe Chatrier Court to down home favourite Benoit Paire 6-3, 2-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 and reach the French Open third round.
The 19th seed, who is playing his first Grand Slam tournament since Wimbledon last year after struggling with a wrist injury, outlasted his opponent in a topsy-turvy battle.
The 28-year-old finally got the better of World no 51 Paire in a dramatic fifth set which saw three consecutive breaks of serve before Nishikori saved four break points to serve it out.
"It was a very difficult match, he played a really good second and third set," he said.
"I changed some things and played good in the last two sets."
The former US Open finalist, who has reached the last eight twice in Paris, will next face Frenchman Gilles Simon who put out American 12th seed Sam Querrey for a place in the second week.
Dimitrov wins in mammoth five-setter
A young American man trying an underhanded serve while cramping during a five-setter at the French Open. Hmmmm. Seen that before, haven't we? Except, unlike for 1989 champion Michael Chang, the unusual strategy didn't help result in a victory for Jared Donaldson against Grigor Dimitrov.
The fourth-seeded Dimitrov came back to beat the 21-year-old Donaldson 6-7 (2), 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 10-8 in a second-round marathon that lasted 4 hours, 19 minutes on Court 18 at Roland Garros.
When it ended, Dimitrov leaned forward while raising each knee to give it a kiss — perhaps thanking his legs for carrying him to the win while Donaldson's gave way.
Donaldson, who is ranked 57th, was actually two points from winning when he led 6-5 in the fifth and got to love-30 on Dimitrov's serve. But Dimitrov took the next four points to hold for 6-all.
Dimitrov broke to lead 8-7 and served for the victory, but Donaldson broke right back.
In the next game, though, Donaldson could barely stand, let alone move well.
He double-faulted. Then he tried an underhand serve — not his first of the match, either — and lost the point.
Dimitrov hit a winner to break for a 9-8 edge, Donaldson slowly limped to the sideline for the changeover, and soon enough, it was over.
Chang famously used an underhand service motion while cramping during a fourth-round win against Ivan Lendl on the way to the French Open title 29 years ago.

Nebraska athletic director Bill Moos told The Associated Press on Tuesday night that his comment earlier in the day that the Big Ten's two highest-profile football coaches are "running a little bit scared right now" of the Huskers, was "a bit of tongue in cheek."
Speaking Tuesday at a luncheon at the Omaha Press Club, Moos, who hired Scott Frost months after he arrived from Washington State, said Nebraska football is ready to recapture the "golden era" under its new coach.

"We're gonna run that up-tempo offense we saw [at Saturday's spring game], and we're gonna get the Blackshirts [defense] back to being Blackshirts. And that's extremely important," Moos said, according to the Omaha World-Herald. "You've got Urban Meyer and Jim Harbaugh thinking, 'We better put a little more into that Nebraska game coming up.' And that's the way we want it. They're running a little bit scared right now. And they won't admit it. We'll leave that at that."
Frost will coach his first Big Ten game as Nebraska's coach against Harbaugh and Michigan on Sept. 22 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in the teams' first meeting since 2013. Nebraska will visit Ohio State on Nov. 3. Meyer is 3-0 against Nebraska as Ohio State's coach, and the Buckeyes have averaged 60.3 points in the games and won the past two by a combined score of 118-17. Harbaugh has yet to face Nebraska since he became Michigan's coach.
Nebraska is coming off of a 4-8 season and seeking its first conference title since 1999, when it played in the Big 12. The Huskers entered the Big Ten in 2011 but have won their division just once.

The legend of the Kessel Run is a popular component of Han Solo and Star Wars history in general. Much like asking who shot first (Han did, as Solo proves), the Kessel Run has been a topic of debate for over 40 years now. When Lucasfilm first announced that Solo: A Star Wars Story was going to be a real movie, nearly all hardcore fans knew that the Kessel Run was going to have to be addressed. When it came time to write that scene, screenwriter Jonathan Kasdan admits that he did not want to include it, but his father and co-screenwriter, Lawrence Kasdan, convinced him that they had to do it.
Han Solo famously bragged to Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker that the Millennium Falcon did the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs in A New Hope and Solo finally addressed how the trashy looking ship was able to accomplish such a feat. In terms of storytelling, it's very well done and is the centerpiece to Solo, but it seemed too daunting to Jonathan Kasdan before they started to write it. He explains.
"When he said that, I said Really, do we have to? Because it's such a complicated bit of logic, and solving it was really challenging. We spent a lot of time arguing about how it could work [and how] the language of what (Han) says in that one scene shot years ago that you know George [Lucas] was just sitting there thinking, This sounds cool: I did it in 12 parsecs --- could be flushed out into a fully-fledged coherent sequence that was satisfying and fun. I'm thrilled with how it came out, but it was one of the daunting elements of this always."
Solo is chalk full of callbacks to the original trilogy as well as the prequels and beyond, so Jonathan and Lawrence Kasdan had to really tread around the legacy of the Star Wars universe softly, to not disturb anything that could easily be called out by the hardcore devotees. Meticulous research had to be conducted in order to string everything together in a linear fashion and then there were those Easter Eggs that are really obscure and are now officially part of the Star Wars canon. Everything works, but Solo has been criticized for having a few too many callbacks.
The Kessel Run is now shown for the first time in Star Wars history and it's written and performed very well. Donald Glover's wounded and irritated Lando Calrissian allows Alden Ehrenreich's young Han Solo to pilot his prized Millennium Falcon to get them out of Kessel and to safety. It's just as white knuckle for Lando as it is for fans sitting in the theater watching it. Though Jonathan Kasdan was apprehensive at first, everything came together and it looks awesome. You can read the rest of the interview with Jonathan Kasdan and his reluctance to initially insert the Kessel Run into Solo over at CinemaBlend.

About 18 months ago, the crowds at Silver Lake's most popular brunch spot, Millie's Cafe, increased notably, according to owner Robert Babish.
"For some reason we're getting very famous," Babish says. "Different kind of people. European, from everywhere. They're very good customers. The hipsters tipped better, though."
Babish, who has owned Millie's for 16 years, says he misses the old, more languid days, when most of the customers were patient and generous locals. He's the rare person who will admit to liking a younger crowd in hats and tight jeans. "It was better before, mostly hipsters, but they moved. Don't know where to, but I'm not going anywhere."
Indeed, it would be a bad business decision to ignore the way Silver Lake has changed, how it's a bona fide tourist destination now. (If you suspect you've seen tour groups in buses arrive to the Whole Foods 365, you're not wrong. I checked with a Whole Foods representative — the chain is not involved in the tours but is aware of them.)
Rebecca Pardess
The expanded Millie's space includes more room for storage and 12 more tables. "I didn't want people waiting in line to get bored and leave," Babish says. There soon will be more dining options in the building, as a "matcha bar" from New York will be opening shortly, with a few simple breakfast options. Next to that, a Middle Eastern restaurant is going into the corner spot that once housed Madame Matisse.
It'd be nice for Silver Lake to have more quality dining options. But the crowds will keep coming back to Millie's for those biscuits, apparently till the end of time.

It's confirmed. Carson Wentz tore his left ACL Sunday in Los Angeles, Philadelphia Eagles head coach Doug Pederson announced Monday.
At least no other ligaments were damaged, as also feared.
Thus ends the season for the second-year quarterback, who leads the NFL in touchdown passes with 33, whose blossoming skillset took him to the verge of superstardom, and who led the Eagles to their first NFC East title and playoff berth in four years.
As a benchmark of his stunning Year 2 improvement, Wentz's TD-to-interception ratio as a rookie was 16-to-14. This season, it was 33-to-7, which is more than double the TDs and half the picks.
Can Pederson's team overcome this?
“It sure can, heck yeah,” he said, in point out that the Eagles are 11-2 despite having already lost for the season their Pro Bowl left tackle Jason Peters, top linebacker Jordan Hicks and versatile running back Darren Sproles, among others.
“This is no different. Yeah, (Wentz) is the quarterback of our football team. Each one of these guys that I mentioned is tough to replace. But you know what, the reason we went out and got (QB) Nick Foles was for reasons like this, and situations like this.
“I'm excited for Nick. I hate it for Carson Wentz. I hate it for the career, the season, I guess, that he's been having. But at the same time, it's been the next-man-up mentality, and that's how we approach it this week.”
McCOWN GOES DOWN
New York Jets QB Josh McCown is lost for the season, after breaking his left (non-throwing) hand at Denver, the team announced. The 38-year-old over-achieved as much as any QB this year for a Jets team everyone thought was tanking for the No. 1 overall draft pick. New York is 5-8.
UNDER REVIEW
The NFL was reviewing incidents from the last minute of the Seattle-Jacksonville game, when Seahawks defensive linemen smashed into Jaguars offensive linemen on two kneel-downs. That precipitated numerous personal-foul penalties and got two Seahawks ejected, including Quinton Jefferson, who nearly climbed into the stands in Jacksonville to confront those who heckled and threw drinks at him. ESPN reported that no suspensions will result from the stupidity.
EXTRA POINTS
Tennessee QB Marcus Mariota suffered only a sprained left knee Sunday at Arizona, and should play Sunday at San Francisco … New Orleans rookie RB Alvin Kamara, although still in concussion protocol, told NOLA.com he expects to play Sunday against the Jets … Buffalo QB Tyrod Taylor is closer to returning from a knee injury and will be day-to-day this week, head coach Sean McDermott said. If healthy, he'll get the starting nod over Nathan Peterman, the coach said.

London: India's Purav Raja and France's Fabrice Martin lost an excruciating five-set battle to Mirza Basic and Dusan Lajovic to make an early exit from the Wimbledon championships on Wednesday.
The Indo-French pair was staring at the barrel as they trailed by two sets but put the match on an even keel before eventually tumbling 2-6, 4-6, 7-6(5), 6-4, 9-11 in three hours and 37 minutes on court number six.
Serving at 9-10, Raja and Martin saved two match points but their opponents latched on to the third to claim a memorable win.
"They hit good returns in that game and it made a difference," Raja told PTI after the match.
Both Lajovic (58), who lost to Roger Federer in the men's singles opening round, and Basic (78) are top-100 singles players. There are five more Indians competing in the men's doubles.

: Maneka Gandhi, the Minister for Women and Child Development, has written to her counterpart in the Electronics Ministry to ban the online game Blue Whale challenge game, which allegedly consists of a series of tasks assigned to players by administrators on social media during a 50-day period, with the final challenge requiring the player to commit suicide."I would like to request you to please take up the matter with the concerned authorities for removing the Blue Whale Challenge game from social media so that safety and security of children could be ensured," Meneka wrote in a letter to Ravi Shankar Prasad, the Minister of Electronics.This Blue Whale Challenge game has taken the live of more than 100 youngsters, Maneka wrote, though it's not clear if the deaths are all in India or worldwide. In India it is being spread through social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and also through WhatsApp. The game consists of an anonymous administrator who orders children to do certain tasks for a period of 50 days. Each successive task becomes more sinister with the final one culminating in the player having to commit suicide.The National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights in May wrote to the Electronics Ministry to take appropriate action. The Ministry asked its technical bodies what action could be taken. Based on the responses the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology concluded that no action could be taken to identify and block the game. However, the Ministry has written to social media service providers to take the necessary action, especially after an incident in Mumbai when a youth lost his life allegedly due to playing the game.
PESHAWAR - The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa on Friday formally filed a reference against four fake travelling agents for cheating public at large.
According to details, the accused, Ameer Ahmed Shah, Shahid Hussain, Humayun Khan and Naveed Akhtar, were running a travelling agency named Al-Mustafa Manpower Agency Shakoor Japan in Charsadda and they grabbed Rs33.265 million from more than 55 affectees on the pretext of sending them on Haj.
As per detail, the accused persons were running a fake Travel Agency in the name of Al-Mustafa Manpower Agency Shakoor Japan in Charsadda. The accused persons lured the members of the general public through Radio advertisement during the seasons of Hajj and Umrah.
They collected approximately Rs330,000 per pilgrim and offered them private Hajj facility.
When the pilgrims reached their office in Charsadda for the collection of their visa and passport they found the accused persons disappeared from the scene and deprived dozens of people of their hard earned money on one hand and pilgrimage on the other hand.
Taking cognizance of the complaints, NAB Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa actively pursued the inquiry and arrested the culprits not only because it is a financial nature of fraud, regretfully they made innocent people their victims on the pretext of religious ritual.
It is worth mentioning here that accused persons were arrested by NAB KP bureau and are now in judicial custody.

Pre Nup is the Calgary-based pop-rock project of husband and wife duo Josiah and Sara Hughes plus Lab Coast members Chris Dadge and Darrell Hartsook. Following their self-titled 7” and an original Christmas song comes Oh Well, Pre Nup's debut LP. Today we're premiering its lead single, “Internet Arguments,” a track which, according to Josiah, is humblingly autobiographical:
This song is loosely based on a number of real-life experiences where my shittalking online has had terrible repercussions IRL. For example, I wrote a blog post about how I thought my local rap scene was terrible and embarrassing. I thought I was being funny, but the story blew up and I was getting hundreds of hate tweets and death threats. This all happened on our wedding anniversary. What a disaster.
A disaster, yes, but a productive songwriting tool. What we hear from Pre Nup is humility-laced guitar-pop, a grounding of their egos without too much deprecation. There are enough people on the internet for that. Check it out below.
TRACKLIST:
01 “Admit”
02 “Internet Arguments”
03 “The Grudge”
04 “Impostor”
05 “On The Nose”
06 “Adequate”
07 “Lost Together”
08 “Oh My”
09 “-“
10 “Life In Hell”
Oh Well is out on 5/4 via Debt Offensive/Jigsaw Records. Pre-order it from Bandcamp or on cassette.
Some of the biggest directors in Hollywood right now are rallying their troops after a declaration of war has been called against TV motion smoothing, or as Star Wars: The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson calls it, "liquid diarrhea." Johnson's term might be more than a little redundant, but you get the picture. Back at the end of August, Stranger Things creators, Ross Duffer and Matt Duffer, fired the first shot that may have started the motion smoothing war. The duo brought up their last visit to Comic-Con and how that really started their agitation towards the "feature" that makes everything look like a daytime soap opera. In an interview with Vulture, Matt Duffer explained the time and effort that Hollywood puts into their projects and that they ultimately look terrible when they reach home video. Duffer had this to say.
"Us and everyone in Hollywood puts so much time and effort and money into getting things to look just right. And when you see it in someone's home, it looks like it was shot on an iPhone."
The Duffer Brothers also sent out a message to fans in preparation of Stranger Things Season 2 that gave specific instructions on how to turn the feature off on viewer's televisions. Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn and Rian Johnson have picked up the gauntlet in an explosive Twitter exchange, rallying the rest of Hollywood up into a frenzy.
James Gunn took to Twitter to announce that he, Rian Johnson, Baby Driver director Edgar Wright, War for the Planet of the Apes filmmaker Matt Reeves, along with Mission: Impossible 6's Chris McQuarrie and Tom Cruise "are all on board the anti-motion-smoothing campaign. Who else?" Christopher Miller (The LEGO Movie) and Dan Trachtenberg (10 Cloverfield Lane) instantly jumped on board to get behind the cause. Rian Johnson doubled down on the Duffer battle cry and tweeted out the specific instructions to turn the motion smoothing off and then had this to say.
"You want movies to look like liquid diarrhea, fine. But it should be a choice you make, not a hoop everyone has to jump through to unmake."
This annoying little phenomenon is commonly referred to as the "soap opera effect" and it's a byproduct of your TV's motion-enhancing features. Thankfully, the effect can be turned off, and that's probably a good idea when you're watching movies. While these smoothing features can make a few things look better; scrolling tickers, sports, and HDTV test discs, for example, our eyes and brains expect something very different when we're watching movies. A slower frame rate is one of them. Just make sure you take it off when watching Star Wars movies, Guardians of the Galaxy, Dunkirk, etc.
As of this writing, Dunkirk director Christopher Nolan is on board as well to fight the good fight against "liquid diarrhea" smooth motion technology. Hopefully these guys get some shirts made to raise awareness for the cause. "Liquid Diarrhea" would look excellent on a shirt or a hat of some sort. Anyway, the time has come. What side of history will you be on? Check out the call to arms via James Gunn's Twitter account below as well as some more leading the charge.

Seen as a strict father to a dyslexic child in Taare Zameen Par, actor Vipin Sharma is set to make his directorial debut with a web series titled - Akki, Vikki Te Nikki.The web series Akki, Vikki Te Nikki deals with life of three strugglers.The show is a tribute to those aspiring actors who come to Mumbai with dreams in their eyes and upbeat every day even when they face rejection, a press release issued here read."Since we celebrated 100 years of cinema in India recently, it is time to pay tribute to these actors dressed in their best, roaming the streets of Mumbai going from door-to-door, asking sheepishly, audition hai kya aaj? ('any auditions today?) looking for that golden opportunity which will turn them into a star," Vipin said in a statement here.The web series was earlier supposed to be a full-length feature film."The content was beautiful and we couldn't have done justice to it in two-and-a-half or three hours. Hence, we decided to make a web series instead of a feature film," producer Surendra Bohra said.The first episode of the web series will air on Diwali on Facebook.
NEW DELHI: Coming down heavily on the defiant Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) brass, the Supreme Court Monday removed Anurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke as president and secretary for “obstructing” and “impeding” its directions for overhauling governance in the cricket body, which will now be overseen by a committee of administrators.
Acknowledging that it has been forced to take “coercive” steps to mend matters in the Board, the court ordered that till the committee is formed, its administration will be headed by the senior-most vice president while the senior-most joint secretary will perform the duties of secretary.
Notwithstanding the curative petitions filed by the BCCI, which was seen as a ruse for continuance of some office bearers, the court set out conditions based on Lodha committee recommendations for their removal – like bar on those above 70 years, ministers, civil servants and those in positions beyond nine years.
The court also slapped Thakur with contempt and perjury notices for filing a false affidavit over writing to International Cricket Council (ICC) on the issue of autonomy.
“The president and secretary and office bearers of BCCI have obstructed the implementation of the final directions of this court on the basis of a specious plea that its state associations are not willing to abide by the directions,” a bench headed by Chief Justice T S Thakur, who will demit office on Tuesday, said.
It slammed Thakur saying “his actions and conduct rendered himself unfit for continuance as president of BCCI” and he is “liable to be proceeded with for contempt of court for having obstructed and impeded the orders of this court.”
The top court issued show-cause notice to Thakur to explain as to why he should not be prosecuted under Section 195 read with Section 340 of the CrPC for filing “false” affidavit before it that he did not seek letter from ICC president Shashank Manohar on the recommendation for appointment of CAG nominee in board would amount to “government interference.”
“The conduct of the president of BCCI in seeking a letter from the president of ICC in August 2016, after the final judgment and order of this court, is nothing but an attempt on the part of the head of BCCI to evade complying, with the order of this court,” the apex court said while issuing show-cause notice to Thakur to respond as to why he should not be proceeded against for the contempt of court.
The apex court said that a committee of administrators shall supervise the administration of BCCI through its chief executive officer and directed that till then the senior-most vice-president of BCCI shall perform the duties of the president and the joint secretary shall perform the duties of secretary.
The bench also comprising Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud said though sufficient opportunities have been granted to BCCI to comply with the judgment and order of this court, it has failed to do so. “This court having furnished sufficient opportunities to BCCI to comply, it is constrained now to take recourse to coercive steps to ensure that the directions contained in its final judgment and order are not left to be a writ in sand,” it said.
The bench said the Lodha panel consists of a former Chief Justice of India and two former Judges of the apex court and they have been tasked with overseeing implementation of the judgment of this court but BCCI left no stone unturned to frustrate the former judges of the top court.
“Yet, the committee has repeatedly been confronted with a barrage of unfortunate comments by BCCI – in press conferences and in correspondence -with an intent that it should lead to a situation where it throws up its arms in despair and frustration,” the bench said.
As Operation Olive Branch continues, Turkish soldiers deliver food aid to needy Syrian families that live near the border.
The Turkish military escalated its aid activities as Syrian families that live in the Sorke village of northern Afrin asked for help, saying they do not have enough food. Informing the Turkish Red Crescent on the issue, the soldiers delivered the aid packages that came from the organization to the Syrian families on Friday.
"We are pleased with the Turkish soldiers. We sought refuge in their arms. They gave us food and protected us. Before the operation, terrorists were coming to our village, but now they do not come anymore. Turkish soldiers provided us security. We are not scared anymore," the families said after receiving the packages, expressing that they already have a better life thanks to the operation.
After Mallorca, Venice and Barcelona, San Sebastian is the latest European city to plan an anti-tourism march protesting the number of unchecked tourists "invading" their cities.Timed to coincide with a major Basque festival, the Semana Grande, the anti-tourism march in San Sebastian is planned for August 17, at the height of tourist season when the region will be swarming with Spaniards and foreigners alike.Across Europe, a wave of anti-tourism sentiment has been overheating this summer, with protestors spraying messages like "Tourists go home" and "Stop destroying our lives" on city walls across Spain.A similar story is playing out across Italy and Croatia, where patience with tourists behaving badly and the impact large, unchecked crowds are having on daily life is wearing thin among locals.Tourism offices across Italy, for instance, have resorted to banning outdoor drinking after nightfall (Rome), eating and drinking anywhere near historic fountains (Rome), banning the late-night sale of alcohol (Turin) and banning selfie sticks, food trucks and street hawkers (Milan), all in a bid to curb anti-social behavior.After announcing plans to limit the number of tourists to its historic center to 8,000 back in January, the newly elected mayor of Dubrovnik told The Telegraph he's slashed that number by half to 4,000, in a bid to protect the city and improve the visitor experience.Borrowing a page from Venice's playbook, the city of Florence launched a public awareness campaign this week, #EnjoyRespectFirenze, aimed at maintaining decorum and civility on city streets."Those who come to visit our city must behave in such a way as to preserve it, respect its heritage and its inhabitants," said Anna Paola Concia, spokesperson for the local tourism office in a statement."We want to defeat the widespread sentiment that those who come to Italy can afford to do what they want. It is time to make it happen...Florence is one of the most beautiful cities in the world and should be preserved, and that this is a responsibility that also belongs to the tourist."As part of the program, local police officers will be monitoring tourists for disrespectful behavior including littering, vandalism and drunkenness.
"Griezmann is very Uruguayan. He tries to look Uruguayan," midfielder Nahitan Nandez said. "It could be a very special match for him. We hope that he behaves well on the field and that he remembers that he is Uruguayan."
CHENNAI: Had it not been for his marriage to V K Sasikala and she, in turn, growing to be a close aide to former Tamil Nadu chief minister and AIADMK leader J Jayalalithaa , the 74-year-old Maruthappa Natarajan would have passed away as yet another retired state government employee with a fleeting political dalliance. But, that was not to be.Natarajan, who died in Chennai on Tuesday morning at the age of 74, had played a role, silent nevertheless, in his wife getting closer to Jayalalithaa and emerging stronger and once there, to not only control the AIADMK, but also the state administration from behind the scene.In a way, had he not become a state government employee, chances were that Natarajan could have well emerged as a Dravidian leader, having come to limelight in the 1965 anti-Hindi agitation. He played a key role in the students' protests in Thanjavur by galvanising students and was closely associated with DMK's then young leader L Ganesan, who eventually facilitated Natarajan's marriage with Sasikala. "I was the one who saw the bride for MN (Natarajan) and arranged his marriage. It was DMK leader M Karunanidhi who presided over the wedding," Ganesan told TOI.An ardent Tamil lover, the anti-Hindi agitation brought him closer to Karunanidhi and that helped him get into the government service as an assistant public relations officer in 1970-71. He had remained close to Karunanidhi until they fell out over a minor ‘posting' issue.But, luck came his way in early 80s when Jayalalithaa, as part of her induction process as propaganda secretary of the AIADMK, came to Cuddalore, where Chandralekha was the district collector and Natarajan the PRO. His wife, Sasikala, got the contract to video record the event. Within a few years, the couple was very well ensconced in Jayalalithaa's Poes Garden residence from where they jointly witnessed several upheavals including the death of former chief minister M G Ramachandran (MGR), the split of the AIADMK and the 1989 assembly polls that saw the DMK triumphantly return to power after a gap of 14 years.After a long political oblivion, Natarajan emerged from the shadows, after Jayalalithaa's death on December 5, 2016, to claim he had politically ‘groomed and mentored' her. For a brief while, Natarajan appeared to have got into the thick of political turmoil in the AIADMK post-Jayalalithaa until he fell ill in September last year.If not for Natarajan, Jayalalithaa would not have remained in politics, says Tharasu Shyam, referring to her resignation letter, addressed to the assembly speaker, seized by the state police from Natarajan's residence. “It was he who worked for unifying the Jayalalithaa and Janaki factions of the party. Theirs was a love – hate relationship as she suspected that he will take over the party. He was never a member of the AIADMK, but has been expelled three times. He remained a strong willed person,” says Shyam.“Natarajan was not politically active once he joined government service in the early 70s and not until MGR's death. Since Sasikala had very little political knowledge, it turned out to Natarajan's advantage. Even though he never came out in the open, his role was key in picking candidates for the Madurai East and Marungapuri bypolls that the united AIADMK fought in March 1989, after reclaiming the two leaves symbol,” says Trichy Velusamy, who was an early confidante of Jayalalithaa and had known Natarajan for long.“It was MN (Natarajan) and I who played a key role in getting the DMK government dismissed, using our connections in Delhi. But within five months after coming to power in 1991, Jayalalithaa did not want us around,” says Velusamy.
A new algorithm developed at the University of Waterloo will help first responders and home care providers better help the elderly during natural disasters.
According to the World Health Organization, older adults who live at home face disproportionally high fatality rates during natural disasters as evidenced by Hurricane Katrina where 71 per cent of the deaths resulting from that disaster involved people over 60 years of age.
"Frailty combined with social isolation can mean that older adults still living at home have nowhere to turn during emergencies," said John Hirdes, a researcher in the Faculty of Applied Health Sciences at the University of Waterloo. "With a growing proportion of elderly persons choosing to reside in their own homes, it's a very real concern. Home care services need to have mechanisms in place to manage the needs of their most vulnerable clients during disasters."
Hirdes is also the senior Canadian researcher for interRAI, an international network of researchers committed to improving care and quality of life for vulnerable populations.
The algorithm uses data from interRAI's home care assessment to generate an up-to-date list of vulnerable adults using home care services. It takes into account disability, health status, social isolation and the amount of support an individual may receive from informal caregivers.
Eight provinces/territories, including Ontario, already mandate the use of the interRAI assessment for long-stay home care clients. Home care clients are assessed every six months to one year to determine their health status and service needs.
"Older adults living on their own are more difficult to locate and assist than those living in healthcare facilities," said Sandy Van Solm, the Emergency Management Coordinator at the Region of Waterloo who developed the algorithm as part of her PhD at Waterloo. "This algorithm helps us to plan for disasters in advance and allows responders to quickly generate an accurate list of those who may need help during a disaster."
Hirdes and Van Solm are working with the Canadian Institute for Health Information to deploy the algorithm into interRAI home care software used across Canada beginning in 2018.
"It has the potential to save hundreds of lives," said Hirdes. "It's a tool that should be top of mind for any part of the country at risk of natural disasters."
By 2036, seniors aged 65 years and older could represent a quarter of the total Canadian population, and one sixth of the global population.
Details of the algorithm appear in the Journal of Emergency Management.

The Northern California DX Foundation (NCDXF) has contributed $2,500 to the ARRL Ham Aid Fund. Ham Aid was created in 2005 in response to the need for equipment and resources to support the Amateur Radio response to hurricanes in the US and Caribbean. ARRL has supplied Ham Aid kits for the hurricane emergency response efforts in Puerto Rico and elsewhere, where the equipment helps to support necessary communication in the disaster's wake.
“Ham Aid equipment will be needed for future requests,” NCDXF President John Miller, K6MM, said in making the announcement. “NCDXF encourages all amateurs to consider a donation to Ham Aid.
With donations from the DX community, NCDXF helps to fund well-organized DXpeditions to “rare, difficult, and expensive entities.” NCDXF also provides scholarships to Contest University for those 25 years old and younger, partners with IARU to operate the NCDXF Beacon System worldwide, and oversees the Cycle 25 Project — an endowment fund created from estate planning.

Tim Roth and Christina Hendricks are set to return for a second season of Sky's original crime drama “Tin Star,” the satcaster has confirmed. The cast for the 10-part second series, which will air in 2019, will also include Irish actor John Lynch, Romanian actress Anamaria Marinca and Canadian actress Jenessa Grant.
Created by Rowan Joffe, “Tin Star” proved a hit for Sky when it premiered on Sky Atlantic in Britain last September. Amazon has the show in the U.S.
Sky had already announced a second season was planned, but no casting was confirmed. Genevieve O'Reilly and Abigail Lawrie will also return for the second season, which is currently filming in Calgary, Canada.
“The Fall” actor Lynch most recently featured in AMC's “The Terror.” Marinca saw her breakout out role in Cannes Palme d'Or winner “4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days” in 2007 and recently starred in National Geographic's sci-fi drama “Mars.” Grant can be seen playing Ofsamuel in the second season of “The Handmaid's Tale.”
Roth stars as an alcoholic former London police detective who moves with his family to a small town at the edge of the Canadian Rockies to become the new police chief and lead a quiet life. However, following tangles with the chief of security for the oil company that dominates the town, his past catches up with him, requiring him to reawaken his violent alter-ego to protect his wife (O'Reilly) and daughter, Anna (Lawrie), after his son is killed. Hendricks plays the oil company's head of public relations.

The second season will pick up where the first left off. Anna seeks refuge from her parents with a family in a religious community near Little Big Bear. Lynch, Marinca and Grant play the members of the new family, which harbors its own secrets.
“A second series of ‘Tin Star' lets us build on the established world of Little Big Bear, but also gives the audience a glimpse of another intriguing community and provides us with a family who are strangely unsettling for our hero,” Joffe and executive producer Alison Jackson said in a statement.
The first season of “Tin Star” scored a total audience of 1.7 million per episode on Sky Atlantic and more than 16 million downloads and views. It launched on the channel Sept. 7 with all episodes immediately available to view via Sky's VOD service Sky Go.
“Tin Star” is produced by Kudos for Sky. Joffe and Jackson serve as executive producers alongside Diederick Santer and Anna Ferguson for Sky. Endemol Shine International and Sky Vision handle international distribution on the title.
Tiger Woods had five drugs, including the opioid painkiller hydrocodone, in his system when he was arrested in May on suspicion of driving under the influence, according to a toxicology report released Monday.A urine test revealed four other medications along with hydrocodone -- which is sold under the brand name Vicodin.Also present were the powerful painkiller hydromorphone; anxiety drug alprazolam (also known as Xanax); sleep drug zolpidem (also known as Ambien) and THC, which is a chemical component of marijuana.The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office made the results public on Monday."As I previously said, I received professional help to manage my medications," Woods said Monday. "Recently, I had been trying on my own to treat my back pain and a sleep disorder, including insomnia, but I realize now it was a mistake to do this without medical assistance."I am continuing to work with my doctors, and they feel I've made significant progress. I remain grateful for the amazing support that I continue to receive and for the family and friends that are assisting me."The 41-year-old Woods was arrested early in the morning May 29 in Jupiter, Florida. Police found him asleep in his Mercedes-Benz by the side of the road near his home.He later said in a statement that his condition was the result of a reaction to mixing several prescription drugs.It was not immediately known if Woods had prescriptions for all of the medications.Woods pleaded guilty to reckless driving and agreed to enter a diversion program that will allow the 14-time major championship winning golfer to clear his record if he completes the program.In June, he completed a treatment program to help him manage medications he was using to combat back pain and insomnia.At the time of his arrest Woods was unable to tell officers where he was, stumbling through a field sobriety test. Woods told officers he was taking Vicodin and Xanax to deal with pain from April back surgery.The diversion program would call for Woods to spend one year on probation, pay a $250 fine plus court costs, attend a DUI course, perform 50 hours of community service and attend a workshop where victims of impaired drivers detail how their lives were damaged or affected.Woods has 79 career PGA Tour victories but isn't currently playing after his latest back surgery -- his fourth overall.He won 14 majors, but the last one was in 2008 when he won the US Open at Torrey Pines by outlasting Rocco Mediate in a memorable 19-hole playoff.
DETROIT (AP) — A fourth person has been charged in the case of alleged genital mutilation of girls by members of a Muslim sect.
Tajera Shafiq was arraigned Wednesday in Detroit's U.S. District Court on charges of conspiracy to commit female genital mutilation, and aiding in the practice. She was released on bond and placed under house arrest with an electronic tether.
Federal documents say Shafiq attended the cutting of two Minnesota girls in February at a Detroit-area clinic, which authorities allege was performed by Dr. Jumana Nagarwala.
Shafiq's attorney Victoria Burton-Harris says there are no specific allegations and Shafiq didn't perform genital mutilation.
Nagarwala and the clinic's owners also have been charged. Her attorney denies the charges, saying she performed a religious ritual.
They belong to a sect called Dawoodi Bohra.

Jeff Goldblum can officially add jazz musician with a major record deal to his resume. The Jurassic Park and Independence Day star has officially signed with Decca Records and will release his first jazz album later this year. At the present time, there are few details about the album, but we can only assume that it will carry with it the usual amount of calm and cool associated with the 65-year-old performer. Goldblum had this to say about his record deal and forthcoming album.
"I'm so happy to be in cahoots with the wonderful people at Decca, one of the coolest and most prestigious labels of all time.
This whole thing came about as the result of a performance from Jeff Goldblum on The Graham Norton Show last year while promoting Thor: Ragnarok. The actor and musician performed the song Mona Lisa with Gregory Porter and the executives at Universal's Decca Records were so impressed, they flew to Los Angeles in order to meet with him and that meeting resulted in a record deal. Granted, the fact that Goldblum is a popular star doesn't hurt, but it sounds very much like this came about as a result of his musical talent and not just because he's a likable actor. Decca director of A&R Tom Lewis had this to say about Goldblum's forthcoming album in a statement
"As far as I can tell, everyone loves Jeff Goldblum. He's a fantastic jazz pianist, a great band leader and just about the loveliest man in the world. His love of jazz is infectious and whenever he plays he makes you feel very happy. If we can take Jeff's music into people's homes then we will be helping, in our own small way, to make the world a happier place."
Even though he is primarily known as an actor, Jeff Goldblum has been playing piano since he was a kid and started performing publicly in Pittsburgh when he was a teenager. He's also been performing with his own jazz band The Mildred Snitzer Orchestra since the 90s. The band is said to have gotten its name from a lady he knew growing up. Goldblum also plays at and hosts a jazz variety show at the Rockwell Table and Stage in Los Angeles. So jazz is very much a part of who he is and he's finally going to bring that to people in the comfort of their own homes with this new album.
There is currently no word on what the album will be titled or when exactly it will be released, but it's reportedly going to arrive this year. Additionally, we're going to get a taste of Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm this summer in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. All in all, it's turning out to be a big year for him. If you're curious, you can check out the performance of Mona Lisa with Gregory Porter that earned Goldblum this record deal in the first place for yourself below.

Houston Texans coach Bill O'Brien believes his team did right by quarterback Tom Savage.
One day after the starting passer was lost to a scary concussion in a loss to the 49ers, O'Brien told reporters that Houston's medical staff initially cleared Savage to return before the coach asked them to examine him a second time.
Savage left Sunday's 26-16 loss to San Francisco in the second quarter following a crushing blow by 49ers edge rusher Elvis Dumervil. The hit left Savage shaking on the ground -- a disturbing sight caught on video -- but the quarterback briefly returned to the field before leaving for good.
"I figured he got hit, didn't know he got hit, very difficult from where I'm standing to even see he got it. There's no video on the sideline," O'Brien said Monday, per the Houston Chronicle. "With benefit of the video, I never would have allowed the player back in the game and I don't think [trainer] Geoff Kaplan would have let Tom back in the game."
NFL spokesperson Joe Lockhart told reporters during a Monday conference call that the league has initiated a joint investigation with the NFL Players Association into the handling of Savage's concussion.
O'Brien went out his way to defend his handling of the injury, along with the team's, saying: "At no point in my coaching career, have I ever passed the buck. In this case, I'm not passing the buck."
Said O'Brien: "At no point in time in my coaching career, in my 25 years of coaching, I've been at Brown University, I've been at Georgia Tech, I've been at Duke, I've been at the University of Maryland, I've been the head coach at Penn State and I've been the head coach here, at no point in time is there anything more important to me than the safety of our players. I love our players and I care about them and I cannot stand when players get injured. Again with benefit of seeing the video that people are seeing, I would have never put him back in the game."
O'Brien added that he expects backup T.J. Yates to start Sunday against the Jaguars in place of Savage, which comes as no surprise after the punishment Houston's starter took Sunday.

Egypt's highest appellate court yesterday annulled a decision to place more than 1,500 people on the country's official terrorist list, including former president Mohammed Morsi. The Court of Cassation accepted appeals by Morsi and 1,537 other defendants against putting their names on the terrorist list, a judicial source said on condition of anonymity due to restrictions on speaking to media.
Prominent Egyptian football player Mohammed Abu Treika was among those placed on the list. Egyptian authorities accuse the defendants of having links with the Muslim Brotherhood group, which the military-backed authorities declared a terrorist organization in 2013.
Egypt's first-ever freely elected president, Morsi, was ousted and imprisoned by the Egyptian military during a military coup carried out in mid-2013. Morsi has been serving out three lengthy jail terms for allegedly "killing protesters" and "spying" for Qatar. He has also faced charges of "insulting Egypt's judiciary." Like his co-defendants, Morsi maintains that all the charges against him are politically motivated.
Islamabad-Residents are facing severe problems due to acute shortage of water in the Capital Development Authority's (CDA) supply system for the last many weeks.
CDA water tanker supply is also pathetic as residents are compelled to buy private tanker to meet their requirement. A resident of Sector G-10, Kashif Ahmed said, “I have been residing in this sector for last many years but this time we have experienced acute water shortage and receive water supply after about 48 hours.” He was of the view, “Water is considered as the basic amenity of life but I think the civic body is not aware of this fact.”
“Another resident Sana Khan of Sector G-8 said, “Water through CDA's supply pipelines was not coming properly on time, even sometimes it comes at the evening for a short period of time and the flow of water was not up to the mark too.”
The residents of federal capital said they are availing water through private water tankers on heavy payments.
They urged the authorities concerned to improve the water supply system in different sectors including I-9, I-10, G-7, G-8, G-9, G-10, and G-11.
When contacted CDA Director of Water Management said the main reason of acute water shortage supply this year is due to less rainfall during current season. “We were focusing on the maintenance work of water leakage from pipelines and repairing defective walls,” he said.
He said CDA has 33 water tankers out of which 20 were functional.
On the other side water theft is on the rise in the capital city but the authorities seem little interested in providing relief to the residents even at the peak of the summer season.
On June 5, CDA had announced to start an operation against illegal water connections installed on main conduction lines starting from Simly filtration plant but not a single illegal connection has so far been disconnected. According to the sources in the authority, the especially-constituted disconnection squad has not yet conducted a single operation.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's Oval Office style dominated U.S. headlines in 2017, but readers were particularly perplexed by his use of the word “covfefe,” in what turned out to be one of the oddest news stories of the year. A late night Tweet is seen from the personal Twitter account of U.S. President Donald Trump May 31, 2017. The Tweet reads, "Despite the constant negative press covfefe". Donald Trump/Twitter/Handout via REUTERSA tweet by Trump in May read simply: “Despite the constant negative press covfefe.” White House officials batted away questions about what the word meant and even the dictionary company Merriam-Webster drew a blank. Trump left it up to the reader to divine his meaning, with a follow-up: “Who can figure out the true meaning of ‘covfefe' ??? Enjoy!” But he was not alone in leaving readers scratching their heads. Even outside Washington, the year produced a spate of weird news, including odd pranks and poorly considered crimes. Los Angeles residents awoke on New Year's Day to find the four-story white letters of the world-famous “Hollywood” sign had been altered to read: “Hollyweed.” The prank came just two months after California voters approved the recreational use of marijuana despite a federal ban. Austin, Texas, police were tipped off to an illegal brothel when hundreds of condoms clogged a city sewer pipe in March. The blockage at Jade Massage Therapy was the smoking gun that led to the arrest of two people for prostitution and money laundering. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were spared a spine-chilling surprise when a California man was arrested in July for trying to smuggle three highly poisonous king cobra snakes hidden in potato chip canisters. FILE PHOTO: A late night Tweet is seen from the personal Twitter account of U.S. President Donald Trump, May 31, 2017. Donald Trump/Twitter/Handout via REUTERSCrooks had planned the latest haul of snakes in a can after all 20 king cobras in a previous shipment died in transit, authorities said. Back in the political arena, an octogenarian ex-con New Jersey politician revived her burlesque act at a May fundraiser - although she kept her clothes on. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during his visit at the Civil Rights Museum in Jackson, Mississippi, U.S. December 9, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueFormer Jersey City Deputy Mayor Leona Beldini, who is in her early 80s and danced as “Hope Diamond,” performed in a gown and feather boa to raise cash for a non-profit dance company, three years after being released from prison following a bribery conviction. Animal stories also captured the public's attention. Millions watched via webcam as April, a giraffe, gave birth to a 6-foot-tall (1.83-meter) male calf. From around the globe, her fans watched her endure the conclusion of a 16-month pregnancy at Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York - in April, of course. Months earlier, a small moth with a yellowish-white coif of scales was named for then-President-elect Trump, who wears a similar hairstyle, researchers told the scientific journal ZooKeys. The new species of insect, Neopalpa donaldtrumpi, is native to Southern California and Mexico's Baja California, and is likely capable of flying over the proposed border wall with Mexico that was a central promise of Trump's presidential campaign.

EXPAND Helado Negro (Roberto Carlos Lange) Chona Kasinger
There will be a point this coming Thursday night when Helado Negro, the musical alter ego of Roberto Carlos Lange, will kick up a wave of high-pitched sounds off his synthesizer and lead the crowd at the Regent Theater into a chorus about being "young, Latin and proud." The song, which turns 2 years old this summer, continues to serve as an anthem for a generation of Latinos growing up in Trump's America, a development Lange never expected.
“Absolutely, it caught me by surprise,” the multitalented Lange admits over the phone. “The song was made for me and was more of an intimate song. We had a few shows and, kind of the way the world works in trying to get people to know that you have a new show coming up, we thought it would be a good idea to release a new song, and I thought, ‘Oh, this would be a great song for summertime.'"
Lange released "Young, Latin and Proud" just as candidate Trump was calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. “A lot of people have commented to me that they found the song to be somewhat of a reinforcement of an anti-Trump idea," he says. But he insists the song wasn't intended as a response to Trump: “It was just music that I was making that I've always made since day one, since the first record. A lot of my music has been covering the same themes. People pick up on it later in time.”
Lange has written other songs that serve as introspective affirmations of Latino identity. He wrote a love song to his high melanin count on “It's My Brown Skin,” on which he sings, “My brown is the shade that's just for me,” and reminds his listeners of color, “It's your brown skin, it will keep you safe.”
Both “Young, Latin and Proud” and “It's My Brown Skin” are off Lange's latest album, Private Energy, which he rereleased in an expanded version this year, along with a vinyl edition of the album for the first time. The rerelease features remastered versions of his songs as well as remixes and new artwork. Private Energy contains a number of songs in Spanish, as all of Helado Negro's albums have since his 2009 debut, Awe Owe.
Lange was born in South Florida in 1980 to parents originally from Ecuador. He absorbed plenty of artistic, musical and cultural influences from the region along with the heat and humidity. He graduated from Savannah College of Art and Design in 2003, then moved to Brooklyn three years later, where he began creating his unique style of music as Helado Negro, blending electronic, tropical and indie in two languages.
Lange also recently released a new single via Adult Swim titled “Come Be Me.” The track features a thumping bass line with an aquatic feel to it that bounces along under synths and a steel drum or two. It's another intimate song that is certain to resonate in a larger way with his audience.
No other Helado Negro song, however, has come close to the impact of "Young, Latin and Proud," which has become a popular T-shirt as well. Lange remains humble to a fault about both the song's and the shirt's impact in modern culture as well as their creation.
“All these things end up being things made out of either passion or necessity,” he explains. “The song was made out of love for what I do, and it was an inspiration that was based on my own life. The necessity part was, ‘Oh, I should make T-shirts for a tour.' I wasn't sure how many people were going to buy them. I don't have some kind of focus group somewhere, so you just make T-shirts for a tour — and I sold out of all of them my first few shows!
“Obviously, some light bulbs go off and you make more. There isn't a huge amount of financial gain in doing it. It's just nice to have it be something that's consistent and have it on the road for a little cash for gas and food.”
Helado Negro performs at the Regent Theatre on Thursday, Aug. 17, with Jesse Baez and Nancy Sanchez. Tickets and more info.

A judge has denied bond for an Ohio man accused of plowing his car into a crowd at a white nationalist rally.
Judge Robert Downer said during a bond hearing Monday he would appoint a lawyer for James Alex Fields Jr.
Fields is charged with second-degree murder and other counts after authorities say he drove into the crowd, fatally injuring one woman and hurting 19 others.
The rally was held by white nationalists and others who oppose a plan to remove from a Charlottesville park of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.
Fields has been in custody since Saturday.
A high school teacher said Fields was fascinated with Nazism, idolized Adolf Hitler and had been singled out by school officials in the 9th grade for his "deeply held, radical" convictions on race.
Sydney, the Real City That Never Sleeps?
To stick or twist, to do or die, to lay it all down on the roll of a die or the toss of a coin. In essence, gambling is a choice – a chance to win life-changing money, but at the same time understanding that an obsession with lady luck can also have the reverse effect and prove to be harmful. It is these individuals who find it impossible to refrain from even having to make such a decision that consequently find it impossible to overindulge when there's a potential wager lurking in the wings.
In some destinations, this element of thrill juggled alongside a level of risk is systemically embedded into their culture and this is most certainly the case for Macau, Las Vegas and Australia – all undisputed heavyweights of this game. We have taken a closer look at all three of these gambling Everest's and explore what each has to offer the everyday gambler.
Las Vegas, USA
An iconic city synonymous with betting – Las Vegas was undoubtedly the world's premier gambling destination for much of the 20th century. This isolated oasis was built in the middle of a desert and it screams tourism with its glorious scenery and sparking entertainment. The Las Vegas strip is the second most popular attraction in the United States after Times Squares in Manhattan, as well as being home to some of the world's grandest hotels (15 of the world's 25 largest), casinos and amusement parks.
A virtual playground for grown-ups and accessible all-year round – the casino doors are always open and through its premier reputation, Las Vegas has always been able to ride the wave of past recessions.
It continues to draw crowds from around the world with 2016 proving to be a record-breaking year as 42.9million visitors came to be dazzled by the downright theatre and pizzazz. For many in the Western Hemisphere as well as Europe, Las Vegas is still the dream gambling getaway for the money.
Macau, China
Whilst Vegas is sometimes referred to as the ‘Macau of the West', Macau is often labelled the ‘Vegas of Asia'. However, the key difference is that people come to Macau with the sole purpose to gamble – it is seen as an investment and as such the number of sums wagered here is staggering. According to Pokerstars, “gamblers in Macau wagered US$28 billion in 2016, dwarfing the $6.3 billion casino resorts that hug Las Vegas' famous Strip took in bets.”
In comparison to Vegas, the former Portuguese colony received just 30 million tourists in 2016, but it is the extremely high quality of life and rich flow of money that attracts wealthy visitors to Macau – they are solely there to consume and play, although you take note that it is also renowned for its gourmet Chinese cuisine.
Macau does not have the recreational distraction that Vegas offers, but capital surges through its casinos like no other destination on the planet. This is why Las Vegas based gaming companies like MGM have all penetrated Macau's gaming market – when it comes to pure immoderation, luxury and gambling overkill being fuelled to excessive heights, there is no rival to the territory of Macau.
Sydney, Australia
According to statistics, Australia remains the world's leader when it comes to spending on gambling per capita, with a report in 2016 confirming Australians spend 40 per cent more on gambling than any other nationality. Their greatest expenditure is on gaming machines or pokies, with over $9 billion spent – considerably more than any other nation.
With a wealth of choice, it is little wonder why the Aussies ooze a passion for gambling. There are 8 states and territories with gambling facilities in Australia which have 20 legal gambling facilities available in total.
If you want to start your new year in style, then every January there is the Aussie Millions – conveniently scheduled to coincide with the Australian Open which enhances sports betting during this period.
Australia's number one tourist attraction is the Crown Melbourne Casino. It is the biggest and most successful entertainment complex in the Southern Hemisphere, boasting fantastic facilities and entertainment with three hotels, numerous pokies machines and two Gordon Ramsay restaurants just for starters.
If is nostalgia you crave, then ensure you visit Wrest Point Casino in Tasmania – situated on the marvellous Derwent River, it is Australia's longest operating Casino having first opened its doors on February 10, 1973.
Through its history, tropical climate and affinity with risk-taking, Australia is and forever will be a name that allures the gambling hordes to its shores.
The Broadway sensation Hamilton has transcended the stage to become a pop cultural phenomenon, with creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda going from an award-winning playwright and performer to a household name, seemingly overnight. Hamilton has taken home boatloads of awards including 11 Tony Awards and the Pulitzer Prize, with Lin-Manuel Miranda currently filming Mary Poppins Returns for Disney, while also working on the music for Disney's The Little Mermaid reboot. As Hamilton begins its U.S. tour next month in San Francisco, some fans are wondering if there are plans for Hamilton to take over the big screen as well. Lin-Manuel Miranda himself recently teased that the movie will happen, some day.
Hamilton has all but consumed Lin-Manuel Miranda's life for the past few years, as he starred as the title character during the show's off-Broadway run in early 2015, before preparing for the show's leap to Broadway in the summer of 2015, starring as Alexander Hamilton from August 2015 to July 2016 before leaving the cast to pursue other opportunities, such as writing the music and several songs for Disney's hit Moana. During a lengthy conversation with The Hollywood Reporter, Lin-Manel Miranda was asked if there are plans in the works for a Hamilton movie. Here's what he had to say below.
"Yes! Who knows when? I don't think I'm done with that role, by any stretch. It's just a meal of a role. In other shows, maybe you have a part where you get to fall in love, maybe you have a part where you get to fight in a gun duel, maybe you get a part where you get to have an affair, maybe you get a part where you lose a loved one and get to explore all that. In Hamilton, you do all of that! You do everything you do in life in two hours and 45 minutes. You live your fullest life. So that never gets old."
The playwright/performer didn't give any specific timeline for when the movie will happen, but just a few months ago, he released the Hamilton Mixtape, featuring popular recording artists tackling performing Lin-Manuel Miranda's songs from the Broadway sensation. While it has already been on Broadway for a year and a half, it may certainly have a lengthy run on Broadway, given its instant popularity, so there will still be plenty of time for fans who want to see the Broadway musical on the stage to do so before the movie adaptation.
Lin-Manuel Miranda was also recently tapped to write 11 original songs for a new Sony Pictures Animation movie entitled Vivo, which is slated for release in 2020. There are also plans in the works to adapt Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical In the Heights, the playwright's musical that garnered critical acclaim before Hamilton. Lin-Manuel Miranda revealed in this interview that he recently read the first draft of the In the Heights script by Quiara Alegria Hudes, who co-wrote the original play's book with Lin-Manuel Miranda. It may be quite some time before Hamilton hits the big screen, but Lin-Manuel Miranda will certainly be plenty busy between now and then.
ISLAMABAD, Oct 6 (APP): Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N)
Senator Lt Gen (R) Abdul Qayyum Friday said National Action Plan
(NAP) was being implemented and it would eliminate terrorism and
extremism from the country.
Situation of law and order had improved in the country including
peace in Karachi and Balochistan due to concrete measures, he said talking
to PTV.
He said international investors were now taking interest to invest
in Pakistan due to the peaceful environment.
Chinese investment under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)
was also the evidence of suitable atmosphere in the country, he added.
Steps taken under NAP included blockade of unregistered SIMs, action
against misuse of loud speaker, he said, adding action was also taken against hate speeches.
The senator said PML-N had been working on its agenda since
it came into power in 2013 and its major part had been implemented.
He said work on FATA reforms was almost completed while Election
reforms bill had also been passed from the Parliament.
Abdul Qayyum said the government was moving in right direction
and working for the welfare of masses.
"He always had that chip on his shoulder for just the way he played, taking risks going out there and just trying to win," Graham said, adding, "Just knowing and seeing a guy that's been an underdog like him, we can relate to him. I think a lot of guys will open their ears and just be excited to be a part of that."

The cause of a structure fire in Keremeos is under investigation.
Firefighters said they responded to a fruit stand on Kurtz Road at Highway 3 was fully involved when the arrived on scene Sunday night.
Damage to the structure is extensive.
About a dozen firefighters and two fire trucks responded to the blaze.
There were no injuries.
Arturs Irbe, the Little Latvian who would be one of the few constants during the Canucks' chaotic 1997-98 season, is set to be honoured by his homeland's hockey federation.
Before the Latvian national squad plays a game Thursday in Riga against the visiting Swiss, Irbe's number 1 will be hoisted to the rafters in a retirement ceremony.
Irbe's lone season in Vancouver saw the firings of coach Tom Renney and president Pat Quinn, the arrival of Mike Keenan as coach, the supplanting of Trevor Linden as captain by Mark Messier and more than a dozen trades.
Five goalies played for the Canucks that season — Kirk McLean, Garth Snow, Sean Burke and Corey Hirsch were the others — Irbe was the only one to play the season from start to finish.
Irbe was signed in the off-season because the Canucks were worried about McLean's health after he'd struggled with injuries the season before and about Hirsch, who revealed in 2017 about the mental health battles he was going through at the time.
After a training camp where many observers felt Irbe — nicknamed Archie by his teammates — had been third-best, he still won the goalie job over Hirsch, who was placed on waivers and eventually assigned to AHL Syracuse.
“After I was placed on waivers, I came in to the rink to pick up my equipment,” Hirsch recalled. “Archie pulled me aside and said ‘Corey, I'm sorry.'”
“I told him that's how it goes, it was no big deal. He's just a really nice man.”
In any era where goalies were famed to try every trick in the book to either bend or break the rules, Hirsch said Irbe was no different.
Listed at 5-foot-8, Irbe was famed for wearing big white leg pads which seemed to touch his ears.
“I remember he has sewn a ropes system into his pads that he could pull to make the pads smaller when they were being measured (by NHL officials).”
Irbe, now 51, played 13 years in the NHL, first with the San Jose Sharks and Dallas Stars before his Vancouver stopover. He signed with the Carolina Hurricanes in the summer of 1998 and went on to play for six seasons there. He backstopped the Hurricanes to the Stanley Cup final in 2002, where the Canes lost the series 4-1 to the Red Wings.
His final two North American seasons — 2002-03 and 2003-04 — saw him play a diminished role with Carolina and both seasons featured stints in the minors as Irbe was supplanted as the Hurricanes' number one goalie by another ex-Canuck: Kevin Weekes.
Irbe sat out the 2004-05 NHL lockout season, then played two more seasons in Europe, first with Salzburg in Austria an then with Nitra in Slovakia.
After officially retiring in 2008, he became a goalie coach, first with Dinamo Riga and then with the Washington Capitals from 2009 to 2011 and the Buffalo Sabres in 2014-15.
He's back in Latvia, working with the goalies for Kurbads.
He played 64 games for Latvia in all, including nine times at the world championships and twice at the Olympics. He also played for the Soviet national team in 1989 and 1990.
In 2010, Irbe was admitted to the International Hockey Federation Hall of Fame. He'll be the third player to have his number retired by the Latvian Hockey Federation after Helmuts Balderis (No. 19) and Kārlis Skrastins (No. 7).

You're not alone if you think Metro Vancouver's allergy season has been worse than usual this year.
Allergy season came late this year, thanks to a seemingly endless winter that led to more mould and late blooming, according to Dr. Donald Stark with the University of British Columbia.
“Instead of all the pollen coming out when the weather is optimal — nice, warm sunny weather earlier in the season and all that pollination gets done in a hurry — this year it's being dragged out as the weather waxes and wanes,” he said.
The pollen hit allergy sufferers hard when it finally arrived.
“Often people with allergies don't realize how much it impairs their ability to function optimally, so you have difficulty learning, you're falling asleep at work or in school just because you don't get restful sleep to start with plus you're probably taking antihistamines, which are sedating,” Stark said.
Stark said allergies are on the rise around the developed world because the places people live in are too clean, in a sense.
“It's the hygiene hypothesis where we're letting our children grow up in a much too clean environment,” he said.
“They need to go out and get some dirt in their system to provoke an appropriate immune response and prevent allergies from developing.”

EXPAND Greg Bechtel of Simmzy's Burbank Jeff Berting Photography
Greg Bechtel is a former bartender, a partner in the new brewery at Simmzy's Burbank and L.A.'s only Advanced Cicerone. What is an Advanced Cicerone, you might ask? It's the third level in the Cicerone certification program, a beer education and certification process similar to the Court of Master Sommelier distinctions for wine professionals.
Bechtel and his team, including new head brewer Brian Herbertson (of Wicks Brewing Co.) have recently launched the first three beers of the Burbank brewery's lineup, just in time for L.A. Beer Week. To mark the occasion of the city's weeklong beer celebration, Bechtel lead us on a tour of his favorite places to drink beer in Los Angeles — and provides a guide to what you should eat as well.
EXPAND Beef and goat birria at Sausal Andrea Bricco
7. Sausal
"At Sausal they curate a beer list that focuses on great examples of classic styles while giving a nod to the local scene. I often order a local IPA like the Three Weavers Expatriate and am sure to check out their Cicerone Stash of bottles. Fun stuff to be drank! They do an awesome job of elevating old-school, California rancho-style cooking with fresh, local ingredients. Expect lots of wood-fire cooking and roasting. I love stopping in for some tacos and a pint at lunch. My favorite is the beef brisket barbacoa." 219 Main St., El Segundo; (310) 322-2721, sausal.com.
6. Bottle Room
"The Bottle Room's draft list focuses on great local one-offs and hoppy beer and is always well selected. Last time I was there I enjoyed some Eagle Rock Brewery Tarte Noir. I am usually eyeing up their sour beer selection or asking the bartender what's fresh and hoppy. They do some killer burgers, but I like the smaller bites like the pork belly tostadas or the house pastrami poutine with a side order of Tony tots." 6741 Greenleaf Ave., Whittier; (562) 696-8000, thebottleroombar.com.
EXPAND Charcuterie at Bestia Anne Fishbein
5. Bestia
"The beer selection at Bestia is small and L.A.-focused. I love drinking a snappy Citra Pale from ESBC, or Smog City's Sabre Tooth Squirrel if I'm in the mood for a slightly darker malt profile. Bestia's pasta is great, but their charcuterie is my favorite, along with an order of marrow bone." 2121 E. Seventh Place, downtown. (213) 514-5724; bestiala.com.
4. Playground
"The list at Playground always has some awesome stuff from local OC breweries, like the Jack Handy IPA from Chapman Crafted. Be sure to check out their bottle list as well. Lots of amazing sour beer to be had. I love the Wagyu tri-tip and pan roasted wild mushrooms." 220 E. Fourth St., Santa Ana; (714) 560-4444, playgrounddtsa.com.
EXPAND L&E Oyster Bar Anne Fishbein
3. L&E Oyster Bar
"Their beer list has a great balance of seafood-friendly styles. I'm also a big fan of the IPA's from Highland Park Brewing that are frequently on the menu, like their Bonkers IPA. I love a great raw bar. I like to start with a stout and some oysters then finish it up with their awesome lobster roll." 1637 Silver Lake Blvd., Silver Lake; (323) 660-2255, leoysterbar.com.
2. Mediterraneo
"This is my local spot for tapas and happy hour. The draft list is a wide selection that covers a lot of bases. Since I'm usually there on the early side, I like to order something sour or light like a Craftsman Sourdough. I usually order up a bunch of smaller bites and some charcuterie and cheese. Chorizo Bilbao and the roasted red pepper and feta dip are some of my regulars." 73 Pier Ave., Hermosa Beach; (310) 318-2666, themedhb.com.
Beer Belly LA Weekly
1. Beer Belly
"The beer list is always moving at Beer Belly and has a variety of things to fit any mood you are in. I can always rely on some awesome local IPA's on tap, like the Mumford Brewing Thrd Term or Beachwood Brewing Citraholic. Perfect to cut through the fat of those fries. The duck fat fries topped with duck confit is something I have to order. If I have any room after that it goes to the grilled cheese or one of their burgers." 532 S. Western Ave., Koreatown; (213) 387-2337, beerbellyla.com.

NEW YORK (AP) – Banks and energy companies surged Wednesday and smaller companies made huge gains as stocks got back almost all the ground they lost the day before. Investors reversed course as they hoped Italy would be able to avoid a new round of elections after all.
Financial companies rallied as bond yields turned higher and energy companies rose along with U.S. crude oil, which busted out of a five-day losing streak. The shift came after Carlo Cottarelli, nominated to be Italy's next prime minister, said there were “new possibilities” to form a government.
Stocks had plunged the previous day as investors expected gridlock to be resolved with new elections that could have turned into a yes-or-no referendum deciding whether Italy would continue to use the euro.
The S&P 500 index jumped 34.15 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,724.01. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 306.33 points, or 1.3 percent, to 24,667.78. The Nasdaq composite gained 65.86 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,462.45.
While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recovered Tuesday's losses and then some, smaller and more U.S.-focused companies did ever better as investors continued to worry about trade. Small companies finished with minor losses Tuesday, and on Wednesday they made even bigger gains than larger multinationals did. The Russell 2000 index surged 24.34 points, or 1.5 percent, and closed at a record high of 1,647.99.
The Chinese government criticized the U.S., which had renewed a threat to raise duties on some imports from China. At the same time, officials from the U.S. and European Union held talks on the tariffs the Trump administration has proposed on European steel and aluminum.
Italy's FTSE MIB stock index climbed 2.1 percent after a 2.7 percent drop a day earlier. Prices for Italian government bonds also rose, sending yields down following a huge surge the day before.
The euro rose to $1.1648 from $1.1531, which was its lowest level in almost a year. The dollar rose to 108.85 yen from 108.24 yen.
Germany's DAX climbed 0.9 percent while the FTSE 100 index in Britain rose 0.7 percent. The CAC 40 in France lost 0.2 percent.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.84 percent from 2.79 percent. Interest rates rose and bank stocks recovered about half of their losses from Tuesday. When rates rise, banks can make more money on mortgages and other types of loans.
Energy companies rose as U.S. crude oil climbed 2.2 percent to $68.21 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 2.8 percent to $77.50 a barrel in London.
Exxon Mobil rose 3.9 percent to $81.50. that was its biggest one-day gain since September 2016.
Oil prices fell 7.6 percent in five days following reports OPEC countries and Russia might start producing more oils soon. Those countries cut production at the start of 2017, which helped take U.S. crude from about $50 a barrel in late 2016 to more than $70 this month. They had agreed to keep production at its current levels until the end of this year, but upheaval in Venezuela and new sanctions on Iran could change their plans.
Gold rose 0.2 percent to $1,301.50 an ounce. Silver added 1 percent to $16.54 an ounce. Copper gained 0.2 percent to $3.07 a pound.

The B.C.-based whistleblower at the centre of a massive data-mining operation that targeted millions of Facebook users ahead of the 2016 U.S. election may have been involved in a similar operation during the lead-up to the Brexit vote — which also involved a tiny B.C. firm.
Christopher Wylie, the 28-year-old data scientist who blew the lid on years of data-harvesting practices by Cambridge Analytica, has also been connected to a small Victoria-based data company called AggregateIQ, which received close to £4 million from the Vote Leave campaign, the main voice calling on the U.K to leave the European Union in 2016.
AggregateIQ is currently at the centre of investigations being led by both the U.K. Information Commissioner's Office and the B.C. Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner, who confirmed their probes in December.

On Monday, the B.C. OIPC confirmed the investigation is ongoing.
“The OIPC is investigating whether AggregateIQ is in compliance with the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA),” the office said in a statement, adding it can't provide specific details on the “active” investigation.
“Our investigations generally result in findings and recommendations, but in some cases, we will issue a legally binding order. In terms of penalties, an organization that commits an offence under [PIPA] is liable to a fine of up to $100,000,” the statement concluded.

On March 6, U.K. information commissioner Elizabeth Denham told the British parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee that a report on the investigation, which also looks at several other companies involved in swaying opinions during the Brexit referendum, is expected to be released by the end of May.
Denham was B.C.'s privacy commissioner before taking her post in the U.K.
AggregateIQ did not respond to requests for comment.
Who is Christopher Wylie?
Global News was unable to speak to Wylie, but an exhaustive profile in the Guardian sheds some light on his past in Canada.
Wylie, who describes himself as gay and a vegan, grew up in B.C., although where exactly he calls home is unknown.
At the age of six, he told the paper, he was abused by a mentally unstable person while at school, which led to a long court battle after the school attempted to cover up the incident.

As a teenager, he was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia, and was a victim of bullying. He successfully sued the B.C. Ministry of Education to get the province's inclusion policies around bullying changed, eventually leaving school altogether at 16 without a single qualification.
But he was able to land a job with the federal Liberal Party a year later, eventually working in the office of then-party leader Stephane Dion, who was also the leader of the Opposition in Parliament.
READ MORE: Facebook data scandal: Canadian whistleblower was axed by Liberals over data harvesting ideas
It was there that he began to formulate strategies on how politicians could capitalize on data collected through social media — the same strategies that would form the basis of the operations conducted by Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ.
A former senior Liberal insider who spoke on condition of anonymity said Wylie pitched the idea to the office, which had since been taken over by Michael Ignatieff, but that the Liberals wanted nothing to do with it, calling his approach too invasive.
The source, who joined several other former co-workers and people who knew Wylie in describing him as “whip-smart,” said the idea played a significant part in Wylie losing his job in the office in 2009.
WATCH BELOW: Canada's privacy laws must cover political parties: former privacy commissioner
Several other senior Liberal officials who worked in the office during that time told The Canadian Press that they don't remember Wylie, and those who did only have vague recollections of him working there.
“I vaguely recall him,” wrote one former senior official in an email on Sunday. “I think that he was a summer intern.”
Another former senior Liberal, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he asked former colleagues on Sunday, and some people remembered Wylie. They say he was “pretty junior” and worked in the data strategy and communications space.
READ MORE: Donald Trump consultants used private info from 50 million Facebook users
A federal Liberal spokesperson said in a statement that protecting the information of Canadians is a “foremost priority,” and insisted that the party doesn't sell information under any circumstances.
Facebook, which says it found out about the data operation in 2015, has since blocked Wylie and Cambridge Analytica from the social media platform as it investigates the operation. Cambridge Analytica has denied any wrongdoing.

They told me not to film them & to move on, both “requests” which I ignored & got into a heated argument with one of them: the young lady among them (2nd picture left) intervened & separated us.
Left or right, carrying an assault weapon in public is an act of terrorism as far as I'm concerned.
I'm amazed that somebody didn't start firing, which would have made the murder by car episode seem trivial by comparison.

WATERLOO REGION — Two Waterloo Region boosters are showing their love for the local food scene by creating an online food show.
Restaurateur Nick Benninger, 39, and filmmaker Taylor Jackson, 32, are just two months away from launching, "Nick and Taylor Make a Food Show."
In eight or so episodes, to be posted online weekly as of April 5, the two showcase some of their favourite spots for grub in the region.
"Taylor came up with the original body of it, which is to be half comedians in cars and half Anthony Bourdain show — and zero per cent Guy Fieri," Benninger said with a laugh, referring to the hosts of separate television programs.
Each episode begins with the two piled in the front seat of Benninger's pickup truck. They introduce the restaurant they are headed to and discuss what makes it a fixture in the community.
At the restaurants they chat with employees and chefs and enjoy a meal with some good conversation.
The discussion "is always more about their place in the community, what they think about the community (and) what makes this place special," said Benninger, who owns four restaurants in the region, including Harmony Lunch and Nick and Nat's Uptown 21.
"It's not meant to be a, 'Go to this place and eat that food show,' it's meant to be (a) get to know the people who you probably already support."
Benninger and Jackson hope the project will increase awareness of the region's food scene, which they believe is underplayed.
"There's a huge amount of coverage in the local area about tech and about the downtown core and things like that," said Jackson, adding that it's time to boost the image of the talented people in the food industry.

ROXANA — The Civic Memorial Eagles started the Class 3A Roxana Regional the way they were supposed to — with a 71-31 win over Cahokia — but it didn't come without a cost.
CM freshman Anna Hall got caught in a scrum going after a loose ball at the 6:22 mark of the second quarter and crashed to the floor. As she began to rise, she grabbed her neck and went back to the floor.
After an extended delay in the game, Hall was transported off the floor via a backboard while wearing a neck brace. She was taken to St. Louis Children's Hospital for precautionary measures.
“Basketball is secondary tonight,” Eagles' head coach Jonathan Denney said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Anna Hall and I'm probably headed over there after we watch this game. I want to make sure she's alright. She's a big part of our team, probably our best defensive player on the post. She's had a really good season as a freshman and I just hope it's precautionary and she's able to get back with us down the road.”
CM senior Allie Troeckler, who poured in a game-high 30 points to go with 11 rebounds, 5 steals and 3 assists, said it was troubling to see Hall motionless on the floor. It's something she'd never dealt with in her career before Tuesday.
“In all my years of playing basketball, I've never had anything like that happen,” Troeckler said. “All of us were concerned for her, but we needed to go out and play the game for her.”
With the win the Eagles improved to 28-2 and will continue their season at 7 p.m. Thursday vs. Triad in the Roxana Regional championship game. The Knights defeated the Jersey Panthers 37-24 in the late semifinal game Tuesday in Roxana.
Prior to Hall's injury CM was floundering in its postseason debut. The Eagles only owned a 4-3 lead after the first quarter and were up just 10-5 when Hall went down.
Troeckler found herself on the bench for much of the first quarter when Denney pulled her for what he thought was lackadaisical play.
“The energy was terrible at the beginning of the game,” Troeckler said. “Me especially, and being a leader on the team when my energy is low the team doesn't have my energy to feed off of and that made a big difference. We were able to pick it up come the second quarter.”
After the long injury delay the Eagles came back reenergized. Junior Kaylee Eaton thought the stoppage in play got CM refocused.
“When (Hall) was lying there we were all hoping she was OK, but then we had to focus on our own game and we had other people step up and make sure we played for her and played as a team,” Eaton said.
The Eagles churned out a 16-4 run when they returned to action, extending their lead from 10-5 to 26-9 and never looked back.
Troeckler was a big part of that surge. She scored 16 of her 30 points in the second quarter. Eaton chipped in with a couple of 3-pointers along the way too and Hannah Schmidt and Tori Pfeifer provided spark off of the bench with free throws and solid rebounding and defense.
“I told the girls, ‘There's going to be a time where we're going to be challenged with some adversity and we've got it first hand here,'” Denney said. “We didn't come out ready to play. I thought we were kind of sluggish and careless with the basketball and unfortunately it was Allie Troeckler that kind of set that tone early with a couple of non-challant passes and it was time for her to sit. I was hoping maybe what happened happened. I was hoping it would get her mad a little bit and I think she played pretty darn good after that.”
CM also played stingy defense in the second quarter, forcing the Comanches to cough it up 12 times in the frame and carried a comfortable 33-15 lead into the locker room.
The Eagles kept that rolling in the third quarter, ballooning their lead to 55-21 entering the fourth and turning Cahokia over 9 more times. The Comanches had 31 turnovers overall in the game.
CM coughed it up 22 times itself. The Eagles understand they can't have lapses on the court like they did Tuesday as they move deeper into the playoffs. It will get much harder to recover.
“Coach talked to us about it and he said we won't make it far if we do that,” Eaton said. She finished with 12 points on Tuesday to complement Troeckler. “We all know that, but we all need to get it through our heads.”
CM will be looking for its fifth consecutive regional championship when it takes the court Thursday against Triad. The Eagles defeated the Knights by a combined 48 points in their two previous meetings this season.

The Nashville Predators won their first-round series in six games. They will face the wily Winnipeg Jets in the second-round in what promises to be a well-watched series. Preds fans, many of whom live in a non-traditional hockey market, have been lauded for taking to the game and they nearly broke the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd at an indoor sporting event. But, let's be honest. The Preds chants are boring, uninspired, and don't represent Nashville, known as Music City.
Hear me out.
Nashville Predators are Contenders
Let's get a few things straight. The Predators are legitimate contenders. They are exciting to watch and have depth where it counts. Full disclosure: they are my prediction to win the 2018 Stanley Cup. It is exciting to see hockey do so well in Nashville and fans get amped up about the team and the sport.
Preds fans have revived the odd hockey tradition of throwing sea life; in Nashville, they toss catfish onto the ice. They also have another tradition. It's loud and it's relentless. Preds fans love to heckle the opposing team – en masse. There are a number of chants that have gained some notoriety including:
“He shoots, he scores, you suck!”
“It's all your fault! It's all your fault!”
“We're gonna beat the hell outta of you, you, you.”
“He sucks! He sucks, too!”
The chant you will hear most often, however, occurs after the Preds score a goal. If you don't know it, here is an example. When the Preds played the Pens last year, it went like this:
“Murray, Murray, Murray. You Suck…It's all your fault! It's all your fault!”
Breaking Down the Chant Chants are fun. Getting folks together in a communal celebration of your team is great. Can we agree though, that some chants are better than others? Let's break it down. “He shoots, he scores, you suck!” If a goal was scored, a player definitely shot and definitely scored. We are all good there. The problem is, I am not convinced it was because the goalie “sucked.” Matt Murray who beat the Predators last year to win the Stanley Cup didn't and doesn't suck. Letting in one goal doesn't say much. Bad goalies have good nights, and good goalies have bad nights. No goalie who is playing in the NHL sucks. Even this Beer League goalie rose to the challenge. “It's all your fault! It's all your fault!” Again, mercilessly heckling the opposing team like 17,000 schoolyard bullies IS fun, I guess. The problem is the basic accuracy of this chant. Very few goals scored in the NHL and especially in the NHL playoffs are the goalie's “fault.” Goals are scored off screens that block the goalie's view or deflections and tips that change the direction of the puck at the last minute. Goals get behind the netminder after they bounce in off defensemen or are scored off rushes in which a goalie's teammates let them down. Is a breakaway goal, which is the result of poor defensive play in the neutral zone, the goalie's fault?
Sure, some goals are the goalie's fault. The problem is that this chant happens either way. It's fake news.
Music City Deserves Better
Nashville is built on music and is a common thread connecting the life and soul of the city to its people. Music has been described as a fundamental pattern in its “…cultural, business and social fabric.” From fiddle tunes and buck dancing in the 1700s to the Fisk Jubilee Singers in the 1800s, music has a long history in Nashville. In 1925, the establishment of radio station WSM and its launch of the broadcast that would be called the Grand Ole Opry secured Nashville's reputation as a creative, music-filled city.
Live music can be seen and heard every day and night of the week in Nashville. The world-famous honky tonks on Broadway offer free live music 365 days a year. Last year, P.K. Subban had fun singing some Johnny Cash at the famed Tootsie's Orchid Lounge. In Nashville, music is written, recorded and performed every single day. Music city deserves better than pathetic chants, whether they are shouted in unison or not.
Three Better Options
Steal from Your Opponent
While not technically a chant, one idea is to steal the Super Mario mushroom sound effect. As some fans know, after the Colorado Avalanche successfully kill a penalty, that is what you hear at the Pepsi Center. It's a great idea. What better way to mock the team you beat in the first round than to steal their sound effects?
Ok I see you Colorado @Avalanche with the Super Mario Mushroom sound effect after a penalty kill. Well played. pic.twitter.com/BmN6G1zk6a — Tim Williams (@realtimwilliams) December 19, 2017
Get Creative
Fans need more than sound effects though. Here's one idea: get creative. Game of Thrones will finish its run next year as the biggest and most popular show in the world. An average of more than 23 million Americans watched each episode last season. In one memorable scene in Season 5, Queen Cersei is forced to complete a walk of atonement. Stripped of her clothing, she is made to walk from the Great Sept of Baelor to the Red Keep, escorted by members of the Faith Militant. As she walks, Septa Unella accompanies her, repeatedly crying out “Shame!” and ringing a bell to attract people's attention.
Preds fans should adopt this when their team draws a penalty. Imagine it, as the opposing team's player makes his way to the penalty box, 17, 000 fans yell “shame, shame, shame” in unison. Short, sweet, and mean. It is a crossover chant that has already been used for other purposes. Get on it, Preds fans.
Look At History
Finally, instead of being negative with the “you suck” stuff, it would be great to see Preds fans get happy. What better way to honor music city than to engage in a song when the home team scores? What should they sing? When in doubt, look to your history, Nashville. What if you used all that fan energy toward celebrating your state. Lots of tunes could be used, but Rocky Top is a great tune and my pick for the Preds' postseason. Recorded first by the Osborne Brother, it has been covered by the Everly Brothers, Lynn Anderson, and even Phish. Yes, Vermont jam band Phish.
Preds fans can and should do better as they cheer their team during what many hopes is a deep playoff run. As great a story as hockey in Nashville has been these last couple of years, fans need to step up their chant game. Here's the chorus to Rocky Top. It should be played and sung loudly and proudly when the Preds score.
Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top

Given his phenomenal success with both The Simpsons and Futurama, the release of a new animated show from Matt Groening is understandably cause for considerable excitement. Fans won't have to wait too much longer to find out if he has another hit on his hands either as it was recently confirmed that the first 10 episodes of Groening's latest venture Disenchantment will arrive on Netflix on August 17th.
Disenchantment will not only be Groening's first foray into producing content for a streaming service, but also his first attempt at a show aimed at an adult audience. Given the track record of both his previous work and Netflix's previous animated output however, the stage is certainly set for Disenchantment to be a considerable success.
Netflix's Track Record
The incomparable Bojack Horseman.(Netflix) More
Netflix has delivered an impressively diverse array of original programming in recent years. However, one of its greatest successes has been in the field of adult-oriented animation.
At the forefront of course is Bojack Horseman, a bona fide masterpiece which has long since transcended from being a mere animated comedy to something far more complex. It's a comedy, a drama and a haunting character study all combined into one unique package that managed to be incredibly witty and unapologetically silly in equal measure. With Bojack, Netflix showed that not only could it compete with the conventional heavy-hitters of the animated comedy world, but it could also add in deep psychological ponderings and genuine emotional heft to take things to another level.
Netflix's other animated offerings have also been well worth a watch too. Big Mouth for example is a crude but clever coming-of-age offering from Nick Kroll and Andrew Goldberg dealing with the awkwardness of adolescence. F is For Family meanwhile is an underrated animated sitcom courtesy of comedian Bill Burr. The show tackles suburban family life in the 1970s and while proudly profane and frequently un-pc, it also has a lot of heart and surprisingly nuanced take on gender equality, masculinity and parenting in general.

Coupled with these three original series, the service has also championed firm favourites from elsewhere, such as Archer and Rick and Morty, both of which are hugely successful and innovative shows which continue to garner huge cult followings. In other words, Netflix's track record with adult-orientated animation is second to none and there's no reason to doubt that they will once again strike gold with Groening's new show.
Disenchantment: What to expect?
Another still from Disenchantment. (Netflix) More
Disenchantment may not land for a few months yet, but it certainly looks like an intriguing prospect. While obviously some of the finer details are still under-wraps, the key characters and the general premise have now been confirmed.
According to the official synopsis:
“In Disenchantment, viewers will be whisked away to the crumbling medieval kingdom of Dreamland, where they will follow the misadventures of hard-drinking young princess Bean, her feisty elf companion Elfo and her personal demon Luci. Along the way, the oddball trio will encounter ogres, sprites, harpies, imps, trolls, walruses and lots of human fools.”

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP)  A man is charged with making harassing phone calls to the Miami Beach Police Department and posting expletive-laced threats against officers in an online law enforcement bulletin board.
The Miami Herald (http://hrld.us/2kNEQ9W ) reports 54-year-old Ricky Weinberger was charged with threatening law enforcement and harassment during a hearing on Monday. He was booked into jail Saturday.
Authorities told the judge that police found 16 guns and 4,500 rounds of ammunition inside Weinberger's apartment.
Miami Beach police spokesman Ernesto Rodriguez says the department believes they "potentially averted a catastrophic crisis."

An arrest report says the agency's lawyer asked Weinberger to stop making threats, to no avail. A judge also ordered him to stop. But in January he began posting on LeoAffairs.com, a non-official website for individual police departments.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Four suspected members of the notoriously violent MS-13 gang went on trial on Thursday after a federal judge in Boston denied a request to delay the case to ensure that critical remarks made by President Donald Trump this week did not prejudice jurors.
During his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Trump referred to the gang as “savage” and said that two teenage girls in New York state whose parents were in attendance were “brutally murdered” by the gang's members.
Federal prosecutors allege that Herzzon Sandoval and Edwin Guzman were leaders of a Massachusetts-based MS-13 “clique” called Eastside Loco Salvatrucha. They are charged with racketeering conspiracy along with Cesar Martinez and Erick Argueta Larios.
Thursday's opening statements took place two days after Trump sharply condemned MS-13 in his speech to Congress. The White House blames the gang's existence mostly on illegal immigration from Central America.
MS-13, which started in Los Angeles in the 1980s, has since grown into a cross-border criminal organization with leadership in El Salvador that has 30,000 members worldwide and 10,000 in the United States, the U.S. Justice Department says.
Trump during Tuesday's address called on Congress to close “deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country.”
In a motion, Sandoval's lawyers argued the trial should be delayed to March to allow the impact of Trump's remarks to dissipate. But U.S. District Judge Dennis Saylor denied the request on Wednesday.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelly Lawrence on Thursday told jurors Sandoval and his co-defendants were “fully committed to MS-13,” a group that promoted using violence to eliminate rivals and to instill fear.
“Put simply, MS-13 is about violence,” Lawrence said in her opening statement.
She said the clique, which operated in Chelsea, Everett, and elsewhere in greater Boston, thought it was owed respect for murders and violence it committed in the past but by 2015 was on “shaky ground” with MS-13's leadership in El Salvador.
Facing pressure, the clique sought to “breathe new life” into their organization by recruiting a new member who had recently killed a 15-year-old boy, Lawrence said.
Defense lawyers questioned the motivations of the prosecution's cooperating witnesses and said that, despite recordings of the group's meetings, no evidence existed that their clients conspired to commit murders or robberies.
“There is no credibly believable evidence that Mr. Sandoval personally committed any of these crimes,” Martin Murphy, one of his lawyers, said.
The Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers Union (JNUTA) on Monday gave a call for a three-day strike following a General Body Meeting against the administration's forming a committee to frame conduct and disciplinary service rules.In a statement released by JNUTA, the organisation said it had noted the attempt by the administration to impose CCS (Central Civil Services) /CCA (Classification Control and Appeal) Rules on teachers and administrative staff in the name of Code of Conduct.“The GBM condemns this move as an attack on academic autonomy, pedagogical freedom and an attempt at repression of dissent. The GBM demands that there should be no incorporation of CCS/CCA rules on faculty members in JNU,” the statement said.Accusing the administration of imposing CCS/CCA Rules on faculty members and administrative employees of JNU by appointing a committee comprising only nominated members, JNUTA said it is going on a ‘satyagrah' against the move.Apart from the three-day strike, JNUTA is organising a “Save JNU” protest march, hunger strike till Wednesday and press conferences as a part of a multi-pronged approach. They will also approach MPs, the UGC chairperson, the Minister of Human Resources Prakash Javadekar and others to intervene in order to address “the increasingly alarming situation on campus".The organisation is also planning public mobilization including invoking the support of FEDCUTA, AIFUCTO, intellectuals and civil society representatives along with a signature campaign from JNU alumni and academia across India and abroad to support a “Save JNU” campaign.JNUTA appealed to ‘faculty colleagues” to refuse administration's offer of chairperson ship/deanship in solidarity with those whose chairpersonships/deanships were arbitrarily terminated“If demands are not met by Wednesday evening based on the resolution… future course of action to step up the struggle will be chalked out by the JNUTA leadership," the statement said.JNU VC M Jagadeesh Kumar formed the committee to make suitable recommendations for framing regulations for conduct, disciplinary service rules for teaching and non-teaching employees of the university for consideration of the Executive Council by a circular dated March 6 2018. The committee will look into areas where the university statutes, rules, regulations are silent. “The university will open to make its own rules in these matters from time to time,” the circular said.The Committee of 14 members was formed with professor SC Garkoti, rector, as the chairperson. It is expected to submit its recommendations to the VC within the four weeks of the notification.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP President Tony James said on Thursday the future of the Thomson Reuters Financial and Risk business is in selling data, not in selling terminal desktop products to traders, bankers and investors.
“We're big believers in data and that's certainly a driver behind the Thomson Reuters business,” James said in a call with analysts after Blackstone's fourth-quarter earnings, when asked how the firm was looking at opportunities in data technology and how it might expand its expertise in that area.
“The most valuable part of that business by far is the data part. The terminals are the legacy business for which people think of them but that's not where the future of that company is,” said James, without giving any further details.
Blackstone this week agreed to buy a majority stake in Thomson Reuters Corp's F&R division, putting the U.S. private equity firm at the heart of Wall Street's financial information industry, where Thomson Reuters competes against privately-held Bloomberg in providing bankers and investors with news, data and analytics.
In an interview after Reuters published James' comments, Martin Brand, the Blackstone executive who led the acquisition of the Thomson Reuters F&R unit, said that Blackstone wanted to improve all parts of that business, including the Eikon platform, F&R's flagship desktop product.
“The data feeds are faster growing. At the same time, we're fully committed to investing significantly behind Eikon and view it as a business we're excited about,” he said.
Reuters News will remain a unit of Thomson Reuters Corp.
WOODBRIDGE, Va. -- Washington Nationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg struck out five and allowed three hits and one walk in a rehab start for the Class A Potomac Nationals.
Facing the Salem Red Sox, Strasburg showcased good command of his fastball and good movement on his curveball as he allowed one earned run.
The plan was for Strasburg to throw about 75 pitches in five innings.
Strasburg has been on the disabled list with a nerve impingement in his right elbow since July 27. He left two innings into his last start on July 23 at Arizona and has been working to get back since.
The 29-year-old is 10-3 with a 3.25 ERA and 141 strikeouts in 20 games this season.

TOKYO U.S. stock futures dipped and Asian shares were on the defensive on Thursday after a media report that U.S. President Donald Trump is being investigated by a special counsel for possible obstruction of justice.Investors' appetite for riskier assets was also dampened by soft U.S. data and after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected and gave its first clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2-trillion bond portfolio.Weak inflation readings, in particular, cast doubt on the Fed's view that the economy is continuing to strengthen.S&P mini futures dipped 0.2 percent in early Asian trade after the Washington Post reported that Trump is being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible obstruction of justice.Mueller is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Trump's legal team denounced the report.The news came just after the No. 3 Republican in the House of Representatives, Steve Scalise, was shot by a gunman angry with Trump and other Republicans. Scalise was listed in critical condition.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.1 percent while Japan's Nikkei fell 0.4 percent.Asian markets were also waiting to see if China's central bank would follow the Fed with another round of money market rate increases, as it did in March. But traders were divided over the possibility, with some analysts noting the yuan is in better than a few months ago while liquidity in China has already been tightening.
The U.S. dollar bounced back from seven-month low against a basket of currencies after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and gave a first clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2-trillion portfolio of bonds.Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the process could start "relatively soon", while projections of Federal Reserve Board members also showed they expect one more rate hike by the end of year.Yet the Fed's decision was over-shadowed by surprisingly weak U.S. economic data released before the rate announcement.Consumer prices unexpectedly fell on month in May and the annual increase in core CPI slipped to 1.7 percent, the smallest rise since May 2015, after advancing 1.9 percent in April.Retail sales fell 0.3 percent last month -- the largest fall since January 2016 and way below economists' expectations for a 0.1 percent gain -- amid declining purchases of motor vehicles and discretionary spending.
The data had knocked the dollar and U.S. bond yields to its lowest level in seven months against a basket of currencies. The dollar index had fallen to as low as 96.323 on Wednesday, having shed nearly six percent on the year, before bouncing back a tad on the Fed's policy tightening.The euro traded at $1.1210, after having hit a seven-month high of $1.1296.The dollar fetched 109.35 yen, not far from Wednesday's eight-week low of 108.81 yen.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield had slipped to as low as 2.103 percent and last stood at 2.129 percent."You cannot help the impression that there is a gap between the Fed's bullish inflation forecast and the weakness in actual data," said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank."The Fed seems to think the weakness is temporary. But that view will be tested in coming months," he added.Money market instruments such as Fed fund futures show market players see the likelihood of one more rate hike this year as less than 50 percent.Crude oil prices were listless after having slumped nearly 4 percent to their lowest close in seven months on Wednesday, on an unexpected large build in gasoline inventories.Brent crude futures slipped another 0.4 percent in early Asian trade to $46.83 per barrel, near a five-month low of $46.64 touched in early May.Many other commodity prices are also under pressure. Thomson Reuters CRB index tumbled to 14-month lows, having fallen almost 12 percent from this year's high hit in January. (Editing by Kim Coghill)

KALAMAZOO, Mich. (WOOD) -- Target 8 is uncovering disturbing flaws in a double-murder case that sent a man to prison 15 years ago.
The Michigan Innocence Clinic says police and prosecutors in Kalamazoo County got it wrong when they went after Jeff Titus. Even the original detectives on the case say the wrong man is in prison.
Titus, a retired U.S. Marine, was convicted in 2002 after a cold case team reopened the investigation into 1990 murders of Doug Estes and Jim Bennett. The victims, who didn't know each other, were shot in the back at close range while hunting in a state game area next to Titus's land.
But Target 8 found that an alibi witness who said Titus was hunting on her family's land 27 miles away at the time was ignored.
Tonight at 7 p.m., Target 8 investigator Ken Kolker takes an in-depth look at the case, tracking down the original detectives, a witness who changed her story, family of the victims and the jury foreman, and sitting down with the convicted killer.
Mississippi imposes 15-week abortion ban, nation's toughest
Mississippi's governor has signed the nation's tightest abortion restrictions into law.
Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed House Bill 1510 on Monday afternoon. It becomes law immediately and bans most abortions after 15 weeks' gestation. Bryant has frequently said he wants Mississippi to be the “safest place in America for an unborn child.”
The law's only exceptions are if a fetus has health problems making it “incompatible with life” outside of the womb at full term, or if a pregnant woman's life or a “major bodily function” is threatened by pregnancy. Pregnancies resulting from rape and incest aren't exempted.
Abortion rights advocates are calling the law unconstitutional because it limits abortion before fetuses can live outside the womb. The owner of Mississippi's only abortion clinic opposes the law and has pledged to sue.

Turkish weightlifting legend Naim Süleymanoğlu's remains will be exhumed on Wednesday for a paternity lawsuit filed by Süleymanoğlu's alleged daughter Sekai Mori.
Mori alleges that Süleymanoğlu met with her mother Kyoko Mori, a Japanese journalist, at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. According to Mori, the couple got close and the rest is history.
Mori requested a paternity test through her lawyer and Turkish officials decided to exhume the remains of Süleymanoğlu in order to obtain tissue samples for DNA tests.
Süleymanoğlu's daughters, Esin and Sezin Süleymanoğlu had previously issued a statement through their lawyer Aziz Demir who had said "We don't want the exhumation. The dear departed will turn in his grave. If there was something like that, he would have had the DNA tests done himself when he was in good health. His daughters are very sad, they are devastated."
The exhumation is set to proceed on Wednesday, with officials already having the graveyard prepared beforehand.
The athlete, nicknamed "Pocket Hercules" due to his short stature, became a global star after setting six world records, winning three Olympic gold medals and out lifting the winner of the weight class above him at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games.
After winning the world championship in 1988, he retired at the age of 22. However, he returned in 1991 to win a second Olympic gold at Barcelona in 1992.
He built up one of the sport's greatest ever rivalries with Greece's Valerios Leonidis which was followed avidly by Turkish and Greek communities across the world. Trading world records with Valerios Leonidis, Süleymanoğlu eventually won his third Olympic gold medal.
In 2000 and 2004 he was elected to the International Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame. He was awarded the Olympic Order, the highest award of the Olympic movement, in 2001.
Süleymanoğlu is the only weightlifter in history to win gold medals in three different Olympics.

WHEW. Well that was a heck of a ride. All season long, The Handmaid's Tale has been lauded as a harrowing and cautionary tale against extremism, and it certainly delivered. It has been about what happens when fear overtakes a society, and a desire for isolationism and religious fundamentalism (or in this case, just crazy-pants rules and brutality) allowing for the creation of an oppressive regime. Some of the most terrifying sequences in Handmaid were its quietest — flashbacks to before the rise of Gilead where then-June (Elisabeth Moss), Luke (O-T Fagbenle), and Moira (Samira Wiley) talked about how fast everything happened. We watched June and Moira lose the ability to hold jobs or have bank accounts, and the next thing we all knew, there were children ripped from their parents, “ceremonial” rape, and public hangings.
Hulu swung for the fences for this original series, and they connected. This was also the first time I genuinely wasn't mad that they didn't drop the whole series at once. Honestly, it would have been too much. Handmaid needs to be consumed slowly, thoughtfully, and with breaks in between. Its unmistakable, controlled aesthetic was a visual representation of its story, and included color palettes helped inform our understanding of this strange and familiar world. It was also a rare case where narration worked, because Offred's thoughts were not commenting on what we were seeing, but what we were not. In her mind she cursed and rebelled while to everyone else she was the embodiment of meekness. Of course, she wasn't always meek, but she did whatever was necessary to both survive for her daughter, and to stay sane.
Though Offred initially relied on Ofglen (Alexis Bledel) as an ally and an inspiration (with the May Day rebellion), it was Offred who became the rock after Ofglen sacrificed her life for her freedom. Her story was desperately important not only as that of a “gender traitor” (in Gilead's world), but also because it led Handmaid to tell a story as horrific as genital mutilation in the cold and calculated context of Gilead. This show has never treated viewers with kid gloves, but it also let its most shocking moments sink in quietly, pervasively, sometimes to the point of giving the series a claustrophobic feeling.
Though Ofglen helped to give Offred a path to follow, it's Janine (Madeline Brewer) who helped Offred come into her own. Janine, the “crazy” girl who dared to talk back and lost an eye for it. Janine, who relished in her pregnancy and fell in love with her rapist commander in the hopes he would save her. Janine who wanted to kill herself and her baby because she could not process the pain of having her child taken from her and being shuffled off to a new rapist to repeat the entire process. Janine, the most sane woman of them all, who never let the bastards get her down.
Offred's story was tied to Janine's from the start, and she became a crucial friend to her in the last half of the season. Most importantly, she led a quiet rebellion to not stone Janine for putting her baby in peril, a move the other Handmaids went along with. In these moments we began to see the first glimmers of hope, bolstered by Moira making it to Canada (O Canada! Ontario has never looked so good), and reuniting with Luke. And though Offred seeing her daughter Hannah was tainted by Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski) threatening her, it was also a triumph — Hannah is alive and safe, and that sighting gave Offred something tangible to hold on to. But now that Offred is again pregnant, she has two children to think of, and her refusing to kill Janine was the moment she tried to help secure that better future — even if it meant potentially sacrificing everything.
We know The Handmaid's Tale is returning for Season 2, and will still star Offred and her story. But just knowing that Offred survives the events of Season 1's final moments is cold comfort. There are a lot of ways for her life to be made into a living hell. And yet, still, hope: Nick whispers to her as the guards come to to with them and to trust him. He seems to know the baby is his, which gives him even more of a reason to try and advocate for Offred as she is punished for her rebellious act. But no matter what, there was also that moment with Rita (Elena Khan) as Offred is led out — she tells her to look behind the tub, where she has re-stashed the letters from women all over Gilead who have been trapped just like they have. I'm not entirely sure if the implication is that Rita is part of May Day, or that Offred thinks she could be once she is confronted with the letters, but either way it's another hopeful moment.
Those letters are just one example of some of the quiet female power that dominates the last half of the Handmaid's finale —a suggestion of a kind of universal sisterhood that people like Serena Joy have viciously turned from, but one that the Handmaids and the Marthas (even in their fear) can use to unite them. Still, Serena Joy exercises her influence to ensure a baby happens without her husband involved, just like when Putnam's wife turned on him and asked for the harshest punishment “because she loved him” — and wanted him to pay for his transgression. The tables can be turned. The letters of desperation, and the impact they had on Offred (and viewers) speak to this same emotion. There's no plan yet, and Offred's fate is uncertain. But the show proved with “Night” that even when walking through the darkness there can be light. The future is still female. Praise be.

Access, ideas, inspiration and opportunity.
That is the mission of a public library, according to Ruth Bond, now six months into her tenure as the West Baton Rouge Parish Library director. Bond accepted her new job in Port Allen in June.
Like her predecessor Beth Vandersteen, Bond's goal is to continue modernizing the parish's library with digital tools and to increase the facility's organizational efficiency. The only obstacle (as always) is time and money.
Preliminary plans were in the works by the former library director for a potential addition to the existing facility. Those plans (and any future plans of a potential secondary location) were tabled after the last legislative session in the Capitol.
Bond says she intends to focus on the existing library.
“There's a lot of opportunity here. Beth left us in a very good spot,” Bond said. “I think from my perspective it's best to invest in this building here.”
As the WBRPL becomes more technologically savvy, the need for an increased physical presence will decrease. Patrons will be able to access collections and online tools with apps and websites through the WBRPL.
“We're definitely focusing on more digital content and how we can make our website more robust,” Bond said.
The goal is to expand the library's user base, not necessarily the number of patrons visiting the physical building. Many of the library's patrons may never even step foot in the building, Bond said.
“I know that traffic is bad… the board is extending our services to as many as we can. We can do that through digital content,” Bond said. “We're always looking at how to make it more easy.”
The library is hoping to launch access to Flipster this month, an app that allows library patrons to browse magazines on a digital database. Other future plans include access to streaming music and video.
Bond said she will focus some energy on renovating the existing library space as well. “We want to at least bring it up to the standards of the state libraries,” she said.
Though this is her first directorship, Bond said she has worked in just about every position in public libraries.
A West Coast native, Bond earned her stripes as a librarian in California, Washington and De Soto Parish and was most recently the Director of Public Services for the Kitsap County Regional Libraries before accepting her role as library director in West Baton Rouge.
The transition to her new job so far has been a positive one so far, she said.
“It's been a good change. We're moving forward,” said administrative assistant Cadie Russo, who has taken on an expanded role at the library. “We're like a small family.”
The library staff has been supportive after Vandersteen's eight years at the helm, Bond said.
“What makes the library is the staff,” Bond said. “I delegate a lot of tasks to the staff and they have been stepping up. My job is to make sure they have the tools to do their job. Without them, there wouldn't be a library here.”
Bond said she is looking forward to hearing more about the community's needs.
“Standard answers are more books and extended answers. But what are the issues that they care about and how can the library help with that?” Bond asked. “We provide opportunity. If you want to see your tax dollars in action, come visit the library.”
The Wireless Institute of Australia (WIA) is seeking a power increase for radio amateurs. WIA is pushing telecommunications regulator the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to bump up maximum power levels for all three licenses classes to 50 W for Foundation licensees, 200 W for Standard licensees, and 1,500 W for Advanced licensees.
WIA Board member Justin Giles-Clark, VK7TW, said comments would be solicited from the membership before the request goes to the ACMA.
For some time the WIA has pushed for higher power limits for Advanced licensees, who feel the current 400 W HF power limit (120 W on constant-carrier modes) puts them at a disadvantage, especially in contests, while other countries permit 1 kW or more.
In 2013, ACMA ended an 18-month trial that allowed participating Advanced licensees to run up to 1 kW on HF. Currently, Foundation licensees on HF may run up to 10 W PEP on SSB (or 3 W on CW, AM, or FM), while Standard licensees have a 100-W PEP HF power limit (SSB) or 30 W for constant-carrier modes.
A year after a deal between the B.C. NDP and the B.C. Green Party sealed her political fate, former B.C. premier Christy Clark has a new job. Clark has joined law firm Bennett Jones as a senior adviser in the company's Vancouver office.
“Joining Bennett Jones is an excellent fit,” said Clark in a statement. “The firm is helping clients seize opportunities in sectors such as infrastructure, technology and innovation, trade with Asia and natural resources. These are areas I am passionate about and worked on closely as premier. Bennett Jones' lawyers share the same passion for their work — they are creative and find solutions to complex matters. I am very excited to be a part of the firm.”

Clark was British Columbia's premier from 2011-2017 taking over from Gordon Campbell as B.C. Liberal leader and premier. One of her defining moments was capturing a surprise victory in the 2013 provincial election. The release from Bennett Jones announcing Clark's hiring touted her as the country's longest-serving female premier and the leader of “B.C.'s standout performance in economic growth.”
WATCH HERE: What are Christy Clark's future plans?
“Christy's leadership as premier took British Columbia to new economic heights,” said Bennett Jones CEO Hugh MacKinnon. “Her vision on driving growth through trade is one that our clients share. Vancouver is a thriving market and a strategic focus for Bennett Jones and we are very pleased to welcome Christy to the firm.”

Clark resigned as premier following a confidence vote that defeated her government. Following that resignation, she asked Lt. Gov. Judith Guichon to call another election. Instead, Guichon asked current premier John Horgan to form a government with the support of Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver.
The longtime politician and former talk show host guided the B.C. Liberals to 43 seats in the 2017 provincial election, one seat short of a majority. Clark quit politics altogether on Aug. 4, 2017, after announcing her intentions to her caucus. Current speaker and former B.C. Liberal Darryl Plecas spoke out against Clark's leadership of the Liberal party before she announced her resignation.

The Upper Basin states on the Colorado River are accusing the Central Arizona Project of manipulating water supply and demand.
Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming claim CAP is threatening water supplies of 40 million people in the United States and Mexico.
CAP insists it is doing its part in water conservation efforts.
The Colorado River has been drought-stressed for 18 years, and winter 2018 was exceptionally dry.
The Upper Basin says CAP is keeping water elevations in Lake Mead artificially low in order to force its states to send more water south.
CAP maintains 336 miles of canals, pipelines, and aqueducts in central and southern Arizona.
Usain Bolt's final track appearance ended with pain and frustration on Saturday as he pulled up injured running the final leg of the World Championships 4×100 metres relay as Britain stunned the United States to win a shock gold medal.
Bolt, who had to settle for bronze in the individual 100 metres, had been hoping to sign off from the sport by leading Jamaica to a fifth successive world relay title but they were struggling in a distant third place when he collected the baton.
The legendary Jamaican sprinter was running the anchor leg for Jamaica in the 4 x 100-meter relay final at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics when he suffered a leg cramp, collapsed to the track and ultimately left in tears.
Though the end came suddenly and painfully, the world's greatest athlete covering little more than 15 metres of his last major race before injury halted his progress; a victim, apparently, of severe cramp in his left hamstring.
It was no way for such an incredible career to conclude, Bolt reduced to an almost pathetic figure as his own momentum carried him half-way down the straight before he collapsed to the track.
Afterward, the Jamaican lamented the sad ending to his remarkable career but also thanked his fans. “Not the way that I wanted to end my championship,” Bolt said on Snapchat, according to NBC Sports. “I left everything out there on the track. I gave it my all, as always. “Sorry I didn't get to say bye or anything, but I will be at the stadium tomorrow. I will come say goodbye.”
Although Great Britain won the gold medal, Bolt dominated post-race conversation. Bolt's team claims event organizers' decision to delay the start of the race caused Bolt's left-hamstring injury. “It was 40 minutes and two medal presentations before our run,” Jamaica's Yohann Blake said, per The BBC. “We keep warming up and waiting, then warming up and waiting. I think it got the better of us. “It hurts to see a true legend, a true champion go out there and struggle like that.”
For Bolt, of course, the legacy remains intact even if the leg is in bits. It remains an astonishing career. He retires with three world records, 13 individual global titles and 19 in all, even if those relay performances do represent a rather less palatable part of his career when they link him to the darker side of the sport.

Romney Seeks Marriott Post He Can't Hold as a U.S. Senator
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) – Mitt Romney is running for re-election to Marriott International's board of directors, but his campaign said Monday that he'll resign from that post if elected in November to the U.S. Senate, which bars senators from serving as an officer or board member of any publicly-held company.
The Utah Senate candidate and former Republican presidential candidate is one of 14 members of Marriott's board running for another year-long term, according to the hotel chain's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.
Democrats Reject Immigration Deal as Budget Deadline Nears
WASHINGTON (AP) – Capitol Hill Democrats have rejected a White House bid to extend protections for so-called Dreamer immigrants in exchange for $25 billion in funding for President Donald Trump's long-sought border wall as Washington talks on a $1.3 trillion catchall spending bill hit a critical stage on Monday.
Disputes remain over immigration enforcement and a smaller infusion of wall funding, as well as a major rail project that pits Trump against his most powerful Democratic adversary, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).
Monday's developments were described by congressional aides in both parties who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks remain secretive.
A leader with the Glendale Tenants Union presented more than 11,000 signatures to the City Council Tuesday in support of a rent control initiative.
Union captain John Bagdzhyan drafted the ordinance prior to the group's June formation, but used its members and outreach to help collect 11,186 signatures during the last six months.
Bagdzhyan, who filed the signatures with the city on Oct. 2, was joined at the Tuesday meeting by 10 of the Union's members, as well roughly 20 residents who support some form of rent control.
“I met hundreds of people who are angry at the conditions of rents in this city [that] are outrageously high, and some of them cannot live in the city. They have to go somewhere else cheaper,” Bagdzhyan told the council.
Escalating rents, a situation he called “unacceptable, appalling and unethical,” are driving the ordinance, he said.
Several speakers asked the council to implement rent controls.
Karen Kwak, a union organizer and renter, said the proposed ordinance asks the city to cap rent increases at 3% a year, allow only annual increases and form a city mediation board to address landlord/tenant disputes.
According to the website RentCafe, the average rent for an apartment complex with 50 or more units in Glendale increased 2% this year over last.
In August, the city of Glendale introduced a proposed “right to lease” ordinance designed to “minimize displacement” by requiring that Glendale landlords offer one-year lease agreements to all their tenants renting in apartment buildings of five units or more.
A city official presented the right to lease ordinance at a recent Glendale Tenants Union meeting. According to Kwak, it was received by union members as "toothless.” She said one member described the right to lease ordinance as “offering a parasol to block out the sun” while tenants “drown” under continuous rent increases.
According to City Atty. Mike Garcia, the Los Angeles County registrar must verify about 10,500 signatures on the union's petition as belonging to registered Glendale voters in order to qualify it for placement on the next city general municipal election ballot.
Before moving to the ballot, however, the City Council will likely order staff to prepare a report within 30 days analyzing the impacts of the proposed measure. Then, if no legal issues are present, the council can adopt the measure as submitted — with no revisions — or take it to voters.

If you're having a heart attack, your life might someday be saved by pond scum.
That's because these lowly bacteria are capable of producing something a stricken heart desperately needs: oxygen.
In fact, when Stanford scientists injected massive doses of cyanobacteria into the hearts of rats who suffered the equivalent of a “widow-maker” heart attack, oxygen levels ballooned by a factor of 25.
The results, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, suggest a truly original approach to reducing the damage done to heart muscle when it is suddenly deprived of oxygen.
When blood flow to the heart is interrupted by a clot or the narrowing of vessels, the effect can be deadly, either now or later. It's not uncommon for a heart attack victim to survive his or her immediate ordeal, only to succumb to heart failure — the effects of heart muscle weakened by its brush with oxygen deprivation — months or years after the event.
Physicians have long sought to avert that lingering damage by restoring the flow of oxygenated blood to the heart muscle as quickly as possible. Wielding an arsenal of drugs, stents, grasping devices, saws, scalpels and long, threaded catheters, cardiac surgeons try to isolate, remove or dissolve clots in the arteries feeding the heart before cells start to die off and lasting damage is done. More recently, stem cells have shown great promise in restoring damaged heart muscle.
But this new approach to rescuing living tissue from so-called ischemic damage proceeds from the observation that oxygen abounds in our atmosphere as a result of photosynthesis — the fuel-making industry of green plants all around us.
If a lack of oxygen is the problem when living tissue is deprived of blood flow, perhaps we should invite into our bodies the forest's genius for manufacturing the gas our cells depend on to survive.
“Every day we walk around and see trees,” said Dr. Joseph Woo, chair of Stanford School of Medicine's department of cardiothoracic surgery and the paper's senior author. “We wondered, would there be any possibility of taking plants and putting them next to the heart and getting them to work together?”
Several years ago, researchers in Woo's Stanford lab started by grinding spinach, and then kale, with mortar and pestle. When they introduced the green slurry to living tissue in Petri dishes and set them in the sun, nothing happened.
But when they tried a more primitive practitioner of photosynthesis — pond scum — the oxygenation effect was clear to see.
The scientists used cyanobacteria, the blue-green algae that often blooms on the surface of still waters, to supply life-giving oxygen to the stricken hearts of rats. After clamping off the largest of three arteries feeding blood to the heart — the left anterior descending coronary artery — the researchers injected those hearts with tens of millions of the single-celled organisms.
For two full hours — one hour while the clamp remained in place and a second hour after it was removed — the animals' incisions remained open. During that time, the hearts of the treated rats were exposed to strong light, which jump-started the photosynthetic process.
Just as they would on the surface of a pond, the cyanobacteria used the pigment chlorophyll to combine water, carbon dioxide and light to produce glucose. The incidental byproduct of that process — oxygen — kept cells deprived of oxygenated blood from dying off in droves.
A day later, the damage to the hearts of treated rats was less than half as severe as that seen in rats that got an inactive treatment, according to the study.
And four weeks after the ischemic crisis, the hearts of rats that got the photosynthesis treatment performed dramatically better than the hearts of rats that did not.
In humans, an improvement in heart function of the magnitude shown in treated rats “would have profound clinical implications,” the Stanford team wrote. If humans were to reap benefits as great as those seen in the lab rats, they added, such a treatment probably would spell “the difference between a healthy patient and one suffering from heart failure.”
Woo sees the new research as a “proof of principle” that photosynthesis, in some form, might someday be used as a bridge treatment for patients who have had blood flow cut off to any organ. It might be useful in sustaining organs harvested for transplant during their long journey to a new owner, Woo said, and in preventing the death of brain cells during a stroke. It may even one day improve the treatment of malignant tumors that thrive in oxygen-deprived environments, he added.
But in its current form, a photosynthetic bridge treatment is far from ready for use in clinical settings.
“It would be very suboptimal to have to crack someone's chest open and shine the light on them” to begin the oxygenation process, Woo said. To work around that impracticality, a team at Stanford is already working on “supercharged versions” of the cyanobacteria that rescued rats' hearts in his team's new paper.
Researchers may have to engineer ways other than direct exposure to visible light to jump-start the photosynthesis process, he said. Plants or cyanobacteria may be amenable to genetic engineering that would allow them to produce oxygen more copiously, or to initiate photosynthesis in response to energy at wavelengths that can penetrate skin and other tissue.
Remarkably, the direct injection into the heart of millions of cyanobacteria did not cause any infection. Nor did it prompt the rats' immune systems to mount a defensive response — a reaction that can be just as deadly as infection.
Virtually all of the millions of single-celled organisms injected into the rats' hearts were gone 24 hours after the experiment. And in a more thorough search four weeks later, the researchers could find no sign of infection or of lingering bacterial cells anywhere near the hearts of rats who got the treatment.
If cyanobacteria were someday to play a key role in the treatment of human disease, it would be a nice footnote to an already striking record of accomplishment. That's because cyanobacteria — one of the largest, oldest and most important groups of bacteria on Earth — are already pretty much responsible for life as we know it.
In the Archaean and Proterozoic eons 2.5 billion years ago, cyanobacteria flourished by using light and carbon dioxide for nourishment. The oxygen given off by this photosynthesis created Earth's oxygen-rich atmosphere, making the evolution of ever more complex life forms possible.

Sindh police and government officials on Monday unveiled the security and traffic plan for the Pakistan Super League (PSL) final, to be played at Karachi's National Stadium on March 25.
Spectators will need to pass through a roughly four-hour-long, three-tier security clearance procedure before they can enter the stadium.
Rangers' Brigadier Shahid explained the security measures which will be in place, and described the process spectators will pass through in order to attend the match:
Ticket holders will report to the specified car parking areas, where there will be six marshalling areas. At the car park, they will undergo the first physical search and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) staff will verify their tickets.
After this, they will approach a shuttle service which will then drop them off at the designated drop zone. There are three drop zones – one at Expo Centre, one opposite Bahria University, and a third opposite Aga Khan Hospital.
They will undergo another physical search at the drop zone.
The distance from the drop zone to the stadium gates is about 200-300 metres. Spectators will walk from the drop zone to the gates. Senior citizens and differently-abled spectators will be transported from the drop zones to the gates via buses.
Spectators will undergo a third physical search at the stadium gates.
PCB official Arshad Khan says the board's staff will be on hand to guide visitors to their seats. The stadium can seat about 35,000. Four VIP enclosures will be set up at the venue.
After the match, the crowd will be transported back to the marshalling area via the shuttle service. Spectators were requested to use the same shuttle service and route they came to the drop zone in.The residents of the surrounding areas will be requested not to force traffic police officials or members of the security forces to let them approach the stadium directly, Brigadier Shahid said. No one is allowed to carry eatables from outside the venue.
A series of PCB-approved vendors will set up food stalls within the car parking area and spectators can purchase food and drinks from there and then go to the stadium. Ambulances will also be present at the parking area in case of a medical emergency, the Rangers official said.

Charleston investigators are continuing to search for possible witnesses and released more pictures in connection to a homicide that happened at an I-26 on ramp in downtown Charleston.
Para personas que hablan español haga clic aquí
On Friday night, police released two pictures of a van they say may have witnessed events which led up to a Tuesday night fatal shooting at the I-26 on ramp from Meeting Street.
Police responded to the area on Tuesday at 11:30 p.m. for the incident.
According to police, the victim's vehicle made a left hand turn from Meeting Street onto the I-26 on ramp where shortly thereafter the victim became involved in some type of altercation and was located deceased near his vehicle.
"The victim's vehicle was located on the on ramp to I-26 partially in the roadway and partially on the shoulder," CPD officials said.
The pictures police have released is believed to be a potential witness who drove past the victim and suspect vehicle on the on ramp moments before the victim was killed.
Investigators said they are attempting to identify the vehicle and its occupants who may have witnessed a portion of the incident.
Charleston police describe the vehicle as a light colored full size panel van with what appears to be a ladder rack on top.
"The vehicle has windows on the front drivers/passenger side doors and rear doors," police said."If you have any information, please contact Charleston County Consolidated Dispatch at (843) 743-7200 or Crime Stoppers at (843) 554-1111."
Police found the victim, 48-year-old Dominique Sheppard of North Charleston, near his vehicle.
Sheppard was suffering several gunshot wounds to the chest.
He later died at MUSC on Wednesday morning, according to the Charleston County Coroner's Office.

Opponent: Charlotte Checkers
When: 7:05, tonight
Where: Mohegan Sun Arena
Online: Follow @CVPiccotti on Twitter for live updates from the game. Nick Hart and Mike O'Brien will have the broadcast on 103.1 FM and 910, 930 and 980 AM — along with AHL Live.
About the Checkers: Charlotte joined the Atlantic Division this offseason after finishing fourth last year in the Central Division (39-29-7-1). It was one of the most well-disciplined teams in the league, recording the second-fewest penalty minutes of any squad (827). ... Four of Charlotte's top-five goal scorers from last season are back, led by center Lucas Wallmark (24) and center Andrew Poturalski (19). ... Charlotte eliminated the Penguins from the 2011 Calder Cup Playoffs, claiming a 4-2 series win in the second round.
Donatelli's analysis: “The (Checkers) have a lot of structure. You can tell they are coached well. They buzz, they work hard. So, any time a team has good structure and works hard, we're going to have to answer the bell ourselves.”
Other notes: The Penguins have won their last two season-opening games, including a 6-2 thrashing of Hartford last season. ... Wilkes-Barre/Scranton and Charlotte will meet a total of four times during the regular season. ... Jean-Sebastien Dea was only Penguin to score multiple goals (2) during the team's four preseason games. He is the longest-tenured Penguin other than captain Tom Kostopoulos.

De Lille to face no confidence motion from DA

Patricia de Lille. Credit: EWN.
Mayor Patricia de Lille will face a motion of no confidence from the Democratic Alliance's (DA) Cape Town caucus on Wednesday. This after a majority of the caucus voted in favour of tabling a motion last week.
De Lille survived a motion brought by the DA through a vote of the full council in February, but this time her fate will lie solely in the hands of her colleagues.
De Lille could be delivering her last address as mayor at Wednesday's full council meeting.
Immediately after that, the caucus that she's been leading until her suspension from party activity late last year will meet behind closed doors to vote on whether they still have confidence in her.
If the vote succeeds by a simple majority of the 154 members present, the decision will be passed on the DA's Federal Executive (FedEx).
The FedEx gave the go-ahead for a vote against De Lille last week.
If it goes against her, she will be able to make representations to the executive as to why she should keep her job.
Failing to accept these, the FedEx can ask her to resign, or lose her party membership.
Wednesday's vote will be the first time the DA tests its new constitutional amendment to recall an office bearer in whom they've lost confidence.

Israel on Wednesday approved construction of 1,958 new settler homes in the occupied West Bank, Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now told AFP.
It was slightly fewer than the 2,500 for which Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said last week he intended to seek approval.
It was the first tranche of settlement approvals since the controversial U.S. embassy transfer to Jerusalem on May 14, a move that infuriated Palestinians and intensified protests on the Gaza border, with at least 61 Palestinians killed in clashes with Israeli forces that day.
Peace Now said that in Wednesday's batch, around 700 units got final approval while the remainder passed the first approval stage in the planning process.
It said that the majority were in isolated settlements outside the major "blocs" which the government will seek to retain in any future peace agreement with the Palestinians.
Peace Now said in a statement that there had been a leap in settlement-building during U.S. President Donald Trump's term so far, with about 14,000 approvals.
That, it added, "is more than three times the amount that was approved in the year and a half before his inauguration (4,476 units)."
According to Israel's Channel 7, the government's planning and building committee approved construction of the new housing units in the Gush Etzion settlement bloc south of Jerusalem.
Roughly 600,000 Israeli settlers currently live on more than 100 Jewish-only settlements built in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which were illegally occupied by Israel in 1967.
The Palestinians, for their part, want these areas -- along with the Gaza Strip -- for a future state of Palestine.
International law views the West Bank and East Jerusalem as "occupied territories" and considers all settlement-building activity on the land as illegal.

Monday night a walking and biking audit was open to those who walk or peddle to Eastern Elementary in Traverse City.
It's a unique part of the grant application process for a Safe Routes to Schools Grant.
The $200,000 grant would fund improvements to sidewalks, crosswalks, bike paths, streetscapes and more.
That's why Monday the school asked the people who use the four main routes to take a walk through and give their feedback.
Eastern and Traverse Heights Elementary are the only two TCAPS elementary schools applying for the grant this spring. Immaculate Conception Elementary is also applying.
Grant director at TCAPS, Dr. Cindy Berck says, “Understanding how students, parents and community members are getting to and from school obviously is an important aspect to know what kind of infrastructure improvements need to be made to make that experience safe and appropriate for those who are using the route.”
Traverse Heights Elementary audit will be April 11th.
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said on Friday that it expects global oil demand to drop sharply by 2040 if regulations aimed at limiting the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on climate are fully implemented.
Under this scenario, Exxon projected world oil consumption will drop 0.4 percent annually to 2040 to about 78 million barrels per day (bpd). That is about 25 percent below current levels, which the U.S. Energy Information Administration puts at 98 million bpd.
The findings were contained in a report produced after Exxon's shareholders supported a climate-impact resolution last year and Exxon's board approved a plan to analyse the effects.
Exxon's climate-impact report comes roughly three years after almost 200 nations met in Paris to set a goal of limiting the rise in the world's average surface temperatures.
President Donald Trump has since pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord, and it was unclear whether Paris accord policies would be fully implemented around the world.
The study added weight to arguments that laws and regulations to limit the rise in global temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels will succeed in curbing fossil fuel consumption.
But Exxon stopped short of laying out how efforts to limit carbon emissions could impact its business, data long sought by some shareholders. In a separate report published on Friday that did not take into account climate legislation, Exxon forecast population growth will drive oil demand higher by about 20 percent by 2040.
Exxon's study saw demand for natural gas, considered a cleaner-burning fuel than oil, growing 0.5 percent per year to about 445 billion cubic feet per day under the same scenario.
Demand for power generated by solar panels, wind turbines and other renewable sources is expected to rise 4.5 percent annually through 2040 under this scenario, Exxon said.
The report followed years of pressure by investors and environmental activists urging the company to describe the potential impact of a warming climate on its operations. Last year, their climate-impact resolution was backed by 62 percent of shares voted at Exxon's annual meeting.
The report came the same day that Exxon posted quarterly results that disappointed Wall Street, sending its shares down more than 5 percent.
While sponsors of the shareholder resolution applauded Exxon on Friday for being more transparent than in years past, there was still frustration that the company did not disclose how climate policies would affect its finances.
“That is the meat that we're missing in the sandwich here,” said Tracey Rembert of Christian Brothers Investment Services, a co-sponsor of the climate-impact resolution.
A spokesman for New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees state pension funds and was a resolution sponsor, said via e-mail: “We are looking at Exxon's report closely and look forward to discussing it with the company in the coming days.”
SECOND REPORT
Exxon on Friday also published its annual outlook for energy demand. In that report, the company does not take into account a scenario to limit temperature rise and projects energy supply and demand rising for the foreseeable future.
The report said global carbon dioxide emissions are likely to peak by 2040, at about 10 percent above 2016 levels, as consumption shifts to lower-emission natural gas, renewables and nuclear.
“It's a dual challenge – we need to meet society's growing need for energy while addressing the risks of climate change,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said in a press release.
In a bid to ‘restore the lost glory' of Punjabi language, Punjab's Minister for Culture and Tourism, Navjot Singh Sidhu, has made it mandatory for Tourism and Cultural Affairs department to carry out entire official work in Punjabi.In his initiative to promote the native language, Sidhu wrote to the Principal Secretary, Local Government and Secretary Tourism and Cultural Affairs, saying that promotion Punjabi language is the ‘ the primary as well as moral duty of all.'Sidhu has asked the concerned officials to ensure that the working of both the departments is done in Punjabi.Similarly, the signboards and name-plates of officials in the aforementioned departments will be soon seen engraved in the Gurmukhi script as Sidhu has ordered that ‘Punjabi language must occupy prominent space in every signboard connected with both the departments.'Stating that Punjabi language is a symbol of the identity and the pride of all Punjabi people, Sidhu also called for strict action against the violating officers.Earlier, during a panchayat summoned by Punjabi lovers in Chandigarh, Sidhu had given a clarion call to restore the lost glory of Punjabi language.“Punjabis must join hands in restoring the lost glory of Punjabi language which is a symbol of pride and identity for all of us”, he had said.The minister who has been a part of various comedy shows, had also advocated having cartoon characters in Punjabi. “Future generations, under the influence of western cartoons, is deviating from their mother tongue. So, it is important for us to have cartoon characters in Punjabi”.
The highly-anticipated sequel Creed 2 has finally, officially locked down a director and it's a name that nobody would have expected. A couple of months ago, Sylvester Stallone indicated that he was going to step up and direct the Creed sequel himself, but that didn't pan out. Now, it's been announced that up-and-coming director Steven Caple Jr. is going to take the reins on Creed 2, which will serve as his first directorial effort for a major studio. No pressure.
Reportedly, Creed star Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone hand-picked Steven Caple Jr. for the gig, after a very long search. Stallone was considering taking the gig, but after talking it over with the rest of the creative team, they decided to find someone else to direct the movie. Jonathan Glickman, MGM's president, motion picture group, had this to say about the news in a statement.
"We could not be more fortunate and excited about the collaboration of Steven, Sly, Michael and the producers, to build upon the success of Creed. The combination of Steven's talent and unique vision makes him the perfect director to continue the Rocky franchise storied lineage."
This new report also confirms that Tessa Thompson is going to return for the sequel. The script for Creed 2 was written by Sylvester Stallone, with Luke Cage showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker co-writing. His involvement had not been revealed until now. Michael B. Jordan, who reprises his role as Adonis Creed in the sequel, took to Twitter to welcome the new director, saying, "Excited for Coogler to hand over the reins to Steven Caple, Jr., our director for Creed 2! Can't wait to bring you guys the next chapter of our story ... coming at you November 2018." Steven Caple Jr. Had this to say about his new job.
"It's an honor to be a part of such an iconic franchise and to work with such great collaborators. Mike, Sly, and Tessa are extraordinarily talented and bring something special to today's culture. I look forward to joining the family and continuing the precedent set by this franchise's alumni of incredible filmmakers."
Ryan Coogler, who directed the first Creed, is still currently busy completing post-production on Marvel's Black Panther. However, it's expected that he will sign on as an executive producer for Creed 2, though no deal has been inked just yet. Sylvester Stallone, who reprises his role as Rocky Balboa once again in the sequel, had this to say in a statement about Steven Caple Jr.
"The character of Adonis Creed reflects this generation and its challenges. I believe it's important for the director to also be a part of this generation like I was in mine, to make the story as relatable as possible. We are extremely lucky to have the talented young filmmaker Steven Caple Jr. step up and accept the role of director. I am confident that he and Michael B. Jordan will hit it out of the park!"
Steven Caple Jr.'s only feature is IFC's The Land, but that was reportedly enough to win over the studio. Creed 2 will feature Dolph Lundgren reprising his role as Ivan Drago from Rocky IV. According to Variety, production starts in March of 2018. The movie is currently slated for release on November 21, 2018, which means they're going to have to turn it around rather quickly, assuming they stick to that date.
When Toys "R" Us recently announced that it would be liquidating and closing all 735 of its stores across the United States, social media was pretty quick to react. Much of the commentary focused on the nostalgic loss felt by all those who grew up in the age of the "Toys 'R' Us Kid" (because memories), while others either lamented the job losses, or eagerly anticipated the opportunity to shop the going-out-of-business sales. But while those reactions may have been predictable, there's another that, honestly, is straight—up baffling. On Twitter, people are saying Toys "R" Us is going bankrupt because it donated to Planned Parenthood — the reason being that, by supporting the reproductive health care organization, the toy company was aiding in its own eventual demise.
Still confused? Allow me to elaborate. Instead of accepting the completely logical explanation that Toys "R" Us went out of business because of debts, changes in consumer shopping habits, and competition from retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Target, according to USA Today, a sub-set of Twitter users appears to think that, because Planned Parenthood offers abortion services to its patients, Toys "R" Us actually went bankrupt because the company gave Planned Parenthood money that went towards ending so many pregnancies that there are no longer enough children around to actually buy toys. ‌
The idea, it seems, may have originated in response to a March 15 analysis by The Washington Post's Andrew Van Dam that discussed Toys "R" Us' own admission that the nation's decreased birth rate had a negative impact on the company's business model. Though certainly not the biggest contributor to the toy giant's demise, it does make sense: Toys "R" Us and Babies "R" Us obviously rely on people having children in order to make money, and yet, as Van Dam noted, the birth rate in the United States has "fallen steadily since the Great Recession," reaching its lowest point in 2016.
His point, of course, was that the impact that the falling birth rate had on Toys "R" Us is just the beginning — as Van Dam explained, "economic growth is extremely difficult without population growth," and without a dedicated effort to encourage Americans to have more children, or to encourage immigration to fill in the gap, the economic impact will be inevitable.
Naturally, there are reasons for this: women are having children later, according to The New York Times, and therefore may not have the ability to have more than one or two children. Unintended pregnancies are also decreasing overall, as are teen pregnancies, thanks to the availability of long-term, reliable birth control options, like IUDs (which is a really good thing). And, well, there's also the fact that having kids is expensive. If you and your partner are already required to bring in two incomes just to pay for outrageously-high daycare expenses? You might have some reservations about going for your second, third, or fourth child.
Somewhere along the way though, anti-abortion advocates seem to have interpreted the connection between Toys "R" Us' bankruptcy and the declining birth rate to mean that we obviously wouldn't be in this predicament if women just stopped having all those pesky abortions. And while that should seem like a pretty big reach, there are actually a surprisingly-high number of tweets and memes floating around social media that seem to support it as a totally legitimate theory.
There are those, for example, who seem to consider Toys "R" Us' demise as some kind of economic karmic retribution:
Then, of course, there were the memes:
There are two pretty big problems with this take though. The first is that, well, it assumes that Planned Parenthood's main function is to terminate pregnancies when really, abortions only make up 3 percent of the services it provides, according to CNN (aka not enough to result in a huge decrease in the overall national birth rate). And then there's the question of whether Toys "R" Us even actually supported Planned Parenthood to begin with. Though that's not entirely clear, 2nd Vote, which describes itself on its website as a "conservative watchdog for corporate activism," reported that Toys 'R' Us' connection to Planned Parenthood is that it "matches gifts to Susan G. Komen NYC and MN chapters, which continues to fund Planned Parenthood." In other words, the suggestion that Toys "R" Us' bankruptcy occurred because it financially supported an organization that is apparently driving a decreased national birth rate by being an abortion factory? It doesn't even sort of hold up.
It's not surprising to see that people take issue with what they view as Toys "R" Us' support of Planned Parenthood, especially if they don't quite understand exactly what Planned Parenthood does. But if they are sincerely concerned about the declining birth rate and its effect on the American economy, supporting policies that would actually make it easier for families to have more children — paid maternity leave, for example, or affordable child care — seems much more useful than simply posting a smug comment on Twitter.

The 11 members of a Burari family, who were found hanging at their residence on July 1, voluntarily followed the instructions of one of the deceased during the mass ritual, the latest CCTV footage has revealed.According to NDTV, footage from a camera with a view of the entrance to the Bhatias' house showed a woman and two children bringing in the stools and wires used in the mass hangings. The youngest members — 12-year-old Dhruv and 15-year-old Shivam — reportedly went to a furniture store downstairs and bought the wires, while the older daughter-in-law brought the stools, the footage showed.Handwritten notes talking about following a set of rituals to appease God and attain salvation were found by the police from the spot, which have compounded the mystery of the 11 deaths.Entries made by the matriarch's younger son, 45-year-old Lalit, indicate that he hallucinated about his dead father advising him about salvation. Another person who allegedly wrote in the diaries was Lalit's 30-year-old niece Priyanka Bhatia, who got engaged on June 17.The notes also revealed that the family did not expect to die in the ritual and thought the spirit of Lalit's father would save them.The last sentence in the final diary entry, written on the day of the suicides, reads: “...keep water in a cup, when it changes colour, I will appear and save you.” After the ritual, everyone was to untie each other.In the final diary entry on June 30, there were instructions titled “Bhagwaan ka raasta” (Road to God), which said nine people would hang from the “jaal” (a grill on their ceiling) and one person would be near the temple on a smaller stool, NDTV reported.The notes detailed the exact time for specific tasks; food had to be ordered at 10pm, “mother would feed everyone roti” and the “kriya (final act)” would be performed at 1am.A police officer said the family had attributed a run of good fortune to Lalit's instructions and thus may not have questioned the ritual. Baffled investigators say the family was probably suffering from a “shared psychotic disorder”.However, the next of kin of the deceased have rubbished the theories, complaining that they were being “painted by the media as a family of maniacs”.Teachers and authorities of the school where Dhruv and Shivam studied also said they were bright students who had keen interest in music. “They were studying here right since their childhood and were doing well in their studies. They were also into co-curricular activities. Their elder sister Maneka also passed out from our institution and was a school topper. None of the teachers ever had any complaints about their behaviour,” a school representative said.Ten of the 11 members of the Bhatia family were found hanging from an iron-mesh in the ceiling on July 1, while the body of 77-year-old Narayan Devi, the head of the family, was lying on the floor in another room of the house.
Residents in Southern Manitoba are waking up to a wet and stormy Wednesday morning.
Severe thunderstorm watches and warnings were issued by Environment Canada early Wednesday, cautioning the threat of damaging wind gusts, hail, and heavy rain of up to 30 mm.
As the system continues to track northeast, the threat of severe weather should diminish before noon.
The academic at the center of the Facebook data-misuse scandal apologized for his actions, but said he thought he did nothing wrong at the time.
Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan made his comments during an interview with CBS's “60 Minutes” on Sunday.
Facebook has been embroiled in scandal since revelations that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica misused personal information from as many as 87 million Facebook accounts. Cambridge Analytica received the data from a Facebook personality-quiz app that Kogan created. That app collected data on both users and their Facebook friends.
Kogan is due to testify before a UK parliamentary committee on Tuesday. The committee is investigating data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica's role in elections globally as well as the UK's Brexit vote in 2016. Kogan also spoke with Buzzfeed.
In the “60 Minutes” interview, Kogan said he thought the way his app mined data was on the up-and-up at the time. He says he's since changed his mind, saying he had been acting “quite naively” in assuming that users weren't too concerned about what apps did with their data.
“I think that core idea that we had - that everybody knows and nobody cares - was fundamentally flawed,” he said. “And so if that idea is wrong, then what we did was not right and was not wise. And for that, I'm sincerely sorry.”
He also pointed out that his former research partner, Joseph Chancellor, still works at Facebook. When asked if Chancellor was involved in Kogan's work for Cambridge Analytica, Kogan said he was. “We did everything together,” he said.
Cambridge Analytica said in a statement that it licensed data for only up to 30 million respondents in the US from Kogan, adding that it found the personality type data from Kogan was “less effective” than standard demographic details. The company said it did not use Kogan's data in its political consulting work for Sen. Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign or Donald Trump's winning presidential campaign.
The company also said it deleted the raw data after Facebook requested it to.
Ime Archibong, Facebook's vice president of product partnerships, said in a statement Kogan had a brief consulting contract with Facebook in 2015, but that the company wasn't aware of Kogan's activities with Cambridge Analytica until December 2015.
“We quickly shut down his app, demanded he delete all the information (which he confirmed in a signed statement he had) and ended any research work with him,” Archibong said. “In hindsight, we should have followed up to confirm he had deleted the information, as well as notified the people impacted - both of which are now happening.”
The privacy scandal has Facebook in full damage-control mode. Executives have apologized repeatedly, the company refreshed its data and privacy policies in the US, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent 10 hours testifying before Congress earlier in April.
Next month, the European Union will begin enforcing its new General Data Protection Regulation, which explicitly applies to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.
The EU rules require consent forms to be written in plain language anyone can understand, targeting the legalese buried in pages of terms and conditions that few users actually read before clicking “I Agree.” The regulations also require companies to make it as easy for users to withdraw their consent as it is to give.

How To Take A Dick Pic
How To Take A Photo Of Your Junk That She'll Actually Appreciate
Page 1 of 2
It has never been easier to send a dick pic than it is in 2015. With relatively high-quality cameras attached to most mobile phones these days, it's possible for almost everyone with a penis to capture their junk and share it with the world instantly.
However, not everyone is happy to be on the receiving end of a dick pic, and historically, dick pics haven't found favor with many women. Traditionally functioning as little more than advertisements for the sender's size, dick pics are bombarded at women online — usually without consent — and they're almost always of dismal quality: low-lit, blurry pictures taken at unflattering angles with no erotic potential whatsoever.
Just over a year ago, I noticed that the dick pic was at crisis point, and so I created the blog Critique My Dick Pic (highly NSFW). It's exactly as it sounds: senders submit their pictures and I give them a detailed review, rounded off with a bold letter grade (“Thank you for submitting to Critique My Dick Pic. Your dick pic gets a D.”)
It's in everyone's best interests, senders and receivers alike, that the quality of dick pics improves, so if you wish to dabble in this particular X-rated art, please bear in mind the following tips:
When Not To Send A Dick Pic
Receiving an unsolicited dick pic can be a very hostile, unsexy experience for women, and it's crucial to send your dick pic strictly to someone you are sure wants to see it. A scattershot distribution approach on OKCupid or Snapchat is likely to be perceived as an annoyance rather than a turn-on, and you may find more welcome reception by asking an intimate partner if they would like to see a nude pic. Be aware, though, that very early in a relationship might not be the best time to propose a dick pic, and it is generally good policy to wait until after you are sextingor have had a nude volunteered to you first. Bear in mind, too, that not every woman will want to see a dick pic at all, or want to see one at all times. Err on the side of holding your dick pic in, because there is more to lose than gain by sending an ill-timed or unwanted nude.
What You Should Send
Once you are explicitly sure you have a willing recipient for your picture, it's time to compose and shoot your dick pic. Here's where things can potentially go downhill if you aren't careful: Sending a poorly composed dick pic is certainly worse than not sending one at all, so you will need to ensure that your dick pic stands out for the right reasons. Before you so much as start loading up your camera app, make sure that you aren't panicking about your size. Most mediocre dick pics stem from the sender's obsession with the size of their penis (whether large or small) and one of the worst things you can do is include an object for scale, like lighters or bottles — it's a common tactic, but it reeks of desperation. The worst dick pics are those that perform as advertisements for size rather than as erotic material, so remember to work with what you've got without obsessing about how big it is.
What are some other things to keep in mind? Read on...
There's the kind of bad movie that just sits there, unfolding with grimly predictable monotony. Then there's the kind where the badness expands and metastasizes, taking on a jaw-dropping life of its own, pushing through to ever-higher levels of garishness. “The Book of Henry,” directed by Colin Trevorrow from Gregg Hurwitz's script, is of the latter, you've-got-to-see-it-to-disbelieve-it variety.
The film's muted yet still rather flamboyant terribleness derives from the fact that it seems to be juggling three or four borderline schlock genres at once. It starts off as one of those movies about a precocious kid genius — and on that score, for half an hour or so, it's actually rather watchable. Then it evolves into a tale of the child abuser next door. Then it morphs into a disease-of-the-week weeper, at which point the awfulness is only just getting started. For “The Book of Henry” — I'm trying not to give too much away — is a movie about how an 11-year-old brainiac lays a trap for the child abuser, all as a way of taking everyone through the grieving process. It's not entirely clear whether you should be laughing, crying, or waving a white flag.
In the picture-postcard town of Cavalry, New York, Henry Carpenter (Jaeden Lieberher) lives with his feisty, affectionate, video-game-playing single mom, Susan (Naomi Watts), and his little brother, Peter (Jacob Tremblay), and he knows everything about everything. He knows how to play the stock market (and win!), which is why he handles the family finances. He knows advanced mathematics and medical science and how to build Rube Goldberg contraptions in his treehouse — and more than that, he knows how to feel and express things with adult emotion. He's not one of those Hollywood whiz kids whose head is bigger than his heart. He's a genius of humanity as well!
Jaeden Lieberher is the best thing in the movie. As Henry, he never smiles, but he's sly and quizzical and engaged, with a look of woodland-animal alertness that reminded me of the young Leonardo DiCaprio (remember him in “This Boy's Life”?). When Henry, using his binoculars and his intuition, figures out that Christina (Maddie Ziegler), the sweet but shy girl next door who is one of his sixth-grade classmates, is undergoing something terrible at the hands of her police-inspector stepfather, a real get-your-leaves-off-my-lawn type named Glenn Sickleman (Dean Norris), he's compelled to become her savior.
But then that pesky illness gets in the way. All the objections one might raise to a movie that features a tragic ailment crashing in out of nowhere are at play here: that it's a way of manipulating the audience, of programming our responses rather than earning them. Trevorrow, whose one previous major credit is the highly impersonal stomp machine “Jurassic World,” knows a thing or two about programming responses, though he isn't bad with actors. He draws out Sarah Silverman as Susan's snippy boozer waitress pal, and Watts lets her feelings shine right through her skin. The actress doesn't hit a false note — at least, not until the disease drama gets put on hold. But it's here that “The Book of Henry” enters a zone of domesticated preposterousness.
At this point, we're asked to believe that Henry is such a genius that he can see and anticipate…anything. He can hold an entire conversation in advance (he'll know just what you're going to ask, and just when you're going to swear). The picture veers slowly and steadily into kitsch, especially during the sequence when it crosscuts between a grade-school talent show and an attempt to vanquish Glenn with a little old-fashioned justice purchased at a gun shop. We're supposed to be glimpsing the tale's grand design, but what we see, for the first time, is that the entire thing is a crock: a film dreamed up by people who are moving “human situations” around like pieces on a checkerboard.
More than half a kilogram of cocaine, worth about $51,000, was seized in northwestern Alberta after a four-month-long investigation by Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams (ALERT).
ALERT's Grande Prairie organized crime and gang team, along with the RCMP, made the seizure on April 13, after a home in the city's Mountview neighbourhood was searched and three people were arrested.

Investigators seized $20,960 in cash and 510 grams of cocaine. According to ALERT, cocaine is sold on the street for about $100 a gram.
Additional items suggesting drug trafficking were located, including packaging materials, scales and multiple cellphones.
“This is a significant amount of cocaine to take out of circulation in Grande Prairie,” ALERT Acting Insp. John Wilson said. “But we know there are more drugs out there on the streets, and we will continue to pursue drug dealers who pose a risk to the safety of the community.”

Three men were charged.
Ryan Lindgrin, 28, was charged with five counts of drug trafficking, two counts of possession for the purpose of trafficking, and two counts of possession of proceeds of crime. He remains in custody and will make his next court appearance on April 30. ALERT said Lindgrin also had an outstanding warrant from British Columbia for drug offences.
Brodie House, 30, was charged with two counts of possession for the purpose of trafficking, and two counts of possession of proceeds of crime. He was released on bail.
Patrick Rabbitt, 32, was charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking, possession of a controlled substance, and possession of proceeds of crime. He was released on bail.
ALERT said it began investigating in January after receiving information about suspected drug trafficking.
ALERT is a provincially funded agency that investigates serious and organized crime in Alberta, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and gang violence. Members include Alberta Sheriffs, Calgary Police Service, Edmonton Police Service, Lethbridge Police Service, Medicine Hat Police Service and RCMP.

Mirzapur: Eight persons were arrested on Monday for allegedly beating up and molesting a woman from Varanasi and leaving a French national injured when he tried to intervene.
UP Police maintained that no attack was made on the French national.
The woman along with a group of French tourists and her relatives was visiting the Lakhania Dari Waterfall when the incident took place. A police spokesperson said, "No attack was made on any French national, but a French national sustained injuries as he tried to intervene in an altercation between two groups of Indians."
The French national sustained injuries on his hand, police said.
He said the woman, a resident of Varanasi, was molested by some persons and was also beaten up.
"The vehicle by which she had come to Mirzapur carried about half a dozen French tourists," he said.
The woman later filed a complaint with the police, based on which the eight persons were arrested, the official added. The spokesperson said that on Sunday the woman in her police complaint had alleged that nearly a dozen persons molested her and beat her. She said her relatives too were beaten up by the men.

DETROIT — A Michigan man kicked and punched a bear to protect his dog earlier this month, authorities say.
According to a report from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, a man let his beagle out on a leash at 4:30 a.m. in the Boyne Falls area, which is near Three Bears Mountain Nature Preserve. When he went back outside to let his dog in, he saw a bear running up his driveway. The bear began swatting at the barking dog, so the man kicked the bear as he tried to get his dog in the house to safety.
Then the bear bit the dog. The man punched the bear in the nose, which caused the bear to retreat and allowed the man to take the dog into the house.

The beagle needed several stitches in its side and rear end, according to the report.
Andrea Erratt, a conservation officer for the DNR, answered the complaint and gave the man several tips to keep bears away in the future, including removing bird feeders, cleaning up sunflower seed husks, spreading moth balls and not feeding food to deer and turkeys.

Emma Watson is a huge advocate for gender equality and is renowned for her feminist activism. So it should come as no surprise that the 27-year-old English star used an appearance at the 2018 Academy Awards after-party to make a statement about the culture of sexual harassment and inequality in Hollywood. Unfortunately, Watson's show of female solidarity did not get people talking about the issues of the day. Instead, observers commented on a mistake she made that was unusual for the young actress and academic.
Emma Watson found worldwide fame at a very early age. When she was just ten years old, the fresh-faced little girl was cast as Hermione Granger in the first of the film adaptations of J.K. Rowling's wildly popular Harry Potter book series. The child star effectively grew up on the sets of those blockbuster movies. Just into double digits for 2001's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, by the time the last installment, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, was released in 2011, Watson was an adult.

Nonetheless, Watson's public persona would forever be entwined with the character of Hermione, because on the face of it the pair were very alike. Both were young women who had a passion for fighting injustice, both were very intelligent and aced all their classes, and both were sticklers for grammar. And that is why Watson's statement at the Oscars party came as such a big surprise – Hermione would have been absolutely appalled! Not least because Watson graduated from the Ivy League's Brown University in 2014 with a B.A. in English literature.

Amid a spate of lynchings purportedly triggered by messages on its platform, WhatsApp on Wednesday said it is "horrified" by the "terrible acts of violence", and outlined steps being taken by the company to curb abuse of the messaging platform.The government had, on Tuesday, issued a stern warning to the social media platform asking it to take immediate measures to prevent the spread of "irresponsible and explosive messages". It has categorically told the popular messaging platform that it cannot evade its accountability on the issue.In its response to the IT Ministry's missive, WhatsApp has said false news, misinformation and spread of hoaxes are issues that need to be dealt with collectively, by government, civil society, and technology companies working together."WhatsApp cares deeply about people's safety, which is why we designed our app with security in mind...," it said.The company also said it follows a two-pronged approach that includes giving people controls and information they need to stay safe, and working proactively to prevent misuse on WhatsApp.In its detailed response sent to the IT ministry, a copy of which has been seen by PTI, WhatsApp has listed out the various measures being undertaken by the platform to curb spread of false news and misinformation. These include product controls, digital literacy, fact-checking advocacy and proactive actions to tackle abuse."We also respond to valid law enforcement requests to help them investigate crimes. And soon, we will start an engagement program with law enforcement officials around India so they are familiar with our approach and how we can be helpful," it said.WhatsApp said it is keen to share "best practices" on how the platform can be used by local police as a resource for their community.The government's warning to WhatsApp came in the wake of a spate of incidents involving lynching of innocent people because of certain "fake and motivated" messages purportedly circulated on the widely used messaging app.Last week, five people were lynched in Dhule district in Maharashtra on suspicion of them being part of a gang of child-lifters. In a similar incident in Tripura recently, two people were lynched and six others thrashed. Assam, too, witnessed a case of lynching last month on similar ground.

“Collecting all of these items has been my great joy,” Young said in a statement. “They have provided a source of inspiration, fun and creativity throughout my life. Now it is time to share them with others in the world whom I hope will enjoy and love them as much as I have.”
Security forces killed a PKK terrorist on the most wanted list during a counterterrorism operation in eastern Tunceli province, local officials said on Tuesday.
Gendarmerie forces launched an operation in a rural area of the Hozat district on Tuesday evening and killed the terrorist following a clash with members of the terrorist group, the Tunceli governor's office said in a statement. The exact date of the operation was not mentioned. The terrorist was identified as Mustafa Şeker, codenamed Berhudar-Genco.
Şeker was in the grey category of the Interior Ministry's list of wanted terrorists, said the statement.
Wanted terrorists are categorized by different color groups - red, blue, green, orange and gray - depending on the level of threat they pose for the country's national security. Red is considered the highest threat level. The red category includes figures such as U.S.-based Gülenist Terror Group (FETÖ) leader Fetullah Gülen, PKK senior figures Cemil Bayık, Murat Karayılan and Duran Kalkan and Daesh-linked İlhami Balı.
Earlier in May, the Interior Ministry announced that about 150 terrorists were killed in operations conducted between Sept. 1, 2016 and April 30, 2018 in eastern and southeastern provinces, including Hakkari, Bitlis, Tunceli, Şırnak and Diyarbakır, where the group has attempted to establish a strong presence and bases.
In its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK, a group listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the EU, has been responsible for the deaths of some 40,000 people, including women and children.

For 73 years, the name Hudson has been associated with fine jewelry in Granite City.
While still in high school, Virgil Hudson, 89, began working at the shop of his father and business founder Roy Hudson when it first opened in 1944. Following four generations of family support, Virgil and Rosalie are preparing to close the doors of their longest-lasting location on June 17.
“We're celebrating our retirement by having a tremendous sale on all of our merchandise,” Rosalie Hudson says.
Customers can save up to 70 percent on wedding bands, diamond rings, pendants, necklaces, bracelets and more over the next few days.
Hudson Jewelers' roots date back to the days at 19½ State St. in downtown Granite City. Roy and Virgil originally worked with Virgil's brother, Jim, preparing and eventually selling watches. As the business grew, Hudson Jewelers moved to a larger store on the corner of 19th and State streets. In 1950, Virgil married Rosalie and the couple joined Glik's and a number of other local businesses when the first area shopping center, Bellemore Village, found its home in Granite City. In 1970, Hudson Jewelers significantly expanded its showroom.
Longtime Granite City residents, Virgil and Rosalie support numerous area charitable organizations, including Allison's Friends of Hope, Edwardsville Neighbors in Need, and Partners 4 Pets.
In keeping the business in the family, Virgil and Rosalie's children and grandchildren have taken on major responsibilities over the years. Their son John is the president of Hudson Jewelers, and his wife, Jane, is the manager.
“The integrity of their management and wonderful staff is credited with earning the respect and loyalty of many great customers and friends,” Rosalie says.
Rosalie also credits granddaughter Lisa Hudson, graduate gemologist and marketing director, with pursuing a presence at their newest location in Edwardsville.
“Their goal is to continue to be the real competitive edge for diamonds and fine jewelry in this community and surrounding areas,” Rosalie says.
Rosalie says the couple plans to “relax a little” but keep in touch with the company and some of the most loyal and memorable customers.
“We've always been honest and amazingly interested in customers,” she says. “Generations of people have become good friends.”
One of the most memorable anecdotes Rosalie can recall involves a man whose 5-year-old daughter had an affinity for “cinnamon treats from Taco Bell.”
“One evening, he promised her a present if she ate her dinner,” she says. “When she was finished with her dinner, she received her gift. She looked up at her dad and said, ‘Dad, this is not a present; a present is from Hudson's.'
“We've had wonderful, wonderful customers,” she says. “I wouldn't even know where to start. We'll definitely miss them.”
Through following the wisdom of the Golden Rule in “always treating people how you want to be treated,” Rosalie says the Hudson experience has been nothing but a joy for more than 60 years.
“It has not been a stressful struggle at all,” she says. “I'm going to miss it here, because we've done it for so many years.”

Çekmeköy Municipality's 3rd International Short Film Competition is now accepting applications. The introductory meeting for the competition, which has neighborhood as its theme, was at the Turgut Özal Cultural Center. Speaking at the meeting, Çekmeköy Mayor Ahmet Poyraz said that Turkish society has forgotten neighborhood values.
He said that the Prophet Muhammad had also spoken about the importance of sharing. "If there is some who can sleep while his or her neighbor is hungry, our services have no meaning," Poyraz said.
"Not only as individuals, but we as a country come to neighboring countries' assistance. We want to bring to mind a value that has gone through a change after modernism with this theme."
'We are grandchildren of ancestors who know laws of neighborhood and brotherhood'
Çekmeköy Deputy Mayor Şahmettin Yüksel, who is also the coordinator of the competition, said that cinema is an important part of art. "We continue to organize art and culture events as the municipality since we think that art revives nations. We held our short film competition under the themes of mercy and justice in 2016, and July 15 betrayal and resistance in 2017 in this context. We chose neighborhood to be the theme of this year's competition."
He said Anatolia is a neighbor of many societies of different languages, religions and communions. "We are the ones who will transfer this neighborhood culture to the next generations as the children of these lands. We are the grandchildren of ancestors who know the law of neighborhood and brotherhood. Neighborhood is a tradition that we have sustained for centuries together with Islam."
'Nation that comes to everyone's assistance regardless of place or border'
"Culture is the spirit of a nation and the potion of life. It is one of the steps that provides salvation and rising. A nation can't continue without culture like a body without a soul can't live. The basic function of culture is to lay a bridge between us and the next generations, sustaining our traditions and values. We first want to serve our culture with the theme of neighborhood because we are a nation that comes to everyone's assistance regardless of place or border," Yüksel said.
Jury member Birol Güven said that "Seksenler" (The '80s), which he wrote, is a TV series about the neighborhood.
Güven said new films should be shot with the theme of the neighborhood, and added: "Short filmmakers do something against something. They don't have enough budget and can't spend money. Therefore, they need to find ideas. This is why the best ideas are created by short filmmakers instead of feature filmmakers. We expect big ideas in this competition. Ideas are free."
In the meeting, Çekmeköy District Governor Cemal Hüsnü Kansız, Justice and Development Party (AK Party) Çekmeköy District Branch Head Salih Kırıcı and winner of the 2nd Çekmeköy International Short Film Competition Caner Menemencioğlu spoke, as well. The pre-selected board of the competition, which will accept applications until Sept. 1, include producer Ferhat Eşsiz, director Sinan Serter, scenarist Elif Eda Karagöz, journalist Bünyamin Yılmaz and actor Adnan Erdoğan. Actor Burak Hakkı, writer and sociologist Erol Erdoğan, journalist Betül Soysal Bozdoğan, actor Turgay Tanülkü, musician Mehriban Zeki and director Ahmed Imamovic will be on the jury. A total TL 65,000 ($16,500) in prize money will be awarded.

Genes tell cells what to do—for example, when to repair DNA mistakes or when to die—and can be turned on or off like a light switch. Knowing which genes are switched on, or expressed, is important for the treatment and monitoring of disease. Now, for the first time, Caltech scientists have developed a simple way to visualize gene expression in cells deep inside the body using a common imaging technology.
Researchers in the laboratory of Mikhail Shapiro, assistant professor of chemical engineering and Heritage Medical Research Institute Investigator, have invented a new method to link magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals to gene expression in cells—including tumor cells—in living tissues. The technique, which eventually could be used in humans, would allow gene expression to be monitored non-invasively, requiring no surgical procedures such as biopsies.
The work appears in the December 23 online edition of the journal Nature Communications.
In MRI, hydrogen atoms in the body—atoms that are mostly contained in water molecules and fat—are excited using a magnetic field. The excited atoms, in turn, emit signals that can be used to create images of the brain, muscle, and other tissues, which can be distinguished based on the local physical and chemical environment of the water molecules. While this technique is widely used, it usually provides only anatomical snapshots of tissues or physiological functions such as blood flow rather than observations of the activity of specific cells.
“We thought that if we could link signals from water molecules to the expression of genes of interest, we could change the way the cell looks under MRI,” says Arnab Mukherjee, a postdoctoral scholar in chemical engineering at Caltech and co-lead author on the paper.
The group turned to a protein that naturally occurs in humans, called aquaporin. Aquaporin sits within the membrane that envelops cells and acts as a gatekeeper for water molecules, allowing them to move in and out of the cell. Shapiro's team realized that increasing the number of aquaporins on a given cell made it stand out in MRI images acquired using a common clinical technique called diffusion-weighted imaging, which is sensitive to the movement of water molecules. They then linked aquaporin to genes of interest, making it what scientists call a reporter gene. This means that when a gene of interest is turned on, the cell will overexpress aquaporin, making the cell look darker under diffusion-weighted MRI.
The researchers showed that this technique was successful in monitoring gene expression in a brain tumor in mice. After implanting the tumor, they gave the mice a drug to trigger the tumor cells to express the aquaporin reporter gene, which made the tumor look darker in MRI images.
“Overexpression of aquaporin has no negative impact on cells because it is exclusive to water and simply allows the molecules to go back and forth across the cell membrane,” Shapiro says. Under normal physiological conditions the number of water molecules entering and exiting an aquaporin-expressing cell is the same, so that the total amount of water in each cell does not change. “Aquaporin is a very convenient way to genetically change the way that cells look under MRI.”
Though the work was done in mice, it has the potential for clinical translation, according to Shapiro. Aquaporin is a naturally occurring gene and will not cause an immune reaction. Previously developed reporter genes for MRI have been much more limited in their capabilities, requiring the use of specific metals that are not always available in some tissues.
“An effective reporter gene for MRI is a ‘holy grail' in biomedical imaging because it would allow cellular function to be observed non-invasively,” says Shapiro. “Aquaporins are a new way to think about this problem. It is remarkable that simply allowing water molecules to more easily get into and out of cells in a tissue gives us the ability to remotely see those cells in the middle of the body.”
The paper is titled “Non-invasive imaging using reporter genes altering cellular water permeability.” In addition to Shapiro and Mukherjee, other coauthors include Caltech graduate students Di Wu (MS '16 and co-lead author) and Hunter Davis. The work was funded by the Dana Foundation, a Burroughs Wellcome Career Award at the Scientific Interface, the Heritage Medical Research Institute, and the National Institutes of Health.
This statement was originally published on mfwa.org on 8 December 2017.
Sulemana Braimah, Executive Director of the MFWA, highlights the deteriorating state of Press Freedom in Guinea.
Until January 2017, The Gambia was the most notorious country for press freedom violations in West Africa. For 22 years, the country's brutal dictator, Yahya Jammeh, subjected journalists and human rights activists in the country to severe abuses including enforced disappearances, torture and extra-judicial killings.
Press freedom conditions in The Gambia are steadily improving since Jammeh fled into exile on January 21, 2017 after suffering an unexpected electoral defeat in the December 1, 2016 polls and compelled by regional forces to relinquish power.
In a recent report assessing the situation in The Gambia a year after Jammeh's exit, Vivian Affoah, a senior programme officer at the Media Foundation for West Africa (MFWA) highlighted significant and positive changes to the general freedom of expression environment in the country over the one-year period.
While the press freedom situation in The Gambia over the last one year has been refreshing and inspiring, events in Guinea have been deeply distressing. In what seems like a race to become West Africa's next worst violator of media freedoms, President Alpha Condé's regime is fast becoming infamous for presiding over several media rights violations.
Just like former President Jammeh, President Condé, 79, has now jumped into the business of personally issuing orders to the Guinean media on what not to publish or broadcast. In what the MFWA referred to as "Presidential Censorship," President Condé on November 25, 2017 ordered the Guinean media not to provide coverage for or grant interviews to the Deputy Secretary General of the country's teachers' union, Aboubacar Soumah. The teachers had been on strike for weeks; an action President Condé described as a rebellion by the teachers' union.
Ironically, President Condé, who took over as Chairman of the African Union in January 2017, issued his censorship order while addressing the 46th meeting of the International Union of the Francophone Press in the capital, Conakry. The President did not only issue a censorship order. Contained in the order was a threat to shut down any media outlets that will violate the censorship order.
In just two days, the President's censorship order was enforced. A popular radio station, BTA FM, located in the city of Labe, 450 km north of Conakry, was shut down. Local gendarmes (a para-military force) stormed the premises of the radio station and shut it down on the instruction of the governor for the Labe region shortly after the station had interviewed the censored teachers' union leader.
Journalist Alpha Oumar Fogo, who interviewed the teachers' union leader, was together with his colleague, Mamadou Saïdou Diallo, taken to the department of national security for interrogation. The two were released after three hours following public agitation.
A day after the closure of BTA FM, 40 leading radio stations in the country, reportedly ceased broadcasting for 24 hours. The action by the radio stations was in solidarity with BTA FM and to protest the Presidential media censorship and the growing culture of repression of freedom of expression in the country.
Prior to the infamous censorship order by President Condé, there had been a series of media rights violations in the country mostly perpetrated by state agencies or officials. On October 30, 2017, the national Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (ARPT) disrupted the transmission of Radio Gangan for four days. The action followed rumours that President Condé had died, which was falsely attributed to the station.
In addition to the disruption of its transmission, the radio station's Editor-in-Chief, his deputy and the Commercial Manager, were taken into custody by security forces on accusations of 'spreading false rumours.' The three were released hours later, only for the general manager of the station, Aboubacar Camara, to be arrested and detained by gendarmes the following day.
To add to the wave of violations, gendarmes beat up several journalists from across Conakry who turned up at the offices of the para military group on October 31 to show solidarity with Camara following his arrest. The equipment of many of the affected journalists were also destroyed. Following the incident, a group of journalists' associations lodged a complaint at a court in Conakry against the Squadron of the Gendarmerie for the assault on the journalists. The case is yet to be heard.
Three days after Camara's arrest, (November 3), the media regulatory body, Haute Autorité de la Communication (HAC), suspended Espace FM and all its relay outlets across the country for one week. The suspension followed a discussion on the radio station about the poor state of military garrisons in the country.
In connection with the same broadcast, Moussa Moïse Sylla, General Manager of Espace TV, who was a discussant on the radio programme, was on November 15, formally charged with "divulging military secrets." Judgment for the case has been set for December 25, 2017.
Earlier in August, a journalist with one of the most influential news websites in the country www.aminata.com was attacked by political party supporters while another was unlawfully detained by a police officer who forced him to delete his recordings. The Management of the publication later issued a statement complaining of lack of redress for acts of aggression suffered by its reporters, despite formal complaints to the authorities.
As the violations multiplied, President Alpha Condé came out to express 'deep concern.' But in what turned out as a shock to the media and freedom of expression advocates, the President rather complained that public reactions to the violations were exaggerated. "As soon as a journalist is arrested, hell breaks loose," President Condé said. "Meanwhile, in the countries considered to be democratic, journalists are arrested every day and nobody says anything." This controversial remark was the prelude to his censorship order on the teachers' union leader.
In the first quarter of 2017, the MFWA reported in its quarterly report titled West Africa Free Expression Monitor, five incidents of press freedom violations including a crackdown on student demonstrators resulting in seven deaths, two cases of physical attacks, one incident of arbitrary detention and one incident of interrogation.
The unending spate of press freedom violations has attracted the attention of not only the media community in the country. Civil society is beginning to speak up about the problem. Head of the coalition of civil society organisations in Guinea, Dr. Dassa Koroma, recently condemned the rampant attacks on journalists and other forms of media rights violations and urged the media and civil society community in the country to stand up and defend press freedom.
Guinea, one of Africa's poorest countries that was hit by the recent deadly Ebola epidemic, has traditionally had a repressive press freedom environment. In the 2017 edition of the global freedom of the Press index by the US-based media rights group, Freedom House, Guinea and The Gambia were the two countries in West whose press freedom was rated as "not free." The island country of Cape Verde was rated as having a "free" media environment while the rest of the countries in the region were rated as having a "partly free" media landscape.
The transitional government which returned Guinea to democracy in 2010 after recent military interventions, passed Law /2010/002/CNT of June 22, 2010 to decriminalise press offenses as well as give citizens a legal right to information with the adoption of a Right to Information Law /2010/ 004/ CNT/.
Hopes were high when President Condé assumed the leadership of Guinea in 2010 after winning in a tightly-contested and contentious election. Condé became the country's first freely elected leader and promised to strengthen democracy in the country.
On the evidence of the press freedom violations enumerated above, one can say that the Guinean authorities have failed to practically deliver on the good intentions of the transitional administration with regard to press freedom and democratic accountability. Now in his second five-year term, which ends in 2020, President Condé's regime is viewed by many as one that has further worsened the state of press freedom in the country.
Over the years, there has been relatively limited press freedom advocacy and media development support initiatives by international organisations in Guinea. The local media advocacy groups in the country have also been quite fragmented and weak.
Guinea has been one of the most troubled countries in the region and obviously one of the countries requiring urgent support for democratic strengthening and consolidation. A stronger, independent media is one of the critical requirements for improving governance in Guinea. It is, therefore, crucial for regional and international media support groups to put Guinea on the front burner for media rights advocacy and media development support ahead of the country's 2020 elections. Guinea must not be allowed to become a hell for journalism in West Africa.
According to Freedom Forum, anti-press incidents have declined in Nepal since April 2017 but the policy environment is still regressive.
Freedom Forum monitored FoE during the elections as it concerns citizens' freedom of expression through the ballot box. Therefore, any action creating an unfavourable atmosphere for the elections is also a violation of freedom of expression.
Press freedom shows slight improvement, but remains abysmally low A recent HKJA survey indicates a slight rise in the Hong Kong Press Freedom Index after two consecutive years of decline. Journalists on the ground believe that the situation has worsened in 2016, compared to the year before. HKJA chairperson Sham Yee-lan explained that the slight increase in the Press Freedom Index was likely to be related to the emergence of online media, which has led to some diversity in the industry.

Greek Cypriots are gearing up for a presidential runoff on Sunday, barely seven months after the latest failure to reunify the eastern Mediterranean island nation of Cyprus.
President Nicos Anastasiades of Greek Cypriot Administration, internationally recognized as the Republic of Cyprus founded in 1960, is looking to reprise his triumph over left-leaning Stavros Malas in 2013 when the two men faced each other. Earlier polls had shown Anastasiades beating Malas convincingly in Sunday's runoff, but Malas' strong showing in last weekend's first round of voting might make it a closer race.
Voters are skeptical about whether anyone can lead them out of the labyrinth of the decades-old division with Turkish Cypriots.
Cyprus was divided into a Greek south and a Turkish north in 1974 when Turkey conducted a military intervention following a coup by supporters of union with Greece. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), proclaimed in 1983, like its predecessor, Turkish Federated State of Cyprus, is only recognized by Turkey.
Anastasiades, 71, who says it will be his last term in office if re-elected, is counting on his track record of turning the economy around after a 2013 financial crisis that saw unemployment soar and salaries slashed. He has also been trumpeting his role in steering peace talks with Turkish Cypriots farther than anyone else since the 1974 split.
By contrast, the 50-year-old Malas is hoping his relative youth will strike a chord with the 550,000 eligible voters, many of whom are disillusioned by the acrimonious breakdown of the latest round of peace talks and years of economic uncertainty that's shaken the confidence of the middle class.
Anastasiades and Malas secured 35.5 and 30.2 percent of the vote, respectively, in the first round, setting up potentially a tighter than anticipated final vote.
Both were busy trying to reach out to the supporters of candidates that have been eliminated, notably those of the center-right Nicholas Papadopoulos, son of late former President Tassos Papadopoulos, who came in third with more than 100,000 votes — or 25.7 percent of the vote.
Nicholas Papadopoulos backs a tougher approach to the peace talks, arguing that both final candidates have been willing to make too many concessions to Turkish Cypriots. Papadopoulos and the coalition that backed him have decided not to endorse either candidate in the runoff.
Conscious of Papadopoulos' sizeable voter support, Anastasiades and Malas have sought to ease concerns about how far they're willing to go in peace talks. Both insisted that they wouldn't agree to a Turkish demand to incorporate military intervention rights and a permanent troop presence into any peace deal.
Turkey's intentions on Cyprus lie at the root of Greek Cypriot fears, and political leaders broadly agree on the need to lift Ankara's hand from a reunified Cyprus. Anastasiades has repeatedly said that Turkey wants to turn the island into its "protectorate." Whereas Turkey has repeatedly accused Greece and Greek Cypriots of hampering peace talks through irreconcilable demands as Turkish Cypriots already suffer from trade and movement restrictions.
A recent opinion poll found that nearly 90 percent of Greek Cypriots don't believe there will be an agreement any time soon.
Aiming to keep hopes for peace alive, both candidates said among their first acts in office if elected would be to approach Turkish Cypriot President Mustafa Akıncı in hopes of reviving negotiations.
Most voters who supported Papadopoulos will cast their ballots for who they consider the least bad candidate, political analyst Giorgos Kentas said.
With both Anastasiades and Malas perceived to be on the same page regarding peace talks, voter preference may boil down to which candidate voters trust most to deliver the most benefits from an economy on the mend.
Anastasiades says a Malas presidency will bring in a period of overspending that will hobble the economy once again.
Malas argues that Anastasiades has little credibility — the incumbent backtracked in 2013 and accepted a rescue package from creditors that forced the seizure of savings over 100,000 euros in Cyprus' two largest banks.
He also says Anastasiades' fiscal policies are geared toward the wealthy rather than ordinary households that aren't reaping the benefits of an economy growing at around 4 percent, one of the highest in Europe.
Los Angeles: A middle school shooting that left two students injured in Los Angeles was the result of a semi-automatic handgun going off "by accident" in a 12-year-old girl's bag, police said.
A 15-year-old boy sustained a head wound, described as a "graze," while a girl of the same age was hit in the wrist in the incident at Salvador Castro Middle School in central Los Angeles on Thursday. Both are expected to fully recover, and the Los Angeles police said they did not believe the shooting was intentional.
An 11-year-old boy, a 12-year-old girl and a 30-year-old woman "had minor abrasions to the face area, some from glass," Erik Scott of the Los Angeles Fire Department said, adding that none of the three was struck by gunfire.
The suspect was arrested at the scene and charged in juvenile court on Friday with felony counts of being a minor in possession of a firearm and having a weapon on school grounds.
The girl, who is not being identified by authorities because of her age, is scheduled to be arraigned on Monday, according to the district attorney's office, which said it would not release any further information.
Some of her friends told reporters that she claims the gun "went off" when she dropped her backpack. "At this time, the information suggests that this was an isolated incident, involving the negligent discharge of a firearm, where innocent children and a staff member were unfortunately injured," the LAPD said in a statement.
Speaking on Friday on KNX Newsradio, Mayor Eric Garcetti said a single bullet apparently went through the girl's wrist and struck the boy near one of his temples before lodging in his neck.
Chief Steve Zipperman of the Los Angeles School Police Department said Thursday it was unclear how the gun wound up on the secure campus. "We have laws that mandate that parents who own guns, any adult who owns guns — any gun owner has an obligation to ensure that gun is locked inside a home," he added.
The image of 12-year-old children bringing guns into the classroom has reignited the long-running debate on America's epidemic of gun violence and the ready accessibility of weapons.
Los Angeles city attorney Mike Feuer said the incident should be a "call to action" for gun owners to ensure weapons are kept away from children while Los Angeles county supervisor Hilda Solis said she was "horrified" by events.
More than 33,000 people die annually in the US from gun-related deaths — two thirds of them suicides — according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

PENTICTON, B.C. — Mary-Anne Arsenault has rolled into Sunday's semifinal at the Scotties Tournament of Hearts.
Arsenault stretched her winning streak to nine games at the Canadian women's curling championship with a 6-2 over Northern Ontario's Tracy Fleury in Saturday's 3 vs. 4-Page Playoff game.
Arsenault is expected to play the loser of Saturday's 1 vs. 2-Page Playoff game between Manitoba's Jennifer Jones and Team Wild Card Kerri Einarsson in the semifinal. The winner between Jones and Einarsson advances to Sunday's final and plays the winner of Sunday's semifinal.
However, Jones and Einarsson were the only skips to have defeated Arsenault at this year's Scotties.
“In the game against Jennifer, we didn't play well,'' Arsenault said. “In the game against the Wild Card team, my team didn't play well. If we played like we did (on Saturday) we'll be right in it.''
Arsenault was particularly sharp Saturday curling at 97 per cent. Fleury, who struggled with her draw weight, shot just 74 per cent.
“The ice was a little quicker in this game than I thought it would be and it took me too long to catch on to it,'' Fleury said. “By the time I did, it was too late.''
Arsenault is bidding to win her first national women's championship since 2004 when she was a second with Team Canada's Colleen Jones.
“It's quite different (in 2018), but having the experience is helpful with the nerves,'' the 49-year-old Arsenault said. “I was definitely nervous (Saturday) morning. That wasn't anything compared to when we started making finals back in the day. I'm a much calmer player now.''

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hollywood's long awards season began to take shape on Monday with Golden Globe nominations that rewarded risk-taking and shone a spotlight on veterans and newcomers alike. Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's “The Shape of Water,” a magical drama about a relationship between a strange river creature and a mute cleaner, collected a leading seven nods, including the best drama, and director and acting nominations for Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins. “Above all, ‘The Shape of Water' is about love overcoming fear and embracing the Other,” Del Toro said in a statement. “The Post,” Steven Spielberg's pertinent drama about press freedom, followed with six nominations. The other nominees for the top best drama prize are British World War Two tale “Dunkirk,” gay romance “Call Me By Your Name” and the quirky dramedy “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.” The Golden Globes are chosen by about 90 journalists belonging to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, but they often foreshadow picks for the Oscars, the movie industry's highest awards. “The Shape of Water” and “The Post” are also among front-runners for Oscars in March. the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) announces its own nominations on Wednesday. “Call Me By Your Name” took 10 years to get made. It also brought first-time Golden Globe nominations for actors Timothee Chalamet, 21, and Armie Hammer, 31. Chalamet also appears in another Golden Globes contender, “Lady Bird,” though he was not nominated for that role. The Italian director of “Call Me By Your Name,” Luca Guadagnino, in a statement called it “a great cinematic romance that challenged conventions and proved that love is love.” Mother-daughter comedy “Lady Bird” got four nods, including for its star, Saiorse Ronan, and Laurie Metcalf, in her supporting role as the title character's mother. However, first-time director Greta Gerwig was snubbed in an all-male list for that category. Nominees for the 75th Golden Globe Awards, Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture, Drama category, (L-R) Timothee Chalamet, Daniel Day Lewis, Tom Hanks, Gary Oldman and Denzel Washington are seen in a combination of file photos. REUTERS/File PhotosOther the best comedy or musical film nominees included James Franco's ”The Disaster Artist,“ about the making of the 2003 box office bomb ”The Room; “Get Out,” a satire on modern race relations set within a psychological thriller, the P.T. Barnum musical “The Greatest Showman” and the ice-skating mockumentary “I, Tonya.” Australian actress and producer Margot Robbie, in her first Golden Globe nod, also was nominated for her starring role in “I, Tonya,” which tells the story of Tonya Harding and the infamous 1994 attack on rival U.S. figure skater Nancy Kerrigan. Allison Janney was nominated for playing Harding's mother. “There were a lot of people who said this project was impossible to make. I‘m really glad we didn't listen to them,” Robbie, 27, told Reuters. Slideshow (8 Images)Movie studio Twentieth Century Fox and its Fox Searchlight unit for independent film dominated the nominations, sharing a total of 27 nods. British actor Gary Oldman, 59, said he was “amazed, flattered and very proud” of his first Golden Globe nomination for his role as British wartime leader Winston Churchill in “Darkest Hour.” Triple Oscar winner Day-Lewis was recognized for “Phantom Thread,” which he has said will be his last as an actor. Other first-time Golden Globe movie nominees included Britain's Daniel Kaluuya for his breakout role in “Get Out,” Sam Rockwell as a dim-witted police officer in “Three Billboards,” and Vietnamese-American actress Hong Chau for her role as a dissident maid in “Downsizing.” For television, British royal series ”The Crown,“ ”Game of Thrones,“ ”The Handmaid's Tale, “Stranger Things” and “This Is Us” will compete for the best drama series award. “Black-ish,” “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” “Master of None,” “SMILF” and “Will & Grace” were nominated in the best TV comedy category.

Steve Edwards, the anchor of Fox 11's “Good Day L.A.” and a fixture in local television and radio for more than three decades, is leaving the morning news show.
A Fox spokesperson said that Edwards “is no longer employed” at the station but did not provide further details.
Edwards has also hosted such shows as KABC-TV's "AM Los Angeles," KCBS-TV's "Two on the Town" and "The Steve Edwards Show."
The mayor of Surrey says she will ask the federal government for $10 million in funding for anti-gang programs in British Columbia's fastest-growing city, where people are dealing with “emotional upheaval” after recent acts of gun violence.
Linda Hepner said Tuesday the money would be spent over five years after a task force aimed at preventing gang violence issued a report with six recommendations, including an expanded gang exit and outreach program that has been led by a combined police and border services unit for about 18 months in the province.
“We first piloted it and it's the only one in the country that I know of,” Hepner said.
“In less than two years, it's actually worked with more than 100 people that are in gangs. They've actually now got a chance to be part of a gang free future but that is in jeopardy because we need funding for that.”
Hepner said “dozens” of people have left gangs because of the program, which the province has committed to funding until the end of the year.
Surrey residents have held anti-violence rallies calling for action, including more RCMP officers, after two teenage boys were recently found shot to death on a rural road and a father and hockey coach was gunned down outside a home.
The task force, which Hepner led after launching it last October, also recommended more police enforcement and the launch of an initiative that would allow nightclubs and other businesses to ban alleged gangsters.
The expansion of early intervention programs to deter children from entering the gang lifestyle was among the recommendations, and Hepner said some kids lured into gangs are as young as 10 and come from a range of backgrounds.
“The profile is so different in British Columbia than anywhere else in North America,” she said. “They could be affluent, they could be poor, they could be middle income. They run the gamut here.”
Hepner said youths are joining gangs for difference reasons.
“Generally, those that are more affluent are out for glory and glamour,” she said. “The ones that are in more vulnerable economic circumstances have often been subject to trauma. Lots of them are subject to seeing domestic abuse, some of them not feeling that they fit in culturally and don't feel part of the community.”
Other recommendations include the development of strategies to help at-risk children and their families, as well as stronger neighbourhood-based and culturally appropriate programs.
The mayor is also calling for more funding from the provincial government.
The Public Safety Ministry announced $1.12 million in funding Tuesday to expand an anti-bullying program based in schools called Expect Respect and a Safe Education, or ERASE, in communities across the province where gang-affiliated behaviours have been identified. It said the strategy is designed to prevent, identify and stop harmful behaviours, whether they occur in school or online.
The task force in Surrey included citizens, people from the business community, police and a local member of Parliament. It said RCMP statistics suggest gang members involved in conflicts between 2014 and 2016 were age 23 on average and had committed their first criminal offence at the average age of 16.

It's not every teacher of trombone who brings a deep knowledge of human psychology to her lessons, but, then again, Michigan State University's Ava Ordman is no ordinary teacher. Since 2002, she has served as the professor of trombone at the university, a position she pursued after a winding career that took her from the Grand Rapids (MI) Symphony to clinical psychology and finally to teaching musical performance.
This summer, Ordman is being honored by her colleagues in the International Trombone Association with the Neill Humfeld Award which recognizes excellence in teaching. Speaking with MSU Today, she said that it's a particularly sweet honor as it highlights the role she has had in mentoring talent in others.
“I was thrilled, humbled and very honored to be considered for this award,” Ordman said. “I don't ever expect these things to happen to me. When I think about it, it brings a smile to my face and makes me feel that maybe I am doing right by my students.”
Equally at home in an ensemble as she is solo, Ordman began performing with the Grand Rapids Symphony at the age of 19. During her time there, she gave private lessons and taught part-time at the college-level, but ultimately felt the desire to pursue other passions. She went back to school and obtained her MA in Clinical Psychology and her LLP at the age of 41. Ordman began practicing in the Detroit area shortly thereafter but kept up her musical interests as a substitute trombonist for the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.
Today, she brings her past experience to bear on her teaching. Ordman's Michigan State colleagues and former students have noted that she is a teacher who demands excellence of her students, but one whoalso seeks to understand their varied perspectives. She takes pride in not just helping students grow as performers but as people as well.
“I consider it a privilege to be involved in the lives of young people who are developing and evolving as both musicians and as people. I hope that I have been able to help them in some way on their journey, because they have certainly enriched mine.”
Disney and Lucasfilm's first Star Wars Story movie is officially a big success. Rogue One just won its third weekend in a row at the box office. And in just over two weeks of release, it managed to become the second-highest grossing movie (at least domestically) of 2016. That should give them a lot of confidence as they head towards production on the young Han Solo movie. But they may be rethinking their original release date, given the success of both Star Wars: Rogue One and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
This isn't coming from Disney or Lucasfilm directly, so for now at least, it needs to be taken as a rumor, but the often reliable fan site Making Star Wars is reporting that the studio is looking to shift Han Solo: A Star Wars Story to a December release date. According to their sources, the movie will land in theaters on Thursday, December 13, 2018. Disney previously had the movie pegged for a May 25, 2018 release date. But after seeing the pattern of their movies being able to run the table in December, it makes perfect sense that they would want to move things around a bit.
The potential problem with releasing a Star Wars movie in May is that it is right in the heart of the summer movie season. Every studio in Hollywood wants to put their big movies out around that time and it has really made things incredibly competitive, especially in recent years with so many massive tentpole and franchise movies needing to find a home. Even though Han Solo: A Star Wars Story would still probably do very well (it is a Star Wars movie, after all), it could be limited by some stiff competition. In December, on the other hand, it is typically a little more free and clear. This year it seemed like Star Wars: Rogue One would have a tough second week with the release of Passengers and Assassin's Creed, but both of those bombed. Sure, that was in part due to poor critical reception, but people really liked the idea of watching Star Wars instead. There just isn't as much competition in that month and people appear to be hungry for something like Star Wars at that time.
We don't know much about the Han Solo movie right now, but we do know that The LEGO Movie and 21 Jump Street directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller are directing the Han Solo spin-off and that Alden Ehrenreich is set to play the legendary smuggler. In addition, Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke has been cast as the female lead, but her character hasn't been identified yet, and Donald Glover has been cast as a young Lando Calrissian. It has also been said that the movie will take place about ten years before the events of Star Wars: A New Hope and that Chewbacca will be in it, which only makes sense.
So far, the results of Disney's $4 billion purchase of Lucasfilm back in 2012 have been nothing if not profitable and that has largely been thanks to their December release strategy. Star Wars: Episode VIII will be continuing that pattern later this year when it finally hits theaters on December 15. If this rumor about the upcoming Han Solo movie turns out to be true (which it more than likely will), then it looks like Lucasfilm is planting their flag in December for the foreseeable future. December will soon become synonymous with Star Wars. At this time, Disney and Lucasfilm are currently seeking extras for Han Solo as it begins shooting in early 2017.
According to Michael McCarthy of Sporting News, ESPN's new morning show Get Up could be in for more major changes before football season begins. One of those could be adding a fourth member to the table with a football background.
The rumored names are Ryan Clark and the two that were originally rumored to be part of the show Booger McFarland and Damien Woody. The reason for this among others is to increase the ratings of an expensive show that has undoubtedly been a disappointment thus far.
If ESPN does plan to make a drastic on-air change, it should be in the opposite direction. One of the glaring weaknesses of the show has been the chemistry between Mike Greenberg, Michelle Beadle, and Jalen Rose. It often appears at least one of the three is left sitting quietly while the other two are bantering.
Whether they add another full-time co-host or have one appear more regularly – like Clark, McFarland, and Woody have done – it would only complicate things even more.
All three of them have experience with Greenberg from his days on Mike & Mike. It is beyond conceivable that the more one of them is on set, the more distance the hosts will become with Greeny and the fourth addition having one conversation and Beadle and Rose, who do NBA Countdown together, having another.
The tweak to be made on Get Up, if one is to be made, is to actually eliminate one of the chairs.
As shown with the new 6 pm SportsCenter, sports fans want nostalgia. Get Up has had disappointing numbers from day one, and the only logical reason is when people turn on ESPN in the morning they want what they are used to.
The quickest, easiest, most logical way to give the audience back what they want is to integrate more traditional SportsCenter highlights and interviews into the show. That strategy should be done with two hosts, not three or four. If they were to do this, it would seemingly be Rose – who is not a host – being eliminated from the mix.
There is a case to be made Rose can shine brighter focusing on the show Jalen & Jacoby and appearing across the network as the top NBA analyst.
It is still very early in the process for Get Up, but it has been clear that the audience is not fond of the show. Get Up should have received one of its biggest boosts during this time as portions of the playoffs, that are rating well (up 30% from 2017), have been airing on ESPN the night before.
Whether the morning show sees an on-air change or not, it should not be a change that only adds to the problem it already has, but instead one that utilizes a process of elimination.

Being a Milwaukee resident has its highlights and its setbacks, fortunately, one of the aspects that makes it great is its community outreach. Last week, the Milwaukee County Office on African American Affairs (OAAA) along with Community Vanguard organized a resource fair for people in need of some help.
“We want to be able to offer resources free of cost,” said OAAA Director Nicole Brookshire.
The resource fair, housed inside the Lincoln Park Pavilion, included organizations from all over Milwaukee. Members behind each booth were ready to answer whatever questions people might have regarding voting, job fairs, gun safety and more.
In addition, children were offered free haircuts and the chance to roller-skate around the parking lot.
“The goal was to involve everybody in the community,” said Kevin Barnes from Community Vanguard.
Given that it was the fair's first year, Brookshire and Barnes were noting what worked well and what could use improvement.
After visitors signed in and entered the fair, they were greeted with a plethora of options. Brookshire said some of the groups had worked with OAAA in the past whereas others she connected with on Juneteenth Day.
Behind one of the first tables sat County Clerk George Christenson. His booth offered information on voting and helped people register to vote.
“People are afraid it's difficult,” Christenson said on the common misconceptions surrounding voting.
He added that registering to vote is easy and that there needs to be a continued education on the electoral process so people feel more confident when entering a voting booth.
Milwaukee Fatherhood Initiative was another table. Amanda Williams explained that this organization offers programs to strengthen the relationships between fathers and their children.
It can help men with their housing, credit repair and driver's license. It also offers focus groups to help strengthen the relationship between parents, Williams said.
In addition to the resources provided, “Different resources can connect,” she said, and through that connection, they can help more people.
Amidst the tables, was one for the Sheriff's Office Community Relations. Deputy Kristine Camarillo was one of four officers ready to answer questions and talk to residents.
According to Camarillo, they decided to attend the fair to help promote access to resources and because they believe it's important to participate in community and youth events.
Attending events like these gives people an opportunity to have a more positive interaction with the police and opens a line of communication. Camarillo said, she and her fellow officers high-fived younger kids, and even talked to some troubled youth.
She added that one way to promote a safe environment where people feel secure is to report on any wrongdoings in one's area.
“I think that if you see something, say something,” she said
With the first official and annual resource fair complete, Brookshire and Barnes are looking forward to planning their next one. To find out when it's happening visit the OAAA's Facebook page.

A bill to bolster programs that help Iowa workers of today and the future acquire new skills passed the Iowa Senate without a dissenting vote today. Senator Craig Johnson, a Republican from Independence, said the bill will have “a huge impact” on the state's economy.
“One of the biggest concerns for businesses in the state is finding quality employees,” Johnson said. “The programs contained in this legislation are going to help reduce the skilled workforce gap in Iowa.”
Summer internship programs, new state financing for apprenticeships and mentoring for college students are all mentioned in the bill. While Democrats joined Republicans to support the measure, some questioned whether Republicans who control voting majorities in the House and Senate will follow through later with the money to make the programs run.
Senator Bill Dotzler, a Democrat from Waterloo, promised to eat the cover of a book about the so-called “Future Ready Iowa” initiative if that money is provided.
“I'm going to hope and pray that we can put our money where our mouth is and this isn't some phony marketing program to sound good at election time,” Dotzler said. “I'm tired of that.”
Dotzler was part of a “Future Ready Iowa” task force and the group's recommendations have been Republican Governor Kim Reynolds' top legislative priority.
“Everyone knows how important it is that we have a skilled workforce,” Reynolds told reporters earlier today. “Job creators, businesses all across the state, they are energized. They tell me business has never been better. They're projecting significant growth. They just need people.”
Democratic Senator Matt McCoy of Des Moines, who did vote for the bill, called it “to re-elect Kim Reynolds plan.” Early in the debate, Senator Nate Boulton, a Democratic candidate for governor, unsuccessfully tried to delete a section that calls for spending half a million dollars on marketing and promotional materials for the “Future Ready” effort.
“This is a pen that says ‘Future Ready Iowa' on it. It's being handed out to people that are going to be wanting Kibbie grants, but not able to get them,” Boulton said. “We're handing out bandannas to people that cannot get a Kibbie grant, but they're going to get a bandanna to tell them about it.”
Republicans like Senator Johnson say it's important to market the program, so people know there are options for training beyond a high school degree.
“Iowa employers continue seeking skilled workers to better compete in markets at home and abroad,” Johnson said.
The bill already passed the House unanimously last week and is headed to the governor for her signature.
It's that time of the year again in the Lowcountry of South Carolina, when alligators are found scrambling in strange places and scaring the heck out of residents in the process.
It happened again in the early hours of Easter. A Mount Pleasant family woke up to a terrifying Easter surprise: An alligator crawling on their second-story porch.
According to WCBD, Steve Polston came upon a 9-foot alligator that had busted through a screen door and moved furniture around the porch. The animal climbed a 15-foot staircase to get to the porch.
The family called the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. An official had to euthanize the alligator because it could not be moved, according to the Post and Courier.
State law requires alligators trapped after being a nuisance to be killed. Since relocation is not an option, when an alligator is “removed,” it is killed by a licensed alligator specialist, according to DNR.
South Carolina alligators move more in the springtime, as they make their way into warmer waters after hibernating during the winter and their movement patterns change as it gets closer to mating season. Last year, an alligator rang a doorbell, and one really big guy fell asleep on a porch.
As the BJP sets its sights on the southern states, party chief Amit Shah has pulled up the Karnataka unit for not going all guns blazing against the Congress on the recent income tax raids on minister DK Shivakumar.In one of the 20 meetings that he attended in Karnataka, Shah reprimanded state BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa for not taking up the I-T raids as a campaign issue. "What greater issue will you get other than the raids that point to corruption," he is said to have asked the state leadership.Yeddyurappa was rapped on why the Karnataka BJP unit hasn't gone ballistic over the raids that could have done serious damage to the state government.The central leadership is unhappy after having already lost ground on other issues such as the Lingayat religion demand and Hindi imposition.Party sources said state leaders, including Yeddyurappa, barely spoke on the raids issue because of their ties with Shivakumar. In fact, three years ago, Yeddyurappa and Shivakumar were co-accused in the same illegal land allotment case.Shah is said to have told Yeddyurappa to keep friendships and business partnerships aside and focus on politics “like a professional”.The rebuke seems to have worked and Yeddyurappa scurried to hold a press briefing, announcing a week-long agitation against corruption in the Congress government. The briefing also paved way for Shah to train guns on the Congress government on the issue of corruption."The Siddaramaiah government is the most corrupt in the country. It has no shame. Even after these raids, the CM hasn't dropped Shivakumar from the cabinet. Instead, they wear the corruption charges like medals. Why has Congress not sacked or suspended these people," Shah said.The party president also rapped office-bearers asking if they have engaged any of the 80 lakh new members who have enlisted with the party.This was apparently one of the first questions that Shah fired on his whirlwind three-day tour in Bengaluru to take stock of election preparedness. "It was like a classroom where the schoolteacher asks questions randomly, with some trick questions in between," said a BJP leader, who was part of these meetings in Bengaluru.Shah attended about 20 meetings with functionaries at different levels, held many rounds with the core committee over these three days.Almost every meeting ended with some grim faces, while some others were held accountable for not fulfilling their targets. He held meetings with district office-bearers, SC/ ST, OBC cells, MLAs and MPs, with leaders who have recently joined BJP deflecting from other parties, with leaders of constituencies where the BJP had failed to win a seat in the last election, with some spiritual gurus and RSS and its affiliate organizations.Over time, the issue of political killings will also get noisier as the BJP continues to blame the Congress government for politics of 'appeasement' and use it in the coastal Karnataka region as an election tool."They have willingly withdrawn many cases against SDPI workers who attacked the RSS cadre. For appeasement (of minorities), an environment of insecurity is being created," Shah said.

People across the city were coping with an excess of water late in the day.
Heavy rains sent water pouring through the roof of the concourse underneath the Fairmont Hotel at Portage and Main.
The rain came through the roof around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, knocking out ceiling panels and soaking the carpet.
Drivers also encountered difficult driving conditions due to the sudden downpour.

On Pembina Highway, water covered the road and quickly filled the Jubilee Underpass.
There are reports that as much as 60 mm fell in some parts of Winnipeg, including in the Tuxedo area, Linden Woods and Headingley.
Another Mohamed Salah masterclass helped Liverpool take control of their Champions League semi-final - but two late Roma away goals gave them a glimmer of hope for the second leg.
Liverpool, who last reached the final in 2007, breached the visitors' naively high defensive line five times in the opening 68 minutes at a raucous Anfield.
Salah, who has now scored 43 goals since his summer move from Roma, scored twice and assisted two other goals.
He curled his first into the top corner from the edge of the box - then clipped the ball over Alisson from the edge of the box for a second.
Salah then ran down the right and squared for Sadio Mane to make it 3-0 - before doing the same to set up Roberto Firmino.
Firmino then headed in a fifth following James Milner's corner.
With his side leading 5-0, Reds boss Jurgen Klopp took off Salah - and Roma gave themselves a shot for next week's return leg at the Stadio Olimpico.
First Edin Dzeko lashed home from Radja Nainggolan's pass - then Diego Perotti put a penalty into the top right corner after Milner handled Nainggolan's shot.
Roma can take inspiration from the last round when they lost 4-1 in Barcelona but won 3-0 in Rome to go through. The same scoreline this time would take them into the final against Bayern Munich or Real Madrid.
The Google Pixel 2 unveiling is still weeks away, but we might have seen what it and its larger variant, the Google Pixel 2 XL, will look like when they both come out later in 2017.
Beyond that, we've also gotten word of how much it will set you back to purchase one, the storage configurations that will be available and of course, the colors you'll have to choose between, all thanks to a massive info leak from DroidLife
Starting with the general design shown off in the latest leak, the rear of the Google Pixel 2 matches what we saw in information that surfaced a few weeks ago, showing its larger rear-facing camera sitting closer to the middle of the phone than it is off to the side.
We haven't yet had a look at the front of the Pixel 2, but comparing it with the Pixel 2 XL side-by-side doesn't reveal any visible differences, well, other than their colors and that the location of their rear-facing cameras don't match up.

Colorful Pixels
Supposedly, the smaller Pixel 2 will launch in three colors: Clearly White, Just Black and (my favorite) Kinda Blue. Bye, bye Really Blue. Like its predecessor, the front bezels will likely match the color scheme we see from the back.
The Google Pixel 2 XL colors take an interesting turn. It'll supposedly be available in two colors: Just Black and Black & White. While the former looks as you'd imagine it would, the latter variant adds a playful dash of orange for its power button. It's a weird, unexpected move and therefore, I need it right now.
In terms of pricing for the Pixel 2, the base model is reportedly staying at the same $649 (£599, AU$1,079 ) price point, but doubles the storage to 64GB. For $100 more, you can double the storage to 128GB.
The Pixel 2 XL will obviously be more expensive, but retains the same storage configurations. Starting at $849 (about £630, AU$1079, but surely to be more), the 128GB option will come to $949. Compared to the first-gen Pixel, which only required an extra $120 to jump up to the plus-sized XL, this is considerably more expensive. Hopefully, Google will have something to show for the hike up in cost.
You don't need to remind us that this is expensive. But will the cost be worth it? We'll found out in just a few weeks at Google's big event.

France's Macron to urge Trump to stick with Iran nuclear deal during US visit
U.S. President Donald Trump treated French President Emmanuel Macron to a colorful welcome ceremony at the White House on Tuesday during a state visit that threatened to expose differences on Iran, trade and Syria between two close allies.
A 21-gun salute echoed across the South Lawn and a flute-playing fife and drum corps, in red-coated uniforms and tri-corner hats, marched by Trump and Macron and their wives, Melania Trump and Brigitte Macron.
The two leaders were then to launch into a morning of talks expected to include how to salvage the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which Trump wants to withdraw the United States from unless European powers strengthen its terms.
European calls for exemptions from Trump's plan for 25 percent tariffs on steel imports are also on their agenda, as well as the U.S. president's desire to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria as soon as practicable.
Macron, whose visit will be followed by one on Friday from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, sees the Iran deal as the best available option to constrain Iran's nuclear ambitions. He has also called on Trump to keep troops in Syria.
Trump, in welcoming remarks, thanked France for joining with the United States and Britain in launching airstrikes in Syria earlier this month in response to a chemical weapons attack blamed on Syrian President Bashar Assad.
He said he and Macron had developed over the past year "a wonderful friendship" that is "a testament to the enduring friendship that binds our two nations."
Macron, in his remarks, called for the two countries to work together against terrorists, on North Korea and Iran, on "free and fair trade," and on climate change.
"It is together that we will counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, whether it is in North Korea or in Iran," Macron said.
He alluded to Trump's withdrawal last year from the Paris climate accord, saying "we do not always agree on the solution," but stressed "the fate of our children is at stake."
In the evening, the Trumps are to host the Macrons at the first state dinner conducted by Trump since he took power.
The Republican is the first president in more than 100 years not to hold a state dinner during the first year of his administration.
More than 100 guests are expected to attend. The official guest list will be released shortly before the event.
The White House said the color scheme for the dinner is cream and gold and food will be served on china from the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.
The Cross Hall of the White House will be decorated with more than 1,200 cherry blossom branches, while the dining room will feature white sweet peas and white lilacs.
Entertainment will be provided by the Washington National Opera.
Dinner will be prepared by White House executive chef Cristeta Comerford.
The White House said it will showcase "the best of America's cuisines and traditions, with nuances of French influences."
The opening course will be greens from the White House kitchen garden first planted by former First Lady Michelle Obama.
The main course will be a rack of spring lamb and rice jambalaya cooked in a New Orleans tradition.
Dessert will be a nectarine tart and creme fraiche ice cream.
Wines will come from both the United States and France -- a Domaine Serene Chardonnay "Evenstad Reserve" 2015 and a Domaine Drouhin Pinot Noir "Laurene" 2014.
The United States last held a state dinner for a French president in 2014, when Francois Hollande was hosted by president Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama.

TORONTO — A painting by Canadian artist William Kurelek sold in a Toronto auction for $472,000 — the second highest on record for the artist and more than double its estimated value of $150,000 and $200,000.
Consignor Canadian Fine Art says the 1972 paining, titled “Hot Day in Kensington Market,” is one of 21 works in Kurelek's “Toronto” series depicting life in the city where the Alberta-born artist found commercial success and raised a family.
The auction house says a second painting by Kurelek, “Hauling Hay,” fetched $94,400.
It says the most surprising result of Tuesday night's auction was a record set for Canadian artist Charles Comfort, whose piece “Smokestacks, Copper Cliff” sold for $33,040, which was six times its estimate of $3,000 and $5,000.
The painting is one of several preparatory sketches to the final canvas, “Smelter Stacks, Copper Cliff,” which is in the National Gallery of Canada's permanent collection.
All prices include an 18 per cent buyer's premium.
Meanwhile, Quebec-born abstractionist Paul-Emile Borduas will headline the Heffel spring sale Wednesday with the 1956 “Figures schematiques.”
The auction house says the painting could fetch between $3 million and $5 million, challenging Borduas's best price at auction, which was a canvas sold for $737,500 in 2015.
Auction house vice-president Robert Heffel says at roughly 1.3 metres by two metres, the canvas is the largest of Borduas's black-and-white paintings in private hands.
“Borduas was one of Canada's most important postwar contemporary painters,” Heffel says. “(The painting is) a culmination of his career.”
The Heffel auction will also feature eight works by the Group of Seven's Lawren Harris, a portrait by Emily Carr and a Tom Thomson painting that was recently recovered from an Edmonton grandmother's basement.

LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball have signed contracts to play with Lithuanian team Vytautas Prienai for the rest of the season, according to Harrison Gaines, the agent for those two players and Lakers point guard Lonzo Ball.
The two brothers will travel to Lithuania in the first week of January and have some family with them. LiAngelo, 19, began the season at UCLA, but withdrew from school last week amid an indefinite suspension. The school suspended LiAngelo and two teammates who were questioned by police for shoplifting while in China. The three players were required to stay in their hotel in Hangzhou until the local government decided not to press charges against them.
Last week the brothers hired Gaines. LaMelo, 16, had also been committed to UCLA, but his hiring an agent ensured he would never play college basketball.
The two brothers are in New York at the moment. Lonzo and the Lakers will play the Knicks on Tuesday. All three and their father, LaVar, participated in a pop-up shop in Manhattan on Sunday, a day the Lakers had off. Thousands of people lined up to buy merchandise and get autographs and photographs with the family.

Still no word on Google Store availability.
At Google's October 4 hardware event, one of the more surprising announcements was the Google Home Max – a beefed-up version of the regular Google Home with two 4.5-inch woofers, custom tweeters, 20 times the audio power, and a whole lot more. A listing in late November suggested that the Home Max would be released on December 11, and that appears to have been fairly accurate.
Spotted by Android Police, the Home Max is currently available for purchase at both Best Buy and Verizon Wireless for $399, but those are the only two retailers selling it at the time of publication. The Google Store still shows an option for joining a waitlist, and it's unclear exactly when this will change.
Best Buy has the Charcoal and Chalk variants available for purchase with free shipping by Wednesday, December 13, but Verizon only has Chalk with the Charcoal one apparently already sold out.

A study from The Auk: Ornithological Advances presents citizen science data which supports that American Crows and Northwestern Crows almost exclusively (97% of the time) instigate any aggressive interactions with Common Ravens no matter where in North America. The data showed that aggression by crows was most frequent during the breeding season, most likely due to nest predation by ravens. This study not only gives insight into interspecies dynamics, but also how citizen science data can aid behavioral studies at large geographic scales.
Cornell University's Ben Freeman and colleagues used more than 2,000 publicly collected and submitted observations from across North America via eBird to analyze the interspecific aggression between crows (American and Northwestern) and Common Ravens. From these records, it was determined that crows were the predominant aggressor. Crows primarily attacked in small groups rather than one-on-one confrontations with ravens. The breeding season was when most of the attack observations were made, suggesting that nest predation by ravens influences this behavior. Aggression during the winter is potentially explained by crows preemptively deterring nest predation and defending resources needed for nesting later in the year. This study was made possible by citizen scientists who were not even asked to submit such observations. Given this was passively collected data that aided in a behavioral study on a large geographic area, it could act as a model for other research and potential studies conducted.
Lead author Ben Freeman comments, “There are two take-home messages. First, we show that bigger birds do not always dominate smaller birds in aggressive interactions, and that social behavior may allow smaller birds to chase off larger birds. Second, this is a case example of the power of citizen science. It would be next to impossible for even the most dedicated researcher to gather this data across North America. But because there are thousands of people with expertise in bird identification and an interest in bird behavior, we can use data from eBird to study behavioral interactions on a continental scale.”
“Given that aggression between crows and ravens can be quite conspicuous, birders and the general public are often the observers of such interactions,” adds Kaeli Swift, who was not involved with the research, “yet despite the ease and frequency of witnessing these events, there was little scientific information for curious minds to turn to for explanation. It's quite rewarding then, that the citizen scientists that may have wished for this information are the very people whose observations made this publication possible.

Nagpur: The Maharashtra government tabled supplementary demands worth Rs 11,445 crore in the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday, including Rs 15 crore for the implementation of a pension scheme for senior journalists in the state.
The supplementary demands, which will come up for discussion next week, were tabled by Minister of State for Finance Deepak Kesarkar on the first day of the monsoon session of the state legislature. The government made a provision of Rs 15 crore for implementing the pension scheme for journalists, called Acharya Balshastri Jambhekar Sanman Yojana.
The provision has been made under the grants-in-aid (non-salary) to the Director of Publicity. The government also allocated Rs 250 crore to National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) as the state's share to the special purpose vehicle of Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project. The other significant demands include Rs 5 crore for the development and recarpeting of airstrips of Karad and Chandrapur airports.
It has been decided to provide additional funds of Rs 159.63 crore for the purchase of two helicopters for the air travel of very very important persons (VVIPs). As the provision made in the current financial year for the installation of CCTV surveillance system in the state is found to be insufficient, it has been decided to make an additional provision of Rs 35 crore for CCTV projects in Nagpur, Nashik, Aurangabad and other cities, it said.
It has been decided to make a provision for newly generated "basic infrastructure facilities" for the Naxal-hit Gadchiroli district. The Centre has provided Rs 5 crore funds under the special central assistance scheme, which needs to be revalidated and budgeted under this scheme.
Another demand of Rs 62 lakh has been presented for expenses associated with the commission of inquiry into the Bhima Koregaon violence. An advance from the contingency fund of Rs 52 lakh was taken earlier, which has been to recouped and an additional provision of Rs 10 lakh is being presented. An amount of Rs 7.9 crore has been made for the victims of the riots at Bhima Koregaon and Sanaswadi in Pune district in January this year.

The National Energy Board says crude-by-rail exports from Canada grew to a record 193,500 barrels per day in April, up 13 per cent from the previous month, as full pipelines forced more producers to use trains to get their products to market.
The oil shipping tally beat the previous record of nearly 179,000 bpd in September 2014 and was well ahead of the 150,000 bpd moved in April 2017.
Andrew Botterill, a partner with accounting firm Deloitte, says he expects rail shipments will continue to grow this year.

He says the increased use of rail will allow prices for Western Canadian Select bitumen-blend crude oil to strengthen as compared with New York benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude.
Botterill says demand for Canadian heavy oil is expected to increase as it will be needed in the U.S. Gulf Coast refining complex to replace shrinking volumes from Venezuela.
Deloitte forecasts global oil prices will fall back from recent three-year highs in the coming months as OPEC countries increase output and international demand for oil declines.

“Continuous decreases in Venezuelan production volumes, the possibility of sanctions enforced by the United States on Iran, and decreased oil stockpile volumes have escalated global oil prices,” the report says.
“However, these are expected to recede in coming months as OPEC members increase rates to fill void agreement volumes resulting from Iranian and Venezuelan production cuts.”

The Ontario Progressive Conservatives have released a blue light election platform.
Leader Doug Ford described his Plan For The People as “responsible, modest and practical.”
It lays out his election promises from beer and wine in the corner store to middle class tax cuts to cheaper gas to a cell phone ban in classrooms.
The PC plan puts $500 million toward initiatives to clean up the environment, $3 million annually to fund anti-gang and anti-gun police units, $30 million to hire new police officers and $100 million more for autism services.
But while it spells out the cost of individual commitments, the PC plan is not fully costed, meaning there are no projected deficit figures or estimates for overall spending and revenue.
Liberal Leader Kathleen Wynne said her party estimates that Ford would have to find $40 billion to cover the cost of his commitments.
“Eight days before an election every party should have a costed fully coherent plant to take to the people of Ontario,” Wynne said. “That's not what Doug Ford and the Conservatives have put out.”
The NDP posted a humourous photo online of Leader Andrea Horwath and supporters looking under a table for Ford's fully costed election platform.

HOW much is an American dollar worth? The glib answer is exactly one buck. But that is far from the case if the dollar in question is one of Zimbabwe's “bond notes”, the world's newest currency that is not officially a currency.
Zimbabwe adopted the US dollar as its official currency after the spendthrift regime of President Robert Mugabe printed so much of its own currency that it caused hyperinflation in 2008. The economy briefly stabilised; but old habits die hard. Last year the government again spent far more money than it raised, much of it on imports, causing scarce greenbacks to flow out of the country.
By the end of the year there were so few dollars still circulating that banks were limiting withdrawals to $50 a day, crippling the economy. In turn the central bank decided to issue a new currency, called “bond notes”, pegged to the US dollar and ostensibly backed by some $200m in actual dollars held in reserve. Shortly after the new notes were introduced many in Zimbabwe cheered their release, since they could withdraw cash from banks again and the notes seemed to be holding their value.
But two months on, the new notes, nicknamed “bollars”, are rapidly losing their value. People have discovered that they are not, in fact, convertible into real dollars. So they cannot be used to pay for imports—a real problem in a country that does not make much. Shops accepting bond notes can use them to pay local wages and suppliers or deposit them in their local bank accounts (which are still denominated in US dollars). But if they want to pay for imports to restock their shelves, they still have to queue for real dollars.
So desperate are shops for hard currency that they are offering discounts of as much as 50% to customers who hand over greenbacks. Some petrol stations now have separate pumps where the price of fuel is lower for customers who pay with hard currency cash instead of using a debit card. A number of shops in Harare have resorted to indicating two or three different prices for the same item—a US dollar cash price, a bond note price and a third price if one pays using a debit card.
Black marketeers have been quick to help out. Some are offering to convert bank balances into real dollars at premiums ranging from 5% to 30%. Among the buyers they sell to are travellers going abroad, who need to apply for permission to use their cards outside the country.
The big supermarket chains are not allowed to offer cash discounts or discriminate against customers who use bond notes or electronic cards. Instead they have simply raised their prices, particularly of imported goods. Even prices of local produce have also gone up significantly since December. A steak cut that would have sold for $8 per kilo last year now costs $13. A two-litre bottle of Zimgold, a local vegetable oil, which retailed in November for just under $3, is now marked at $3.55.
With consumer prices surging, the bond notes are proving to be exactly what many Zimbabweans feared they might be: the resurrected “Frankenstein” of their dead cousin, the Zimbabwe dollar, which burned itself out almost a decade ago. Unless the country changes tack, more economic misery looms. – The Economist

Rawalpindi - Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) high-ups have failed to include any mega project in the annual budget of fiscal 2018-19 for the provision of clean drinking water supply, construction of graveyard, improved sanitation and introduction of an efficient system for birth and death certificates despite collecting a million of rupees in tax from civilians. The board approved the annual budget for fiscal 2018-19 worth Rs3 billion while a major chunk of the budget has been allocated to the expenditure of the RCB officials. A sum of Rs175 million has been allocated for water supply projects only.
The budget session chaired by Station Commander Brig Shahzad Tanveer was held on Tuesday. At the session, 12 elected members led by RCB Vice President Malik Munir and a number of nominated members from military and civilian bureaucracy were present.
Cantonment Executive Officer (CEO) RCB Sabtain Raza presented the budget and the board approved the budget without any objection. After this, the annual budget would be forwarded to Military lands and Cantonment Rawalpindi Region Director for final approval within a day or two.
While presenting the budget, Sabtain Raza claimed that no new tax had been levied and there would be no change in property tax and water tariff in the next fiscal year. He said that the uplift projects worth Rs175 million would be launched in 10 wards of the cantonment areas equally without any discrimination.
As per the details of the budget, the total outlay of the annual budget is Rs3 billion and this year, Rs175 million was set aside for the uplift schemes for water supply.
The civic body estimated the total receipts are expected to stand at Rs1.2 billion from property taxes and other fees while earning of the civic body from other sources was estimated at 1.8 billion.
A sum of Rs450 million has been allocated for salaries and allowances of the staff while Rs221 million for ongoing projects.
According to plan, the civic agency will generate Rs650 million from property tax on commercial and residential properties and Rs200 million from water fees.
Rs1.5 million will be earned from fines imposed on shops and commercialization including Rs70 million from hoarding charges, Rs283 million from development charges on transfer of properties and others.
RCB Spokesman/Secretary Qaisar Mehmood told media that it would spend Rs175 million in new projects for roads, streets and water supply lines while Rs221 allocated for ongoing projects.
“The major chunk of the development funds will spend on the water supply schemes as the area was facing water shortage for last many years especially in the summer season,” he said.
Meanwhile, there has been no allocation of funds for the education, health and other civic facilities. The elected members did not raise any civic issue especially regarding the absence of graveyard for the civilian population in the cantonment areas. No civilian grave is allowed in the Army graveyard near race Course Park. “The RCB had to allocate the funds for the establishment of new graveyard but the annual budget was silent,” said a senior official of RCB.
He said that the sanitation branch was limited to cleaning the areas in and around the army installations and the work in civilian populated area was ignored for the past two years. “The main reason is that the lifting the garbage and dump at proper landfill site is main issue but the RCB collecting the fee from the people and do nothing in this regard,” he said.
Valentine's Day can be the sexiest day of the year. Well, unless your partner isn't feeling like her usual self because she's pregnant, vomiting, & bloated with feet three times their usual size. Then, it could just be another day for her to get through for her —or waddle through, as the case may be. As the partner of a pregnant woman, you may want to do everything in your power to make her happy, so here are nine sexy things you can do for a pregnant woman on Valentine's Day, and hopefully, you'll bring back that sexually-charged spark, even if it's just for a few hours. Note: results might be mixed.
Sexy, of course, can be in the eye of the beholder, but it could include many different things, from food gifts to back rubs. Even better? Foot rubs for their tired feet. Kind gestures at any point in her pregnancy (or really any point in the relationship) can be very sexy. There's never a bad time to bring flowers or jewelry, though this might not be the best time to indulge your own sexual fantasies with unsolicited lingerie or kinky sex toys. If you do try to get it on, remember that by the time she's spent all day growing that baby, doing the nasty with you may be furthest from her mind. Then again, with all those pregnancy hormones surging through her body, you may have a shot. Basically, follow her lead.
Some women say there's nothing sexier than the sight of their partner wielding a vacuum, so don't rule out a clean-house surprise for your Valentine. Or cook a dinner that isn't focused on prenatal nutrition. Whatever you do, approach it with a flexible mind and a sense of humor. Given that the "sexy" is quite possibly what got her into this pregnancy situation in the first place, if she's not feeling her best, she might not be up for it. But it's still worth a try!
1 Buy Her Granny Panties Giphy And tell her she looks hot AF in them. There will be time soon enough when she might choose form over function, but right now, function (and comfort) wins.
2 Sprinkle Little Red Foil Hearts At The Base Of The Toilet Giphy Since she may be vomiting all the time if she's in her first trimester or peeing all the time if it's her last trimester — or doing both during all those -mesters — the bathroom floor may be the only place she will see the romantic gesture.
3 Light Candles Around The Bedroom Giphy But make sure they aren't too smelly because strong smells make her kind of nauseous this day.
4 Help Her Shave Her Legs Giphy Towards the end, it's nearly impossible to bend over and shave. She may have high hopes of cleaning things up down there these days, but since that's nearly impossible, with a little help you can do it for her.
5 Ignore The Smelly Farts Giphy If it happens, just smile at her like she's the most wonderful thing in the world (and then you can quietly open a window and talk about how romantic fresh air can be).
6 Buy Edible Underwear For Yourself Giphy Edible underwear ($9, Amazon) comes in all sorts of flavors, including strawberry chocolate, passion fruit, and cherry. Buy several pairs because the truth is, she's pretty hungry these days and one just won't satisfy her. And the sexiest part? Letting her eat them straight out of the wrapper (not off your bod).
7 Make Some Chocolate Covered Strawberries Giphy The berries are good for mama and the baby. But don't say the word "champagne" and whatever you do, don't buy that sparkling apple juice that pretends to be champagne. That may be satisfying to a 6-year-old, but a pregnant woman does not accept mocktails as a celebration.
8 Buys Her A Vibrator Giphy At certain stages pregnant women are overflowing with hormones and pretty darn horny. The right "little toy" might be useful that night and might be a really nice thing for her to have around when she gets really needy and you're not there.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - For nearly nine years, the global hunt for yield sent you to one place: the U.S. stock market.
On Friday, stocks took their biggest pounding since 2016 after the U.S. government's monthly payrolls report showed the biggest wage gains for workers since 2009. That convinced investors the threat of inflation, long tame since the 2007-2009 recession, is growing larger, sending bond yields soaring.
With central banks having taken extraordinary measures to combat the financial crisis, driving interest rates to record lows and making safe assets like U.S. Treasuries a scarcity, investors of all stripes were forced to turn to equities.
But when what had been a stealth increase in U.S. rates over several months suddenly broke out into the open in the last week, investors were jolted awake to a new reality: Stocks are no longer the only solution for finding yield.
“One of the key mantras of the bull market has been stocks are inexpensive relative to bonds, and bonds are getting cheaper, especially at these highs,” said Michael O‘Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. “So people are taking profits and they probably should be.”
With the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond on pace to top 3.5 percent this year for the first time since April of 2011, risk-free bonds are becoming an increasingly attractive place for yield-focused investors.
At the current forward price-earnings ratio of 18.2, according to Thomson Reuters proprietary research, the S&P 500 index's earnings yield is 5.5 percent, well below the historic norm of around 6.7 percent. With bond yields rising across the spectrum, the 5.5 cents of profit that underpins every $1 in share prices on average begins to look thin by comparison.
“We don't have a line in the sand but 10-year Treasuries near 3 percent are starting to look a lot more attractive,” said Mike Dowdall, a portfolio manager with BMO Global Asset Management.
That rise in yields prompted a broad sell-off in stocks on Friday, as investors reacted to data from the U.S. Labor Department showing wages last month recorded their largest annual gain in more than 8-1/2 years.
Equities continued a five-day downward trend, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 2 percent for its largest one-day decline since September 2016. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 2.5 percent.
Meanwhile, a sell-off in bonds that has gathered pace this year intensified, with yields on 10-year Treasuries hitting a four-year peak.
That dynamic is putting pressure on areas of the market that had served as bond proxies. As a result, fund managers are rediscovering the risk of rising rates, selling out of assets ranging from high-yield “junk” bonds to utility stocks and pushing the broad S&P 500 lower.
Warning signs for equities have been long discussed, as the market hit almost daily fresh highs. On Friday, Merrill Lynch's bull-bear indicator, which has accurately predicted 11 out of 11 U.S. stock market corrections since 2002, hit a “sell” signal.
The rise in bond yields is “certainly beginning to concern the markets,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research in New York. “Rates have risen fairly quickly this year and the speed of the advance is worrying.”
The yield on the 10-year Treasury has risen to 2.84 percent from 2.46 percent at the start of the year, the swiftest rise since November 2016.
Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged but said it anticipated inflation likely would rise in 2018, bolstering expectations borrowing costs will continue to climb. The Fed currently projects three rate hikes for this year.[nTLAVCEE14]
Stocks have so far proven largely immune to rising rates, with the S&P 500 jumping nearly 20 percent in 2017. Stocks have not fallen by 10 percent or more since the start of 2016, leaving recent declines as buying opportunities.
A stock market correction could pose a political problem for President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans ahead of congressional elections later this year. Trump has trumpeted the sharp gains in U.S. equities since he took office as proof that his economic policies were working.
SECTOR DECLINES
There already are signs investors are moving into actively managed stock funds in order to sidestep the impact of rising rates. U.S.-based active stock mutual funds, which lost $7.2 billion in outflows as investors moved toward “passive” stock exchange traded funds (ETFs), attracted $2.4 billion in new assets during the week that ended Wednesday, according to data from Lipper.
At the same time, the lowest end of the credit spectrum has been facing cash withdrawals as rising rates increase the cost of refinancing debt. In the week ended Wednesday, U.S.-based high-yield “junk” bond funds posted outflows of $1.8 billion, their third consecutive week of cash withdrawals, according to Lipper. The four-week moving average for the sector is negative $825 million, the largest such figure since early December.
Stocks sensitive to rates are leading the market lower for the year. Real estate stocks in the S&P 500 are down 3.7 percent over the last month, while utilities are down 4.6 percent over the same time.
Consumer discretionary stocks, which tend to outperform during periods of inflation due to rising wages, are up 8 percent over the same time.
Fund managers say that they expect that other growth-oriented sectors such as technology and financials will continue to outperform, thanks in part to a pickup in inflation and the Republican-led tax overhaul that slashed corporate rates.
Overall, 78.1 percent of companies in the S&P 500 have reported fourth-quarter earnings above analyst expectations, compared with an average of 72 percent over the last year, according to Thomson Reuters data.
“You're getting a pickup in economic growth and in wages, so that makes the growth sectors still the place to be,” said Margaret Patel, a senior portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Funds who run a portfolio of both equities and fixed income. “Even Treasury yields of 3 percent have never been an impediment to the stock market doing better.”
Related Story GST Return - Last Week to File Your 1st Ever GSTR before Aug 20
Nearly 45 days have passed since the roll out of GST, the much awaited and historic move in India's Taxation history, the new tax structure and process still is tagged "complicated" by most of the traders, professionals and taxpayers. Now, since GST Returns for the first time will be filed till August 20th, it is extremely necessary that taxpayers understand the structure and procedure properly so as to file the GSTR in an accurate and hassle free manner.Under the previous tax regime, there were various taxes imposed on a single taxable event e.g. VAT, Central excise, cess etc.; However, under the new GST Regime all these taxes have been incorporated into one.Under GST, there are 3 main taxes i.e. CGST i.e. Central GST; SGST i.e. State GST, and IGST i.e. have been integrated into GST. In order to understand, which tax will be levied at which taxable event, you need to differentiate between an inter-state transaction and an intra-state transaction.The location of the supplier and the place of the goods/services being supplied are key factors in determining whether the supply is inter-state or intra-state.If the location of the supplier and the place where the goods and services are being supplied to, are both in different states or when the supplier is located in India but the place of supply is outside India (exports), then the supply will be an inter-state supply. In case of goods or services being supplied by or to an SEZ unit as imports along with any supply which is not covered under intra-state supply, also comes under the purview of an inter-state supply.On the other hand, if the supplier is located in the same state as the place of supply of goods or services, then the supply will be termed as Intra-State Supply.Even though on every taxable event both the Central and the State Government charge tax, however on an inter-state supply, IGST i.e. Integrated GST is charged by the Central Government which implies that the Central Govt. has the power to tax whereas on an intra-state supply GST is charged by both and the power to levy CGST is with the Central Government and SGST is with the State Government. Even though the revenue will go to both Centre and State in both the cases.stands for Central Goods and Services Tax. This tax will be levied on intra-state supply of goods or services by the Central Govt. and will be governed by the CGST Act. On the same intra-state supply of goods, SGST will also be levied but by the State Govt. This implies that both the Central and State Governments will agree on an appropriate proportion for revenue sharing and on imposition of the tax, the proceeds will be divided between in the State and the Centre in the proportion agreed upon. However, according to Section 8, in no case the rate of tax will exceed 14% each.stands for State Goods and Services Tax. This tax will be levied on intra state supply of goods or services by the respective State Govt. and the proceeds will go to the exchequer of the State Govt. SGST is governed by the SGST Act. On the same intra state supply, CGST will also be levied as explained above under CGST. Also any tax liability incurring under SGST can be set off against only SGST or IGST input tax credit.stands for Integrated Goods and Services Tax and is governed by the provisions of the IGST Act. IGST has replaced the previously levied Central Sales Tax and is levied on all inter-state supply of goods or services within India along with export and import of goods or services. In case of inter-state supply, only IGST will be charged by the Central Government, unlike the levy of CGST and SGST on intra-state supply, however the proceeds will anyway be shared between the 2 Governments.Given below is the methodology for the imposition of CGST along with SGST on intra-state supply and IGST on inter-state supply.For example – a cloth trader from Ludhiana, Punjab supplies Rs 50,000 worth cloth to a clothing store in Jalandhar, Punjab. The rate of CGST and SGST is fixed at 6% each (12% GST). So the trader will have to pay Rs 3000 CGST into the Central Govt. account and ₹3,000 SGST into the State Government account.For example – a cloth trader from Chennai, Tamil Nadu supplies cloth worth Rs 50,000 to a cloth store in Delhi. The rate of IGST is fixed at 12% which comes to a total IGST of Rs 6,000 which the trader will deposit in the Central Government account.

Detroit — Mayor Mike Duggan declared Wednesday that nobody from his office has been questioned or subpoenaed in regards to a federal grand jury evaluation of the city's demolition program.
The mayor added he's hoping for a speedy conclusion to the matter, and if people did wrong, they should be held accountable.
Duggan, during a public appearance in northwest Detroit on Wednesday, briefly addressed the investigation a day after The Detroit News learned the grand jury was empaneled to focus on the blight fighting program and whether federal money was misappropriated while Detroit spent almost $200 million to demolish homes after the city's bankruptcy.
The effort has been under scrutiny and the focus of several investigations and reviews in the wake of concern over rising costs and bidding in fall 2015.
“I hope they'll move quickly because what we want is if somebody did something wrong they should be charged. If nobody broke the law, they should be cleared as soon as possible,” Duggan told reporters.
“I hope they resolve it quickly, and we'll continue to cooperate in any way we can to speed the process.”
As many as 30 contractors and city agencies are believed to have been subpoenaed to testify or provide documents regarding the program, according to sources familiar with the investigation and subpoenas reviewed by The News.
The target of the investigation is unclear.
The mayor stressed Wednesday his administration has been “completely open from the beginning.”
The grand jury is weighing potential violations of federal wire fraud and antitrust laws that prevent bid-rigging and unfair competition for federal funds, according to a source familiar with the investigation.
Detroit has spent almost $200 million in mostly federal funds earmarked to help cities demolish thousands of homes the hardest hit by the Great Recession. The city has taken down more than 11,670 under the program.
The grand jury investigation has been underway for approximately one month and investigators have sent contractors subpoenas demanding they provide copies of communications with various city agencies and Duggan's office, according to a subpoena obtained by The News.
The program also has been under investigation by the FBI and Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SIGTARP.
SIGTARP has said it does not publicly confirm or deny the existence of investigations. But Christy Goldsmith Romero acknowledged the probe in court filings last year. SIGTARP spokesman Rob Scholars declined to comment on Wednesday.
The U.S. Attorney's Office has declined comment.
Duggan, a former prosecutor, said the U.S. Attorney's Office is doing what it's supposed to do. The reason for a grand jury, he said, is to determine whether a crime has been committed.
“What you are seeing are issues that may or may not have occurred in 2014,” said Duggan on Wednesday, adding U.S. Treasury recently released another $130 million for the program and it's “moving full speed ahead.”
At issue during the demolition program's history is a controversial 2014 set-price pilot program for bulk demolitions that emerged after city officials met with a group of contractors.
Three of the four local contractors participating in negotiations — Adamo Group, Homrich and MCM — were the sole bidders after the project was publicly offered. They were awarded the work.
Duggan has said the move was designed to attract firms able to handle big bundles of demolitions as the city moved with urgency to raze homes and meet a deadline to draw down federal dollars earmarked for the program.
The mayor on Wednesday declined to say if he believes contractors are targets in the probe.
“You need to draw your own conclusions,” he told reporters. “I have a pretty good idea of what's going on, but it's not appropriate for me to talk about it.”
The federal subpoena sought communications involving several contractors, including: Homrich, ADR Consulting, MCM Management Corp., Bierlein Companies, Atwell and Atwell/DCR.
Homrich, ADR, MCM and Bierlein have not returned messages seeking comment. An attorney for Adamo could not be reached.
Atwell on Wednesday said it never had a contract with the city or the land bank, is not a demolition contractor and didn't provide any demolition services in Detroit. The company did receive a subpoena some months ago and responded.

Spoilers ahead for Star Wars: The Last Jedi.
One of the best decisions Star Wars: The Last Jedi makes is choosing to have nobodies be Rey's parents. It's a decision that ignited some controversy now, but I think in time more people will see the wisdom of Rian Johnson's dramatic reveal because it's a reveal driven by what will challenge the character.
Johnson was kind enough to sit down to do a 70-minute Q&A following an IMAX screening of The Last Jedi with Collider, and during the discussion, he explained that the reason he went with making Rey come from nothing wasn't because that was the theme he had in mind, but rather the theme emerged about of the decision of what would challenge Rey the most:
“It definitely was something that kind of slowly emerged. The truth is that was never like a driving thing for me in the movie, and I've talked a little bit elsewhere about the big decision with Rey and her parents. That's one of the big things. It's cutting loose the idea that of her being special coming from lineage. And that is true and I do like that, and I think that's a good thing. That wasn't, though, the motivating factor behind that decision. It was a more dramatic decision of ‘What is the toughest thing she could hear about her parents? What is the thing for her and for us what will make her have to stand on her own two feet and will make things the hardest for her?' Because she's the hero and that's her job—to have things be the hardest for her. So it came from that and the other element came along with that, which is something I really liked. But I didn't sit down and think, ‘How do we overturn this whole thing of Star Wars lineage?' That wasn't the driving factor. It was almost a byproduct of a natural process of, ‘Oh, this is what's going to make sense for her as a character, as a dramatic turn there. And that means this, and that's kind of nice.' It's a strange, organic process, I guess.”
That's smart writing because ultimately it understands what a character wants and needs rather than catering to the wants and needs of the audience. The audience, desiring the comforting blanket of mythology, would probably want a recognizable name to be Rey's parents. But once you get that answer, Rey's story becomes divided between her parents and her own, thus rendering her into another form of Kylo Ren. With Johnson's decision, you get a great juxtaposition where Kylo Ren is driven by his parents while Rey is driven by her parents being nobodies. She's now free to craft her own destiny whereas Kylo Ren feels like the only way to live is to react to the past.
I know Last Jedi had more than its fair share of detractors, but I definitely think that it's a movie, now divorced from two years of expectations, that will grow on viewers who are willing to accept the movie on its own merits.

LOS ANGELES:- Ariana Grande has teased a new collaboration with Nicki Minaj. The 24-year-old singer - who previously worked with the rapper on ‘Side to Side' in 2016 - has hinted that she's enlisted the help of the 35-year-old star for her forthcoming album ‘Sweetener' as she uploaded a short clip on her Instagram account of her lip-syncing Nicki's rap verse on her new song ‘The Light is Coming'. The brunette beauty didn't give any more details about the track - and she left it uncaptioned - but she did tease the title of the song a few weeks ago.
NEW YORK -- The National Football League and Verizon announced today a multi-year partnership in which Verizon's portfolio of premium digital and mobile media properties, including Yahoo Sports, will stream in-market and national games, including national pre-season, regular season, playoff games, and the Super Bowl nationwide to sports fans -- regardless of mobile network.

The U.S. Supreme Court is keeping in place a revised map of Pennsylvania's congressional districts, turning down a request from Republican leaders in the state Legislature.
The court's order Monday declining to put on hold the revised map comes as incumbents and potential challengers are circulating petitions to get on the May primary ballot.
The court is declining to halt a series of decisions by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that threw out a 2011 Republican-crafted map and established a new map of the state's 18 districts.
Pennsylvania's 2011 map is generally considered among the most gerrymandered in the nation, and Democrats hope new district lines will boost their chances of reclaiming majority control of the U.S. House.
1:15 p.m.
A panel of federal judges on Monday dismissed a legal challenge by Republican congressmen to a district map imposed last month by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
The decision does not end litigation over the matter, but it makes it much more likely that this year's congressional elections in Pennsylvania will be conducted under district lines widely viewed as more favorable to Democrats than a 2011 map the state court threw out in January.
The earlier map has been a campaign winner for Republicans, leading them to a 13-5 edge in the state's congressional delegation for all three elections in which it was used.
The three-judge panel issued its decision with just one day left for the state's congressional candidates to circulate petitions to get on the May 15 primary ballot. It said it had no authority to act in the matter except to dismiss the case.
"The plaintiffs invite us to opine on the appropriate balance of power between the Commonwealth's legislature and judiciary in redistricting matters, and then to pass judgment on the propriety of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's actions under the United States Constitution," the judges wrote. "These are things that, on the present record, we cannot do."
Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf called the ruling the right decision and said it will let the state move ahead with a fair map.
The Democratic majority on the state Supreme Court had ruled in January that a map Republicans crafted in 2011 amounted to an unconstitutional gerrymander.
After Wolf and lawmakers in the GOP-controlled General Assembly did not produce a replacement, the court enacted its own map last month and gave candidates extra time for petition gathering.
Monday's decision comes in a federal case brought a month ago by eight sitting Republican congressmen and two GOP state senators. They argued the state justices infringed on the Legislature's prerogative and did not give lawmakers enough time to come up with a replacement.
The panel said the senators have only two votes in their chamber, calling that "inadequate as a matter of law to allow a lawsuit premised on an institutional injury to the General Assembly." The eight Republican congressmen, the judges wrote, may have wasted resources campaigning in their old districts, but they cannot prove that was caused by a violation of the U.S. Constitution's Elections Clause.
"The cost of shifting district boundaries -- in terms of both campaign funding and constituent fealty -- is surely appreciable," the judges wrote. "But the federal congressional plaintiffs have identified no legal principle tethering that cost to a legally cognizable interest in the composition of their electoral districts under the Elections Clause."
In a separate case, two senior Republicans in the state Legislature who were on the losing end of the state Supreme Court decision have a pending request before the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a stay, which would result in the use of the 2011 map for this year's congressional elections in Pennsylvania. They want the new map put on hold while they pursue an appeal to the nation's highest court.
A ruling on that request could come at any time.
A group of 18 Democratic voters sued in state court last year to challenge the 2011 map, a case the state Supreme Court put on a fast track before throwing out the former district lines.
All five Democrats on the state Supreme Court said the map violated the state constitution, but one of the Democrats joined both Republicans in objecting to the majority's determination to enact a new map for this year's races.
More than two dozen candidates had filed petition paperwork by mid-day Monday, according to state elections bureau data. The deadline to submit at least 1,000 voter signatures to get on the primary ballot is Tuesday.
Salem residents are driving as far as Woodburn in search of bottled water following the city's announcement Tuesday that its drinking water supply is contaminated.
Those without the time or means to go out of town are temporarily out of luck.
Neither the city of Salem nor the Oregon Office of Emergency Management plan to coordinate water distribution points, OEM spokesman Cory Grogan said.

Officials are telling residents to keep calling local retailers.
“There should be a supply of water coming in to stores,” Grogan said. “It benefits them economically to be distributing water.”
Major retailers such as Costco and Roth's say they're expecting water shipments, but don't know if they will come in today or Thursday.
“We are out of water at the moment,” Costco manager Larry Kelley said.
Late Tuesday, Salem announced that an algae bloom discovered a week ago in Detroit Lake is producing low levels of toxins.
Children younger than 6, people with compromised immune systems, people receiving dialysis treatment, people with pre-existing liver conditions, pets, pregnant women or nursing mothers, or other sensitive people should not drink the water, the city said.
Bottled water should be used for drinking, making infant formula, making ice and preparing food and beverages for those groups.
Reports of price-gauging began appearing on social media by Wednesday morning.
Grogan said the Office of Emergency Management is allowing the city of Salem to coordinate the response to the water crisis.
"We don't get involved unless it becomes overwhelming," he said.
Neither city spokesman Kenny Larson, nor Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, who oversees OEM, could be reached for comment Wednesday morning.
The city expects to receive fresh test results on Thursday.

Police are investigating after three women, including two pedestrians were involved in a collision in Montreal's Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough.
It happened at the intersection of Décarie Boulevard and Paré Street at around 11 a.m. Monday.
According to police, a 67-year-old female driver was waiting to make a turn when her vehicle was rear-ended by a dump truck, sending it crashing into two pedestrians.
One of the pedestrians, a 43-year-old woman, suffered serious head injuries and was rushed to hospital.
The driver of the car and the other pedestrian, aged 31, were also injured and taken to hospital for treatment.
The truck driver, a 55-year-old man, was not injured.
Paré Street was closed for several hours as collision experts investigated.
The director of public prosecutions Noordin Hajji has ordered for the arrest of Patel dam owner Pherry Mansukh and his farm manager Vinoj Kumar to face charges of manslaughter following the 9th may dam tragedy which claimed the lives of 47 people.
The action comes barely a day after the ministry of water revealed that the construction of the killer dam was not licensed.

A three-judge panel of the state Superior Court on Monday upheld weapons convictions against a city man who killed someone in what police described as an accidental shooting.
Delroy Toomer, 27, appealed his sentence of 15 to 30 months in jail on charges of carrying a gun without a license and evidence tampering on grounds that the first charge should have been dismissed and the second did not have evidence to back it up. However, the judges found Toomer was properly convicted of the crimes.
Toomer was charged after Jason Khaleen-Rowe was shot on South Street on April 1, 2015. Prosecutors say Khaleen-Rowe had been passing weapons owned by Toomer's wife, Angelic, when one of them discharged. Khaleen-Rowe died after being taken to a hospital.
Police described the death as being the result of firearms mishandling.

A social critic, Dr Junaid Muhammad has said that Mr. Mohammed Dauda from Plateau State would have been the one to have been appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari as the Director General of NIA.
Speaking in an exclusive interview, Junaid said Dauda was the most senior director, who should have been appointed.
“He is from Plateau State. He was the one that acted. He is fit and qualified to take the seat as the substantive head of NIA and you now brought another person,” Junaid said.
Mohammed said if President Buhari wanted a northerner to occupy the office, it wont have been wrong if he picked the man who is the most senior director and from Plateau State.
“The most senior director after Ayodele Oke was asked to leave was from Plateau State. He was allowed to act and they had nothing against him, other than that there is some mago mago in the NIA concerning money found in a flat in the DGS office vault.”
“It is only in Nigeria you have somebody keeping $43 million in some kind of flat in Lagos and then about $44 million in his office. He must be crazy or there must have been some high handed moves by the cabal to steal the money and then the man came out to say he was not confirmed, because he was not prepared to cooperate with the cabal to steal the money.”
“As I'm speaking, there are 28 directors from the Southwest in the NIA. And this is just within the two terms of Oladimeji and Oke. How do you justify having 28 directors mainly from Oyo State, when there are states that don't have a single director in NIA? They should know that some of us know so much about the agency,” Junaid added.
First responders are working to clean up after a car drove into a West Ashley business Saturday night.
Emergency units responded to a reported vehicle accident in the 2000 block of Savannah Highway at approximately 5:30 p.m.
Crews arrived to find a single vehicle drove into the building of Holistic Medical Clinic.
The driver was the only person inside of the vehicle and was evaluated by Charleston County EMS then released.
The business was closed and unoccupied at the time of the incident.
Members from the CFD Urban Search and Rescue Team responded to the scene to assess the damage and provide temporary shoring, as needed, to stabilize and secure the building.
The Charleston Police Department is investigating the vehicle accident.

Husband of jailed AIADMK leader VK Sasikala, M Natarajan, died on Monday night at a corporate hospital. He was 74."It is with profound grief and sorrow that we announce the sad demise of Natarajan Maruthappa at 1.35 AM today," an official release issued by Shanmuga Priyan, chief operating officer of Gleneagles Global Health City, said.Natarajan was admitted to the hospital on Saturday with a severe chest infection and was put on ventilator support.Last year he underwent a kidney transplant.Natarajan's body was later kept at his Besant Nagar residence for people to pay homage. Sources close to him said that his body will be taken later in the day to his native village in Thanjavur district for the final rites.However, it was not immediately known when the final rites will be held at the family anticipates a possible parole for Sasikala.Convicted in the Rs 66.6 crore disproportionate assets case, Sasikala is serving a four-year jail term in Bengaluru Parappana Agrahara prison since February last.She was granted an emergency parole in October last year when Natarajan underwent the kidney transplant.Natarajan was an avid Tamil activist and was also running a vernacular magazine called 'Puthiya Paarvai'.He was formerly a Public Relations Officer with the state government.In 2011, he was one of the family members of Sasikala who were expelled by late Chief Minister and then AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa from the party.Though Jayalalithaa expelled Sasikala, her close aide, she later re-inducted her.
David Moyes has heaped praise on Jordan Pickford for his “remarkable” debut season in the Premier League – and compared his outstanding kicking to that of a top midfielder.
The 23-year-old has been one of the few positives to emerge from this campaign, which sees Sunderland's top flight status hanging by an increasingly small thread.
Pickford, who has been nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year award, continues to win admirers for a string of impressive displays, with his pin-point distribution catching the eye too.
Moyes describes it as a “big weapon” for Sunderland in their ongoing battle for survival, with Pickford averaging 33 passes a match.
And the Sunderland boss believes the Washington-born stopper has got the balance just right in terms of when to play out from the back and when to get Sunderland quickly motoring up the pitch.
“He's obviously a very big kicker, I thought some of his passes against Watford recently, it was like watching a top midfield player,” beamed Moyes.
“He's just got to be careful, that it isn't something he needs to do to get noticed or to be seen, because then it adds risks to his game. At the moment he's not doing that, he's limiting it.
“He's a very good passer, he can go short, he can play long, it is such a big part of goalkeeping these days.
“Against Leicester he had something like 70 per cent pass accuracy, against Manchester United I think it was down to about 40, so we're keeping an eye on it.
“Of course there are other things, Darmian out jumped Victor [Anichebe] quite a lot so you can't read too much into it, but we're always on to make sure his distribution is good, as a team we need it, it's a big weapon for us.”
Pickford has made 23 appearances in the Premier League this season, keeping three clean sheets.
In total, the in-demand stopper – who is being monitored by several top flight teams – has made 751 passes this season in the league, with 261 accurate long balls included in that figure.
After several loan spells in the Football League, the England Under-21 international made his debut for Sunderland last season against Arsenal in the FA Cup before establishing himself as the club's number one this campaign with Pickford the first name on the team sheet.
“For a young lad to do so well, to not make mistakes, it is really, really big,” added Moyes.
“He's been through the season nearly immaculate, I touch wood when I say, but you'd have to say he's just been so good.
“The scrutiny will come, and goalkeepers will have ups and downs, I use David de Gea as an example, I thought that Sir Alex Ferguson played him when he wasn't playing so well, took him out the odd time, put him back in, showed great faith in him, and all of the managers since have had a really great goalkeeper in him.
“Jordan's come in and nearly not made any mistakes, and gone through a season nearly as well as anybody, it has been a remarkable first season in the Premier League.
“I've seen him as probably the biggest positive at the club this year.”
WASHINGTON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Susan Collins, whose support was crucial in passing the Senate tax reform bill earlier this month, said on Sunday she has not yet decided whether she will back the final measure negotiated by House and Senate leaders.
The moderate Republican from Maine has laid out conditions for her support of a final “conference committee” version of the tax proposal. They include assurances that federal Medicare payments will not be cut and that Republicans will support two separate health care bills aimed at reducing premium costs.
Republican Senate leaders worked hard to get Collins' support for the legislation, the largest change to U.S. tax laws since the 1980s that would slash the corporate tax rate.
The bill would lower the rate to as low as 20 percent, which Republican leaders say would encourage U.S. companies to invest more and boost economic growth. Democrats say the proposed cuts are a giveaway to businesses and the rich, financed with billions of dollars in taxpayer debt.
Collins' vote was important since the Senate approved the bill by 51-49 vote after an 11th-hour scramble. With Republican Senator Bob Corker voting against the bill, there is little margin for losing support.
“I‘m going to look at what comes out of the conference committee meeting to reconcile the differences between the Senate and House bill. So I won't make a final decision until I see what that package is,” she said on the CBS “Face the Nation” program on Sunday.
If Collins and Corker vote against the final tax bill, leading to a 50-50 tie, Republican Vice President Mike Pence would cast the winning vote. But if more than two Republican senators vote no, it would fail.
The House–Senate conference will hold an open meeting on Wednesday afternoon as it starts to reconcile differences.
Collins voted for the Senate's tax reform legislation after Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, promised to support legislation to prop up U.S. health insurance markets.
But last week The Hill newspaper reported that House Speaker Paul Ryan told his staff that he wasn't part of the deal that Collins brokered with Senate leaders.
Collins said she is “absolutely confident” of the leaders' support and both McConnell and Ryan have put in writing that they will not allow a 4 percent cut in Medicare payments to take effect.
“I have read in correspondence that memorializes the agreement that the 4 percent cut in Medicare that could go into effect will not go into effect,” she said.
She added that she has the support of President Donald Trump, with whom she has discussed the issue three times.
“I have no reason to believe that that commitment will not be kept,” she said. (Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
Coming off of a tough road loss the night before, the Raptors projected to be easy pickings for a solid Portland Trail Blazers squad on Friday at the ACC.
DeMar DeRozan and Jonas Valanciunas had other ideas.
Both scored inside and out, Valanciunas continuing a recent trend of three-point marksmanship and DeRozan getting reacquainted with life beyond the arc following a dry spell, by matching his career-high of six three-pointers.
Toronto shot out to a 37-18 lead after a quarter and went up by as many as 29 points in a 74-point opening half, on the way to an eventual 130-105 cakewalk.
The home side had 101 points after three. Portland had been the NBA's eighth-best defensive team heading in, but DeRozan and Valanciunas absolutely carved them up early on.
DeRozan finished with 35 points, Valanciunas 18. Toronto only committed a single turnover through 24 minutes and six in all, one off of the season low.
The Blazers were coming off of a 50-point performance in just three quarters by star shooting guard C.J. McCollum, but this time the Raptors were the team that let its top players get the final quarter off.
McCollum was held to 21 points, while all-star Damian Lillard notched 32, including Portland's first nine points, the only initial bright spot for the shell-shocked visitors.
Valanciunas attempted more than two three-pointers for the first time in his career and is now seven for his past 10, helping him score at least 17 points in each of the past three games.
The Raptors hit 19 three-pointers in all, the second-most in a game in franchise history.
“Move the ball. We took what they gave us,” DeRozan said.
“We were aggressive. We didn't really force much. We got shots that we wanted.”
Head coach Dwane Casey also chimed in when the carnage was over.
“Make shots everything's easy,” Casey said. “You make shots, it makes up for a multitude of sins. Tonight we did.”
Fred VanVleet is also cooking from deep. Back in the lineup after missing a game to tend to his newborn daughter, VanVleet scored 16.
Casey had challenged his reserves pre-game following a bad night in Washington: “If you're on the court, you've got to do your job and not be a minus-8 or minus-7 or minus-9 or whatever it is and then force us to play the starters bigger minutes,” Casey had said.
“They're not going to be out there if they don't do their job.”
Message received. Each of the Raptors did their job on this night, whether it was the many big scorers, Jakob Poeltl protecting the rim, Serge Ibaka waking up to score his only seven points of the game to start the third quarter to give Toronto a spark, or OG Anunoby playing some defence (before leaving after getting bumped).
Bouncing back was the key.
“Yeah it's big. If you want to be a good team in this league, you can't lose two in a row, especially you don't want to drop two back-to-back,” VanVleet said.
“It happens from time to time, but we want to go in the right direction.”
The game lacked drama. Things looked like they might be getting interesting when Portland went on a 21-5 run in the second to cut the huge lead down to 13, but Toronto responded with 11 straight, including a pair of treys from Kyle Lowry, one after a smartly called timeout.
C.J. Miles was out of the lineup again with a sore knee, but his shooting wasn't needed on a night where his teammates could barely miss.
The Memphis Grizzlies come to town for a pre-Super Bowl matinee on Sunday and the Raptors did themselves a favour by playing well enough to allow the older players to skip the fourth.
Many fans did the same.

At least on paper, sharing a joint with a 17-year-old can bring a sentence of up to 14 years after legalization.
But an amendment passed Monday by a Senate committee, which could make its way into the final law, carves out two major exceptions in which adults can share marijuana with minors. The change will protect:
Someone 18 years of age or older, who gives the pot to someone less than two years younger than they are
A parent or guardian who gives it to someone who is at least 16, but only in their home
The change, proposed by Nova Scotia independent senator Wanda Bernard, was passed on a 7-5 party-line vote by the Senate's social affairs committee Monday.
WATCH: The association that represents B.C. landlords is worried about people growing pot plants in rental units
“Parents have a responsibility to parent their children, and they should be able to teach their teens appropriate use of cannabis without fear of criminal penalty,” Bernard told the committee. “It would be sharing of a legal substance, not an illicit substance. I would see it as being similar to sharing a glass of wine in one's home.”

It still has to pass the full Senate and go back to the Commons, but Victoria lawyer Kirk Tousaw sees Monday's decisions as probably the last round of meaningful tweaks to Canada's new marijuana law.
“I don't think the full Senate will do much or anything in the way of introducing its own amendments.”
“Close-in-age exceptions in the criminal law consequences are not uncommon,” he says.
“It only makes sense that we shouldn't be looking at criminalizing a 19-year-old that's sharing a joint, or small amounts of cannabis, with their 17-year-old peers.”

The change would also allow parents to introduce their children to legal cannabis under supervision, much as some families now do with alcohol.
“This was a very sensible and appropriate amendment to make sure that we're not criminalizing behaviour that is both normal, in the case of teens sharing amongst themselves, and socially positive, in the sense of parents being the ones to introduce their young adults and teenagers to cannabis consumption,” Tousaw said.
Three Conservative senators spoke against the amendment.

“I think we have to assume that this is kind of opening the door to – it's the same as kids who give someone $10 and say to someone, ‘Go buy me a pack of cigarettes,' or ‘Buy me a bottle of wine,‘ or something,” said New Brunswick senator Carolyn Stewart Olsen.
“I'm not saying we can stop it, but I‘m not saying we should encourage it, either.”
WATCH: Colorado law enforcement officers offer tips for how Bill C-45 could curb a flourishing black market for marijuana ahead of legalization.
“This amendment legitimizes the fact that we want to legalize already for 16-year-olds to smoke marijuana, when we have compelling evidence that we shouldn't even be allowing people under the age of 25 to do this,” said Manitoba senator Neil Plett. “We're going down further and further and further.”

Depending on the province, people under 18 or 19 may be ticketed for possessing cannabis under legalization, no matter who gave it to them, and the people who gave it to them might also face provincial charges, similar to a traffic ticket.
A day after Indrani Mukerjea, prime accused in the Sheena Bora murder case and witness in the Karti Chidambaram case, told the trial court that somebody in jail was trying to kill her, the prison department of the Maharashtra police has rubbished her claims.Indrani had claimed that that the day she got hospitalised, she had not eaten anything outside or in the court where she was produced as she was fasting. She stated that she felt disoriented after having dal and medicines in the prison later in the evening.Inspector General of Prisons Rajvardhan Sinha said it was factually incorrect to say that she did not eat anything outside.“She had a paratha and pizza in court premises, contrary to what she is claiming. Our inquiry with her escort team and other people present in court has revealed that."He also said that the medicine given to her in prison on that day was not Benzodiazepine, the drug on which she had allegedly overdosed as per a hospital test report. He said that it is possible she procured Benzodiazepine outside or within the court premises from somebody."We have questioned escort team and other jail staff. We are yet to record Indrani's statement. We had approached her thrice and she said she was unwell and that she will approach her lawyer before giving statements to us. Her claims will be verified," added Rajvardhan.Indrani had been taken to JJ Hospital for alleged drug overdose two weeks ago. Refuting rumours that it was a case of drug overdose, she told the special CBI court that she was fasting on that day.“I entered the prison from court at around 4.45pm. I broke the fast with a bowl of dal in the evening in the prison. I felt a bit drowsy and then at around 7.30, I was given a medicine in the evening after which I lost consciousness."She went on to say that similar incident has happened last time when she was hospitalised in October 2015 for an overdose of the same drug."I won't be able to deal with this again. I'm constantly looking over my shoulder about what is going to happen to me next. I don't know if it was the dal or the medicine but somebody in prison is trying to kill me," she said.
We all want the best for our children and what that looks like can vary widely between families. Some mothers decide not to breastfeed, while others switch to formula when they go back to work. Women who decide to use a breast pump may not always find it convenient or enjoyable to express milk, but they are motivated by the desire to continue feeding their babies their milk. Whatever your plans are for using a breast pump, you're bound to experience some impatience that makes you wonder: how long does it take your breast pump to get milk? There's no one answer, but Kelly Mom suggested "rather than thinking of nursing or pumping as 'pouring milk out of a container' think of it as flipping on the 'high speed production' switch." In other words, pumping (as well as nursing baby at the breast) stimulates milk production and may get easier in time.
Often the most important factor in how long it takes your breast pump to get milk is the type of pump you choose. You may have heard the phrase "hospital-grade" to describe some breast pumps. While this is not an FDA-regulated description, the Food and Drug Administration does note that "The amount of time it takes to pump varies, but certain types of breast pumps may be easier to use and extract milk faster."
Some women rent so-called hospital-grade pumps because they find them faster. However, all that "hospital grade" really means is that the pump has a closed system to make it usable (with the purchase of an indivdual accessory package) for more than one woman, as opposed to the open system, single user pumps you can buy or obtain through health insurance. Talk to your doctor or a lactation consultant about the best breast pump for your needs.
Remember that breast pumps aren't really "one-size-fits-all," even if advertised that way. You may have to try more than one before finding a good match. Once you do have a pump that works well for you, the next step is to create a pumping schedule that fits within your life and/or work day. This will also likely involve a process of trial-and-error before you get it right.
Kelly Mom's article "Exclusive Pumping" explains that " it's best to pump at least 15 minutes, and to avoid going much longer than 20 minutes. Experts also encourage pumping about five minutes past when the milk stops flowing, often by doing so mom will elicit another letdown, and at the very least will maintain production as well as encouraging increase in supply if needed." So don't get discouraged if the milk doesn't gush right out. Even if it does, keep going for at least 15 minutes to maintain your body's overall milk supply-and-demand response.
If you're struggling to supply enough milk for your baby's daily intake, the American Academy of Family Physicians offers this reassurance:
"You may not get much milk when you first start pumping. This will change as you continue to pump regularly. Your breasts will begin to make more milk. The more often you pump, the more milk your breasts make. Drink lots of fluids to stay hydrated. This will also help your milk supply."
The website also recommend pumping every three to four hours during the workday in order to match your baby's natural feeding schedule. Besides drinking plenty of water, the same tips for increasing supply that breastfeeding mothers use also apply to pumping mothers. Oatmeal and Mother's Milk tea are popular remedies for supply issues, but overall nutrition (getting enough to eat) and rest are also important. Try a relaxation technique before you sit down to pump, such as meditation or alternate nostril breathing. Looking at pictures of your baby while you pump can also help get your mind off of work stresses and feelings of impatience or anxiety. And if you change your mind about pumping, that's OK, too. In the end, what's best for your baby is a matter of what's best for you, too.

MEXICO CITY, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Mexico has raised the bar on oil contracts in Latin America after sweetening terms to attract international energy firms, luring $93 billion in future investment in the region's first big auction this year.
On Wednesday, Mexico awarded 19 of 29 deepwater blocks on offer, comfortably more than the seven areas expected to be assigned. Anglo-Dutch oil major Royal Dutch Shell emerged as the biggest winner, with nine blocks.
Unique for generous terms such as setting a cap on royalties that oil firms can pledge to the government in bids, Mexico faces off this year with Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador and Uruguay.
They will all hold auctions for oil and gas fields in 2018 that require billions of dollars in investment from foreign firms.
Mexico is due to hold major auctions in March and July.
While Brazil's prolific deepwater presalt oilfields are expected to attract aggressive bidding from oil majors, other regional rivals could be forced to revise the terms of their auctions if Mexico scores another win in its next auction for shallow water areas in March, analysts said.
Argentina and Ecuador have already changed their terms over the past year in preparation for their 2018 auctions. Argentina has lowered labor costs and some taxes, while Ecuador switched to production sharing from service contracts. Oil prices have reached three-year highs near $70 per barrel in 2018, giving the world's top energy companies a cash boost and improving the chances that they will have the funds needed for big-ticket projects in Latin American.
The industry is, however, emerging from a recession that cost tens of thousands of jobs and forced companies to slash spending on expensive projects such as those in deep waters. Oil majors have committed to keeping tight control on costs and will only bid for what they see as the most profitable projects.
Oil executives and industry specialists say the terms on offer in Mexico, as well as the potential for major finds in the country's deep water, made it attractive on Wednesday.
At the auction, the decisive bidding parameter was the cash bonus that firms pledged. Shell won several bids with cash bonuses that drew surprised gasps from an audience mostly made up of executives from bidding firms and members of the media.
Mexico collected $525 million in cash.
While the government has limited its own take at the auction, the estimated $93 billion in investments pledged to develop the blocks auctioned is about 1.5 times greater than the amount involved in the previous eight auctions.
”COMPETITION FOR CAPITAL'
After the government of Mexico started auctioning oilfields in 2015, it tweaked the terms of the bidding process several times, following a historic energy reform that ended state oil firm Pemex's 75-year monopoly over the sector.
The liberalization, the most ambitious plank of President Enrique Pena Nieto's economic policy, started just as oil prices crashed in 2013-2014.
The government had to balance the need for a big enough take for the state to placate opponents of the reform with ensuring there was enough potential profit to attract foreign firms.
“Mexico understood how tough the competition for capital was in a very difficult oil price environment,” consultant Pablo Medina told Reuters.
After failing to award a large number of blocks in previous auctions, the government regarded the results of this week's deepwater bidding round as a success.
As well as the limits on royalties, sweeteners included allowing foreign firms to propose areas to be included in the bidding rounds and relaxing the qualification process.
Mexico also put a stop to “additional investment pledges.” This makes it harder for small companies to win by making unrealistic promises, but further limits the mandatory investment in projects.
“What we are looking for is that the market tells us how big royalty should be and how much government take is possible to achieve,” Salvador Ugalde, head of the Mexican Finance Ministry's Hydrocarbon Income Unit, said Wednesday.
Brazil, which plans a busy auction schedule for 2018, does not expect Mexico's auctions will lower interest in its own offerings, said Marcio Felix, Brazil's oil and gas secretary.
In Brazil's last round in October, Shell and BP were the biggest winners.
“We have a set of companies that have an appetite for a certain type of asset,” Felix told Reuters on Thursday.

The ‘beauty with brains' cliché is not a stretch in the case of Bollywood's current blue-eyed girl, Kriti Sanon. The Delhi native, who studied to be an engineer, couldn't resist the lure of the limelight when modelling assignments happened to come her way. After appearing in ads and walking runways, an acting career, as is the norm du jour for many, was the next natural step.
Telugu film 1: Nenokkadine (2014) marked her acting debut, and Sanon forayed into Bollywood with Heropanti opposite Tiger Shroff in the same year, though it was being cast alongside Shahrukh Khan, Kajol and Varun Dhawan in Rohit Shetty's Dilwale in 2015 that really singled her out as one to watch out for. While her last release Raabta did not set the cash register ringing, she's already looking ahead to her next release, Bareilly Ki Barfi, with Aayushmann Khurrana and Rajkumar Rao.
The early years
Sanon's coming out sartorial party was mostly a barrage of bodycon dresses and minis alongside midriff baring crop tops, cut-outs, and bare backs. With a frame as statuesque and lithe as hers, one can understand the draw to aforementioned silhouettes, but this did not lead to a particularly memorable impact in the style department in the initial years. Prints—be it stripes by Dior, caricatures by QuirkBox or florals by Dhruv Kapoor—were a consistent part of her repertoire as was traditional wear by glam pack favourite Manish Malhotra.
Sanon's red carpet game, however, was strong from the very beginning. She stood out for her ability to strike a balance between drama and demure with grace; looking just as effortless in a feminine strapless Gauri & Nainika gown as she did in avant-garde numbers by Amit Aggarwal or Georges Chakra Couture.
An evolution of style
The actor's off-duty style took on a more sophisticated turn mid-2015, coinciding with the release of Dilwale. The figure-hugging ensembles made way for more nuanced, urban choices—think jackets by Sanchita, shift dresses by Osman, and solid-coloured separates by Payal Khandwala. While dresses continued to be a favoured silhouette, Sanon was also seen embracing pantsuits and trouser sets by designers like Namrata Joshipura, Anand Bhushan and Vikram Phadnis among others.
Today, Sanon can safely be slotted as a denimphile. From denim overalls with leather patches, ripped denims and high-waist flared trousers to denim jackets worn with slip dresses and twin sets in the fabric; in denim, Sanon most definitely trusts. Her roster of go-tos has now been widened to include oversized sweatshirts, jumpsuits, anti-fit dresses, maxis, and boho chic minis. The actor is unrelenting in her championing of homegrown designers and has been seen in creations by Kanika Goyal, Lola by Suman B, Chola, Sukriti & Aakriti, Rahul Mishra, Doodlage, Hemant & Nandita, and Péro among others. Sanon wears pret by Indian designers as easily as she does high street pieces by brands like H&M, Zara, Bershka, and Global Desi.

BEIJING, June 15 (APP): Indian Ambassador to China, Vijay Gokhale
Thursday said the platform of Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) would help India and Pakistan to come closer and resolve their bilateral issues amicably.
“Although, we have other direct channels to discuss with each other but
certainly, the SCO would provide a platform to both the countries to resolve their bilateral issues,” he said while talking to APP after a flag-raising ceremony which marked the formal entry of India and Pakistan into the SCO, held at the SCO Headquarters here.
The Indian ambassador said the SCO would further enhance the regional
connectivity and encourage the member states to jointly work for the mutual benefits and the shared prosperity.
Earlier, speaking at the flag-raising ceremony, he said, his country
looked forward to developing its relations with all the member countries for benefit of the people of entire region.
He said India was ready to share its expertise with the regional
countries in various fields including Information Technology (IT), biotech, space and renewable energy for the shared prosperity of the region.
Gokhale also said India was ready to contribute to further
enhancing the stature and influence of the SCO and harvest new opportunities to realize the full potential of the mutually beneficial cooperation among the member countries.
The raising of national flags of India and Pakistan at SCO Headquarters
has formally heralded the entry of their countries into the organization.
Both the South Asian nations were admitted as members into the
six-member organization at the Astana Summit last week.
The SCO is now comprised of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia,
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India and Pakistan. Afghanistan, Belarus, Iran and Mongolia have an observer status.
Former Rajya Sabha MP, senior BJP leader Vinay Katiyar has said that if the decision regarding Ram Mandir does not come in their favour then a ‘Balidani Dasta (Sacrifice Squad)' will be formed.The leader, famous for his controversial statements, said that the ‘Balidani Dasta' will not be engaging in any work till the judgment is given by the apex court.Speaking to the media, Katiyar said, “If Ram Mandir is not constructed, then Balidani Dasta will do the needful and help in construction of the Temple. However, the Balidani Dasta will not come into play till the time Supreme Court gives its decision. The process, though, has been started.”Katiyar also added that Iqbal Ansari, a party in the Babri Masjid case, has little knowledge about the entire issue.The former BJP state president was elected a Lok Sabha member from the Faizabad (Ayodhya) constituency in 1991, 1996 and 1999 and recently retired from the post of Rajya Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh.The former MP, one of the key campaigners for a Ram temple in Ayodhya, is known for his controversial remarks. He is the founder member and president of Bajrang Dal, an affiliate and youth wing of Vishwa Hindu Parishad. Katiyar is one of the top BJP leaders facing charges in the Supreme Court for criminal conspiracy in the Babri Masjid-Ayodhya Ram Temple issue.
FTSE 100 Index called to open -60pts at 7575, having broken down from last week's rising 7500-7700 channel, opening the door for another revisit of April lows support. Bulls need a break back above 7600; Bears require a breach of 7570. Watch levels: Bullish 7600,Bearish 7570
Calls for a negative open derive from a negative start to the week, month and quarter in Asia, with Chinese stocks pointing south again on uninspiring PMI prints and an intensification of worries about the global trade ruckus, this after Europe's $300bn counter-threat to Trump's proposed tariffs on cars. It's getting harder to work out who he's really targeting.
FTSE not helped by GBP off highs; metals (including safe haven Gold) and oil hindered by USD off its lows and Trump calling on OPEC to increase Crude output by 2m barrels/day, still regarding prices as too high, Brent having returned to $80 since the OPEC meeting with the supply/demand dynamic still views as tight given certain countries output issues.
In Politics, we have the run-up to a key weekend for PM May in terms of thrashing out Brexit with her Cabinet. We also have German Chancellor Merkel's being threatened with the resignation of her interior minister Seehofer in criticism of the migration deal signed last week. And then there is Mexico voting in populist AMLO (Andrés Manuel López Obrador) with a landslide victory.

In terms of data today, we have final Eurozone and UK PMIs (8:15-9:30am), with France, Germany and the Eurozone as a whole expected to confirm weaker reads in June along with the UK, although all should hold above the key 50-point level that separates expansion from contraction.
Positive news for the European Central Bank (ECB), which wants raise interest rates from next summer, could come from MayProducer Price Inflation (PPI; 10am) if it delivers a consensus jump to 2.4% from 2%, and Unemployment hold around 8.5% lows, still in a trend of falling joblessness.
The USA joins the action mid-afternoon, with US PMI Manufacturing (2:45pm) expected weaker (after peaking in April), another sign of cooling stateside growth (after Thursday's slower GDP). This is followed by ISM Manufacturing (3pm), where analysts expect another fall (after a May rebound following an April drop). As always, Jobs, Orders and Price components could be more interesting than the headline print.
Princesses don't always wear glass slippers, and modern day fairy tale heroine Meghan Markle is proof. In fact, even though the Duchess of Sussex has been wearing heels more often than not lately (at least in front of the cameras), the former Suits actress has a history of rocking comfy footwear. Before marrying Prince Harry, she was even photographed multiple times in the same pair of surprisingly affordable kicks; in fact, you might even have them in your own closet. The sneakers Meghan Markle is obsessed with are Reebok Classic Leather in white, a versatile choice that looks good with practically everything... except a wedding gown, of course.
As Cosmopolitan reported, Meghan has been spotted wearing her Reeboks many times (usually on her way to or from yoga, it seems). And why not? White sneakers never truly go out of style, but they're definitely having a major moment. And while it can be tricky to find a pair that doesn't look too clunky or too much like something your grandpa would wear, the Reebok Classic Leather is sleek and flexible – and with a price tag of $75, probably one of the least expensive items in Meghan's royal wardrobe.
Seriously, as far as sneakers go, this one is pretty much iconic (not to mention legitimately supportive of your arches and all that other stuff that sneakers are supposed to do besides look cool). Plus, how great is it that you can actually own the same sneakers as a princess IRL for under $100?
Whether or not Meghan will be allowed to wear her beloved trainers very often now that she's officially related to the Queen is up for debate – if the royal dress code is any indication, it's going to be all knee length skirts, demure trousers, pantyhose and neutral nails from here on out. But that doesn't mean you can't still channel her single gal style. And honestly, considering Meghan started doing yoga when she was 7 years old, chances are there'll be at least a couple of paparazzi snaps in the coming months of Meghan dashing outside the Palace walls for a quick class in her trusty Reeboks, even if she's wearing dark glasses and a hat in the hopes of going undetected. (What the Queen doesn't know can't hurt her, right?)
If, however, you're into the white sneaker look but those Reeboks just remind you too much of the shoes you wore to gym class in 7th grade, you don't have to literally follow in Meghan's footsteps. There are lots of similar options out there that are equally versatile and affordable (some are even more affordable). Whether you're looking for something slightly less thick-soled or you need a tiny pop of color, there's definitely a shoe that fits the bill. And while you may not be married to a prince, at least you'll get to wear your white sneakers with jeans. (Good luck with that, Megan.)
Police are issuing a warning to residents of Southington after several car thefts and break-ins over the weekend.
Police said the incidents were mainly in the southwest part of Southington and they are reminding residents to lock their vehicles and be vigilant about anything or anyone suspicious.
Hundreds of thousands of vehicles flooded during Hurricanes Harvey and Irma will soon return to the road, riddled with mechanical and electrical issues.
Chris Basso with Carfax says the vehicles are likely rotting from the inside out.
“It's going to corrode the mechanical systems,” said Basso. “It's going to short-out the electrical systems, and it may even compromise the safety systems, like your anti-lock brakes and your airbags.”
Basso says there are three areas to check when determining whether a car has water damage: the trunk, engine and the interior of the car.
“The biggest signs of flood damage are going to be on the interior of the car, especially on the metal parts of the car,” said Basso.
Start with the seatbelts.
"See if there's any rust on the seat belt,” Basso said. “Unfurl the seatbelt and see if any mold and bacteria is building up on the belt itself."
Look for waterlines and corrosion on anything metal, especially the battery. Don't forget to lift the carpeting and run your hand along the plastic.
“You may find mud or silt that shouldn't be on the inside of the car,” said Basso.
Don't forget to check under trunk, where the mats and spare tire are stored.
“If you've got condensation; if you've got mud or silt that have built up around here, even a water line that may exist," he said. "These are areas that can be overlooked when someone is trying to quickly clean up a flood car."
Most importantly, get the Vehicle Identification number (VIN) and look up the car's history. This is key, as car's titles are often washed when sold across state lines, making it difficult to track the vehicle's history.
Plug that VIN into a site like Carfax to get the full story. In fact, Carfax has a special tab set up specifically for flood inquiries: www.carfax.com/flood
“Make sure you're doing the proper research ahead of time, so that you know the car you're thinking about buying is a waterlogged wreck,” said Basso.

Wielding a giant pair of scissors to cut a shiny blue ribbon, a trio of Alberta cabinet ministers officially opened Canada›s largest jail five years ago.
Located on the city›s northwest edge, the new Edmonton Remand Centre was state of the art in March 2013 — a 60,000-square-metre, 1,952-capacity detention facility designed to solve the problems of its dank, overcrowded downtown Edmonton predecessor.
Five years later, the new remand centre has solved some of those problems, while creating new ones of its own.
Since it opened, correctional officers have repeatedly complained about safety at the facility, while inmates have raised concerns about living conditions.
At the same time, Alberta's remand population has surged. People who have not been found guilty of a crime now make up more than 64 per cent of Alberta›s provincial inmate population — a larger proportion than before thenew remand opened, and one of the highest rates in Canada.
“I think anyone goes (to the new remand) is better off than going to the old remand,” said Chris Hay, executive director of the John Howard Society of Alberta.
“But still, the building of a super-remand was a mistake.”
Old facility the ‘shame' of Canadian corrections
A remand centre is a facility where people accused of crimes, including those from Cold Lake, are held until either they go to trial or are released on bail. Hay said the average stay at the Edmonton remand is short — around a week, although some inmates spend months waiting for trial.
This article is Part 10 of a multi-part series explaining the recently issued white paper on data protection in India. The responses to the white paper will help in the formulation of India's future data protection laws. You can read Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, Part 5, Part 6, Part 7, Part 8 and Part 9.
Regulating and enforcing data protection faces two key challenges — the wide range of entities, sectors and industries which are subject to it and the rapid pace at which technology is developing. In view of the divergent needs of each, a suitable regulatory model needs to be adopted. Once established, it is essential to support this regulation with suitable enforcement mechanisms.
Customising regulation for diverse sectors
The diverse needs of various sectors demonstrate the need for customised regulation. For example, in the telecom sector, ensuring adequate encryption and other security requirements, such as for the various networks, is essential to make sure that there is no snooping on people's communications. For the financial sector, it is crucial to maintain the confidentiality and security of the data in the possession of the financial entities. This will still need to be disclosed, routinely, to the apex financial regulator to ensure the smooth running of the industry.
Data in the medical sector is even more sensitive but still needs to be shareable with relatives, other health institutes and for research purposes. This data may even need to be shared without consent to save the life of the individual. For data with social media, protecting people's personal information like photographs and messages from hackers and the government is one consideration and dealing with the privacy implications of a new technology like live streaming is another.
International regulatory models
When considering regulating data protection, different countries have adopted different versions of these models. One is the European model, ie, the general data protection regulation (GDPR), an all-inclusive regulation, applicable to all entities, whether private or public. The second is the US model, featuring an encouragement of self-regulation, through numerous state and sectoral level regulations, along with a few federal regulations. Another is the Singapore model, with one data protection regulation and several guidelines issued through a public consultation process, much like that of TRAI.
The co-regulatory approach for India
These models can be broadly classified into the ‘command and control' approach, the self-regulatory approach, and the co-regulatory approach. The White Paper recommends the co-regulatory model for India, an approach that was previously also recommended by the Justice AP Shah Committee. This combines an overarching data protection regulation, along with sector specific self-regulation.
The benefit of this approach is that different industries can customise data protection regulations based on the kind of data they handle. Any aspects or industries that are left out will still be protected under the main regulation.
Inadequate enforcement mechanisms in India
Once a regulatory approach is decided, the next consideration is enforcing it. Prescribing privacy regulations can be effective only when they are backed by adequate enforcement mechanisms. This is, in fact, one of the primary drawbacks in India's current privacy laws. The IT (Sensitive Persona Data or Information) Rules, for instance, embody most of the privacy principles, such as consent and notice, purpose specification, use limitation, and so on. However, there are next to no enforcement mechanisms.
The IT (SPDI) Rules require adequate security practices, require a regular audit of these practices, and require the body corporate to be able to demonstrate at any time that it has adequate security standards. This is, in fact, similar to the approach of the GDPR. There is, however, no system of checks to ensure implementation, nor is there any consequence or penalty for non-adoption. Thus, despite the rules being in place, the lack of enforcement makes their implementation is limited.
Accountability under Indian laws
The only consequence that will follow will be under Section 43A of the Information Technology Act when the lack of adequate security practices results in a failure to protect the sensitive data, and this leads to a ‘wrongful loss' to a person.
The tie-up with the lack of security practices, on the one hand, and the need to prove ‘wrongful loss' such as financial loss, on the other, further limit the scope of this section. For instance, many a time, the effects of a loss of data, say a hack of a social media site, are felt much later. This can take the form of another cyberattack, say a spearphishing e-mail targeting the head of a business, sent later using details acquired from the social media hack.
Ineffectiveness of Section 43A
For example, consider the major breach of ATM card details in India in 2016. A person whose debit card was compromised as a result of this hack, would not be entitled to compensation under this provision for the hack itself, for the loss of their data or for any mental agony that results. He will only be entitled to compensation if actual financial loss results to him, such as an actual stealing of funds from his account.
The bank itself, will also not be subject to penalties for any negligence under this provision. Since this example considers the highly regulated financial industry, there are penalties under financial laws, such as the Banking Regulation Act. The example nevertheless demonstrates the failure of Section 43A as a privacy law.
Who should be held accountable?
When considering accountability under the new law, resolving this issue with Section 43A is crucial. A key consideration for this is to define what kind of liability must be established under the new law?
Consider a mobile wallet — this will involve a number of different parties — the app developer, the telecom service provider (TSP) providing communication channels, the m-wallet provider itself, a bank that the m-wallet has tied up with, or the cloud service provider whose services the m-wallet provider is using. The operating system of the phone being used may also be transferring data. For a data breach from the m-wallet app, who should be held responsible — the m-wallet company itself, the app developer for a flaw in the app, or the OS manufacturer for any contributory vulnerability? In this case, should liability apply to all the entities (jointly and severally)?
Another option is to establish strict liability, where the data controller is liable for any loss of data, regardless of the adoption of security practices. This is recommended by the White Paper for inherently risky businesses. This may be considered, for example, for the central identities data repository (CIDR), which stores crucial biometric data.
Yet another option to be considered is the common practice of contracting to establish liability among various parties. The RBI, for instance, allows financial entities to enter into contractual arrangements with outsourcing providers to fix liability, but where the agents of the financial entity are concerned, the financial entity will remain responsible for any violations by them.
Determining security standards and codes of practices
The IT (SPDI) Rules require the adoption of security practices ‘commensurate' with the nature of the business and the data in their possession. An international standard such as the IS/ISO/IEC 27001 has been recommended.
This approach has its advantages, in effect, avoiding a one-size-fits-all approach. Industries are thus also encouraged to self-regulate. Small businesses also, this way, are allowed a lower standard of security. Sector-specific regulations, such as the Information Security Guidelines of the RBI, or its Cybersecurity Framework for Banks, follow a similar format, where an extensive set of security standards have been prescribed, but each organisation is expected to customise these to their specific needs. A bank, thus, will have a different set of security practices from, say, a payment bank or a peer to peer lending platform.
This process also has drawbacks to be considered. TRAI's latest consultation paper on data privacy, for instance, appears to be a case of regulatory overreach, unless its scope is restricted to the telecom sector. Another issue that arises is with overlapping obligations from various regulators, as seen for m-wallets, with RBI directions on prepaid payment instruments, and the Meity's IT (SPDI) Rules as well as the proposed Meity rules for prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) specifically, all of which have privacy provisions. Such overlaps can create compliance issues for the governed entities.
Privacy by design
The drawbacks of the notice and consent system for privacy, particularly in view of the overwhelming amounts of data usage for which consent is required, has led to the ‘privacy by design' approach. This imposes an obligation on businesses to implement ‘privacy by design' or ‘privacy by default'. Through this, a business is obliged to consider data privacy at the initial design stages of a project as well as throughout the life cycle of the relevant data processing.
This approach is supported in the GDPR but is again not without issues. For example, OS manufacturers release common APIs based on which apps are developed. A flaw in this can lead to flaws in the whole system.
Consider the Apple HomeKit flaw which left smart gadgets developed using the software development kit vulnerable to attacks. Even OSes like Android and Apple have built-in privacy requirements, such as data which an app can and cannot access, raising issues with their conformability to prescribed privacy requirements.
Key questions raised in the White Paper
In view of these issues, the White Paper has presently sought comments on the following key questions with respect to the regulatory approach and enforcement mechanisms to be adopted:
Is the co-regulatory approach appropriate for India? What about other models like self-regulation and ‘command and control'?
What are your views on the principles of accountability?
What organisational measures and standards must be prescribed? Who will determine these standards?
Should lack of organisational measures be linked to the harm caused by establishing liability?
Should all data controllers be jointly and severally liable for harms caused, or can they have contractual arrangements?
Should there be strict liability for specific categories of processing?
Should data controllers be required to take out insurance policies to meet liability requirements?
What are subject matters for which codes of practice can be developed within a data protection law? What is the process of their preparation? Should stakeholders be mandatorily consulted?
Who should issue the codes of practice and how should they be enforced? What are the consequences for violation?

Sustainable pickup
Sustainability is all about preparing for the future. From discovering and developing new sources of energy like wind and solar to crop rotation and water conservation, we all have to do our part to mitigate our impact on the environment. A small investment now goes a long way down the road. And when it comes to fantasy football, a major key to building sustainable depth from waiver wire adds means finding players that you can rely on for the long term without wasting resources. So in this section, the Fantasy Hipsters will get ahead of the curve and offer up one player to add for depth who should pay off dividends in the future. Hey man, turn that light off in the other room. It's not hard, okay?
Jaron Brown, WR, Arizona Cardinals
I remember when it was cool to say Carson Palmer was done, like, three weeks ago. He threw a few picks against the Lions and Colts in the first two games and it seemed like my entire timeline lined up in formation to kick the dirt on his grave. Sheep! Here we sit heading into Week 5 and Carson Palmer is second in the NFL in passing yards.
Everyone knows a good concert venue is about 60 percent ambiance. A band can be as killer as they want but without the right acoustics or vibe of the setting, the show can't truly be great. Not to mention, if it's a place that just overcharges you for mediocre mixed drinks, forget about it. I'm willing to pay out the nose for a well-brewed IPA, obviously, but if you're charging me $12-plus for some poorly concocted well drink, it's going to kill the whole show.
In that same vein, the poor pass protection for the Cardinals has the potential to wreck Palmer's stellar play at any given moment. A line with this many holes isn't exactly the best venue for an immobile, gaining Palmer at this stage of his career. But don't worry, just like you can get around the concert-killing terrors of overpriced drinks with a good vibe in the surrounding musical compatriots in the crowd, the Cardinals are making up for their protection issues with a stellar cast of receivers.
Look, everyone knows about Larry Fitzgerald. I've been telling you John Brown is good literally forever, but the new Cardinals wide receiver on the scene is rising from the ranks of the unknown to make a claim for their top spot.
Jaron Brown has 29 targets over the last three weeks, that's one more than Larry Fitzgerald in the same span. He also gets more vertical targets than his veteran counterpart, averaging 14.9 air yards on his targets this season. Brown draws a matchup with the Eagles pass defense that is in the bottom-10 at defending the deep ball (20-plus air yards) in the left and middle portions of the field by passer rating allowed.
If you haven't picked up Brown by now, you must do it now. He's getting reliable volume in a Cardinals offense that leads the NFL passing play percentage with 69.9 percent. Everything about that screams sustainability. Brown is in an ideal spot this week and should be able to help you to go forward.
Vintage Veteran
Some things get better with time. Like a full-flavored cask of aged bourbon or that one pair of skinny jeans, you've worn in so much that they feel like sweatpants (let's be honest, I have, like, eight pairs of those). The same goes for fantasy football players. Did you draft Hunter Henry thinking the shiny new young tight end would be the next big thing? Get in line with the rest of the herd. While you and the rest of the mainstream horde are all about the up-and-coming young talent in the NFL, us Fantasy Hipsters are sticking with experience over youth. Each week in this space, we'll deliver one Vintage Veteran player of the week that you can rely on to produce for your fantasy team. Now where did I put my great-grandpa's brogues?
Marshawn Lynch, RB, Oakland Raiders
Yeah, that's right. Beast Mode. You've probably never heard of him.
Straight out of retirement, Marshawn Lynch was a borderline second-round fantasy pick in redrafts back in August. All the sheeple were nostalgic for the Beast Mode of old to come back to form. Newsflash: He hasn't quite been the dominant running back we grew to love back in his hay day with Seattle. Must be something in the fair trade, locally sourced and organic coffee up there.
I digress.
This week, while all of you mainstream bums are sipping pumpkin spice tea and raking leaves from your front yard, Beast Mode is going to light it up against the Ravens. There are a few factors that should lead to a big day for Lynch, that only us Hipsters are, well, hip to.
First, Oakland will be without quarterback Derek Carr who is set to miss a few games with a fractured back. That means EJ Manuel is going to start under center, and you'd have to think the Raiders coaching staff would rather not have him throwing the ball a ton. That means more handoffs to the Vintage Veteran Lynch early and often. And if Lynch can get rolling, there might be no stopping him.
Second, there's a good chance he gets rolling. The Ravens defense has been torched by running backs. A combo of Jaguars and Steelers backs combined for 428 scrimmage yards and three rushing scores against Baltimore the last two weeks. And on the season, the Ravens are allowing the fifth-most fantasy points per game to opposing backs (21.3).
Plus, Lynch's workload hasn't been huge recently with the Raiders falling behind early the last two games in tough matchups. It's true, he hasn't produced because of it, but Oakland is returning to their home turf to face an east-coast team making a cross-country trek. Lynch has fresh legs and he's going to put this struggling Raiders offense on his back.
Barrel-aged bargain:
When we're building lineups for the week, we're always looking for a bargain. The thing is, those of us who don't want to live cookie-cutter lives aren't chasing for some boring old fill-in; we're still after something fresh. Just like a good barrel-aged craft beer that's off the beaten path away from dull domestic brews, we want a different kind of bargain brought on by a unique spin on an outcome of a game that the public just hasn't considered yet.
Jacoby Brissett, QB, Indianapolis Colts
It's bye week time. You can't be afraid to go shopping at the quarterback thrift store for our bargain this week. We have Matt Ryan, Drew Brees, Kirk Cousins and future Hall of Famer Trevor Siemian unavailable this week. I sincerely hope all those fellas enjoy their little week away but we have lineups to set.
If you need quarterback help this week, you should go all the way to the bottom of the barrel for this bargain and stream Jacoby Brissett. The 49ers and Colts gave has the best chance to be the beautifully bad shootout of the week. Neither team features a stellar stop unit and Brian Hoyer and Jacoby Brissett have at least one explosive fantasy game on their 2017 resumes. San Francisco allowed a combined 649 yards to Jared Goff and Carson Palmer in back-to-back weeks.
I know you mainstream folks want some upside in a quarterback streamer and Brissett has it. He's averaging 9.1 intended air yards on his passes this season, which means he's comfortable chucking it deep. I mean, did you see his sick touchdown throw to Donte Moncrief in Seattle last week? Come on. This guy can sling it. The icing on the cake is his rushing ability. Brissett has taken off 10 times through his three starts and popped in a pair of touchdowns against the Browns in Week 3.
Maybe you didn't know about him until he got traded to the Colts. That's fine, I can't remember where he played before this, either. Probably some small market team no one has ever heard of. Here's the deal though: after Sunday, you'll remember Jacoby Brissett when you start him in fantasy and he's a top-10 quarterback. Yep. I said it.
Most Ironic Stats of Week 5
-- Amari Cooper has caught just 12-of-31 intended targets this season (38.7 percent), the lowest rate in the NFL. Yikes.
-- Kareem Hunt has more rushing yards in the second halves of games this season (372) than any other player has in their full games. (He might be good, which ironically, nobody saw coming.)
-- Carson Wentz leads NFL quarterbacks with a 54.0 percent conversion rate of his third and fourth downs this season (via either pass or rush). Dude still has haters.
-- Joe Flacco has averaged 4.45 fantasy points per game this season against team that are not the Cleveland Browns.
-- Deshaun Watson is the only rookie in NFL history with 7+ pass TD and multiple rushing TD in his team's first 4 games. Sell high, kids.
Pour over your lineup
Franchise: What's up, Harmon? Ready to dominate this lineup for another loyal Hipsters follower?
Harmon: Not really, but I guess if we have to be here we can look at this team.
Franchise: He started Evans on TNF ... not off to a great start. There's one dude on his bench who I think he can slot in at WR2 for some upside ... I know you know who I'm talkin' about.
Harmon: I'm just going to go ahead and assume you're talking about Devin Funchess. I'm about it. Look, I wasn't a big of him as a college prospect, but I can evolve. Just like I started drinking these gorgeous coffee stouts when my palette grew, my view on Funchess has changed.
Franchise: We're on the same wavelength, man. I'd pop Funchess in over Alshon Jeffery, who hasn't been very productive and is in a bad matchup. What do you think about Russell Wilson / Deshaun Watson at quarterback?
Harmon: I dig Watson again this week but give me Russ here. People were trying to throw shade at me for my preseason call of naming him fantasy player of the year, well, guess what? He's the QB3 in fantasy after four weeks and he's totally on fire the last two games with seven total touchdowns. Not to mention, he's so fun to watch. Seeing him scramble out of the pocket and throw outrageous passes on the move is the best fever dream ever induced.
Franchise: Ironically, and in perhaps the most shocking development of the week, I have to agree with you here. Wilson is hot right now, and if the Seahawks want any chance to win, they'll have to put up a ton of points against the Rams (that feels weird to say). Watson's been great, but he was also on my sell high list this week.
Can we talk for a second about how he has a punter on his roster? This has to be, like, the most hipster fantasy league ever.
Harmon: Seriously. Like, I can't even handle that. So hipster. I'm feeling a little too mainstream after this follower just shamed us with his punter fantasy league. Should we head out to the local consignment shop, buy some vintage threads and tell everyone we see we're better than them?
Franchise: Marquette King for the win. That might be the only way we can regain our hipster street cred, my friend. Hipsters out?
Harmon: Hipsters out.

Last week, we reported that Sony was moving forward with a pilot program where they would offer clean versions of selection movies on digital download. The list of 24 films ranged from inoffensive fare like Goosebumps to R-rated comedies like Step Brothers. These clean versions already existed from being edited for airlines and cable networks, but now Sony was simply offering it as a bonus to anyone who wanted the clean version with their digital download. It didn't supplant the original version, and it wasn't being forced on anyone.
Nevertheless, there's been an outcry, and Sony is reconsidering the program. The studio tells THR, “Our directors are of paramount importance to us, and we want to respect those relationships to the utmost. We believed we had obtained approvals from the filmmakers involved for use of their previously supervised television versions as a value added extra on sales of the full version,” so now they're going back and making sure the directors are okay with the clean versions being sold. If they're not okay with it, Sony says “we will discontinue it for their films.”
Already, Judd Apatow has spoken out on Twitter about having clean versions of his films sold, saying “This is absolute bullshit and @sony and @SonyPictures is gonna get hell for F—ING with our movies. Shove the clean versions up your asses!” I assume Apatow is referring to movies he's produced since all the films he's directed were for Universal.
Ultimately, it looks like Sony never bothered to reach out to directors. “The Clean Version initiative is news to Adam McKay. He would not have agreed to this,” said a rep for the filmmaker. McKay's Step Brothers and Talladega Nights are both offering clean versions.
On the one hand, I sympathize with the filmmakers. It sounds like their movies are being tampered with and resold by people who didn't want their original vision. On the other hand, these versions already exist. I seriously doubt any director would tell a major studio, “You can't edit my movie for airlines or for cable networks,” because those are major revenue streams. Sony is simply trying to get a little more money with a product it already has. Filmmakers can object to people watching those versions, but that version already exists no matter what. I'm not exactly sure what's been solved by removing it from digital download. Then again, I'm not exactly sure who wants a “clean version” of Step Brothers in the first place.
London: Egypt star Mohamed Salah won the prestigious BBC African Player of the Year award on Monday, rewarded for 2017 packed with sparkling displays for Liverpool, Roma and his national team.
The 25-year-old topped a poll that saw a record number of votes cast after firing Egypt to the final of the Africa Cup of Nations and almost single-handedly taking Egypt to their first World Cup finals since 1990, scoring five and setting up their other two goals in qualifying.
Salah, the Premier League's top scorer with 13 goals, also scored 10 times in all competitions for Serie A club Roma in 2017 before making the move to Merseyside.
"I am very happy to win this award," Salah told BBC Sport.
"It's always a special feeling when you win something. I feel like I had a great year, so I'm very happy."
Salah beat a star-studded cast of rivals to become the third Egyptian to win the award and first since Mohamed Aboutrika picked up the gong in 2008.
Gabon's Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Guinean Naby Keita – his future Liverpool team-mate currently at RB Leipzig – fellow Reds star Sadio Mane of Senegal and Chelsea's Nigerian winger Victor Moses lost out to the pacy attacker, nicknamed the "Egyptian Messi".
"I want to be the best Egyptian ever so I work hard," added Salah, who helped with 15 goals helped Roma to their best ever points total of 87 as they finished second in Serie A last season.
"I always follow my own way and I want everyone in Egypt to follow my way."
Salah joins African legends such as Ivorian duo Didier Drogba and Yaya Toure – the latter won it twice – as well as Liberian striker George Weah in winning the award.

The Devon Rotary Club is hosting a delegation from Ukraine through March 24.
The delegates speak some English, and a translator has been provided as they visit the area and meet with local officials and residents.
The group is visiting to learn from the local community about various programs and outreach and to bring back information to their country so they can develop and grow similar programs there, said Tami Jackson, representing the Devon Rotary and Literacy Volunteers of Southern Connecticut.
The delegates from Ukraine include a librarian, English as a second language teacher, educational rehabilitation project manager, Peace Corp member and a city council member.
“We, in the club, are very excited to welcome our new guests to Milford,” Jackson said.
Their visit here includes attending local events, and going to New York to see the Statue of Liberty and Ground Zero.
They will also visit Yale University, as well as the local library and soup kitchen.
They will meet with local officials, including City Clerk Joanne Rohrig and State Rep. Pam Staneski at the Parson's Government Center to see how city departments interact with each other and the importance of legislative functions in creating and sustaining democracies.
Mayor Ben Blake will meet the group to discuss how local government works.
On Thursday, the group will go to Quinnipiac University to meet with officials from the Central European Institute to discuss academic and business development relationships in Hungary and Poland.
The statement itself sounds absurd.
The idea that any player could score 100 goals in a single season is outlandish considering the only man to get close just so happened to be the greatest hockey player to ever live. Wayne Gretzky set the NHL record in the 1981-82 season with 92 goals and after setting that mark some 36 years ago, the only other person to come anywhere close in the last decade was Alex Ovechkin with a 65-goal season in 2007.
100 goals seem next to impossible. Yet, as crazy as the idea sounds, one of the greatest players in NHL history believes it's possible.
One of the Best Watching Arguably the Best
The Edmonton Oilers played the Calgary Flames to open their season on Wednesday and in that game, Connor McDavid, Edmonton's superstar captain scored the only three goals of the contest as the Oilers shut out the Flames. McDavid was dangerous all evening and if it weren't for a stellar performance by new Flames' netminder Mike Smith, McDavid could have had one, even two more tallies.
One of the players looking on in astonishment was newly acquired Flames' forward Jaromir Jagr.
Not signed in time to be game-ready, travel and make the opening night roster for the Flames, Jagr watched on as McDavid put on a show. When asked about the phenom, Jagr could only smile and had a hard time describing what watching him felt like:
“What to say? McDavid is just too good. He's a great player. If he learned how to score on breakaways a little more, I think he'd score 150 in a season. To score 100 for him … it's possible. I've never seen anything like that in my life, to dominate like that with his speed.|
Is 100 Even Possible?
Jagr went on to detail the difference between the NHL of the past and the NHL of now. Long gone are the days of clutching and grabbing that was so prevalent in the years Gretzky set all sorts of records. Back then, it was like Gretzky was hauling a busload of school kids and rarely got a call. In the current NHL landscape, players with speed and skill are nearly unstoppable without taking a penalty.
This season, in particular, the NHL has made slashing and other minor infractions something that will be called regularly and McDavid is one of the NHL's best at drawing those types of penalties. He'll see more power play time in 2017-18 than ever before and he'll get even more opportunity to score.
But, C'Mon, 100 Goals?
It's only been one game and the rule of thumb is to never get over-excited after one victory. There are still 81 more games to go and to assume McDavid will score a hat trick in all of them is foolish. But, the way he played opening night, it's nearly impossible not to think about what he could do in those 81 remaining matchups.
Anyone who watched on Wednesday night has to believe, if McDavid stays healthy, he's got the ability to score at least one goal in 75% of the games he has left. To do so would put him at 63 goals on the season. If you give him 20 two-goal games (amazing, but not absurd) he'll have around 83. That alone would be incredible, especially if you consider that just last season he only netted 30.
How many more multi-goal games would he need? One or two four-goal performances almost feels expected. From there, it's anyone's guess.
Still Not Convinced
If the most cynical of fans were to remotely believe 100 goals was possible, a few things would have to happen.
First, McDavid has to shoot more. He talked about wanting to increase his shot totals at the beginning of the year and it looks like he's off to a good start. On Wednesday, he had seven shots on net. That pace obviously won't continue, but there could be an awful lot of games he comes close and other games where he has more.
Second, he'll need to keep using his speed. It's hard to imagine that McDavid could have gotten faster, but he has. He was burning past defenders all evening and during his second goal of the game, he was clocked skating over 40km per hour. He stopped on a dime, threw the puck upstairs on Smith and never once touched the goaltender. His speed is simply too much to handle for defenders and the Calgary Flames are assumed to have one of the better blue lines in the league.
Third, is his ability to finish breakaways. He's already great, but when you consider how many he'll get this season, if he finishes breakaways at just a 25% clip, he'll probably net 20 goals on undefended shots alone.
Why Even Talk About It?
Again, the idea that an NHL player can score 100 goals in a season is ridiculous. And, to be having this conversation after one game is the kind of thing a fan with a serious case of drinking the Koolaid would do. But, a fan didn't suggest it. One of the better players in hockey did.
With a smile on his face, if a player like Jagr jokingly says McDavid could score 150 if the young star was better on breakaways, you know he's only partially kidding when he says 100 is within reach.
Let's put it this way. If McDavid scores even half of what Jagr thinks he can, it will be a glorious day for the Edmonton Oilers, the NHL and fans in Edmonton who so badly want the team to make a trip to the Stanley Cup playoffs again, and this time go deep.
Those fans in Edmonton who saw Jagr's interview just got a whole lot more excited. As if there wasn't enough of a reason.
Carnival Cruise Line Announces Cruises to Cuba
Cruise News – Feb. 14, 2017
Carnival Cruise Line has announced that it's received approval to sail to Cuba, and will be adding the Cuban capital of Havana to select Carnival Paradise cruises. The overnight visits to Havana will be featured on a dozen 4- and 5-day cruises aboard Carnival Paradise departing from the Port of Tampa starting June 29, 2017.
Four-day cruises will depart June 29, July 13, August 24, September 7 and 21, and October 5 and 19, 2017, as well as May 3, 2018, and include a daytime and overnight visit to Havana. Five-day voyages will depart August 14 and 28, September 25, and October 9, 2017, and include a daytime and overnight visit to Havana as well as a stop in either Cozumel or Key West.
“Cuba is an island jewel unique from anywhere else in the Caribbean and we are thrilled to have this rare opportunity to take our guests to this fascinating destination,” said Christine Duffy, president of Carnival Cruise Line. “The opportunity to visit Havana, combined with the fun, relaxed ambiance, and wide variety of amenities and features offered on Carnival Paradise, will make for a truly one-of-a-kind vacation experience,” she added.
The visits to Havana comply with regulations of the U.S. Department of Treasury that permit travel operators to transport approved travelers to Cuba to engage in activities as defined by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Foreign Assets Control.
Carnival Paradise guests will be able to choose from a range of shore excursions that showcase Cuba's vibrant culture and beauty, along with the island's warm and friendly people and centuries-old architectural landmarks.
The number of cruise ships to sail from the United States to Cuba has significantly increased in the past several months. In December 2016, for example, several major cruise lines announced approval to sail to Cuba, including Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, Regent Seven Seas Cruises, Royal Caribbean International, and Azamara Club Cruises.

In another six years, India is expected to overtake China and become the world's most populated country. However, India can bring about a turnaround in its population growth rate in another 37 years, provided it manages to bring down the birth rate, or total fertility rate (TFR), below 2.0 between 2035-2040, the 2017 revised projections of the Population Division of United Nations' Department of Economic and Social Affairs has said.
The projections also said India is expected to reach its maximum projected population by the year 2061 but will achieve a TFR of 1.8 by that year. TFR is the average number of children born to a woman.
However, by then, India's population would have increased by 33.9 crore (based on the current medium variant projections of the UN report). The slowdown in growth rate is also likely to include an improved sex ratio and a decrease in the number of newborns while an increase in the number of senior citizens, the 2017 revised population projection suggests.
Why does total fertility rate matter? Whether or not India will cross the 2 billion mark depends entirely on birth rate, particularly in heavily populated regions, the data suggested. The 2017 population projections confirm the numbers required from India to maintain a trajectory which would see a decline in population growth. So India is more or less on the correct path. The challenge will be to maintain the current rate.
The country, however, will continue to contribute to global immigration, with over 100,000 people migrating overseas every year.
What's more interesting is that by 2050, all regions of the world except Africa will have nearly a quarter or more of their populations at ages 60 and above. Africa will be relatively younger than the rest of the world.
COX'S BAZAR/DHAKA, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Bangladesh is deploying thousands of extra police to Rohingya refugee camps in the south, officials said, after a series of mostly unexplained killings that have sown fear among hundreds of thousands of people who have fled from neighbouring Myanmar.

Since August, when a military crackdown in Myanmar forced many of the Muslim minority to cross the border into Bangladesh and seek shelter in the crowded camps, 19 people, some of them community leaders, have been killed.
Police have made a number of arrests in connection with some of the killings, but say the motives often remain unclear.
Conducted after dark and often by groups of men wielding pistols, knives, and sticks, the killings have sent a chill through the camps, which are guarded by the Bangladesh army during the day but manned by fewer police officers at night.
A.K.M. Iqbal Hossain, police superintendent of the coastal town of Cox's Bazar under whose jurisdiction the camps fall, said a special force of roughly 2,400 men was being formed to guard the refugees.
A second senior officer, Superintendent Afrujul Haque Tutul, said police numbers were already being increased.
“We have 1,000 police officers right now for a million people, so you can imagine,” he said.
More than 700,000 Rohingya have taken shelter in Cox's Bazar district since August, joining thousands who were already living there, making it the world's largest and fastest growing refugee camp.
Even before the August exodus, there had been violence in the camps, which Bangladesh police and aid workers have previously blamed on a struggle for control of supplies to the camps.
STABBED 25 TIMES
The latest killing, of 35-year-old Arifullah, took place last month on a busy road outside the Balukhali camp, where he had been appointed a leader of thousands of refugees.
A group of men surrounded him on the evening of June 18, stabbing him at least 25 times, police said. A pool of blood stained the spot the next morning, and a crowd of refugees could be seen gathered around.

Police said three Rohingya men had been arrested over the killing of Arifullah, who spoke English, had worked for international agencies in Myanmar, and often met foreign delegates who visited the camps.
His wife, who did not want to be named and asked Reuters not to disclose the location where she was interviewed because she feared attack, said Arifullah was a critic of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) – a militant group whose assaults on Myanmar security posts in August triggered the crackdown by the military.
The group says it is fighting for the rights of the Rohingya. Police said investigations into the murder were ongoing and they had not found links to ARSA.
A spokesman for ARSA referred Reuters to its Jan. 31 statement that said other armed groups were responsible for “activities” at refugee camps and were using its name to malign its image.
The group said it did not attack civilians and would never carry out killings in the camps because its was thankful for Bangladesh's generosity in sheltering the refugees.
That statement was issued after the Jan. 19 killing of Yusuf, another English-speaking camp leader. Sitting on the mud floor of her shelter, Yusuf's wife Jamila said her husband had been watching a football match on his phone with his two sons when around a dozen men barged into their shelter in the Taingkhali camp carrying knives and pistols, shooting him twice.
She said police had urged her to file a case and name suspects, but she had refused, fearing retaliation, and because she did not want to leave her shelter for hours to go to court. “I'm scared for my children,” she said.
Details of Yusuf's killing were confirmed by police superintendent Tutul at the Cox's Bazar police station. He said the police investigation was hampered because the refugees were afraid to name suspects.
He said intelligence received so far suggested several of the killings, including those of Yusuf and Arifullah, were due to personal disputes refugees had brought from Myanmar.
Police have arrested about 300 Rohingya in cases involving killings, robberies and abductions in the camps since the August influx, Tutul said.
Camp leaders at Balukhali and Taingkhali said the army had appointed Rohingya volunteers to keep guard at night, but most had stopped working because they were not being paid.
Foreign officials said security inside the teeming camps was a worry. “What I hear from my colleagues is that is obviously a big concern,” Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said on a visit to the camps on Sunday.
“It is obvious that it is a big challenge when you have big numbers, poor conditions, cramped situations.”

“I used the word ‘anger,' but I was more worried about crying, to tell you the truth,” Thurman said in the Times article. “I was not a groundbreaker on a story I knew to be true. So what you really saw was a person buying time.”
Thurman's allegations against Weinstein had been widely anticipated since she hinted late last year that she had a story to tell about the beleaguered movie mogul, who has been accused of sexual misconduct against many women, but wanted to wait until she was less angry. Her story came in an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd.
NEW YORK — Actress Uma Thurman, in long-awaited remarks, has accused embattled Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of forcing himself upon her sexually and accused Kill Bill director Quentin Tarantino of making her perform a dangerous car stunt that injured her.
Thurman told Dowd that an early encounter with Weinstein in a Paris hotel room in the 1990s ended with him suddenly appearing in a bathrobe and leading her to a steam room but that the first “attack” — the word appears in quotes — happened later in London.
“He pushed me down,” she said. “He tried to shove himself on me. He tried to expose himself. He did all kinds of unpleasant things. But he didn't actually put his back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard.”
Later, she alleged, she arranged a meeting with Weinstein and warned him: “If you do what you did to me to other people you will lose your career, your reputation and your family, I promise you.”
The Times article says Thurman's memory of the Weinstein encounter stops there, but it quotes a friend who was waiting downstairs as saying Thurman emerged from an elevator dishevelled and shaking.
“Her eyes were crazy, and she was totally out of control,” said the friend, Ilona Herman.
When Thurman was able to talk again, Herman said, she revealed that Weinstein, who was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, had threatened to derail her career.
A representative for Thurman, Leslie Sloane, responded to an Associated Press request for more details on all the encounters by saying only: “The article speaks for itself.”
Weinstein, the executive producer of award-winning movies including Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's Good Will Hunting and Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, acknowledged making an “awkward pass” at Thurman but denied physical assault and emphasized a long-standing professional relationship with her.
“Mr. Weinstein acknowledges making an awkward pass 25 years ago at Ms. Thurman in England after misreading her signals, after a flirtatious exchange in Paris, for which he immediately apologized and deeply regrets,” his representative Holly Baird said in an emailed statement. “However, her claims about being physically assaulted are untrue.”
The statement questioned why Thurman waited 25 years to make her allegations public and said numerous photographs show Thurman and Weinstein had a “strong relationship” for many years.
Thurman, one of the stars of Pulp Fiction, also was quoted as saying that just before shooting began on Tarantino's Kill Bill: Vol. 1, which came out in 2003, she told Tarantino about Weinstein and he confronted the mogul, leading him to apologize.
But Thurman also described a harrowing onset episode on location in Mexico in which Tarantino ignored her expressed fears of driving a car that she had been warned might be faulty.
Tarantino persuaded her to do it, the article said, quoting him as saying, “Hit 40 miles per hour or your hair won't blow the right way and I'll make you do it again.”
Video accompanying the article online shows Thurman struggling to control the car and crashing into a tree.
Thurman said in the article “that was a deathbox that I was in,” the seat “wasn't screwed down properly” and the sand road “was not a straight road.” She said that after the crash she left a hospital in a neck brace with damaged knees and a concussion.
Tarantino's representatives did not respond to the AP's request for comment. The Times also did not get a response, according to the article.
Weinstein, who has been accused by scores of women of sexual assault or harassment, was fired by the film company he founded with his brother and was expelled from Hollywood's movie academy. He has apologized for causing “a lot of pain” with “the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past” but has denied “any allegations of non-consensual sex.”

Stock up on Bolly if you want some for Christmas, as stocks are about to run out on the other side of the Channel!
Absolutely Fabulous lushes Patsy and Edie are returning to the BBC for the festive season for a Champagne treat.
On a visit to France, Joanna Lumley , 71, and Jennifer Saunders , 59, travelled to the Bollinger vineyards to learn how their characters' favourite tipple is produced.
And, it goes without saying, they made sure they got to sample some.
“It was a blast, even though it was work,” Joanna tells 3am. “And we had great fun catching up.”
Their new travelogue will air in a Boxing Day special.

Fans of the BBC series have been hoping for a sequel to last year's Ab Fab movie, which saw Kate Moss plunged into the Thames and cameos from everyone who's anyone in showbiz.
However, Joanna reveals that scriptwriter Jennifer is not planning any more escapades for the fashion darlings.
Speaking as she launched War Horse: The Story in Concert album, which she narrates, Joanna said: “I don't think Jennifer will write another Ab Fab. It was a lot of work and she'd like to go out on a high.“
“So I think Jen would prefer to do everyone together, if she did do it. Leave it as it is, I would say.”

The series ran on the BBC in the 90s and returned for specials to mark its 20th anniversary in 2012.
Joanna previously revealed she'd offered Jennifer £200,000 to write a sequel to the movie after Jennifer created the first one following a bet with pal Dawn French . The film raked in £16million – which equates to 533,000 bottles of Bolly.
Joanna adds: “I am so lucky to be part of that show! We had a blast making it.”
Hyderabad: When the late Dr YS Rajashekhara Reddy (YSR) decided to take up the agrarian crisis brewing in the-then combined state of Andhra Pradesh as the primal issue against the rapidly consolidating halo and brand of Nara Chandrababu Naidu in the 1999 elections, he thought he had, besides history on his side, a winning issue.
The worsening crisis had been ubiquitous across regions and distress, indicated most predominantly by rising suicides of farmers unable to repay private lender loans during a sustained drought, and yet, it did not seem like a winning political issue.
The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) had, since its formation in 1982, made history by sweeping elections within nine months of its formation but had never retained power for a second term in Andhra Pradesh, like the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre in India. The TDP was betting on retaining power for a consecutive term based on a single factor – the brand image of Naidu; like BJP would rely on Brand Modi in 2019, against a populist free-power promise of YSR.
YSR lost and Naidu won in 1999, aided by an added factor of being an important partner of the Atal Behari Vajpayee-led NDA, Kargil War victory, nuclear tests and a general pro-NDA mood prevalent across India before the turn of the millennium.
Parallels between Naidu and Modi
There may be little similarity between Naidu's coup against matinee-idol and founder of TDP, late NT Rama Rao, after the patriarch brought his party in power in the 1994 elections against the Congress and a fair, open manner of the internal takeover of Modi within BJP in 2013, wherein he took responsibility and led the party to an unprecedented victory.
Naidu stole power, whereas Modi earned it. But thereafter, Brand Modi which has enamoured the country so much leading to massive returns in 2014 elections, and subsequently, is eerily similar to the erstwhile Brand Naidu.
One might think the Rajdeep Sardesai-Arnab Goswami tale we recently heard of one scribe usurping and internalising professional experiences and key features of someone else's curriculum vitae might be more widespread, and prevalent in politics as well. Modi perhaps deeply analysed, understood and acquired Brand Naidu and initiatives approach, modified it for a pan-Indian appeal and added it as a sheen over his nationalist-Hindutva core.
The big challenge ahead for Rahul Gandhi and his tattering Congress, no matter what the final results of the Gujarat polls are on 18 December, is this Brand Modi; that which defeats the Congress even before the polls, in their very minds; as indeed Naidu was then, a difficult force to face up to in the adversary's own head.
Naidu pioneered a mega vision approach, working with McKinsey to launch the Vision 2020. He launched Janmabhoomi programs, wherein he encouraged celebrities from all walks of life to clean, yes, clean streets and local areas, using brooms and harnessed photo-ops to great impact.
The File Clearance Week pushed the focus on how bureaucracy was stalling files and put a focus on it. Clear and Green was voluntary cleanliness by another name. Biometric attendance and login made offices look efficient, like never before. Prajala Vadaki Pallana took the administration to people where petitions, complaints and concerns were heard and cleared on the spot. Tree plantation, water harvesting, computers for efficiency, start-ups, sports, fitness, every initiative was taken up on a mission mode, with a target and deadline, and a good pontification on the near-divine-to-saintly qualities of a young, dynamic, visionary leader who was the CEO of Andhra Pradesh.
Naidu's rhetoric was the buzz of commonplace conversation, media discussions and analysis. The pradhan sevak was clearly an 'inspired' script.
Consider two statements of Naidu: "I won't sleep till Andhra Pradesh develops. I work 18 hours a day and urge every one of you to do so", and "I will not take one paisa bribe or allow anyone in my party or government to do so".
Naidu used endorsements from Bill Gates, heads of the World Bank and IMF and heads of visiting countries to build his brand. Long before LinkedIn built it, he knew the value of professional endorsements, especially form business barons and spiritual leaders. He ensured US president Bill Clinton visited his mega creation, CyberTowers, the new temple of a panacea for a New Andhra Pradesh – technology.
Yoga and meditation were made compulsory for all MLAs, then bureaucrats and senior police officers. Cinema stars, business icons, sports stars and intellectuals made a beeline for a photograph. He became bigger than the party and government, it was the Naidu government not Andhra Pradesh or TDP government. His appointments were perceived as spectacular; he had appointed the first woman Dalit speaker to any State Assembly, he had nominated a Dalit as a Lok Sabha Speaker.
In those days, Naidu would disrupt everything, carefully crafting an image of a global development icon, champion of reforms but devoted to welfare of people achieved through growth and trickle down impact. He started the Indian School of Business, NALSAR, and the Indian Institute of Information Technology on one hand, and Shilparamam, a village themed park for artisans to sell their wares and Rythu Bazaars to enable farmers to get higher remuneration for their produce by selling grain and vegetables directly to urban consumers. The international airport, ring road and other major infrastructure projects all build the hope for a ‘Golden Andhra Pradesh'.
The food for work program and micro lending for women DWCRA groups consolidated the image of economic reforms being for a purpose of alleviating poverty. Power reforms and pioneering private power production made him the natural choice for awards – Best chief minister, man of the year, IT visionary, laptop CM and CEO of AP.
By 2002, it seemed too remote a possibility for anyone to even challenge, much less beat, either Vajpayee or Naidu.
YSR's farmer bet
With the media and narrative strongly set in favour of Naidu, YSR took to a gruelling padayatra to force the media and popular conversation to a topic that had been brushed under the carpet – extreme agrarian grief. While media flashed Naidu and Gates, Naidu and Hitech City, Naidu and broad roads, Naidu and new projects, YSR walked from village to village, across three regions of the state – Telangana, Rayalaseema and Andhra.
Where the camera would never go, YSR went there, and the media was forced to go too, and thus expose an underbelly of big claims. Naidu's claims of hospitals, school buildings and irrigation canals were exposed; YSR could show to people, through a reluctant media in awe of Naidu, that canals were dry, schools had no teachers, hospitals were dilapidated and without medicines or doctors.
People saw and brought into the new narrative of YSR – Naidu was only for Hyderabad and Andhra Pradesh was more than just one thriving capital city. The biggest beneficiaries of Naidu, people of a city he rechristened Cyberabad, also joined the rest of the state to defeat him in 2004, for neglecting the farmers and villages and focussing only on them.
It was YSR's great political intuitiveness to understand that brands are built in urban minds, but can be shattered by focusing on rural reality.
Rahul's Bharat yatra
Today, Rahul, possibly shrunk in perception as a leader and looking pale and dwarfed against an inflated perception of Modi's invincibility, despite increased traction since his US trip and good response in Gujarat, will do well to realise the control of media narrative the incumbent prime minister has. Like Naidu, Modi has crafted his image by co-aligning with several endorsements, initiatives, with added advantages Chandrababu never had; brilliant oratory, the RSS, Hindutva ideology and social media power.
Instead of going to places known, like IITs or IIMs, or the United States of America, or post disaster spots, Rahul must take the media to places they don't visit, ever. To villages and check if villagers are happy. If farmers are happy. If woman are happy. If hospitals have improved. If primary schools have been bettered. To government offices. To fields. To homes of artisans. To small towns. To see if power is supplied. If LED lights have come. If highways are really being constructed at the pace claimed.
Like YSR, if Rahul can undertake a padayatra across India, or even a rath yatra like LK Advani, he can let common people tell other common people if acche din are here. The power of such a cumulative people view on Modi's performance will be the best bet for Rahul Gandhi in 2019; the irrefutable plight of the farmer and rural citizen will be the best argument against the Modi-Amit Shah duo's battle cry.
Instead of Rahul saying Modi has failed, he would do well to imitate YSR and let common people tell other common people if they are happier under Modi.
Because Naidu did lose to YSR in 2004. He not only remained in Opposition as a shrunk leader with little prominence but also never came back to ruling in his beloved Cyberabad. And Modi might still lose in 2019.

Coming off consecutive losses, Whitmore rose up to resurrect his status as one of the favorites for next month's Breeders' Cup Sprint, prevailing in a long drive for a head victory in the Grade 2, $250,000 Phoenix Stakes on Keeneland's opening day. The race awarded the winner a fees-paid berth in the Nov. 4 event at Del Mar.
"[We were looking for] a tightener, something to show that he's back to Whitmore," said trainer Ron Moquett, who co-owns the 4-year-old gelding with Robert LaPenta and Head of Plains Partners. "Our end-of-the-year goal has always been the Breeders' Cup. We were happy to be able to do this on the way to the Breeders' Cup."
Awesome Banner, who had been fractious in the paddock, was the fastest away from the gate in the Phoenix and led the field by 1 1/2 lengths through an opening quarter of 22.27 seconds, and the half in 45.75. Meanwhile, Whitmore ($8.80) and Manny Franco broke from the outside in the field of 11 and wound up racing in the five path, 2 1/2 lengths behind Awesome Banner in fourth, down the backstretch.
Whitmore gained ground around the far turn, with Threefiveindia also making a bid between horses. Awesome Banner still clung to a narrow lead as Threefiveindia, Whitmore, and favored Limousine Liberal, in that order, went after him in earnest in upper stretch, the top four separated by heads. Whitmore prevailed in the long drive, getting the nod at the wire over a dead game Awesome Banner. Limousine Liberal was another neck back in third, besting Threefiveindia by a half-length for that placing.
The final time for the six furlongs was 1:09.90.
Whitmore was considered a classics prospect in the spring of his 3-year-old year after finishing second in both the Grade 3 Southwest and Grade 2 Rebel Stakes and third in the Arkansas Derby. But he finished 19th in the Kentucky Derby, after which he got an extended break.
The gelding returned in December 2016 at Oaklawn, capturing a pair of allowance-optional races before stepping back into stakes company, this time in one-turn events. He found his niche, rattling off wins in the Hot Springs Stakes and Grade 3 Count Fleet Sprint Handicap before shipping to Pimlico to win the Grade 3 Maryland Sprint Stakes.
Moquett said that Whitmore can be "a bit of a handful at the barn" and credited members of his team - the trainer's wife Laura Moquett, exercise rider Greta Kuntzweiler, and groom Jose Espinoza - for their work with the gelding.
"They've all had the patience to help him develop into what he's meant to be, and that's a really cool horse," Moquett said.
But Whitmore's win streak ended at five when he was a well-beaten third as the favorite in the Grade 2 True North Stakes at Belmont. He wasn't seen in the afternoon again for three months, as he shipped to Saratoga but was forced out of the summer's Grade 1 action with a foot issue. He finished third of four in last month's Grade 3 Frank J. De Francis Memorial Dash at Laurel, where Moquett said his charge didn't relish the track.
"We had a few setbacks," Moquett said. "I'm not mad. If you can have a bad race and run a 95, 97 Beyer Speed Figure, you're not doing too bad. The horse has carried us."
Whitmore will now carry his team to the Breeders' Cup at Del Mar, where the Sprint field is expected to be led by reigning divisional champion Drefong.
"There are obviously some great sprinters out there, but we're not afraid of anyone," Moquett said. "We respect and appreciate what they've done, but we're not afraid of anyone."
Kendrapara (Odisha): A daily wager's son from a village in Odisha's Jagatsinghpur district has cleared the Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced), clinching 582 rank in the Scheduled Caste (SC) category.
Bikash Das, who belongs to a family that comes below the poverty line, has secured 582 rank in the SC category, and is now eligible for a seat in the IIT.
His father, Bijoy Das, said, "Bikash never studied in an English medium school. He received his education at the primary and high school in the village and was good in academics."
"I am a farm labourer. I toil in the field to earn my livelihood. Despite severe fiscal constraints, I prioritised my son's education. From his primary school days, he showed brilliance in studies in Manapur upper primary school. I saved money for his studies. I am really happy now," Das said.
"My father is my inspiration, guide and philosopher. He sweated it out to financially support me in my studies. He never made me feel the pangs of poverty. Whatever I have achieved today is only because of him," Bikash said.
"Parental support with hard work has paved the way for my success. I never believed in shortcuts to achieve success," he said.
New Delhi: State-owned oil firms IOC, BPCL and HPCL today signed an agreement to jointly set up the world's largest refinery and petrochemical complex at Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra at a cost of US $40 billion.
Indian Oil Corp (IOC) will be the lead partner with 50 percent stake while Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) will take 25 percent stake each, IOC Chairman Sanjiv Singh said.
The three oil refining and marketing companies signed the joint venture agreement here this evening.
Speaking on the occasion, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said though India is the world's third largest energy consumer after US and China, its per capita energy consumption is one-fourth of the world average.
"Domestic oil demand is likely to climb to 500 million tonnes by 2040. Against this, our domestic refining capacity currently is 230-235 million tonnes. We need to plan capacity addition to not just meet this demand but also of export market," he said.
Already, 55 million tonnes of brownfield refinery expansion has been finalised at existing refineries and a new 9 million tonnes unit is planned at Barmer in Rajasthan, he said.
He said the 60 million tonnes capacity refinery at Babulwadi, Taluka Rajapur in Ratnagiri district is being set up keeping in mind the future fuel demand and the export potential of the country.
The refinery will have an accompanying mega petrochemical plant, Singh said adding the petrochemical plant would include an aromatic complex, naphtha cracker and polymer complex.
The project will take five-six years after land acquisition and all clearances, he added.
The entire refinery will include three crude units of 20 million tonnes each.
IOC has been looking at West coast for a refinery as catering to customers in West and South was difficult with its refineries mostly in the North.
HPCL and BPCL have also been looking at a bigger refinery because of constraints they face at their Mumbai units.
The refinery will produce petrol, diesel, LPG, ATF and feedstock for making petrochemical that are basic building blocks in plastic, chemical and textile industries.
Fifteen million tonnes a year is the biggest refinery any public sector unit has set up in one stage. IOC recently started its 15 million tonnes unit at Paradip in Odisha.
Reliance Industries holds the distinction of building the biggest refinery in India till now.
It built its first refinery at Jamnagar in Gujarat with a capacity of 27 million tonnes, which was subsequently expanded to 33 million tonnes. It has built another unit adjacent to it for exports, with a capacity of 29 million tonnes.
Being on the West coast will provide the unit a natural advantage of easily sourcing crude oil from the Middle-East, Africa and South America, officials said, adding East coast was not being considered as shipping crude oil there will add at least US $1 per barrel to cost.
Also, moving products to consumption heartland from west will not be difficult.
India has a refining capacity of 232.066 million tonnes, which exceeded the demand of 194.2 million tonnes in 2016-17 fiscal.
According to the International Energy Agency (EA), this demand is expected to reach 458 million tonnes by 2040.
IOC has 11 refineries with a total capacity of 81.2 million tonnes while BPCL has four refineries with a total capacity of 33.4 million tonnes. HPCL has three refineries with a total capacity of 24.8 million tonnes.

Rhubarb is a traditional allotment favourite that's become very trendy again, especially when it is forced, and now's the time to do it.
Using an established plant, cover the crown with straw and place a large bucket over the top to exclude light.
Terracotta rhubarb forcers at RHS Harlow Carr, Harrogate.
You can use a traditional terracotta forcer, like these pictured at RHS Harlow Carr – but they're really expensive and a cheap bucket works just as well.
The pale pink, tender stems can be harvested about eight weeks after covering.
Don't force the same crown for two years in a row, as it weakens the plant.
If you can wait for a natural crop, all the better, as patience is needed for a rhubarb plant to build itself up.
Ornamental leaves look great against contrasting shapes, such as this bamboo Fargesia Pingwu.
Pot-grown rhubarb can be planted at any time, in an open, sunny site with free-draining soil. With crowns, plant late autumn-early winter. You can plant later, but run the risk of crown rot.
If you planted new crowns in autumn, don't harvest during the first year. Remove a few stems the next year, then up to a third or half from then on. It's best to stop cropping by June (unless you have an autumn-cropping cultivar), or at least only remove a few stalks after then – older varieties often go stringy then and the plant needs the sustenance.
HOW TO GROW GUIDE
l Planting time (pot grown): Anytime.
l Crowns: October-December.
l Harvesting time: early spring (forced) to midsummer; autumn for late varieties.
l Planting distance:Space plants 75-90cm (30-36in) apart, with 30cm (12in) between rows.
l Aspect and soilL: Sunny, well-drained soil (will tolerate some shade).
l Hardiness: Hardy.
l Difficulty: Easy.
l Recommended varities: Timperley Early: Thick stems, early, high yield. Bred for forcing; performs very well outside, but even better colour when forced. Victoria: Late (summer) type with heavy yields.Hawke's Champagne: Compact plants with high yield potential. It has bright red, medium length, uniform stems.Livingstone: Autumn cropping, from September to November.

JOBS TO DO THIS WEEKEND
Lily bulbs can be planted in pots, for flowers this summer. After growing on in a cool greenhouse, they can be moved on to the patio when in flower.
Check tender plants overwintering outdoors to make sure protective coverings are still in place.
Continue to deadhead winter pansies and other winter bedding. Pansies will carry on into the spring and even to early summer if attended to often.
Cut off old leaves of hellebores that produce flowers from ground level (including Helleborus x hybridus and H. niger) to expose the flowers and remove possible foliar diseases such as hellebore leaf spot.
Look out for rot (such as crown rot, Sclerotinia, delphinium black blotch, black root rot and Antirrhinum rust) on emerging perennials.
Many summer-flowering deciduous shrubs can be pruned now – those that flower on the current year's growth, including Buddleja davidii, Ceratostigma, Hydrangea paniculata, Lavatera, Leycesteria, Perovskia, hardy fuchsias, and deciduous Ceanothus.
Prune Wisteria by cutting back the side shoots shortened by summer pruning to two or three buds (2.5-5cm/1-2in). Avoid cutting off flower buds.
Dig a new pond.Have a minimum depth of 60cm (2ft) at the deepest point, to reduce the risk of the pond freezing totally. Gently sloping contours between the shallow and deep areas, and between the bank and the water, are more wildlife-friendly.
If you do have any seedlings, make sure they are getting the maximum light available, or else they will become weak and leggy. If necessary, turn them once a day so that they get light on both sides. This will stop them leaning over towards the light, and keep them upright and compact.
Plug plants can be grown on in your greenhouse, being a relatively cheap source of large numbers of plants.

The 63-year-old woman killed in a fatal hit-and-run on Wednesday night in Toronto has been identified by Global News as Debbie Graves, who was in town on business from New Brunswick.
Graves, an employee of market research company Numeris, usually worked out of the Moncton office, but was working out of the company's Toronto Don Mills office at the time of the incident.
Global News learned that Graves had just gotten off work at 11 p.m. and was walking back to her hotel, the Westin Prince, across the street when she was struck and killed. She was pronounced dead on scene.

Police said the driver of a 2014-2016 Nissan Rogue mounted the northbound curb of York Mills Road just west of Don Mills Road, striking the victim before fleeing westbound on York Mills Road.
Investigators said the vehicle would have sustained damage to the passenger's side.
A witness, identified as Dion, told Global News that he was standing at a bus stop when Graves was struck.
Dion, also an employee of Numeris, said he ran to the woman's side to see if he could help.
Dion said a friend who had been with Graves when she was struck yelled for help and said she would have to call the woman's daughters.
Graves' obituary said that she loved gardening and sewing, and was happiest when spending time with her family.

She leaves behind two daughters. Her husband passed away five years ago.
“The Numeris family was shocked and saddened to learn of the tragic news,” wrote the company in a statement to Global News. “[Graves] was an incredibly valued member of our team and we will miss [her] greatly.”
The company added that out of respect for the family, they will not be providing any further comment.
With the #MeToo movement here to stay, how is it changing the dating game?
“Masculinity is getting blurred and women are still looking for a guy to take the lead,” said relationship expert Laura Bilotta.
“I don't think that flirting will ever stop … but I think that men will be more cautious.”
I sat down with four single men, all at different stages in life. Although they met before today, they all share on thing in common — dating in a post-Weinstein era.
Here's part of that conversation:
“There's certainly a much wider conversation going on — not only when you're on a date, but also between male friends,” said 26-year-old copywriter Dominic Smith.
“Relationships are like business now … I mean you have to have rules, you have to have rules that make the relationship work,” said 50-year-old actor Philip Moran.
“Maybe it could be perceived in the wrong way, but I feel like you just got to come off genuinely friendly,” said 23-year-old student, poet and motivational speaker Wali Shah.
“I'm very open and up front … As an adult, as a person, you should be able to kind of read verbal signs, physical signs – if somebody is interested or not,” said 42-year-old real estate broker Alex Moloney.
Meanwhile, there's a new app that's trying to take away any confusion. It lets you consent to having sex. It's called LegalFling and it seeks to make the dos and don'ts of a relationship clearer.
“I don't think written consent is going to fly,” said Bilotta.
In 1953, an American writer wrote, “A good man is hard to find.” Some good men say they are having a difficult time navigating the waters of a relationship, so where do we go from here?
“Women are still looking for a gentleman — someone to pay for the date, some to lead that date,” said Bilotta.
“I think with the #MeToo movement, men are going to take a step back.”
An apartment building at UBCO was evacuated early Monday as the result of a fire.
The fire was reported at around 12 a.m. in a unit at Discovery Avenue at UBCO.
“First in Engine reported smoke and sprinkler activation in a second floor unit at this location,” Platoon Captain Kelly Stephens said.
He said the cause of the fire was bedding and a mattress placed against a baseboard heater, and added that fire sprinklers had doused the fire before it could spread.
The lone occupant of the unit managed to escape unharmed.
Water damage was contained to the second floor unit and six units below.
All affected students have been allowed to return to their units.
Valentine's Day isn't always a bed of roses especially if you're working it. There's a lot of time and planning that goes into the big love day to set the scene for romance.
In fact, those working in industries that cater to couples and making the occasion special – couldn't remember the last time they celebrated Valentine's Day on February 14th like everyone else.
“Never, not for years and years and years – this is how I celebrate,” said Rebecca Hunter, Store Manager for Crave Cupcakes.
Hunter who was up at six a.m. said the most difficult part about the occasion is that it falls on a different day every year, so figuring out how many cupcakes to make is pretty much just an educated guess.
“We decide on how busy the past couple of days were, the weather outside which is absolutely lovely is great for us and hope that we get it right.”
With a line-up wrapped around the counter, staff were icing delicious delights as quickly as they could.
“Our bakers usually start at five a.m., today they were here by three, we baked 90 dozen cupcakes today,” said Hunter.
“Normally, the bake would be done or probably by nine in the morning and today they're still baking.”
From cupcake spots to flower shops, restaurants to even health care – among those we spoke to said they're used to it and cupid would just have to wait.
“Probably the week-end and we'll go out for supper, I'm hoping” laughed Roberta Materie, a laboratory technician at St. Paul's Hospital.
For many industries, Valentine's Day will mark the busiest day of the year.
“We probably will send out about 250 deliveries out the back door and probably about 150 to 200 in the store so it's pretty crazy,” said Jana Ellis, Owner of Bill's House of Flowers.
“It's all day long, I've been here since six o'clock this morning wrapping arrangements.”
Adding to the complexity, the flowers need to be fresh so not a lot of work can be done weeks or even days in by the florists in advance.
“We worked all day Sunday to get ready, we stay late. We just keep working until it's all done,” Ellis said.
It's no wonder folks were running off their feet on Tuesday, love may be blind but it's also not cheap. According to one survey the average Canadian will spend $305 on Valentine's Day.
It will be all hands on deck at Ayden Kitchen and Bar in downtown Saskatoon, more than 100 couples are expected to wine and dine from its specialty menu.
“There are still some late spots available as well as a few different spots at the bar which normally we don't reserve the bar but tonight we're doing it,” said Brett Theriault, who's worked the night for the last decade.
“We extended hours a little bit so people can sneak in that romantic dinner.”
Unlike a set menu, the restaurant is offering a three-course menu with options for every course.
“We like providing a little bit of variety and it's nice because you'll get couples come in and there are a few different choices,” Theriault said.
“They'll kind of order different things and share, that's what we like to encourage rather than picking one set menu that people have to get.”
A hot bath and some much-needed sleep is how many said they planned to recover from all the romance and the big business that comes along with it but that they didn't feel like they missed out.
“Every day is a day of love right?” smiled Ellis.

The Latest on actress Uma Thurman's allegations of sexual misconduct by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein (all times local):
5:45 p.m.
Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein's attorneys have suggested Weinstein could take legal action against actress Uma Thurman, who has accused him of forcing himself upon her sexually years ago.
Weinstein's lawyers say he acknowledges making an "awkward pass" at her in a London hotel room but denies physical assault.
Attorney Ben Brafman says Weinstein is "stunned and saddened" by the allegations, which came in a New York Times interview with columnist Maureen Dowd published Saturday. The attorney says it's a mystery why Thurman would wait 25 years to publicly make the claim.
Brafman says Thurman's statements to the Times "are being carefully examined and investigated" before Weinstein decides whether any legal action against her would be appropriate.
Thurman says Weinstein pushed her down and tried to shove himself on her and expose himself.

1:15 p.m.
Actress Uma Thurman has accused embattled Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of forcing himself upon her sexually and director Quentin Tarantino of making her perform a dangerous car stunt that injured her.
Thurman is quoted in The New York Times on Saturday as saying Weinstein attacked her in London. She says he pushed her down and tried to shove himself on her and expose himself.
Weinstein's representatives say he acknowledges making an "awkward pass" but denies physical assault.
Thurman says when she expressed fear about driving a possibly faulty car in Tarantino's "Kill Bill: Vol. 1" he insisted.
Video shows Thurman crashing into a tree. She says she left a hospital in a neck brace with damaged knees and a concussion.
Tarantino hasn't responded to a request for comment.
QUETTA - A hand grenade attack in the provincial capital of Balochistan Monday killed one child and wounded the other two who were playing there. A police official said the unidentified miscreants on motorcycles threw a hand grenade in the premises of Shanties in Jinnah Town's Barat village where three children were playing. A child Hussain Bakhsh was killed in the attack while two other injured children were immediately shifted to Civil Hospital Quetta where one child was in a serious condition, he added. The police are investigating the incident and were yet to determine the nature and intensity of the blast.
Weekend flu shot clinics vaccinate dozens Saturday
The deadly flu outbreak is still threatening lives. It has killed 53 children and 16 in just the past week.
The Florida Department of Health is working to get people potentially life-saving flu shots in the area.
Last weekend, the demand for flu shots in Collier County outweighed the supply. But it was a different story this weekend.
Free clinics were prepared to meet the masses with more than 1,000 flu shots readily available for children and adults.
Dozens made their way to the health department in Collier County Saturday to protect themselves from the influenza virus threatening the community.
For Maureen Marotta, getting her flu shot is something she's been holding off on her whole life. She just got a flu shot for the first time Saturday.
“They weren't as stressful years ago. At least we're informed now to take precaution,” she said.
Across the country, the number of flu cases being treated is still on the rise.
“Right now there are a lot of cases of influenza and we want to be sure everyone in our community has the opportunity to be protected by getting the flu shot,” said Cindy Whetsell with Florida Health.
Protecting yourself and others around you is something health officials highly encourage.
“It's one defense that you have against a terrible virus. If you don't get the vaccine and you get sick, you can end up in the hospital with a lot more injections and needles,” Whetsell said.
Flu season lasts until June, which means you have plenty of time to get your flu shot. According to officials, it takes about two weeks for the shot to take full effect.

Indigenes of Twon Brass and Olugbo kingdom in Brass and Southern Ijaw local Government area of Bayelsa State have commended the Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC) for its continued efforts toward the development of the two communities.
According to the indigenes, the company has always lived up to its corporate social responsibility, by meeting the basic needs of host communities, thereby improving the living conditions of the people.
The indigenes of the communities, in a press statement jointly signed by the Youth Secretary of Twon Brass, Mr. Robert Desmond, and the Community Development Committee (CDC) Chairman of Olugbo kingdom, Hon. Moses Biewari, commended the multinational company for providing a cutting-edge cold room and bakery in Twon Brass and Olugbo kingdom, respectively.
“We wish to thank the Nigerian Agip Oil Company for mounting a state-of-the-art cold room in Twon Brass and bakery in Olugbo kingdom communities a week ago.
“This well thought-out action has once again made it evident that NAOC is concerned about the plight of our people as well as committed to improving the standard of living.
“The two facilities will no doubt create jobs, encourage industry and consequently reduce crimes in our communities, thus we are immensely grateful to the management of NAOC for coming up with such lofty initiative.
By this initiative we believe that the well-established partnership between NAOC and our communities will become more cordial,” the statement reads in part.
The statement further extolled the Managing Director of NAOC, Mr. Masimo Insulla, for working round the clock to ensure that the company has a sound relationship with host communities, while carrying out her operations in the Niger Delta region, noting that he has expressed great professionalism, integrity and compassion in the course of undertaking his job.

Suspected Islamic extremists opened fire at a Turkish restaurant in the capital of Burkina Faso late Sunday, killing at least 18 people in the second such attack on a restaurant popular with foreigners in the last two years.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the violence, which continued into the early hours Monday. Gunfire could be heard almost seven hours after the attack began.In addition to those killed, eight others were wounded, Communications Minister Remi Dandjinou told journalists. Two of the attackers were also killed, he said.The victims came from several different nationalities, he said. At least one of the dead was French and another was Turkish.Security forces arrived at the scene with armored vehicles after reports of shots fired near Aziz Istanbul, an upscale restaurant in Ouagadougou. The attack brought back painful memories of the January 2016 attack at another cafe that left 30 people dead.Three or four assailants arrived at the restaurant on motorcycles and then began shooting randomly at the crowds dining Sunday evening, said police Capt. Guy Ye.Burkina Faso, a landlocked nation in West Africa, is one of the poorest countries in the world. It shares a northern border with Mali, which has long battled Islamic extremists.In the 2016 attack the attackers were of foreign origin, according to al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, which claimed responsibility for those killings along with the jihadist group known as Al Mourabitoun. But the terror threat in Burkina Faso is increasingly homegrown, experts say.The northern border region is now the home of a local preacher, Ibrahim Malam Dicko, who radicalized and has claimed responsibility for recent deadly attacks against troops and civilians. His association, Ansarul Islam, is now considered a terrorist group by Burkina Faso's government.shortfall.
Saskatchewan's premier says a rash of drug overdoses in the province is an issue both the government and Opposition can work on together.
Premier Scott Moe said a recent spike in cocaine laced with fentanyl isn't just an urban issue, it extends to smaller communities too.
READ MORE: Weyburn Police Service warning public about cocaine laced with fentanyl
“This will not be dealt with just through law enforcement,” Moe said during Monday's question period. “The leader of the Opposition is correct and we need to continually work.
“This may be an opportunity where both sides of the house would be able to do some work together.”
Three people died in Saskatoon earlier this month in overdoses believed to be linked to cocaine laced with fentanyl.
Police said on Friday that two more sudden deaths in Maidstone, a rural Saskatchewan community near the Alberta-Saskatchewan boundary, may also be overdoses.
And the RCMP said that two people were found in the Kamsack area northeast of Regina on Wednesday with substances believed to be cocaine and fentanyl in their systems.
WATCH: Weyburn is the latest Saskatchewan community fighting fentanyl
On Saturday, Weyburn police warned that cocaine with fentanyl had been found in that city.
“I'm not aware that Saskatoon has actually had any turned in, and we've not had any questions since Saturday about turning anything in,” Weyburn police deputy Chief Rod Stafford said on Monday.
“I don't really suspect we will have anything turned in, but we wanted to make sure that people were aware that they could, without fear of arrest or prosecution.”
Three men were arrested as a result of the Saskatoon deaths after investigators took the unusual step of releasing the street name and phone number of an alleged drug dealer in the hope of preventing further deaths.

The Opposition NDP raised the issue of Naloxone kits being limited to pharmacies along with limited use of Narcan nasal spray in the province.
“One of the things we talked about was a harm reduction measure … (like) having the Narcan nasal spray available,” Sask. NDP leader Ryan Meili said.
“(Narcan is) a Canadian-made drug that sort of immediately overturns the effects of an overdose and is much easier to use than Naloxone.”
Moe said his government would take those points under advisement.
“I think it's important for us to have that discussion on: Is there an opportunity for us to provide more accessibility to just those kits in light of recent occurrences here in the province?” Moe said.

Word had been quiet on the project over the past few months, but Warner Bros. is working on some sort of reboot of The Matrix. It has been said that they aren't going to remake the original Matrix movie or anything like that, but a new Matrix movie is in the works to some degree. One can't bring up The Matrix without immediately thinking of Keanu Reeves. Though, when it comes to this new movie, don't ask him about it, because he doesn't know anything.
The actor appeared at New York Comic-Con in order to promote his upcoming sci-fi movie Replicas. IGN was on the ground at the event and was in attendance for the panel. During the Q&A portion of the panel, Keanu Reeves took some time to talk a bit about some other projects he's working on. And in this case, one he's most definitely not working on. Here's what he had to say when asked about the proposed, The Matrix 4.
"Remaking The Matrix. I don't know. Maybe it's...I don't know anything about it."
IGN's report notes that the crowd began to boo when the subject of this Matrix reboot came up. The Matrix, at least the first one, is truly sacred to many people and the idea of another movie that won't feature Keanu Reeves and won't have the Wachowskis involved clearly isn't a popular one. In fact, IGN says when the crowd began to boo, he held the microphone out for the crowd, seeming to imply that he agrees with their sentiment. If he doesn't know anything about it, then it's likely he hasn't been contacted.
The Matrix is considered among the greatest accomplishments not only in sci-fi, but cinema in general. The sequels were not nearly as well received by either fans or critics and the series didn't conclude in a satisfying way. But the power of that first movie is truly something. So at least Warner Bros. has the good sense not to remake it, but their proposed new Matrix movie could tarnish that legacy. The news of the movie broke in March and the studio was said to be assembling a writer's room to work on the project, but we haven't heard many concrete details since.
The only thing we've heard is that, at one point, Michael B. Jordan (Creed) was being eyed to star, possibly as a young version of Morpheus. It should also be noted that Keanu Reeves did say at one point that he would be willing to do The Matrix 4, if the Wachowskis were the ones doing it. But since that isn't the case, he clearly isn't going to do it and, as it stands, Warner Bros. doesn't seem to want him for it. IGN didn't have any other details to provide, for the time being, but we'll be sure to keep you up to date as any new details on The Matrix reboot are made available.
KARACHI - Two suspected terrorists were killed and 15 others, including two women, arrested in eight raids by Sindh Police's Special Security Unit (SSU) in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, said a SSU spokesman in a statement here on Sunday.
He said the accused, affiliated with a banned organisation, were involved in attacking police officials and the personnel of other law enforcement agencies (LEAs).
The spokesman said that SSU officers, including commandos, took active part in these raids. Two sub-machine guns (SMGs), two pistols, two hand grenades, explosive material/devices and several 9mm pistols were recovered from the possession of the accused, he added.
About security for anti-polio teams during the past months, he said over 5,000 SSU commandos provided effective security to health workers during 44 anti-polio campaigns in the city.
The spokesman, giving details about SSU assistance in security measures in the city in 2016, said over 123 SSU commandos provided security during the inauguration ceremony of Yadgar-e-Nishan-Pakistan.
On the occasion of Ramazan-ul-Mubarik 1,355 SSU commandos provided security to citizens at a number of shopping centres in Karachi.
On the eve of Eid-ul-Azha, 834 SSU commandos took part in patrol and performed duties at different points to ensure law and order. Besides, the commandos provided security on the occasion of collection of hides.
In the light of threat alert issued from intelligence agencies, the SSU officers and commandos performed duties in different educational institutions. The SSU also made adequate security arrangements during the visits of foreign dignitaries, including Prince Karim Aga Khan, Sayedna Mufdil Bora Pir, delegation of Turkey and Sultan of the UAE.
The SSU also provided awareness about the measures to be adopted in case of any emergency situation under the programme Hostile Environment Awareness Training at the Karachi University, Hamdard University, Shaheed Benazir Bhutto University, Federal Urdu University and Jinnah University.
Anthony Davis led New Orleans with 38 points and managed to keep the Pelicans from getting completely blown out in the first quarter, when the Wolves opened a 22-6 lead. Davis scored 19 first-quarter points to help the Pelicans pull within single digits at times, but Minnesota had an answer for every run and shot 50.5 percent on the night to steadily maintain its lead.
Project Fi has been quietly plugging along since April 2015 when Google launched its then invitation-only phone service. That most of you haven't heard much about Fi in the ensuing three years no doubt reflects the fact that very few phones are compatible with the service.
On Wednesday, Google announced that three new handsets will be coming soon to Fi, starting with the budget-oriented $199 moto G6 that is now available for preorder--Motorola's phone normally goes for $50 more.
The other devices, both from LG, are higher-end smartphones: the $740 LG G7 ThinQ and the $899 LG V35 ThinQ.
These latest phones, each with large screens, portrait mode-equipped cameras, and expandable storage, join the only others in what remains a thin Project Fi portfolio: Google's own Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, the Android One moto x4, plus the older Google devices that are still supported, the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Pixel and Pixel XL.
Expanding the Fi lineup is certainly a positive, but it's still difficult to imagine that Fi will suddenly gain a bevy of new customers, especially since it still lacks the most prized phones on the market from Apple and Samsung.
“The handset choice, or better the lack of it, is a big hurdle,” says Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics. “Not having iPhones is literally halving its addressable market.”
Suffice it to say, Fi never emerged as the disruptive force in wireless that some predicted when rumors first surfaced that Google had designs on becoming an Internet Service Provider. For its part, Google maintained that it wasn't trying to overtake the cellular business but rather to showcase what was possible when the company could manage the hardware in its devices, the software in Android and the connectivity with Fi.
The appeal of the service for consumers is that Google charges low rates---$20 a month for unlimited calls and texts, plus $10 for each gigabyte of data up to 6GB. But Google doesn't make you pay for data you don't use.
Of course the environment has changed since 2015, with consumers now having many attractive unlimited wireless plans from which to choose.
Google's network is actually an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) that in the U.S. piggybacks off T-Mobile, Sprint, and U.S. Cellular, and automatically chooses the fastest and strongest available network to glom onto, whether that's cellular or Wi-Fi. (Overseas, it works with a European provider Three.)
Google didn't answer my question on how a T-Mobile-Sprint merger, if approved, might impact Fi, and best I can tell hasn't taken a public stance on the merger.
Nor has Google said how many customers it has for Project Fi, which in my mind has always been something of a curiosity.
“I don't think it is growing much if any at all,” Entner says. “Advertising and promotion is the lifeblood of any wireless brand. Without it, and I haven't seen any advertising for it, it languishes. As the name indicates it's a project, not a product.”

A 49-13 loss might cause some to hang up their helmets, but Brusly High head football coach Hoff Schooler looks at the situation differently after their loss last Friday, Sept. 29, to West Feliciana High School.
Schooler said there were many positives that came out of the game for the Panthers.
“Early on they gave us a formation offensively that was giving us a problem with alignment, but we were able to get that adjusted on the sideline and that is a sign of getting more mature as a defense. I look at the film and see 11 guys running to the football each play on defense, and for the most part we played their option game well,” Schooler said. “We had a couple guys sick or injured defensively and had to play with two guys who have not started a varsity game, I thought those guys played well for their first time out. We are moving the ball well on offense, but we need to do a better job of finishing drives.”
The Panthers defense was able to keep the Saints from scoring until late into the first quarter when West Fel's Derek Turner scored first with a quarterback keep.
Brusly struggled to get past midfield most of the first quarter and was forced to punt back to the Saints with just over three minutes left in the first. The punt put West Fel back on their own 25-yard line, but a 65-yard pass from Turner to Davon “Smoke” Harris put the Saints up 14-0 by the end of the quarter.
After offset personal fouls, Brusly found themselves on their own 20 after the kickoff, and it looked as though the Panthers were about to get themselves past the 50-yard line and set up for a score. Quarterback Nick Penell rushed to the 37, followed by a short run by Avery Grant to the 40. A Brusly fumble gave the ball back to the Saints on their own 30-yard line, which then turned into a 30-yard pass once again from Turner to Harris for their third score of the game to make it a 21-0 lead.
Two more touchdowns from the Saints' Harris put Brusly down 34-0 at halftime.
“The speed that West Feliciana has at the skill positions is being tough for anyone to defend both when they are on offense and in special teams,” coach Schooler said. “It is difficult to replicate that in practice with scout teams. Offensively, we moved the ball well all night, but we had three drives stall out inside their 30-yard line during the first half that could have changed the game if we go ahead and punch those into the end zone.”
The second half didn't start off on a good note for the Panthers either, when on the kickoff, West Fel made it to Brusly's 33-yard line and after two plays, were in the endzone and up 42-0.
Schooler said that their problem was twofold.
“It was a combination of them being a talented and experienced team and us being fairly young. We made some mistakes early on, but for the most part we are in position to make plays defensively we just need to finish,” Schooler said.
The Panthers were able to make up for a mistake, when after turning over the ball to West Fel, Brusly stopped the Saints in the red zone, by recovering one of their fumbles.
After fumbling and recovering twice, the Panthers were unable to complete the drive and were forced to punt.
Halfway through the fourth quarter, the Panthers were finally able to get into the endzone with a Penell quarterback keep. A two-point conversion attempt was unsuccessful.
A fourth quarter touchdown from a Penell pass to Tyler Theriot put more points on the board for Brusly, eventually making the final score 49-13.
Despite the loss, Schooler saw plenty of good things coming from his offense and said that he feels that offensively, the Panthers were much more efficient in their passing game on Friday night and that they will continue to get better with more experience.
“We challenged the players at halftime to go out and win the second half and I think we did just that, learning how to play for 48 minutes with a great attitude and effort regardless of the scoreboard will benefit us no matter how talented the opponent,” Schooler said.
The Panthers will face district rival University Lab this Friday at home. Kickoff is at 7 p.m..
