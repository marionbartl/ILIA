Seth Shteir, National Parks Conservation Association, (760) 332-9776, sshteir@npca.org Thousands Voice Support for Proposed California Desert National Monuments Momentum Grows for Permanent Protection WHITEWATER, Calif.— From business leaders to recreationists and conservation groups to desert residents, almost 16,000 people have joined together in sending letters of support for permanent protection of some of the California desert's most spectacular landscapes, recreation areas and wildlife habitat. Their calls to the Obama administration to permanently safeguard these areas culminate the day before Senator Feinstein, Obama administration officials and other leaders host a community meeting on the proposed Mojave Trails, Sand to Snow, and Castle Mountains national monuments. The hearing will be Tuesday, Oct.13 at the Wildlands Conservancy in Whitewater, Calif. “More than 20 years ago the California Desert Protection Act raised the profile of California's magnificent deserts. We now have an opportunity to continue the vision of permanently protecting the austere grandeur and unique wildlife of our desert,” said Joan Taylor, vice chair of the Sierra Club's California/Nevada Desert Committee. “People from across state, across the country, and even around the world come to experience the wonder of the California Desert. It's time to put Mojave Trails, Sand to Snow and Castle Mountains national monuments on the map.” This most recent wave of public comments adds to those from elected officials, business owners, veterans, faith leaders and others who have banded together to push permanent California desert protections over the finish line after nearly a decade of public meetings and local input. Within the proposed monument areas are irreplaceable historic, cultural and natural wonders — from Historic Route 66 and American Indian petroglyphs to the threatened desert tortoise and the headwaters of the Santa Ana River. “The California desert is home to some of the most treasured and imperiled plants and animals in America, including the threatened desert tortoise and desert bighorn sheep. The habitat and wildlife corridors here are irreplaceable, and it is essential that this unique part of our country be protected, especially in the face of a changing climate,” said Kim Delfino, Defenders of Wildlife director of California programs. “These rugged, beautiful California landscapes and the awesome plants and animals that live there will greatly benefit from the protections national monument status will give them, especially as climate change advances,” said Ileene Anderson, a scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity. Designation of these areas as national monuments would protect the desert's natural beauty and enhance recreation opportunities; it would also be a boon to the local economy. Already Death Valley and Joshua Tree national parks and other protected public desert lands contribute millions of dollars to the economy every year. “The designation of the Sand to Snow, Mojave Trails and Castle Mountains National Monuments protect outstanding recreational opportunities, core habitat for iconic desert wildlife like bighorn sheep and desert tortoise, and a tapestry of public lands which preserve important wildlife corridors between the national parks, Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service managed lands,” said Seth Shteir, desert program manager for the National Parks Conservation Association. “The new monuments will also raise the profile of the California desert as a destination for tourism.” ### The Sierra Club is America's largest and most influential grassroots environmental organization, with more than 2.4 million members and supporters.

(Reuters) - Virginia will no longer recognize concealed-carry handgun permits from 25 states that have reciprocity agreements with the state, effective Feb. 1, Attorney General Mark Herring said on Tuesday.
Virginia took the step because laws in those states are less restrictive, Herring's office said in a statement.
SEE ALSO: Support for legal abortion at highest level in 2 years
The change prevents people convicted of a felony, domestic abusers, those adjudicated mentally ill or incompetent, recently convicted drunk drivers and dishonorably discharged military personnel from using a permit from those states in Virginia.
The state is the site of worst mass shooting in U.S. history, a 2007 rampage at Virginia Tech University in which 32 people were killed.
The change came after a review by Herring's office and the Virginia State Police of the 30 states whose concealed handgun permits are valid in Virginia under a reciprocity policy.
Virginia will continue to recognize concealed-carry permits from Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.

Concealed permit rules approved by Virginia lawmakers "should not be undermined by wrongly recognizing permits from other states with more permissive standards," said Herring, a Democrat.
Governor Terry McAuliffe, also a Democrat, has vowed to tighten gun laws but has been thwarted by the Republican-controlled legislature.
Chris Cox, executive director of the Institute for Legislative Action at the National Rifle Association, the Virginia-based gun lobby, said permit holders were among the safest groups of people in the United States.
"Plain and simple, this is putting politics above public safety. This decision is both dangerous and shameful," he said in an emailed statement.

Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth talked about pricing for Ubuntu smartphones this week, telling The Inquirer that devices "will come out in the mid-higher edge, so $200 to $400."
Assuming those are off-contract prices, they would make Ubuntu phones significantly cheaper than the iPhone 5S, which costs $649 to $849 depending on how much storage you get. The highest-end Android phones often sell for $600 and up as well, though the Nexus 5 debuted late last year at just $350 off contract.
"We're going with the higher end because we want people who are looking for a very sharp, beautiful experience and because our ambition is to be selling the future PC, the future personal computing engine," Shuttleworth said, according to The Inquirer report. The highest-end Ubuntu phones are expected to become full PCs when docked with a monitor, mouse, and keyboard.
Canonical previously tried to raise $32 million to fund the development of a premium smartphone called the Ubuntu Edge, with prices ranging from $600 to $830. But the crowdfunding campaign fell short, so the phone won't be built.
We have some reason to believe that neither major carriers nor handset manufacturers will offer Ubuntu phones in the US during 2014. Elsewhere, the first Ubuntu phones are expected to ship this year from two hardware manufacturers, BQ in Spain and Meizu in China.
UPDATE: A Canonical spokesperson told Ars that while the company provides pricing guidance to device makers, "the final pricing structures and go to market plans will be set by our partners, Meizu and BQ." The spokesperson confirmed that the prices quoted by Shuttleworth are the off-contract, unsubsidized guide prices.
Unlimited domestic phone calls are nearly standard feature for landline plans these days. Now, Vonage Holdings Corp., which helped pioneer that feature with its Internet phone service, is expanding it to most international calls as well.
CEO Marc Lefar said Wednesday that Vonage will include unlimited calls to more than 60 countries in a new standard plan that costs $25 per month, replacing a plan of the same price that included unlimited calls to just six countries.
The new Vonage World plan also replaces various step-up plans that included expanded international calling, like an “Enhanced World” plan that gave unlimited calls to 58 countries for $40 per month.
Lefar said that while domestic long distance calling has been declining, international calls have been rising year by year, yet pricing hasn't kept pace. He expects to market the new plan to immigrants in the U.S., including Asians and Latin Americans.
Vonage is the largest of the independent companies that supply their subscribers with adapters that let them plug their home phones into their broadband connections.
In its heyday it added hundreds of thousands of customers per quarter, thanks it part to its offer of unlimited domestic calling for a flat monthly rate.
But growth tapered off as it battled patent lawsuits, while cable and phone companies countered with their own unlimited-calling plans. Subscriber numbers are now slowly shrinking, to about 2.3 million at the end of June. That makes it the eighth-largest landline phone company in the U.S.
Vonage will still charge extra per-minute fees for calls to mobile phones in most countries under Vonage World. Lefar said the prices would be competitive with the cheapest competitors, like Skype and Google Voice.
Current Vonage subscribers must call the company and request to be put on the plan, but there is no charge for switching, Lefar said.
Lefar also said Vonage will start transcribing subscriber voicemails into text and sending them via e-mail or text message for subscribers who choose that. Google Voice does this as well.
“Our research tells us people aren't even listening to their voicemails anymore,” Lefar said.
Hillary Clinton, on the final Saturday of the 2016 presidential race, relied on a legion of surrogates and A-list entertainers to help make closing arguments, while Republican rival Donald Trump reveled again in the status of his outsider, go-it-alone campaign.
“We don't need Jay-Z to fill up arenas,” Trump said in Tampa, Florida, the first of his four rallies Saturday, three days before Election Day. “We do it the old-fashioned way, folks. We fill them up because you love what we're saying and you want to make America great again.”
Trump -- estranged from much of the Washington establishment that he's vowed to dismantle if elected -- was on the campaign trail alone Saturday with the exception of vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence.
The Indiana GOP governor and former congressman has been a steady, reliable running mate for the unpredictable Trump, holding together the Republicans' conservative base, even on the worst days of Trump's 18-month campaign.
Pence, in fact, campaigned Saturday in Wisconsin with House Speaker Paul Ryan, who vowed in early October that he would no longer campaign for Trump, after the release of a 2005 audiotape in which Trump is heard bragging about kissing and fondling women without their consent.
“When Donald Trump says he's going to repeal ObamaCare, we are ready. We are willing, and we are able,” the Wisconsin congressman and leader of the Republican-controlled House said at rally with Pence in Mukwonago, Wis.
“I voted for Donald Trump and every Republican I saw on the ballot,” offered Ryan, among the Republicans who appear to have put party unity above their differences with Trump, as the race tightens and appears potentially winnable for the GOP.
Fox News confirmed Saturday that Ryan told reporters earlier in the day that he would have campaigned with Trump in the state this weekend, but the event was cancellled.
A Fox News poll released Friday shows Trump now trailing Clinton 43-to-45 percent, while the nominees remain within a few percentage points of each other in Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and a few other battleground states that will decide the race.
Early-voting results from some of the those states show Clinton appearing to have a slight lead in Florida and with Hispanic voters, including those in Nevada.
However, early voting among African-Americans, who have in recent decades voted consistently for Democrats, appears down compared to their record numbers when they helped elect President Obama, the country's first black president, in 2008 and 2012.
Early, in-person voting in North Carolina ended Saturday.
Clinton headlined two battleground-state rallies Saturday and again relied on star power to help her with younger voters.
She began with an outdoor rally in South Florida to appeal to the region's large black and immigrant population -- including Cubans, Columbians and other Latinos. And she will close with a rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with recording artist Katy Perry.
“In case you didn't notice last night, I got to say I was with Jay-Z and Beyonce,” Clinton said at the Florida rally, which was ended by rain after about five minutes. “It was the most extraordinary show. When a famous entertainer tells you I want to support you and do a show, it's such a gift.”
Clinton is expected to be joined Sunday by NBA star LeBron James in Cleveland, Ohio, where Jay-Z and Beyonce performed.
Meanwhile, Obama will return to Florida to help his former secretary of state, who is a if elected would be the country's first female president.
Trump on Saturday slammed the Clinton campaign for letting Jay-Z rap a profanity-laced song at the Friday night rally.
“He used every word in the book. Can you imagine if I said that?” Trump, whom the Clinton campaign and others have criticized for using racially and otherwise insensitive language, said in Tampa.
“That shows you the phoniness of politicians, the whole system. … In three days, we are going to win Florida. We are going to win the White House.”
Clinton has been the front-runner from the start of the race against first-time candidate Trump.
The race, like others in recent presidential election cycles, will be decided by the handful of so-called battleground states, in which voters could go for the Democratic or Republican nominee, with the remaining 50 or so states solidly Democratic or Republican.
Trump on Saturday was also in battleground North Carolina before heading to Nevada and Colorado. He announced in Tampa that he would visit liberal-leaning Minnesota before the polls close Tuesday.
Vice President Joe Biden held two rallies for Clinton in Pennsylvania on Saturday.

A woman protests against the shooting Ezell Ford in Los Angeles on Aug. 14, 2014. (Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)
On Monday night while, 1,800 miles away, Ferguson was rioting over the shooting of Michael Brown, Ezell Ford was walking down a street in Los Angeles.
It wasn't the nicest street. Florence, where Ford was walking, has one of the highest rates of violence in Los Angeles County.
It's not clear what Ford was doing. Ford had a history of mental illness and had been convicted of marijuana possession and illegal possession of a loaded firearm. In January, he was put on probation for trespassing in Long Beach. But there's not yet information about what he was doing wrong, if anything. And it's not yet clear why he was stopped by police.
What is clear: After he was stopped, Ford was killed, shot by two members of the Los Angeles Police Department.
Even as the LAPD released a detailed account of the incident Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reported that “residents and community activists are demanding answers” about the shooting.
According to the LAPD's news release, two veteran gang officers saw Ford walking on a South Los Angeles sidewalk Monday night and stopped their patrol car and attempted to speak to him. But Ford, the statement said, “continued walking and made suspicious movements, including attempting to conceal his hands.
“When the officers got closer and attempted to stop the individual, the individual turned, grabbed one of the officers, and a struggle ensued. During the struggle, they fell to the ground and the individual attempted to remove the officer's handgun from its holster.” The other officer, police said, “fired his handgun and the officer on the ground fired his backup weapon at the individual.”
Police said Ford was detained, then transported to a hospital where he later died.
Ford's relatives have offered a vastly different account of what transpired Monday.

The Los Angeles Times reported that Dorene Henderson, a family friend, witnessed part of the incident and “saw no struggle between the officers and Ford.” Henderson said that neighbors began yelling at the officers: “He's got mental problems.”
Ford's parents said he was diagnosed with depression and later schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A man who identified himself as Ford's cousin told Los Angeles news station KTLA: “They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications. Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division, knows that — that this child has mental problems,” the man said. In addition: “The excessive force … there was no purpose for it. The multiple shootings in the back while he's laying down? No. Then when the mom comes, they don't try to console her … they pull the billy clubs out.”
KTLA reported that Ford's mother, Tritobia Ford, said her son “was lying on the ground and complying with the officers' commands when he was shot three times.”
“My heart is so heavy,” she told the station. “My son was a good kid. He didn't deserve to die the way he did.”
Police took another view.
“There is a lot of misinformation out there,” LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said, according to the Times.
Ford, Smith said, “didn't comply with any of the officers' instructions. He was grabbing the officer's gun with the officer underneath him.”

The LAPD said it is still investigating the shooting “in coordination with investigators from the Office of the Inspector General and the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office.”
“The LAPD views any loss of human life as a great tragedy,” the news release said.
The Times reported that Ford had prior convictions for marijuana possession and illegal possession of a loaded firearm.
A rally is scheduled to take place Sunday at the LAPD headquarters, The Times reported.
Ford's family has hired the former attorney for Rodney King, according to the Times. LAPD officers accused of beating King in 1991 were acquitted the following year, prompting riots during which 54 people died.

MANHATTAN — Kansas State University's newest residence hall on the Manhattan campus will be named Wefald Hall in honor of Jon Wefald, who served as the university's 12th president from July 1986 to June 2009. It will be the first residence hall built on the university's main campus since Haymaker Hall in 1967 and will be open for the fall semester in August 2016.
"We are pleased to honor one of our key figures in Kansas State University's proud heritage with a residence hall that will be a cornerstone in the student life experience on campus," said Kirk Schulz, university president. "Wefald Hall is an important addition that helps Kansas State University meet its evolving student needs as we move forward to becoming a Top 50 public research university by 2025."
The hall's naming follows approval from the Kansas Board of Regents on June 18.
"There was not one thing that wasn't positively affected by Jon Wefald's vision, passion and leadership during his presidency," said Pat Bosco, vice president for student life and dean of students. "It is incredibly significant that this living-learning environment be dedicated to his legacy."
Wefald Hall is an eight floor, 129,000-square-foot residence hall that will house 540 students with additional apartments for key staff. The hall will be part of the Kramer Complex on Claflin Road and is designed to be a transformational space for student living and integrated learning. It includes academic spaces to create a nontraditional environment that fosters student learning outside the classroom.
In addition to Wefald Hall, the larger $76 million project includes a new dining facility and renovations to Marlatt and Goodnow halls, said Derek Jackson, university director of housing and dining services.
Currently, the Manhattan campus can accommodate 5,469 students in its residence halls and Jardine Apartments. Demand for on-campus housing has remained high for a decade, with roughly 600 students in overflow housing for the past two years and a constant waiting list to live on campus, Jackson said. According to university projections, demand for on-campus housing is expected to grow to more than 6,600 students by 2025.
Site preparation will begin by the end of June, with construction starting in September. Wefald Hall will open for the fall semester in August 2016.
Wefald began his 23 years of service as president of Kansas State University in July 1986.
Under Wefald's presidency, the university added more than 2.2 million square feet of new buildings; philanthropy increased from $6 million a year to nearly $100 million annually; research funding grew from $18 million annually to nearly $134 million; and enrollment increased from around 16,000 students to more than 23,000.
At the same time, Kansas State University produced 125 Rhodes, Truman, Goldwater and Udall scholars — more than any other public university in the nation, said James Coffman, a professor emeritus of clinical sciences and former dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine who served as provost for 17 years under the Wefald presidency.
"It's very fitting that this new residence hall is named after Jon Wefald because student success was one of the main elements of his legacy at Kansas State University," Coffman said. "Not only did he work to make sure that more students were recruited, but he made sure that they received a first-rate education when they enrolled and that there was a system to help those top academic students win major scholarships."
In addition to his contributions to academics, research and infrastructure, Wefald helped revitalize the university's football program.
"I appreciate the regents and our administration led by Dr. Schulz for recognizing Dr. Wefald with this honor," said Bill Snyder, K-State head football coach. "It is appropriate in that Jon and Ruth Ann truly cared about the students on our campus and their well-being. Such a well-deserved recognition for their long-standing service to our university, our community and our state."

NBA star Dirk Nowitzki Cristal Taylor wrote judge a leniency letter NBA star Dirk Nowitzki's ex Cristal Taylor was sentenced to five years in jail on Monday, despite writing a letter to the judge asking for leniency.
The sprightly 100-year-old athlete, who trains five days a week and bench presses 35kg weights, set the record in her age class of 100 to 104-year-olds at the World Masters Games in Sydney Australia.
Ruth, a great-grandmother of 11, won a gold medal at the world sporting event for seniors for her shot put throw of 4.07 metres.
Her fitness secret is simple: "Don't eat vegetables, because I never eat vegetables. I know people that like diets that will scream at me, (but) don't eat vegetables. I never have" she said.
Of the 28,000 athletes taking part in the World Masters Games, the oldest participant was Reginald Trewin (101, Australia), who competed in the lawn bowling event.

A state audit of the Howard County Public School System found limited financial controls led to the approval of millions of dollars in salaries, mileage expenses and construction projects without proper approval or procurement.
The findings, were released by the Maryland Office of Legislative Audits on Friday as part of a state-mandated audit conducted at least once every six years.
They come amid mounting concerns from the community and local elected officials about the school system's commitment to financial transparency and accountability.
State auditors were especially concerned about the school system's reliance on no-bid contracts, said Thomas Barnickel III, the office's legislative auditor.
"If you're a steward of public funds, you want to make sure the procurement process allows all vendors to openly participate so you can get the best price possible," he said.
The school system disputed the findings, which its internal auditor, David Clark, said were "unbalanced" conclusions by "inexperienced" auditors.
"We want the [state's] audit; it can provide a value, but we want it to be done well," Clark said, adding the audit was the "most difficult" experience for him in nearly four decades of work in the field.
State auditors defended their work, citing that staff members are led by experienced and objective auditors. At times, the school system resisted requests for timely information, access to documents and access for interviews, Barnickel III said.
The school system, which has an $808 million operating budget, came under fire this year when the Howard County Council and Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman refused to fully fund its record-high request of $856 million.
The contentious budget season spurred the council to call for an independent financial audit of the school system. That audit, which is not routine like the state's, is ongoing as a council-created committee reviews the school system's budget.
The state's ombudsman is also expected to release by January an investigation of the school system's handling of public information requests. The state Senate unanimously passed a bill in April that requested the investigation.
Despite increasing public pressure, schools spokesman John White said Thursday that he saw no reason for public concern.
"We are one of the most scrutinized systems in the state right now and probably the most transparent," White said, adding the school system is responding to all public requests for information.
In its report, state auditors found the school system awarded $15.3 million in total salaries for administrative staff in 2014, without the school board's approval as required by state law. The audit report addressed no other issues related to salaries.
For their report, state auditors for the Office of Legislative Audits reviewed the school system's financial records, particularly from mid-2013 through 2014.
Clark said the school board approved the administrative raises based on a salary scale set up years ago. He said state law does not require the board to re-approve that scale every year. He said state auditors raised concerns based on their "philosophy" and not issues "grounded in any law or state regulation."
In a critical response, the school board's chairwoman, Christine O'Connor, called the audit a "disservice" to the state and school system and questioned the state auditor's experience and understanding of financial audits.
"On the whole, we believe the audit delivered limited value at best; diverted attention away from meaningful and important school system initiatives and operations; and overall was a disservice to the state and HCPSS in our joint efforts to ensure accountability and improve performance," O'Connor said in a written statement. She also wrote that the audit "stubbornly resisted acknowledging the sound business practices we use."
State Del. Warren Miller, a District 9 Republican, said the "abrasiveness" of the school system's response was astounding.
"It just seems like [the school system] has been caught doing something they shouldn't have been doing and we have to be the adults and step in and fix this problem," Miller said.
Responding to the state report, State Del. Frank Turner said the school system should work to eliminate sole-source contracting – a long standing concern for state legislators.
"Senior management has little business making these decisions," Turner said. "The school system should openly listen to these recommendations and take the steps necessary to improve."
State Del. Vanessa Atterbeary, a District 13 Democrat, said the audit was shocking and validated concerns related to transparency.
"It all goes back to whether the people we have entrusted our children with are doing the best job that they can. Are they being transparent? Are they being truthful? This audit calls all of that into question," Atterbeary said.
With better cooperation from the school system, the cost of the audit could have been reduced, the report said.
Competitive bidding
The audit found senior management awarded $12.6 million in no-bid contracts without sufficient justification, suggesting the school system did not award contracts to the most qualified vendors at the best value, according to the audit.
School policy allows management to seek single-source contracts if it is impractical to seek competitive bids. The school board management failed to support why it did not seek competitive bids, according to the audit.
Clark said it was "unbalanced" for state auditors to fail to mention that 97 percent of its contracts are competitively bid.
Barnickel III, however, said that assertion was ungrounded because the audit mentions that the school's methods for handling the selection of goods and services were appropriate overall.
The audit also found that the school system did not select construction management firms by competitive bids as required by state law. The audit shows that in fiscal 2013 and 2014, the system entered into a dozen contracts worth $9.3 million with five construction management firms.
Competitive bidding helps ensure qualified firms participate in a fair environment that provides the best value for the school system, according to the audit.
So I received an email/comment this morning about a craigslist ad soliciting health care activism for money. “Activism for money,” I thought!! Was this it at last? The missing link Democrats have been searching for? Obamacare opponents turning up at town halls really are a mob?
We really are nothing but a slew of paid hacks drummed up by the promise of easy cash by cynical Obamacare opponents to create an artificial appearance of opposition?!?
Ummmm, no. (click for full size)
But wait, there's more!
So I started searching around, and posting links on Twitter, and reading links I received by reply. Turns out there are hundreds, if not thousands, of advertisements seeking “activists” who will be paid to support Obamacare. That's right CNN. That's right Olbermann. You want astroturf? It's out there by the dozens. In support of, not in opposition to.

Super Smash Bros., Nintendo's latest entry in the fighting franchise, will include two multiplayer modes — For Fun and For Glory — for players to choose from, director Masahiro Sakurai announced during a Nintendo Direct presentation today.
Both the Wii U and 3DS versions of the game will include online multiplayer to allow players to try "whatever style" they want to play. The Wii U's online multiplayer will function like Super Smash Bros. Brawl's. However, the 3DS version "isn't going to be overshadowed," Sakurai said, and will offer online options as well for players with a stable connection.
When people are playing online with random players, they can choose from two different modes. In the For Fun mode, the stage will be randomly selected from the game's available options; the Final Destination stage is not included. In this mode, only wins will be recorded and all items have a chance of appearing. In the For Glory mode, players can only engage in one-on-on battles in Final Destination. There will be no items, and both wins and losses are recorded. According to Sakurai, players of this mode "probably spent a lot of time on Final Destination in previous titles."
"Almost all" stages now have Final Destination form, Sakurai added.
Nintendo is also attempting to cut down on players that cheat, drop out of matches too much or target an individual player. This means bans, Sakurai said. The more people abuse other players, the longer the ban. "I hope we can create an online environment where everyone can enjoy themselves," he said.
Online matches will no longer be anonymous, Sakurai explained. Online names will be linked to Nintendo Network IDs, enabling players to report cheaters and unsportsmanlike conduct. Baseless reporting of other players, however, can also warrant ban penalties.
Super Smash Bros., revealed at E3 2013, is expected to launch this year for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS and will feature cross-platform play. The game's roster features popular characters such as Mario, Luigi, Link, Princess Zelda, Mega Man, Sonic and many more.
A man who couldn't find a black doll in the shops as a gift for his niece decided to take matters into his own hands.
In 2007, Taofick Okoya, 43, created his own doll that Nigerian girls could identify with by recreating their skin colour and style - and it is now so successful that it is outselling Barbie.
The doll, which is called Queens of Africa, comes with traditional outfits and accessories and costs around £4.50.

A Nigerian businessman decided to create own doll that Nigerian girls could identify with called Queens of Africa, by recreating their skin colour and style - and now it's outselling Barbie in his native country
The dolls' look is modelled on three of the country's biggest tribes and aims to promote strong feminine ideals, like love, peace and endurance.
The doll is now so popular that, according to Reuters, it is selling up to 9,000 units a month - a staggering 15 per cent of the country's toy market.
But the Queens of Africa aren't just selling in their home country.
Thanks to the doll's online presence, customers are coming from as far as America, Brazil and Europe.

Speaking to ELLE about his dolls out-selling Barbie in his native Nigeria, Okoya said: 'My mission is to make the Queens of Africa a symbol of hope, trust, and confidence by promoting African history, culture, and fashion.'
One person that Okoya really hopes the dolls will have a positive impact on is his daughter, who, he explains, once wished she was white.
Okoya said: 'I don't believe Mattel sees the Nigerian market as a priority, yet their product has great influence on the psyche of the children here and affirms certain values contrary to our society'
He explained that even though they live in Nigeria, there was a lot of Western influence. He said: '[This] might have been responsible for her wishing she was white. It made me aware that I needed to make her proud and happy being a black African girl, and not limit it to her alone as this was a common trend among the younger generation. The Queens of Africa became a platform to achieve this.'
Unfortunately, Okoya has been told that he won't be able to sell the dolls on the shelves of mainline stories in America and will have to limit his business to specialist stores.

From poverty to drug abuse to unemployment and other challenges, social problems include a variety of ills that damage society from the inside out. Our communities and churches cannot thrive if such problems are unknown or ignored. Of all groups, it is the religious — those motivated not just by a social conscience but also by a belief in the divinity of each person — who should be in the vanguard of lifting our neighbors' burdens.
Interestingly, new Pew Research Center findings say the share of U.S. adults who think houses of worship contribute "not much" or "nothing" to solving important social problems has nearly doubled since 2001 (from 21 percent then to 39 percent today). Of those within the religious fold, 74 percent of weekly churchgoers say churches contribute "a great deal" or "some" to solving social problems, while 49 percent of those who attend less often agree.
While Pew's report focused on what some think churches do, studies of what believers say they do (such as this one) indicate faith is the strongest predictor of generosity, altruism, trust and civic involvement among Americans. So why this gap between the perception of some and the experience of others? How can this gap be bridged, and whose responsibility is it to do that?
In part, this Pew report could simply be a reflection of a growing unawareness of religion. After all, the ranks of the religiously unaffiliated continue to rise, creating a sizeable chunk of U.S. adults (nearly 25 percent) who are likely unaware of the day-to-day happenings inside churches. But we know this isn't the only possible cause because Pew's finding also show that not even all regular churchgoers think their houses of worship are solving social problems.
Another reason for this gap could be rooted in respondents' understanding of survey terminology. In the words of Martin E. Marty of the University of Chicago Divinity School:
What does “solving social problems” mean? Are the big ones “solvable,” or are they only “addressable”? Who really pictures the epochal refugee crises of our day as being “solvable”? Or the destructive human issues in “climate change”? And are any religious institutions capable of addressing the issues on such a vast scene that it is fair to ask thus about them?
These are important questions that don't have clear answers. But they are valuable because they temper the kneejerk lamentations of those worried that so many are unaware of the good churches do in society. It's one thing for people to perceive houses of worship as nothing more than places of preaching, where the power of the word doesn't motivate the heart to other-oriented action. It would be quite another thing if that perception reflected reality.
Sharing Stories of Service
Churches can certainly help decrease the knowledge gap by publicizing their efforts to address social problems. Though such efforts risk appearing self-promotional, they also help foster a culture that values Christian service. What's more, these efforts can forge invaluable partnerships between churches and humanitarian organizations that have a mutual interest in joining together to alleviate pain and suffering through serving others.
Journalists play a role as well because their reports can inform the unaware of the good churches are doing. Take, for example, a June story from North Carolina where several Christian congregations held a community-organizing camp for kids, teaching them "we're all God's children, and we all should look out for one another." Or a July report out of Georgia that tells how a Southern Baptist congregation rallied to help a Muslim neighbor whose business was robbed and damaged. “They stood by me in my difficult time, and it gives me hope to rise again,” the grateful business owner says.
Careful reporting also shows how the ripples of religious community extend beyond group service projects to the voluntary one-on-one interactions of the faithful. One example can be seen in a July in-depth profile in the New Yorker about one Christian woman's quest to answer God's call to be a hospice nurse. She chose this vocation because she wanted to "care for the whole person" — a desire rooted in her belief that "God had created bodies for a reason and that they mattered a lot." This kind of quiet one-on-one ministry happens every day by unseen multitudes who quietly live for God without need of recognition.
Practicing What We Preach
Of course, even the best reporting can't completely fill the knowledge gap. And the most diligent efforts of churches to tell the world their service stories will not reach or convince everyone. So perhaps the most important thing people of faith can do, regardless of others' false perceptions, is to live their religion, ever seeking to relieve their neighbors' burdens, motivated by a commitment to a God who “calls for sacrificial love, not benign whatever-ism.”[1]
This matters because, as Marty writes, “when churches and synagogues are not only observed and reported on as losing heart or finding other priorities than the ‘social' ones, but actually failing and falling, millions get hurt” (emphasis added). Thus, he says, “attending to these local and voluntary fronts is, in dated language, ‘where the action is.' On some scales, some problems, if not solved, are there addressed, and the ‘social' scene and the people who make it up experience life enhanced.”
Nearly 200,000 people who were ordered to leave their homes after a damaged California spillway threatened to unleash a nine-metre wall of water may not be able to return until significant erosion is repaired, authorities said Monday.
The officials who issued the hasty evacuation order defended their decision, saying it was necessary to ensure public safety in the region downstream from the nation's tallest dam, about 240 kilometres northeast of San Francisco.
Engineers spotted a hole in the spillway, which they feared could have failed within an hour.
The water level of the massive reservoir known as Lake Oroville dropped Monday, slightly easing fears of a catastrophic collapse. But with more storms on the horizon, crews raced to assess what happened and began dumping large boulders and sandbags into the spillway to prevent any more erosion.
The acting head of the state's Department of Water Resources said he did not know if anything had gone wrong and was unaware of a 2005 report that recommended fortifying the earthen emergency spillway with concrete for just such an event. The spillway had never been used in the dam's nearly 50 years of operation, and it was not near capacity when it began to fail.
"I'm not sure anything went wrong," Bill Croyle said. "This was a new, never-having-happened-before event."
Croyle and the local sheriff sought to reassure the public that downstream communities were safe until water began spilling over the lake's edge Sunday and a chocolate-colored torrent of water began chewing through the slope below it.

The Department of Water Resources said conditions were stable at noon Sunday and then tweeted an evacuation order at 4:45 p.m., warning of a possible failure within the hour, saying "this is not a drill."
Chaos ensued as anxious residents rushed to pack up their families and abandon several communities in Butte, Yuba and Sutter counties. The mostly flat northern Central Valley is known mainly for its sprawling agriculture industry, which is fed by dammed-up rivers that spill down from the Sierra Nevada foothills nearby.
'People were just panicking'
It took some people seven hours to travel to evacuation centres that should have been an hour away, said Chico Councilman Andrew Coolidge, who visited with evacuees in packed shelters in his city.
Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea insisted the evacuation had been accomplished in a "fairly timely fashion" and a "fairly orderly manner."
Patrick Miner, of Live Oak, Calif., said he and his family in a caravan of four cars returned home after driving back roads for two hours and feared they would run out of gas. They didn't bother trying to fuel up because lines were hours long at gas pumps.
"People were just panicking, honking and yelling at each other," he said. "I just got nervous and decided to hunker down. It was pretty scary."
Tens of thousands told to evacuate due to flood danger 0:43
Honea could not estimate when people will be able to return home, but said he's working on a "repopulation plan" that would let residents return to areas least at risk of flooding.
The threat emerged after weeks of storms dumped rain and snow across California, particularly in northern parts of the state.
While the wet winter has been a boon for water supplies, it has created a challenge for water managers who must balance the need for water and hydroelectric power with protecting flatland communities from floods during times of excessive rain or rapidly melting snow.

After a chunk of concrete tore out of the spillway — creating a hole that is 60 metres long and nine metres deep, and continues to grow — water managers began using the emergency spillway for the first time in its 48-year history. Eventually, the flow of water ripped through a road below and carved out deep chasms in the ground.
Workers used helicopters and backhoes to dump large boulders and sandbags in place on Monday as the main concrete spillway was used to drain water from the lake at about three times the rate it was filling up. Officials want the level to drop 15 metres to make room for storms expected later this week.
Stability concerns previously raised
Environmental groups raised concerns years ago about the stability of the emergency spillway, but state and federal officials dismissed them and insisted the structure was safe, according to records.
In 2005, three advocacy groups complained to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that using Lake Oroville's earthen spillway would cause significant erosion because it was not armoured with concrete.
They said soil, rocks and debris could be swept into the Feather River, potentially damaging highway bridges and power plants. The groups warned of a complete failure of the dam itself, threatening lives and property.

Nearly three years later, state officials said no "significant concerns" about the emergency spillway's integrity had been raised in any government or independent review.
The Department of Water Resources estimated repair costs last week at $100 million US. Officials refused to update that figure Monday.
Gov. Jerry Brown issued an emergency order Sunday directing all necessary resources to deal with the problem, but he remained out of the spotlight Monday.
U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, both Democrats, called on President Donald Trump to provide $162.3 million US in disaster assistance requested by California.

In case you hadn't heard, the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a really big deal — unless you're China.
The largest regional trade agreement in history involves the United States and 11 countries in the Asia Pacific and the Americas, which collectively represent about 40% of world GDP and around a quarter of global exports.
More than five years in the making, the TPP, as it is commonly referred to, was finalized on Monday, but it still needs the approval of lawmakers in member countries, including the U.S. Congress.
Given the importance of the accord, which is designed to boost cross-border trade and investment among member countries and, ultimately, economic growth, it might seem strange that China, the world's second largest economy and biggest trading nation on the planet, has been left out.
While a lot of the details of the deal are still secret, the TPP is clearly more than just a free trade agreement. In addition to slashing or eliminating 98% of tariffs on thousands of goods including dairy, beef, sugar, cars, tractors and chemicals, it also establishes common rules and regulations for trade and investment across member countries as well as external tribunals to sort out disputes.
TPP member states will include the United States, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Peru. More countries are expected to join the exclusive trading club, but given the tough membership rules, China is not expected to sign up any time soon.
Perhaps never.
Excluding China has been widely interpreted as an attempt by the United States to curtail Beijing's growing political and economic might in the Asia Pacific region, and some experts have described it as a “terrible mistake.”
But does Beijing really care? Possibly not as much as you might think.
For starters, China doesn't need to belong to the TPP to enjoy some of the perks that come with being a member.
Beijing already has free trade agreements with more than half of the TPP countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Peru, Singapore, Brunei and Vietnam, and it can exploit those arrangements to minimize or avoid import duties that would normally apply to made-in-China products.
Felipe Caro and Christopher Tang of UCLA's Anderson School of Management explained in Fortune magazine this week how that could work.
“To satisfy certain country­-of-­origin conditions stipulated in TPP, China can manage the supply chain operations of cotton shirts by importing cotton from Pakistan (via its existing free trade agreement with China) and conduct 'upstream' operations, such as fabric design, knitting and dyeing at home.
"Then China can ship the fabric to Vietnam (via an existing free trade agreement with China). At the same time, Japan can ship the buttons to Vietnam (via the TPP). Vietnam can perform 'downstream' operations (sewing) and then ship the finished shirts via TPP agreement to Australia, Japan and the United States, cutting off the 5%, 10.9% and 16.5% import duties that would have applied if China had dealt directly with these countries.”
And China clearly doesn't require the TPP to enhance its already sizeable influence in the world.
Beijing is a card-carrying member of the World Trade Organization, has a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and is the driving force behind the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which could potentially become a rival to the World Bank and Asia Development Bank once it gets going.
The China-led AIIB, which has the support of dozens of countries, aims to fund infrastructure projects in the region and could help Beijing buy the support of its neighbors.
China is also on track to become one of the world's biggest overseas investors by 2020, with outbound foreign direct investment already topping $100 billion a year. In some countries, China's investment is actually bigger than the loans they get from the International Monetary Fund, and that gives Beijing a lot of economic and political clout.
On top of that China is busy negotiating its own free-trade pact with 15 countries in the Asia Pacific region and is expected to become the world's largest economy in the next decade.
“That preponderance is driven by China's sheer size, its continued growth — which though slower than in the past is still faster than that of most other Asian economies — and its increasing centrality in global supply chains,” Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics and editor of China Economic Quarterly, told Foreign Policy.
Missing out on a TPP membership card won't change that.

According to reports in The Wall Street Journal and Japan's Chunichi Shimbun, Toyota is in the “production engineering” stage of building an electric vehicle (EV) battery with a solid electrolyte. Reports suggest the new battery will debut in Japan in a model 2022 car with an all-new platform.
So-called “solid state” batteries have both solid electrodes and solid electrolytes. Solid-state batteries can be made smaller and lighter than the lithium-ion batteries that currently power electric vehicles, but engineering such a battery at an attractive price point for mass production has been a challenge. The Chunichi Shimbun reported that Toyota's battery will be able to charge in a few minutes and have a long range, but the article did not list specifics.
A solid-state battery would also reduce the fire risk that comes with lithium-ion batteries that use a liquid electrolyte. And, because the electrolyte wouldn't be in danger of freezing, it could withstand a wider range of temperatures.
Being able to consistently manufacture a solid-state battery for use in electric vehicles would give Toyota an edge over rivals like Nissan, Tesla, and Daimler, assuming those companies aren't also able to bring battery advances to their cars in the next five years. (Reuters reports that BMW is also working on solid-state batteries.)
For years, Toyota has pushed hydrogen fuel cell vehicles like the Mirai as the advanced automotive technology to look out for. The automaker even broke a partnership with Tesla to develop an all-electric RAV4 in 2014 and declared the fuel cell vehicle the way of the future. But Toyota has also been working on advanced batteries for years as well. As early as 2011, it has been working with academic researchers to perfect crystalline structures that will move lithium ions through a solid electrolyte, and early last year the company presented a paper showing a battery that could withstand temperatures from -30 degrees Celsius up to 100 degrees Celsius.
I was recently lucky enough to participate in a cooking class held by the MCIA (Miyazaki Center for International....something that starts with an A). We learned how to make Chicken Nanban (southern barbarian chicken), Miyazaki's speciality dish. I have had many different variations of Chicken Nanban in my years living here (all from different places that all claim to have invented it), but the dish seemed too daunting to make on my own. When I saw the chance to participate in the cooking class, I jumped on it. The following recipe is courtesy of the MCIA staff and the class's teacher.
What you'll need (Makes five giant servings, or 6 normal sized ones)
For the chicken:
1. 750g chicken meat
2. 4 eggs
3. Salt as appropriate
4. White pepper as appropriate
5. Vegetable oil for deep frying
6. Wheat flour
For the Nanban Sweet/Sour Sauce:
1. 60 ml regular soy sauce
2. 60 ml light soy sauce
3. 120 ml vinegar
4. 60g sugar
5. Pinch of salt
6. Red chili as desired
For the Tartar Sauce:
1. 300g mayo
2. 25g sugar
3. 20g ketchup
4. 1 hardboiled egg
5. 1 cucumber
6. 1 small onion
7. 1g parsley
Garnish:
1. 75g cabbage
2. 10 mini tomatoes
3. 100g lettuce
Directions:
1. First, prepare the sweet and sour sauce. Put all the sweet and sour sauce ingredients in a pot and stir well. Bring to a boil then turn off heat.
Tartar Sauce
1. Prepare the tartar sauce. Finely chop the hardboiled egg, cucumber, onion, and parsley.
2. Season the cucumber and onion by rubbing with salt (about 5g, not included in the list of ingredients). Rinse with water and squeeze well in a paper towel to dry.
3. In a bowl, add the mayo, sugar, ketchup, and mix well. Add the chopped egg, cucumber, onion, and parsley. Blend well and set aside.
Chicken
4. Now, prepare the chicken. Cut the chicken into pieces (about 40g per piece), season with salt and pepper. Coat the pieces with flour.
5. Crack one egg in a bowl and beat well.
6. Dip the flour-coated chicken pieces in the beaten egg. This works best if you don't dip the chicken into the egg until right before you put it into the oil. Don't set it back down in between.
7. Heat vegetable oil on the stove and fry the chicken until golden.
8. Immediately after frying, dip the chicken in the sweet and sour sauce. Keep in the sauce for 30 seconds.
9. Drain the excess sauce and place the chicken on a plate. Serve with the garnish and tartar sauce.
And that is how to prepare Chicken Nanban.

THE Irish government will finally be able to collect the €13bn in taxes owed by the Apple corporation, after having the entire country unlocked by a Chinese guy working out of a shop in Moore Street called Extra Good Phone Unlock & Afro Caribbean Hair Product Store.
Confronted with the entire Irish revenue system, a young Chinese man called Aidan working on a stool behind a massive bank of Minions phones covers and bluetooth speakers told the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe that the unlocking would take ‘about 20 minutes', and came at a cost of 50 euro.
Donohoe proudly announced that the newly unlocked Ireland was now free of the tax loopholes that allowed the massive multinational corporation to pay next to no tax for a number of years, and that the 50 euro bill for the unlocking would be subtracted from the Department of Social Protection's budget next year.
“We've now got a country that is not stuck in contract, so we can do whatever we want,” beamed Donohoe, picking up a few punnets of cherries while waiting on Moore Street for the country.
“The old plan we were on just let Apple away with murder, so that we were totally unable to collect any revenue from them at all. It was too much hassle to try and fight the terms of the contract, so we let it lapse and then just got the Chinese lad in the shop to work his magic. All it'll take now is another few years stuck in a legal quagmire, and we're in the money lads!”
Flush with extra cash, Donohoe has decided that maybe it's time to strike up a new deal with Apple instead of walking away, and will enter into a new tax-free scheme with the iPhone giants as soon as possible.
China says India has been building up troops along its side of the border and demands an "immediate withdrawal" amid an increasingly tense standoff in a remote frontier region high in the Himalayas.
The standoff, on a plateau that lies at the junction between China, India, and Bhutan, is one of the worst border disputes between the nuclear-armed rivals in more than 30 years.
On Thursday, China's foreign ministry demanded India must "immediately withdraw troops" from the region, known as Doklam in Bhutan and India, and Donglang in Beijing, if it cherishes peace.
The plateau is currently disputed between China and Bhutan with India supporting Bhutan's claim over it.
"It has already been more than a month since the incident, and India is still not only illegally remaining on Chinese territory, it is also repairing roads in the rear, stocking up supplies, massing a large number of armed personnel," China's foreign ministry said in a statement.
"This is certainly not for peace."
READ MORE: China demands India pulls back troops in border dispute
India, meanwhile, denied any such military buildup.
In a statement to parliament on Thursday, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj urged dialogue based on a written common understanding regarding the border intersection reached in 2012.
"India always believes that peace and tranquility in the India-China border is an important pre-requisite for smooth development of our bilateral relations," Swaraj said, according to a transcript of her remarks released by her office.
"We will continue to engage with the Chinese side through diplomatic channels to find a mutually acceptable solution."
'Bottom line'
The standoff began in June when Chinese troops began building a road through the plateau.
India sent troops at Thimpu's request and warned China that construction of a road near their common border would have serious security implications.
The road gives China access to the so-called Chicken's Neck, a thin strip of land connecting India's central mass to its remote northeastern regions.
Indian officials say about 300 soldiers from either side are now facing each other about 150 metres apart.
In a separate statement, China's defence ministry said the country had shown goodwill and that its forces had exercised utmost restraint, but warned, "restraint has a bottom line".
"No country should underestimate the Chinese military's confidence in and ability to fulfil its mission of safeguarding peace, and should not underestimate the Chinese military's determination and will to defend the country's sovereignty, security and development interests," it said.
China's military has held live fire drills close to the disputed area, and state television on Friday said more exercises had been conducted recently, though did not give an exact location.
In an editorial, the official China Daily said China was not in the mood for a fight, noting how the standoff has been "unusually restrained".
"However, if good manners do not work, in the end, it may be necessary to rethink our approach. Sometimes a head-on blow may work better than a thousand pleas in waking up a dreamer," the English-language paper said.
Narendra Modi, Indian prime minister, is to visit China early in September for a summit of BRICS leaders.
HootSuite, the Vancouver social media management company that came under fire recently over its practice of unpaid internships, has paid up all the interns who have worked there in the past six months.
“It was brought to my attention on Friday, April 5th that HootSuite had unpaid internship postings on its website that may have been in contravention of the Employment Standards Act of BC,” HootSuite CEO Ryan Holmes said in an emailed statement.
“HootSuite conducted an immediate review with our Talent and Legal team and we have determined that some intern roles may not have been in compliance with Employment Standards Act of BC.
“To completely remove outstanding doubt around this matter, we will immediately rectify the issue by offering full payment, including interest incurred, to unpaid interns who had roles within our company within the last six months that were not in accordance with the ESA BC.”
HootSuite, which has grown from a Vancouver startup to take a leading role in social media management, faced its own social media storm after a post on the popular news and entertainment site Reddit drew attention to the unpaid internships.
The practice of having interns work for free, although widely touted as way to gain experience and help build a resume, actually amounts to unpaid labour under BC's Employment Standards Act and regulations.
Under the act, a “practicum,” which is part of a formal education process and not considered to be work is different from an “internship.”
Here are the definitions of the two according to the Interpretation Guidelines Manual for the Act and its regulations:
A “practicum” is part of a formal education process for students enrolled in a public or private post-secondary institution that involves the supervised practical application of previously classroom taught theory related to course study. The students are usually engaged in studies to obtain a degree so as to pursue a career in education, medicine, or engineering. A practicum is “hands-on” training that is required by the curriculum, and will result in a certificate or diploma. It is not considered to be “work” for the purposes of the Act.
An “internship” is on-the-job training offered by an employer to provide a person with practical experience. Often internships are offered to persons who have completed a diploma or degree program and are seeking employment. Completing an internship does not itself result in an academic certificate or diploma. If the duties performed by interns fall within the definition of “work” contained in the Act, the intern falls within the definition of “employee”, and the agency using the services of an intern falls within the definition of “employer”, internships will be considered “work” for the purposes of the Act.
And the act is unequivocal on the issue of paying for work.
Time spent by an employee performing labour or service for an employer is time worked and time for which wages are payable.
At a time when many people have come to expect content and services online to be free, it should probably come as no surprise that some employers have people working for them with no compensation.
That may work for practicums, as BC's Employment Act stipulates, but at least in that case the workers are getting something – presumably credit towards a diploma, degree or some other professional recognition.
What about people who aren't students and can't count their unpaid labour as part of their costs of getting an education? How are unpaid interns supposed to pay the rent? Buy groceries?
I'm glad to see HootSuite has ended its practice of unpaid internships and hopefully its public acknowledgement of the mistake will prompt others to follow suit.
“I appreciate those who have taken the time to bring this to our attention,” Holmes said. “ I too am passionate about the Vancouver tech industry and committed to making it stronger.
“HootSuite will continue to offer its internship program, ensuring that future internship positions are compliant with the Employment Standards Act of BC. I remain confident that our program offers young professionals unique opportunities to build their careers and I will proudly continue to provide this option for those interested.”
I realize it can be difficult for people to speak out or complain about not getting paid for their work, particularly if they are hoping to eventually get paid work with a company or get a recommendation they can parlay into other paying employment.
I hope HootSuite's leadership here will encourage young people starting out in the digital sector to speak out and stand up for their right to be paid for their work.
It appears as though the end is near for long-time Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard.
We've seen this coming for a while now. As Howard continued to struggle (his .154 batting average and .219 on-base percentage rank 188th out of 188 MLB players with at least 150 plate appearances) it's become more obvious that his playing time should decrease.
And now, with the presence of the intriguing Tommy Joseph now jumping to the forefront, it seems clear manager Pete Mackanin is ready to award Joseph with much more playing time.
"We brought Joseph up here for a reason, to get a look at him," Mackanin said. "I can't let him stagnate on the bench like (Darin) Ruf ended up doing, so he's going to face some right-handed pitchers to keep his timing. I don't know when the next time we're going to face a left-handed pitcher is, but I'm going to use (Joseph) a little bit more often than I did Ruf."
Interestingly, Mackanin referenced Ruf and how his lack of playing time "stagnated" the veteran first baseman. Ruf never started more than two games in a row during his straight platoon with Howard this season, and some weeks only got one or two starts.
Nevertheless, Ruf is now in Triple-A and Joseph is on the big club. And it appears it's Joseph that's going to get the chance to prove he's more than just a platoon bat.
Howard has struck out in 33% of his plate appearances this season. He is batting .097 in the month of May. Each single seems worthy of celebration. Meanwhile, since being called up, Joseph is batting .286/.286/.571 with three homers and a .286 ISO.
Although it's a small sample size, Joseph has a hard hit rate of 46.2% and is hitting a line drive in 30.8% of his plate appearances. Yes, he's not drawing many walks yet, but he is running deep counts and, outside of Odubel Herrera and Andres Blanco, has been having the most consistent at bats on the team since his call-up.
After Sunday's game in Chicago, wrapping up a disastrous series against the best team in baseball, Howard said he hadn't yet been made aware he would sit more against right-handers.
"I haven't heard anything about sitting more against righties," he said. "I haven't been called into the office and talked to about it, so you guys apparently have breaking news before I do."
The change began on Sunday against the Cubs, as Howard sat against right-hander John Lackey. And while Joseph went 0-for-3 against Lackey, he did add a garbage time home run in the ninth inning, his third of the season.
It remains to be seen exactly how the playing time will be divvied up, but any scenario in which Joseph doesn't play at least five times a week just doesn't make sense.
The whole point of the 2016 season is to see which young players may have a future with the club. And even if the goal was to win as many games as possible this season, benching Howard would be best in that scenario too.
The larger issue remains just how much longer Howard is going to stay on the roster. It's hard to argue that Howard has less value than a player like Emmanuel Burriss, and perhaps not playing every day will help Howard perform better on the days he is in there. If Joseph truly is getting the vast majority of starts, the Phils don't need to release Howard right now.
But as young players like J.P. Crawford, Nick Williams, Zach Eflin, Jake Thompson and others get ready to hit the Majors, the Phillies will have some decisions to make with their roster. And if things keep on like this, it's not unreasonable to think Howard could be the victim of a numbers crunch.
For now, Howard is a bench player. Joseph is the starter.
A move that, frankly, was overdue.

A daily chronicle of creativity in film, TV, music, arts and entertainment produced by Southern California Public Radio. Host John Horn leads the conversation, accompanied by the nation's most plugged-in cultural journalists.
David Javerbaum was a writer and producer on "The Daily Show" for 11 years. Since leaving that show, he's written books, plays and worked on TV series like "The Late Late Show with James Corden."
He's spent a lot of time cultivating the voice of God. He's done that in part through his play, "An Act of God" — which premiered on Broadway with Jim Parsons in the lead role and is now at the Ahmanson Theatre, starring Sean Hayes ("Will & Grace"). And since 2010, Javerbaum has been the brain behind the popular Twitter feed, "The Tweet Of God," which has over 2 million followers.
The Frame's John Horn asked Javerbaum about speaking for the Almighty. Below is an excerpt from a longer interview which you can hear by pressing the blue play button above.
Interview excerpt
So, God started on Twitter — is that right?
David Javerbaum: Well, actually what started was I had an idea for a book, "Memoirs by God," and it eventually became a book. But while I was working on that book my editor suggested I open a Twitter account — sort of pre-publicize a book — and I did that over the course of a year. And by the time the book came out, the Twitter account had had such success people thought the book was a spin-off of the Twitter account, but in fact it was sort of the other way around.
But God is still busy on Twitter.
God actually — and this is an announcement — God is leaving Twitter. God's done with Twitter.
There was a Scalia post over the weekend. I think the post was one word, "Justice."
Yup.
Tweet Of God's final tweet
That was it?
That's going to be it.
Why?
It's been taking up too much of my time and energy and mental agility. And I have other things that I want to do in my life and I just have to, at a certain point, just cut that cord. And the point was this weekend. The triggering event was I got hacked. The Twitter account got hacked. God got hacked, which wasn't surprising. There were a number of obscene messages put up there briefly and then removed. There was a pornographic picture of Garfield. I just have to move on. And also working on Twitter for a long time, it just miniaturizes the way you think, because that's the medium. You're a miniaturist. And if I'm going to work on other things that require anything longer — i.e. anything else in the world — I need to stop doing that.
You're discontinuing God's Twitter feed. The last joke will be about Scalia — did that just feel right?
I'd been thinking about it for a while and then that hack happened. And then by coincidence that morning [that Scalia died] Stephen Fry said he was leaving Twitter. Now Stephen Fry is one of my huge heroes. And he just had enough of Twitter. He had told a joke — a very harmless joke in his opinion and in my opinion too — and just got a lot of grief and just said, You know what, this is not worth it. I don't like the cesspool Twitter has become.
This is the British actor.
Yeah, the British actor and well-known atheist. The quote he said was, It feels like I just removed a boulder from my chest. And it's great. I wouldn't characterize Twitter as being a cesspool. But I do feel just like for me personally it's time to move on. It was successful. It did very well. I somehow monetized it into a play which is really ridiculously miraculous. And I would like to think it was intentional, but it was not. It was purely happenstance.
What will you miss most about not being God anymore?
Well, I never claimed to be God... That's not true — in interviews I don't claim to be God. I think the thing I'll miss most is the thing I'm leaving deliberately. You tweet something and immediately you see people retweeting it and it feels like, Oh, you have made people laugh. You have caused people to react. And it's a rush. It's a limbic brain rush to do that. But heroin is also a limbic brain rush, and that is problematic. And after a while — it's been five-and-a-half years — and, again it was prompted by the hack. But I want to think about other things. I want to do other things. I'm done. If I have more jokes to offer or anything else to offer the world, I would like it to be in a different medium.
MySpace?
Yes, MySpace. Or CompuServe.
It turns out that God did reveal his plans to quit Twitter via his wife's account, @TweetOfMrsGod:
My husband @TheTweetOfGod and I are leaving the Twitterverse for a new cosmos. There's milk in the fridge. Good luck and godbye. — Mrs. God (@TweetOfMrsGod) February 15, 2016
You can still hear the voice of David Javerbaum's God in his play "An Act Of God." It stars Sean Hayes and is running at the Ahmanson Theater in downtown Los Angeles until March 13, 2016.
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's exit from the European Union could be delayed until at least late 2019 because the government was too “chaotic” to start the two-year process early next year, the Sunday Times reported, citing sources it said were briefed by ministers.

Britain voted to leave the EU on June 23, but views differ over when it should invoke “Article 50”, which sets the clock ticking on a two-year deadline to leave the bloc, with some senior politicians calling for a quick departure.
Prime Minister Theresa May, who campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU and leads a cabinet of ministers from either side of the debate, has said she will not trigger Brexit talks this year as Britain needs time to prepare.
But British government ministers have warned senior figures in the City of London, London's financial district, that Article 50 was unlikely to be triggered early in 2017 because the situation in government was “chaotic”, the Sunday Times reported on Sunday.
“Ministers are now thinking the [Article 50] trigger could be delayed until autumn 2017,” one source, who had spoken to two senior ministers, told the newspaper.
“They don't have the infrastructure for the people they need to hire. They say they don't even know the right questions to ask when they finally begin bargaining with Europe.”
Asked about the reported delay to triggering Article 50, a Number 10 spokeswoman said: “The Prime Minister has been clear that a top priority for this government is to deliver the decision of the British people to leave the EU and make a success of Brexit.”
“The PM has set out the government's position on Article 50 and has established a new department dedicated to taking forward the negotiations,” she said.
European leaders have taken a firm line on the speed of Britain's exit, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying that while it was understandable that Britain would need a few months to figure out its strategy, “nobody wants a long period of limbo”.
But behind the scenes, there has been a growing realization in Europe's capitals that the two-year window for negotiating Brexit is far too short.
Britain created two new government departments to handle Brexit and international trade, led by David Davis and Liam Fox, two prominent “Leave” campaigners in the referendum.
Davis has recruited less than half of the 250 staff he needs for the Brexit department, the Sunday Times said, while Fox has fewer than 100 of the 1,000 trade negotiators he is seeking.
Elections in France in May, and Germany in September, could also push back the timing of Brexit.
Any delay to the process, however, is likely to draw criticism from the pro-leave side of May's Conservative party, with senior members such as John Redwood calling for a quick departure from the bloc.
There was an early sign of tension between the pro-Brexit members of May's cabinet in a report that Fox had clashed with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson over the remit of his new department.
Fox said economic diplomacy — policies concerning trade and Britain's economic ties — should be transferred to his department, according to a letter quoted in the Sunday Telegraph. Johnson had firmly rejected the Fox's demands, the newspaper said.
The spokeswoman said the government did not comment on leaked documents.
Police in Louisville, Kentucky are responding to a call of an “active shooter” at Western High School.
Western, and the nearby Waller-Williams Environmental School, have both been placed on lockdown.

Officials are saying the lockdown was a precaution, as they are trying to confirm the presence of a shooter. There have been no reported injuries yet.
There is a heavy police and firefighter presence at both schools, blocking the nearby roads. The authorities are saying they received a “phoned in threat” at Western High School. No shooter has been found so far.

A giant metallic head splits into segments and rotates in a ‘metamorphosis' worthy of its subject, author Franz Kafka. All 42 of its layers spin independently, catching the sunlight on their reflective stainless steel edges, magnifying the strange transformation as the head briefly blurs into something more abstract and then comes together again. The 45-ton sculpture was installed in a Prague plaza in 2014, visualizing the inner workings of a psyche the sculptor may identify with, himself. It's perhaps the tamest and least controversial piece Czech artist David Cerný has ever put out for public consumption.
Entitled ‘K', the sculpture has a nearly-identical twin called METALMORPHOSIS in Technology Plaza in Charlotte, North Carolina, which even had its own live webcam feed for a while so anyone in the world could watch passersby interact with it at any given moment. The Charlotte version is not based on Kafka, and sits in the center of a fountain, occasionally spitting water. Its mirrored exterior almost makes it seem like an optical illusion in certain lights, like some kind of apparition made of the sky itself.
Born in Prague, David ?erný first gained notoriety in 1991 when he took it upon himself to paint a Soviet tank serving as a war memorial in his home city bright pink. A number of his statues feature grown men peeing, and the literally masturbatory ‘Nation for Itself Forever' had to be perched on the roof of the National Theater to keep it from being defaced.
Crawling babies with bizarrely punched-in faces scale the Czech Republic's highest tower and wander blindly around parks, while the nation's most revered saint, St. Wenceslas, is depicted riding a dead horse. A permanent exhibition at FUTURA gallery Prague features ladders leading up to two white posteriors; climb up and stick your head inside to view a video of two Czech politicians spoon-feeding each other to ‘We Are the Champions.” Czech out a tour of the irreverent sculptor's works in Prague if you're ever in the city to see them all.
Last Saturday (the 15th), Michael Retter and Matt Hale drove up from West Lafayette to stay at my house for the weekend (specifically for the Gull Frolic, more on that coming soon). They had to head out on Sunday, but before they left, we birded a bit looking for Scoters on the lakefront.
This winter has been quite unlike others due to the massive freeze occurring in northern clines. Lake Superior is over 90% frozen, and Lake Michigan is covered in ice as well. This has forced lots of usually deep water ducks inland in search of open areas of water, or at least that is one take on the situation. Lake Michigan has a few patches of open water right offshore at many of the harbor mouths, and almost all of them contain at least one White-winged Scoter. We are in the middle of an insane winter for White-winged Scoters, and they have been seen in at least 15 counties in Illinois alone between December 2013 and February 2014. Here is a link to a thread on the Illinois Birders' Forum about the invasion.
I read on IBET that my friend Steve Huggins had loads of Scoters on the Lakefront on Saturday. Michael and Matt wanted a Black Scoter, so we headed out Sunday morning for Belmont Harbor to look for the two Steve had. Arriving, we could see a fairly large open pool with ducks right next to the breakwall. In this pool, there were some Greater Scaup, Common and Red-breasted Mergansers, Common Goldeneye, and of course, White-winged Scoters.
Scoping off shore, I finally picked out what we came for, an adult male Black Scoter, my first male ever. It was far out, but soon flew in slightly closer to us. It was really neat to be able to see the yellow knob on its bill, something I had hoped to see for a while.
After Belmont, we heard about a Surf Scoter at Montrose, about a 5 minute drive north. Matt and Michael were willing to go look quickly, and right after we arrived, Matt picked out a bird that was sleeping but looked right for the Surf. After waiting a few minutes, the bird picked up its head and began to dive, revealing a very large, sloping bill and square head. Yes! A three scoter day, all before 11 AM.
After Michael and Matt dropped me off at home, we said our goodbyes and they headed back, after a fantastic weekend of birding.
On Monday, I was keen on going birding as I had no school. Andy Sigler was able to go out and we went to Kane, DuPage, and Will counties to look for some hard to get waterfowl. He picked me up at 5:45 and we headed straight for Batavia, Kane County, which lies on the Fox River. A female Long-tailed Duck had been found on the river a few days ago, and I hoped to add it to my ever increasing Kane list. We looked for the duck from 7:00-7:20, but were unable to find her. If we wanted any hopes of making it to the other counties, we needed to move on. But not even five minutes after pulling away, I read a post from Joshua Little on IBET that he had the female Long-tailed Duck swimming in the river at 7:00. Impossible! We backtracked and once we arrived, Andy soon muttered, “There she is… Jeeze, we looked right past her.” So we had, as she was not even 100 yards off of the bridge. What was notable was how long she would go underwater during dives. She would be on the surface for under 10 seconds, and then dive for a minute or two. I was able to watch her dive a few times, and grabbed this record photo.
We headed out next to the and M Channel in Lemont. This is a hard area to bird as the county line between Cook and DuPage is very hazy. White-winged Scoters have been found throughout the area, but getting them in DuPage is a challenge. Andy and I found some Scoters that we thought were in DuPage, but on our way out, we met Andrew Aldrich and Joshua Little, and consulted about the county line. It wasn't as easy as we had thought, and we turned around and went back to the birds (We wanted to ensure they were in the proper counties). Below is a map I constructed and put red dots where we had the Scoters. The top of the dotted line is DuPage and the bottom is Cook.
The two right-most dots were an adult male and an immature, which allowed for me to take some horrible record photos. A closer bird in DuPage as well was a bit more obliging.

Having succeeded in two of the four targets, we sped down to Lockport in Will County to bird the 9th St. bridge. There is a side access road that looks over the main channel, and we parked here to view the open water. Upon arriving, we had no trouble picking out White-winged Scoters. Andrew and Joshua had 29 earlier, and Andy and I estimated we had at least 20 birds. They consisted of many ages, but my favorites were the adult males.

Though I was pleased with a 7th White-winged Scoter county, I really wanted the Red-throated Loon that had been here for a few days. After scoping the channel for about 30 minutes, I finally found the Loon, though it was about as far out as it could be. Here is a horrible but probably identifiable image of the Loon.
This was a great trip to end a fantastic weekend, and I ended the day with seven county birds, Long-tailed Duck and House Sparrow in Kane (for 51), White-winged Scoter, Common Goldeneye, and Bald Eagle in DuPage (for 131), and White-winged Scoter and Red-throated Loon in Will (for 111). I will not be able to bird much next weekend, but these past few days surely make up for that!
A senior member of the majority United Russia party has proposed a law that would oblige the heads of mass media outlets and civil society activists to publish income declarations, just as senior state officials and politicians do now.
“Step by step we must move towards a situation in which all people that are public activists would submit their income declarations,” the secretary of the General Council of the United Russia party, Sergey Neverov, was quoted as saying by RBC.
READ MORE: Communists plan bill banning Russian public servants from owning property abroad
Neverov also said that the list of such persons should include chief editors of all mass media outlets and well-known activists in general. He added, however, that the project only existed as a concept and that United Russia has not yet started to discuss the planned bill among members.
Russia's Law on Countering Corruption, adopted in 2008, orders all civil servants and their family members to submit annual declarations of their income and property. This year the parliament passed an amendment to the law that allowed lawmakers to be stripped of their seats for failing to submit the declarations in time (the previous edition on the law only allowed for punishment if false information was included in declarations).
In 2013, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree ordering high-level officials to declare all bank accounts, securities and property they have abroad.
The same year, Russian mass media reported an unnamed source in the parliament as saying that the anti-corruption laws had caused about 30 divorces among the 450 State Duma members. Parliamentarians have neither confirmed nor denied the report.

This column periodically revisits the concept of boundaries as fundamental to civilization itself. Perhaps the most self-evident, the most taken for granted, and yet the most often violated boundary is that between the real and the fictional. The violation of that particular boundary (or those boundaries, as they are as infinite as the number of impossible things that can never happen) is the by far the most dangerous and the most likely to lead to immediate and extreme consequences.
The Hi-Tech Traditionalist: It Takes A Tribe, Not A Global Village
Perhaps the best known instance of disastrous consequences stemming from the breach of a boundary between the real and the fictional was the American Civil War of 1861. At that time in human history there had already existed for more than two generations a simple incontrovertible reality: chattel slavery was not commensurate with civilized, industrial societies. This reality was evident to all, with the crucial exception of the ruling classes of the American South. These highly educated and highly influential people chose to not only cling to the illusion that slavery could endure into the industrial age, but bet their fortunes and their honor on it. Needless to say, they lost their bet and with it were lost the countless lives of brave Americans. Furthermore, they created a dangerous reality that reverberates through America to this very day and in fact more today than in the last fifty years.
Today, the illusion that so grievously hurt the South one hundred and fifty years ago has morphed into a different, though no less dangerous one. This illusion is often called “white supremacy”, but really it is the illusion that “white” denotes a type of ethnicity, cultural identity, or common history. In reality, skin pigmentation or claiming the continent of Europe as one's ancestral homeland has exactly nothing to do with either one of those things. Europe is home to many cultures that span the spectrum from Eastern collectivism (Russia) to Western individualism (Britain). From extreme work ethic (Germany) to extreme laissez-faire (Greece). Ethnically, Hungarians would be quite amused to be told that they share anything in common with the Portuguese. European diaspora is similarly diverse; it is doubtful that much in common can be found among people in Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, or America, whose ancestors came from the European continent.

An argument often put forth by participants in the “white supremacy” is the supposed economic success of white majority countries as compared to those that are not so lucky. This is an easily refuted argument. The success of certain European and European-derived societies relies on the culture of lawfulness that has flourished in them due to certain historical and geographic reasons. The British, for example, being the occupants of a small island meager in natural resources, developed a highly venturesome culture that depended on a high degree of order and discipline to succeed in its maritime endeavors. The French and the Russians, blessed with vast natural resources, did not have to venture far from their shores.
Counter-examples of course abound, both in history and in the present. Japan, China, and South Korea developed highly economically successful societies without the benefit of “whiteness”. What they share are hard-working and law-abiding populations. Recently I saw a side-by-side of Detroit in the 1960's (white! prosperous!) and now (black! derelict!). The message is clear. Or is it? The 1960's Detroit benefited from zero competition from Germany, Japan, and Korea, all still licking their wounds after WWII. Soon as that competition hit in the 1970's, it turned out that Detroit (all white!) was producing inferior product with inferior quality at uncompetitive prices and capitalism worked. Cadillac became Caddy and nobody wanted that stuff anymore. Prosperity left Detroit and found a new home in Stuttgart and Tokyo. Real estate prices dropped and more African Americans moved in now that they could afford it. So no, Detroit is not derelict because of blacks. It is derelict because whites ran it into the ground. In fact, the story of Detroit is a perfect counter-example for white supremacy; American whites (and in the 1970's most blue collar and nearly all white collars workers in Detroit were white) were beaten, fair and square by a bunch of Asians.
Illusions have reasons; denying reality does not come naturally. In the antebellum South, the idea of African Americans, who in many areas constituted the majority of the population, obtaining the full slate of rights guaranteed to all Americans including the right to keep and bear arms was so unpalatable to the ruling and the working class whites, that they had to take refuge in the illusion that this inevitable outcome could be long forestalled. Today, American communities, many of which are majority white are being disrupted by an influx of refugees, migrants, and immigrants, both legal and illegal. This is introducing significant stress factors into communities many of which are already struggling to provide adequate services to their existing populations.
Significantly, these stresses have nothing to do with the ethnic origins, the skin color, or the religion of the new arrivals, though it may seem that they do. They have everything to do with their lack of experience in functioning as members of law-abiding societies and their low educational and public health standards. It is exceedingly difficult for societies to successfully absorb massive levels of immigration when immigrants are less educated, less healthy, and less experienced to the rule of law than the original population. Just ask the nearly 100% Ashkenazi Israel of the 1950's how hard it was to absorb the massive immigration of Jews from North Africa, Yemen, and Iraq. Or the much more prosperous Israel of the 1990's about the absorption of Ethiopian Jews. Many, many mistakes were made. Many scars remain. Intra-Jewish Ashkenazi on Sephardi (in other words white on black) racism was rampant and, unfortunately it had not yet been fully effaced to this day. Ethiopian Jews, whose standards of education, health, and societal development were even lower than those of the Sephardi Jews from the 1950's, are finding it even more difficult to fit in. And Israel is struggling with them even more, all the good intentions in the world non-withstanding. But there is also a highly illuminating counter-example. The 1970's and 1990's waves of Russian Jewish immigration to Israel, while not without their own difficulties, proved to be much easier to absorb. And it is easy to see why; these folks were educated, healthy, and law-abiding (in other words used to living in a state of lawfulness). They set about learning Hebrew, finding the ins and outs of the Israeli society, and eventually joining its leadership at the highest levels. It took them a few years to achieve what Sephardi Jews could only realize after two generations. Was institutional racism to blame? Were non-immigrant Ashkenazi Jews receiving preferential treatment? Most certainly, in both cases. The Russian immigrants however knew how to deal with discrimination; they were experts in it from the old Soviet Union days. The Sephardi Jews had to learn the hard way. Ethiopian Jews are learning still.
The Hi-Tech Traditionalist: The Opening Salvos Of The 2nd American Civil War…Lenin Would Be Proud
Inviting non-Ashkenazi Jews to Israel as part of the Law of Return enjoyed and still enjoys wall-to-wall consensus in Israel, though the difficulties associated with it have always been well-understood. Imagine how much more difficult it is when this kind of immigrants are foisted on communities that were not consulted in the least prior to their arrival. No wonder that some of the folks who are so ill-treated by their own elected officials are pushed to finding refuge in dangerous illusions such as “white destiny”, “white genocide”, etc. What is desperately needed are responsible leaders like President Trump, who lead the way to a common-sense immigration policy. This policy should be broadly merit-based, such that most immigrants who are granted entry are law-abiding, educated, and healthy individuals. Such individuals, regardless of anything else, will be welcomed with open arms in any American community. A small number of refugees from less fortunate backgrounds can be admitted on humanitarian grounds in consultation with their host communities. Perhaps Hollywood, California is better suited to receive Somalian refugees than a small town in rural Minnesota. Let's ask them!
It's time to pivot toward single payer. Of course, this was the plan all along. ObamaCare was designed to fail. It was, famously, a “step on the path” to a fully government-run system. Hillary has decided it's time to move forward on the road to single-payer.
Right now, Hillary is struggling among many of her formerly loyal demos. She desperately needs something that will generate excitement among young liberals. If you're a basement-dwelling socialist who's angry about the destruction of Bernie Sanders, nothing gets you pumped up like the idea that the feds could take control of every doctor in the country.
This will be Hillary's last great play of the 2016 cycle: Get millennials on board by promising (or intimating) to enact the greatest federal expansion in the history of the nation. Bill is laying the groundwork, and none other than the New York Times is announcing the plan by suggesting the “ailing” ObamaCare “will have to change to survive”:
On Monday morning, Andrei Zubov, a sixty-two-year-old history professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, heard a knock on his apartment door. When he opened it, a postman handed him an official telegram, requesting his presence that afternoon at the university's personnel office. When Zubov arrived, the school's vice-rector wordlessly handed him a signed letter: he had been fired, in accordance with Point 8, Article 81 of the state labor code, which covers the “commission of an immoral act incompatible with the continuation of work.” The statute is usually applied to instructors who show up to lecture while drunk, for example, or who harass female students.
Zubov's “immoral act” was an op-ed, published on March 1st, in Vedomosti, the country's most respected daily newspaper. Under the headline “This Has Already Happened,” Zubov compared the Russian seizure of Crimea, justified as a defense of Russian-speakers there, to Hitler's annexation of Austria and the German-speaking Sudetenland, in 1938 and 1939. Everything seemed “radiant” for Hitler at first, Zubov wrote: after all, he had expanded the Reich “without a single shot, without a single drop of blood—is the Fuhrer in fact not a brilliant politician?” Putin's aims, Zubov later said, were not like Hitler's. But just as Germany eventually paid the price for its conquests, Zubov suggested, so would Russia. “Our politicians are drawing our nation into a terrible, horrifying venture,” he wrote. “We should not buy into this as the Germans bought into Goebbels and Hitler's promises.”
The university's statement explaining Zubov's dismissal claimed that his writings “contradict Russia's foreign policy and inflict careless, irresponsible criticism on the actions of the state, thus causing damage to the teaching and educational process.” The offending article, the university claimed, had caused “outrage and confusion in the university community.” Zubov, who graduated from the Moscow State Institute in 1973, with a major in Asian studies, describes himself as a member of the late-Soviet dissident intelligentsia, and he looks the part: a swirly gray beard; a tweed jacket; speech laced with long, discursive historical metaphors; and a dark, book-filled apartment on a quiet lane in the center of Moscow, where I met him two days after he had been fired. “I decided to conduct an experiment, like a doctor, but on myself,” Zubov said, describing his decision to write the piece that cost him his job. “If we were headed toward dictatorship, it would end, of course, with my expulsion from the university.”
Zubov had been targeted by a newly vigorous hunt for internal enemies—a campaign against those who do not share in Russia's officially sanctioned mood of expansionary euphoria. In an address to Parliament on March 18th, Putin raised the spectre of “a fifth column”—a “disparate bunch of national traitors”—sowing discord inside Russia. Putin's menacing language, a loyal member of Parliament from the pro-Kremlin United Russia party told me, was simply expressing “what has been known for a long time.” Anyone “who plays along with the interests of another state is either an idiot or a traitor,” the deputy said, adding that this was “a scientific fact.” (Angela Merkel was right to describe Putin as “in another world,” the deputy said. “He's in a different league, he is in a dialogue with history.”)
Putin's speech took place two days after the Crimean referendum, but it was as much a declaration of the new rules and motifs of Putinism, rich with grievance and triumph, as it was a statement about the disputed peninsula. He was furious, but proud of the spoils he had brought home: at long last, there had been some measure of historical revenge for the injustices Russia had suffered since the Soviet collapse. “If you compress a spring all the way to its limit, it will snap back hard,” he said.
The annexation of Crimea—not the act itself as much as its reverberating effect on Russian politics and society—has consolidated the new operating model for Putin's rule, which had already been taking shape. Ever since Putin returned to the Presidency, in 2012, he has searched for an ideological, even spiritual, underpinning for his grip on power. Disturbed by a protest movement that briefly seemed formidable and a slowing economy, Putin turned to a mishmash of nationalism, conservative values, Russian Orthodoxy, and a fear of the corrupting influence of the degenerate West. If his first decade in power had been justified by a growing economy and improved living standards, then his third term would be justified by the grandeur of historical destiny.
Crimea marks a capstone to this shift in orientation: a new and harder era, in which isolation and conflict with the West are virtues in and of themselves. Gone is the postmodern carnival defined by people like Vladislav Surkov, a showman and manipulator who helped Putin construct the political culture of the aughts.
Putin is turning the country away from a time when citizens were expected to be passive and inert, and toward an era when they must be jumpy, mobilized, and ready to defend the state at any cost. The need for enemies is obvious: to rally the patriotic masses for the struggle that lies ahead. The idea of a fifth column, Zubov said—he presumes himself to be considered among its members—is to show that those who disagree with the state are not “political opponents in the political arena” but “enemies who naturally have to be isolated; you have to fight them until they are all exhausted.”
For many years, Russia's small number of liberals were regarded as essentially harmless; they could safely be mocked or ignored, left alone to their nice restaurants and online magazines. But now the stakes are higher: one widely read news portal, Lenta.ru, just had its editor replaced by a Kremlin loyalist. Dozhd, an independent cable channel, has come under intense pressure and is in danger of needing to shut down.
As the space for independent journalism shrinks, the propaganda apparatus is working at feverish speed. Dmitry Kiselyov, a television host and media executive who represents the id of the state propaganda machine at its most grotesque, blamed this same fifth column for the sanctions imposed against more than thirty Russian and Ukrainian officials by the European Union. Kiselyov, who was among those sanctioned, cited Putin's speech as evidence to blame the fifth column for compiling the blacklist. “Putin legalized that term in the political language of Russia,” he said. “We know their names. We know how they wrote our names and sent them to these Western embassies.” On another segment, he identified two of the fifth columnists: Alexei Navalny, the opposition leader now under house arrest, and Sergei Parkhomenko, an editor and civic activist who called for sanctions against those responsible for state propaganda.
Parkhomenko didn't see the program when it aired; a friend told him about it afterward. “I found it on the Internet and watched only these five minutes,” he told me. “Physically I can't endure any more, literally. It's impossible to look at this horror,” he said of Kiselyov's performance. “It's really quite rich material for a psychiatrist: all the mannerisms, movements, endless grimacing, exaggerated gesticulation, some kind of howling intonation.” But he also recognized the seriousness of being singled out by someone seen to channel the will of the state. “Of course it's a threat,” he said. “A large number of people who serve the regime will perceive this as a direct order.”
In Russia, the will of the state is expressed with signals of varying subtlety; the invocation of “national traitors” is among the less oblique examples of the genre. A new Web site called predatel.net—the word means “traitor”—has recently launched, featuring a list of public figures that the site's anonymous creators deem to have betrayed Russia, whether by criticizing the annexation of Crimea or by supporting Western sanctions. As the site's short manifesto puts it, “We believe that Russian citizens who insult our soldiers and who cast doubt on the need to fight neo-Nazis are traitors, no matter whether they are talented journalists, writers, and directors.” The site has a form for users to “suggest a traitor.”
When the Duma approved the annexation of Crimea, on March 20th, only one deputy, Ilya Ponomaryov, voted against the measure. Two days earlier, when Putin spoke to both houses of Parliament, Ponomaryov's colleagues already knew his decision: as Putin came to the sentence about the “fifth column” of “national traitors,” the other deputies seated nearby patted Ponomaryov on the shoulder. “That was for you,” they told him. One parliamentary faction has called for Ponomaryov to be expelled. He expects to hang on for now, but may be kicked out by his own party, the vaguely left-leaning Just Russia, whose leadership is ultimately servile to the Kremlin. “Consolidation helps when there are problems, and of course there will be problems,” Ponomaryov told me.
But, for now, Putin is maintaining his victorious pose. Crimea is Russian again, and the costs of his new prize—whether from sanctions or a dragging economy—haven't yet shown themselves. The Levada Center, an independent polling agency, found this week that his approval rating had soared to eighty per cent, the highest yet of his current term.
Zubov, however, is waiting for the crash—and fears that it will be the citizens who suffer the consequences. “I saw how the occupation of Crimea stirred up such excitement, such happiness,” he told me. “This was the most frightening thing of all. If the people are a party to the actions of the state, then they are the ones who will have to answer for them.” For now, there are few signs of discontent: another survey this week found that seventy-two per cent of Russians supported the censorship of information for the good of the country. Armed with that license, the state's campaign against “national traitors” can only become more intense.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Friday welcomed a “first step” by Saudi Arabia to allow humanitarian aid to reach Yemen and called for negotiations on the country's conflict.
The coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen said on Wednesday it would allow aid in through the Red Sea ports of Hodeidah and Salif, as well as U.N. flights to Sanaa, more than two weeks after blockading the country.
About 7 million people face famine in Yemen and their survival is dependent on international assistance.
“Full and immediate implementation of the announced measures is a first step in ensuring that food, medicine, and fuel reach the Yemeni people and that the aid organizations on the frontlines of mitigating this humanitarian crisis are able to do their essential work,” the White House said in a statement.
“We look forward to additional steps that will facilitate the unfettered flow of humanitarian and commercial goods from all ports of entry to the points of need,” it added.
A U.N. spokesman said the Saudi-led coalition had given the United Nations permission to resume flights of aid workers to the Houthi-controlled capital on Saturday, but not to dock ships loaded with wheat and medical supplies.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asked Saudi Arabia to ease the blockade.
The U.S.-backed coalition closed air, land and sea access on Nov. 6, in a move it said was to stop the flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran. The action came after Saudi Arabia intercepted a missile fired toward Riyadh. Iran has denied supplying weapons.
The White House said it was committed to supporting Saudi Arabia and its Gulf partners “against the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' aggression and blatant violations of international law”.
The Saudi-led coalition has been targeting the Houthis since they seized parts of Yemen in 2015, including the capital Sanaa, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee.
The Houthis, drawn mainly from Yemen's Zaidi Shi'ite minority and allied with long-serving former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, control much of the country.
The United Nations has been mediating in the conflict without much success.
“The United States continues to believe that this devastating conflict, and the suffering it causes, must be brought to an end through political negotiations,” the White House said.
Offensive line help. Another pass-rusher. And depth at running back? Yes, the Indianapolis Colts could use some more bodies in the backfield to compete for the backup running back spot behind starter Frank Gore. The veteran had 227 more rushing attempts than his next closest teammate last season.
@MikeWellsNFL If Ezekiel Elliott is there @ #18, do the #Colts bypass oline & pass rush needs & take him in your opinion? #ColtsMail — Anthony Childress (@Naptown2Htown) April 8, 2016
Mike Wells: Elliott is expected to be gone when the Colts pick at No. 18. ESPN NFL draft expert Mel Kiper Jr. has Elliott going to the Baltimore Ravens at No. 6 in his most recent mock draft. The Colts will likely have to trade up to get Elliott. But for the sake of this question, let's assume Elliott takes a major plummet in the draft and is sitting there when Indianapolis' pick rolls around. Owner Jim Irsay, GM Ryan Grigson and coach Chuck Pagano may have a tough decision, especially when you take into account the Colts' need for help on the offensive line and in the pass-rush department. Elliott is too good of a talent to pass up. Grigson made an interesting comment during the owners meetings when asked about their depth at running back after the signings of Robert Turbin and Jordan Todman. "We're not done there, either," Grigson said. "There are a lot of good backs you can get. There are the elite backs that are going to be in this draft." Elliott rushed for 3,961 yards and 44 touchdowns in his three seasons at Ohio State. The Colts will have to find their running back of the future at some point because Gore, who rushed for 967 yards last season, turns 33 years old in May. Having only six picks makes it tough for the Colts in this draft.
The man accused of killing Deputy Darren Goforth has been found incompetent to stand trial. Shannon Miles will be sent to a state mental hospital.
"According to one of the reports, he's aware of the fact that he's charged with capital murder but it doesn't resonate. In other words, he doesn't fully grasp or understand how severe that is," said Miles' attorney Anthony Osso.
A psychological evaluation was completed and the results were handed to a judge on Monday. State experts agreed that Miles was mentally unstable. The state hospital is at maximum capacity, so Miles will have to wait until there is a vacant space.
"It's one of our cornerstones and fundamentals of our criminal justice system for someone to understand the charges against them and to understand what's happening in the courtroom," prosecutor Marcy McCorvey said.
State hospital is full so #ShannonMiles will remain at Harris County Jail until a bed becomes available. @kprc2 — Syan Rhodes (@SyanRhodes) February 9, 2016
When he regains competency, case will move forward. #ShannonMiles #DeputyGoforth — Syan Rhodes (@SyanRhodes) February 9, 2016
"There's 61 people ahead of us. We don't anticipate him being transferred from the Harris county jail up to Vernon state hospital probably for in excess of 100 days," Osso said.
Miles will stay inside the Harris County jail until something opens up. That could be months from now and his treatment will be on hold.
"That's a result of the failure of the legislature to see the need to finance additional hospitals, additional bed spaces and additional staff members to be able to bring a person back to the level of competency," said George Parnham, who some consider to be an expert in the defense of individuals with mental illness. His most well known client is Andrea Yates, the Houston-area mother who drowned all five of her kids in a bathtub in 2001.
Parnham will soon be meeting with officials inside the Harris County jail to discuss implementing local mental health services.
"We will take a tour," Parnham said. "We're going to talk about what we can do to have a local competency evaluation unit established within the jail system."
The Harris County Sheriff's Office released a statement Tuesday that read: "We are disappointed by the news, but remain hopeful that the State will restore Shannon Miles' competency promptly so justice can be sought. It is a tragic reminder that we lost Deputy Goforth to an individual whose only apparent motive was that Darren wore the uniform of a law enforcement officer."
The Harris County Deputies Organization also released a statement that read: "The Harris County Deputies' Organization respects the decision by the Harris County District Court in this case. We have faith in the judicial process and believe that justice will be served in time."
[READ THE COURT ORDER]
"It's been literally impossible to communicate with him on a rational basis or in a rational manner," Osso said after filing the documents on behalf of Miles. "So it makes it difficult to plan strategy, discuss evidence, discuss what steps we need to take to get ready for trial."
According to the court documents, Miles' attorney wrote, "... have attempted to communicate with the defendant in the Harris County Jail on multiple occasions in furtherance of their investigation in preparation for trial. However, defense counsel would show the court that the defendant does not have:
1) a sufficient present ability to consult with his attorneys with a reasonable degree of rational understanding; or
2) a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him; and
3) is competent to stand trial..."
The defense counsel hired a psychiatric expert to evaluate Shannon Miles. According to court documents, the psychiatric report indicates, "Defendant has been diagnosed with suffering from schizophrenia and the report concludes with a reasonable degree of medical probability that the defendant is presently incompetent to stand trial."
Prosecutors said Miles shot and killed Goforth in retaliation for being a law enforcement officer, and no other reason.
Miles was indicted in Nov. by a Harris County grand jury on a capital murder charge.
The single-page indictment document, obtained by Channel 2, points to a motive of "retaliation".
"...committing and attempting to commit retaliation against Harris County Sheriff's Department Deputy D. Goforth," the document reads.
There is no evidence that Miles ever had any prior contact with Goforth before the murder, so the "retaliation" could be against police officers in general.
"The way I understand it is that this defendant engaged in this conduct not because any prior dealings, run-ins, or bad blood but because the complainant in this case, Deputy Goforth, wore a uniform," Channel 2 legal analyst Brian Wice said.
Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson outlined the probable cause against Miles at a press conference after Miles was arrested.
Anderson said a witness saw a man sitting in a red Ford Ranger pickup truck at a gas station on West Road in northwest Harris County.
The witness said Goforth had just pumped gas into his patrol car, then went inside the store. While returning to his vehicle, Anderson said surveillance video shows a man wearing a white T-shirt and red shorts get out of the pickup and run up behind Goforth as the deputy was walking back to his vehicle.
Anderson said surveillance shows the man putting a gun to the back of Goforth's head and firing. She said the deputy then falls to the ground and the man shoots him multiple times while he's down.
"And as you see the video, you see the male get out of the car, he's wearing a white T-shirt, red shorts, tennis shoes, and he runs up behind Deputy Goforth and puts the gun to the back of his head and shoots. Deputy Goforth hits the ground and then he continues to unload his gun, shooting repeatedly into the back of Deputy Goforth," Anderson said.
The man then gets back into the pickup and drives off.
According to Anderson, the video and witnesses confirmed to investigators that the pickup had an after-market trailer hitch and a white cooler in the bed of the truck.
Anderson said investigators ran vehicle registration for red Ford Ranger pickup trucks in the same ZIP code as the gas station and got a match at an address on Pine Falls.
Authorities spotted the truck with a similar trailer hitch in the driveway at the residence.
A man answered the door and told authorities that the truck belonged to his brother, who had just left with his mother.
The mother and Miles returned home, and Anderson said Miles admitted that the truck was his.
When asked if he owned any guns, Anderson said that Miles told authorities he owned a pistol that was stored in a blue bag in his garage.
Deputies got a search warrant and found the gun, which was empty, and the white cooler.
Anderson said ballistics testing showed the gun matched the shell casings found at the gas station.
"The gun holds 14 in its magazine, and one in the chamber. Fifteen shell casings, you can do the math. He unloaded the entire pistol into Deputy Goforth," Anderson said. "In addition there is a witness who viewed a video lineup with the defendant in it and he positively identified Shannon Miles as the shooter."
Authorities have called Goforth's shooting an unprovoked, execution-style ambush.Miles is being held without bond.
"The shooter in this case didn't see black, he didn't see white. He saw blue," KPRC 2 legal analyst Brian Wice said. "That's what this case is about. In another year, the DA's office is going to ask 12 Harris County citizens to probably ask this defendant to pay with his life for this execution."

French-led troops are consolidating their position in the historic Malian city of Timbuktu after seizing it from Islamist extremists.
French military commanders say soldiers are patrolling the streets looking to flush out any remaining militants.
The troops are then expected to focus on the last rebel stronghold, Kidal.
An international donors' conference has opened in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, hoping to fund a budget for the campaign set at $950m (£605m).
Also on Tuesday, a conference in Brussels is due to decide on troops for an EU military training mission for Mali. The UK has already said it will contribute to the mission.
'No shots fired'
Life appeared to be returning closer to normal in Timbuktu on Tuesday, with French and Malian troops in control of the streets, although electricity and phone lines were still cut.
On Monday, about 1,000 French soldiers - including paratroopers - and 200 Malian troops had seized Timbuktu airport and entered the city.
Col Frederic Gout, head of French helicopter operations at Timbuktu, told Agence France-Presse: "There were no shots fired, no blood spilt. Not even passive resistance with traps."
At the scene Residents were still cheering French and Malian troops when we entered the city late in the afternoon. Both national flags can be seen all over town. The feeling that people are coming back to life after nearly a year of occupation by extremist militants is simply incredible. There are still some reminders of the Islamist rule with banners declaring Sharia here and there. But we have also seen people looting houses allegedly held by al-Qaeda militants. A young man was walking with a huge wooden door on his back while others fought for iron sheets and all sorts of lamps and cables. A French commander said troops were still sweeping the town for mines, booby traps and more importantly for potential militants hiding within the population. There is no electricity here nor phone network. The two main hotels, which have been closed for so long, have reopened to accommodate incoming journalists. Staff are delighted to welcome us and are moving heaven and earth to resume normal service.
Welcoming the French and Malian force, residents said that the Islamists had left several days earlier, following French air strikes on their bases.
As they withdrew into the desert, the Islamist fighters set fire to several buildings including a library containing priceless manuscripts, some dating back to the 13th Century.
The Ahmed Baba institute held about 30,000 manuscripts and includes documents about centuries of life in the city, Mali and neighbouring countries.
Ali Baba, a worker at the institute, told Sky News that more than 3,000 manuscripts had been destroyed.
The recovery of Timbuktu followed the swift capture by French and Malian forces of Gao on Saturday, another major northern population centre occupied by militant groups.
Islamists took advantage of a coup last year to seize the vast north of Mali and impose strict Sharia law on its inhabitants.
France - the former colonial power in Mali - launched a military operation this month after militants looked to be threatening the south.
Meanwhile, reports from Kidal - home of the head of Ansar Dine, the main militant group in northern Mali - suggest that the group may have already lost control there.
The secular Tuareg rebel group MNLA said it had taken charge.
On Tuesday, the MNLA said on its website that it had taken control of six other towns, including Lere.
It said it was prepared to work with the French "to eradicate terrorist groups" in the north but that it would not allow the return of the Malian army, which it accused of "crimes against the civilian population".
Image caption Signs proclaiming Sharia law are a testament to the militants' period of control
In Paris, French President Francois Hollande said that African forces would now be in the forefront of securing the north.
"We know that this is the most difficult part because the terrorists are hidden there and can still carry out extremely dangerous operations, for neighbouring countries and Mali," he said.
France has 2,900 soldiers in Mali, with almost 8,000 African troops expected to take over, although the deployment has been slow.
The BBC's Mark Doyle, in Bandiagara, some 320km (200 miles) south of Timbuktu, says there is still great fear among the people outside of the main population centres.
No-one is sure where the Islamists have gone, he says, and there are concerns that another phase of the war could now begin - one of hit-and-run attacks or suicide bombings.
'Solidarity'
At the opening of the donor conference in Addis Ababa, Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara said the budget for the multinational force's operation would be $950m - more than double the African Union's initial estimate.
The AU pledged $50m at its summit at the same venue on Monday, and it was hoped the UN and some of the 60 to 70 donors invited to the conference would increase the funding.
In a list of donations carried on the AU's Twitter account on Tuesday, Japan had pledged $120m, the US $96m and Germany $20m.
India and China pledged $1m each, the AU said.
AU Commission chief Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma told delegates that they had gathered "to express solidarity with the Republic of Mali and its people".
She said: "We all know the gravity of the crisis. It is a situation that requires a swift and effective international response, for it threatens Mali, the region, the continent and even beyond."
Ethiopian PM Hailemariam Desalegn said money would also be needed to fund post-conflict projects.
The BBC's James Copnall, in the Ethiopian capital, says there is a general recognition that Mali will not become peaceful again without a democratic transformation, but that for the moment the focus is firmly on finding the money needed by the military force.
On Monday, the International Monetary Fund agreed an $18.4m emergency loan to Mali.
Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department appeared to be visibly shaken when told reporters Friday that he wasn't attempting to be “subversive” in previous statements he made surrounding details of the October 1 massacre at the Route 91 Music Festival where 58 people lost their lives.
As Intellihub details, in the ‘no questions' conference, which members of the independent media were not allowed to attend, the sheriff said that he's “well aware” of the timeline dispute released by MGM Management on Thursday which claims that Stephen Paddock fired his weapon into the crowd just seconds after Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos was struck by a bullet in the 32nd-floor hallway outside the shooter's end suite.
The sheriff stuck to his guns on Friday when he told reporters that he still ‘stands by' his latest timeline which lists Campos'sencounter with Paddock at 9:59 p.m., 6 minutes prior Paddock's first known volley of fully-automatic gunfire.
The visibly nervous sheriff also made clear that “there is no conspiracy between the FBI, LVMPD, or the MGM” and that “nobody is attempting to hide anything” in reference to the investigation and noted his solidarity with the FBI. “We are standing hand-in-hand with the FBI in the continuance of this investigation,” the sheriff explained. “I feel confident that there are no other individuals that are intending to cause harm to our community associated with the 1 October event.”
Sheriff Lombardo also provided an explanation for changes he recently made to the publicly released timeline surrounding Paddock's arrival to Vegas and his check-in date at the Mandalay Bay.
“We have come to learn that the suspect did occupy the room on the 25th and the situation on how the room was compensated or paid for had changed on the 28th to include Marilou Danley,” he explained.
Additionally, the sheriff told reporters that so far there has only been a “visual inspection” done of Paddock's brain and said that Paddock's brain was shipped to a facility that will conduct a “microscopic analysis of the brain” to see if there were any signs of mental illness.
As of yet, authorities admit that they still have no motive for Paddock's crimes and maintain that he has no affiliation with any groups.
At one point a reporter tried to sneak a question in but was quickly swatted down by Lombardo over the podium mic.
This fiasco comes after earlier chaos surrounding the sudden disappearance of Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos, who was shot in the leg by Stephen Paddock…
Authored by Mac Slavo via SHTFplan.com,
Over the last few days Las Vegas law enforcement officials have significantly altered the timeline of the mass shooting that left 59 dead and hundreds injured. Adding further intrigue is the fact that the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino now says that they have their own timeline of events, which diverge from the official story.
Media scrum tonight as we learn security officer shot in Vegas attack, Jesus Campos' whereabouts are unknown. pic.twitter.com/Jk09tRlPsX — Stephanie Wash (@WashNews) October 13, 2017
On top of that, mystery still surrounds Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos, who was shot in the leg when Stephen Paddock opened fire and unleashed some 200 rounds through the door of his hotel room.
As Fox News reports, the Mandalay Bay security guard shot by Stephen Paddock in the moments leading up to the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history was set to break his silence Thursday night with five television interviews, including one on Fox News, Campos' union president said.
Except when the cameras were about to roll, and media gathered in the building to talk to him, Campos reportedly bolted, and, as of early Friday morning, it wasn't immediately clear where he was. “We were in a room and we came out and he was gone,” Campos' union president told reporters, according to ABC News' Stephanie Wash.
ampos, who is reportedly not registered to work in the State of Nevada, was also scheduled to do an interview with Sean Hannity Thursday night. But just minutes before the interview was to take place, Campos was said to have abruptly cancelled his appearance:
In response to the cancellation, alternative media reporter Laura Loomer attempted to reach out to Campos, who has thus far remained shielded behind his union representatives and refused to provide his account of the shooting to the public. According to Loomer, it appears that Campos and his family have been forced to remain silent because of a gag order surrounding the incident.
She “doorstopped” the Campos family in person when she visited their home in Las Vegas Thursday night.
I just doorstopped #JesusCampos after it was reported he canceled his interview with @seanhannity. I can confirm his family has a gag order. https://t.co/lNMaaaZzWC — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) October 13, 2017
According to a video Loomer posted on Periscope, Campos has armed security and it appears that an unmarked law enforcement vehicle is parked outside his home.

Additional videos show Loomer asking members of the Campos family for more information about why he chose to cancel his interviews:
According to Loomer, Jesus Campos and his family members have been told not to discuss the incident. Further, when Loomer was confronted by an armed security guard outside of Campos' home she noted that the firm the security guard supposedly works for is not registered to operate in Nevada, to which she asks the guard:
You said that you worked for OnScene, a security company. We did a background check…. and the business license expired in January 2017 and has a virtual address… so the company that you work for…. is it a real company? Or is it just some type of shill company that the FBI or DHS is using?
Little is known about Campos, with few pictures to emerge of the security guard and no apparent online footprint surfacing to provide details about one of the central figures in the mass shooting.
Former Alabama politician Stephen Nodine says he is seriously considering running for Congress even though he is a convicted felon and still serving time in jail.
The former Mobile County Commissioner is seeking redemption after a nightmarish three years of being put on trial for the murder of his mistress and serving time in federal prison for a gun offense. He has long maintained his innocence and blamed politics for his prosecution.
While a jury failed to reach a verdict in the murder case against him, Nodine is currently serving time in a county jail after accepting a plea bargain to lesser charges.
Nodine, who is on work release during the day but in jail at night, spends much of his time on social media, arguing his innocence and attempting to rehabilitate his image.
On Wednesday, the colorful politician said in an email that he will consider running for the congressional seat left vacant by the resignation of Alabama Rep. Jo Bonner.
“I know some will be skeptical of my interest in this congressional race after wrongfully being accused of crimes, drug abuse and personal mistakes,” he admitted Wednesday.
Nodine added: “All I ask is for a second chance to serve the citizens of South Alabama.”
In his email to several reporters, Nodine listed his accomplishments while in office, including recovery efforts after Hurricanes Ivan and Katrina. He boasted of economic development experience and his actions to “take on BP” after the oil spill in 2010.
If elected to Congress, Nodine vowed to work to lessen regulatory burdens, increase infrastructure and bring businesses to the area. He also said he would work to reform the country's justice system.
“I have lived through a devastating chapter of my life, seeing first hand what an out of control Justice System can do to an innocent persons life,” he said.
Nodine told The Daily Caller he would campaign heavily on social media, where he was aggressive in promoting news stories and national television appearances that have been questioned whether he was wrongly prosecuted.

I can't believe this blog has been around this long without an entry on fermented vegetables. I mean, there was the vinegar thing, but grapes are berries, so I don't think that counts. How can we have a hipster blog like this without “probiotics” as a keyword?
Sorry about that.
Let's talk about sauerkraut.
It's really easy to make… You buy the $120 pickling crock, the $30 weights and the the $25 book from Williams and Sonoma, then a $35 artisanal kraut pounder (not a Krauthammer) from a non-profit, sustainability-focused group, and you're all set! That's more than $200 worth of sauerkraut-making supplies and you haven't even bought your cabbage yet. It'll look nice on your counter, though, and you can use it as a conversation starter about probiotic foods when your friends come over for your Friday-night kombucha party.
But don't worry, you really don't need any of that expensive stuff. You can make sauerkraut with regular, easy to find, and much less expensive materials. And if you'd like to make sauerkraut because it's awesome, then read on.
You'll need:
1 head of cabbage.
1 chopping device for cabbage.
1 fist, small enough to fit in opening of jug. Borrow one from a small child if yours won't work.
1 jug of some sort with an airtight lid. Ensure jug and fist can interact without resistance. I'd recommend at least a half-gallon.
1 method of adding an appropriately-sized hole to the top of the airtight lid. If you're using glass, you'll need glass drill bits from the local home improvement store and a youtube video about how to drill a hole in glass without dying.
1 airlock to fit in said hole (you can get this at a homebrew store for about $2)
1 grommet or other method of ensuring an airtight seal between hole and airlock.
1/2 tablespoon (or so) of pickling salt (you're going to have to buy a whole box)
1 plastic bag
1 quantity of water to put in said bag
You'll want:
2 hours of free time
1 warm place that's out of the way that the kitties / kiddies won't get into.
Directions:
1. Peel off the outer layer of cabbage. Throw these leaves in your neighbor's yard.
2. Chop the rest of the cabbage into little sauerkraut-sized bits. You can leave the core in, or you can cut it out and feed it to your neighborhood bunny. I used a Cuisinart, but a simple knife works just as well.
3. Put a couple of inches of cabbage in your jug. Sprinkle a little salt on it. Repeat until full. You'll need to use pickling salt for this. The artisanal salts aren't completely Sodium Chloride and table salt contains iodine, which kills germs, which is exactly what we're not trying to do here.
Keep shoving cabbage in the jar, and adding salt. If you're not making a mess, you're doing it wrong.
At some point, the jar might get too full. You'll need to smash the cabbage down with your fist. The decision to wash your hands is yours and yours alone. If you let it sit and wilt for a little while, it gets easier. You can also use a potato masher or kraut pounder if you don't like punching cabbage.
Really beat the crap out of it. You'll get it all to fit!
4. Fill your bag with water. I made a mistake here by not tying the bag shut. As the fermentation caused the packed cabbage to expand, the pressure on the bag ended up bursting it. Add some salt to this water so if it does break it won't affect the salinity of your mixture.
5. Put water bag on cabbage in a way that also allows the jar to close.
6. Attach your airlock in the hole you made.
Other blogs will tell you that you have to “scrape the mold off every once in a while.” Fuck that. The airlock system prevents mold from growing as long as it's airtight and you don't open it until it's done. If you do open it up, especially after it's done fermenting, you will let out all that precious CO2 that's preventing mold from growing on everything that's exposed to air. If you want to smell it, you should be able to get a good whiff of what it's doing through the airlock.
7. Connect lid to jar.
8. Fill airlock with water.
9. Put it somewhere where you won't screw with it.
10. Wait one month. You might want to set an alert on your phone to remind you that it's ready.
11. When that alarm goes off, take your kraut out of the jug and put it in the refrigerator. You don't have to take it out of the jug, but if you do and you refrigerate it, it will slow down the fermentation process and keep your sauerkraut from going “too” sour. Also, remember that if the fermentation has finished, your cabbage might start to mold if you expose it to oxygen.
Some people say you should keep the leftover juice to jumpstart your next batch. This will work, but it won't taste the same as this batch you just made. There are several different phases of bacteria growth while fermenting. They all impart a different characteristic to the kraut. Since you're skipping to the end bacteria, your kraut won't have as balanced of a taste. It will be much more sour. If that's what you want, though, save your juices! If you don't, drink it!
That's it. You've got sauerkraut now. Invite your friends over for sauerkraut and sausage. If they make fun of you for fermenting your own vegetables, then know you've got good friends!

A company that holds medical cannabis business licenses in several states received a tentative green light from zoning board officials to open the first dispensary in Boston despite resistance from locals.
Patriot Care Corp. initially had trouble getting officials to sign off on the dispensary after members of a downtown business group voted tooppose the dispensary, calling it a “step in the wrong direction” for the neighborhood.
The company was awarded a license last week to grow, process and sell medical marijuana in New Yorkunder the name Columbia Care. It also runs dispensaries in Arizona, has a license to open a storefront in Illinois, and has a presence in Washington DC and Nevada, according to its website.
Massachusetts' first dispensary, Alternative Therapies Group, opened in Salem in June, kicking off an MMJ industry that could eventually generate tens of millions of dollars in annual sales.
We'll be the first to admit that the 1983 movie The Right Stuff takes artistic license when it talks about the Mercury program and other events. It exaggerates problems between the astronauts, portrays the journalists as unthinking buffoons and misrepresents historical events such as breaking the speed of sound.
Late in the three-hour film, the movie turns to astronaut John Glenn‘s first flight in space, which took place on this day in 1962. Glenn was the first American to make an orbital flight of the Earth. He returned a national hero.
Below we'll highlight a few points of similarity and difference between the movie and John Glenn's own account of the flight of Friendship 7, which he detailed in his 1999 biography John Glenn: A Memoir. And yes, the rest of this post does contain spoilers for those who haven't seen the film.
– Visit from Lyndon Johnson. During an aborted launch attempt, the movie shows Lyndon Johnson parked nearby the Glenns' house in a limousine, ordering an aide to let him inside. Glenn's wife Annie (through a fellow astronaut wife) keeps informing the hapless assistant that there's no way Johnson (and the TV cameras he wants to include) can come in. While Glenn's actual account doesn't specify where the vice-president of the United States was at that time, he does talk about the request and refusal. “She said she was tired, she had a headache, and she just wasn't going to allow all those people in her house … I told her whatever she wanted to do, I would back her up 100 percent.”
– Threat to remove Glenn from the flight. In The Right Stuff, Glenn then gets into a shouting argument with a NASA official nearby, who orders him to get on the phone and tell Annie to let the vice-president in. The NASA official threatens to replace Glenn with another astronaut, at which point Glenn's colleagues surround him and the official backs down. Glenn confirms the incident, but does not mention other astronauts: “I saw red. I said that if they wanted to do that, they'd have a press conference to announce their decision and I'd have one to announce mine, and if they wanted to talk about it anymore, they'd have to wait until I took a shower. When I came back, they were gone and I never heard any more about it.”
– Fireflies. An extended sequence in The Right Stuff shows Glenn exclaiming as he sees “fireflies” outside of the spacecraft. The movie doesn't really explain why they happen, but yes, they actually were there. “I saw around the capsule a huge field of particles that looked like tiny yellow stars,” Glenn wrote in his memoir. “They seemed to travel with the capsule, but more slowly. There were thousands of them, like swirling fireflies.” Glenn added: “They were droplets of frozen water vapor from the capsule's heat exchanger system, but their fireflylike glow remains a mystery.” However, fellow astronaut Scott Carpenter noted frost flakes from his spacecraft, Aurora 7 on the next Mercury flight after Glenn's, and floating nearby. They shone when the Sun illuminated the flakes. He also noticed more flakes coming off the side of his spacecraft when he banged the inside.
– Activities in orbit. While allowing that The Right Stuff probably had other priorities in mind, the movie does not show Glenn doing much in orbit besides gazing out the window and talking about the aforementioned fireflies. Glenn's book shows him doing more than that: taking his blood pressure, snapping pictures of the Canaries and Sahara Desert, testing his vision, and doing exercises with a bungee cord to compare his readings to previous ones taken on the ground.
– Lights on in Perth and Rockingham, Australia. Glenn and a ground station in Australia chat about the residents of Rockingham and Perth turning on their lights for him. This actually did happen (and it happened again when Glenn returned to space in 1998.)
– Decision to bring Glenn down after three orbits. The movie accurately says Glenn was gone for at least seven orbits, but then shows Glenn being confused when he's told to come down after only three. Glenn contradicts that directly in his account: “The mission was planned for three orbits, but it meant that I could go for at least seven if I had to.”
– Heat shield threat. The movie shows Mission Control grappling with a signal indication that the landing bag deployed, which implies that the heat shield might have cut loose prematurely. They recommend Glenn refrain from removing a retrorocket package that usually was jettisoned after the rockets fire for re-entry, and keep it on the spacecraft to hold the heat shield on. Glenn talks at length about the situation in his book, and expresses frustration that he didn't receive information quickly: “I was irritated by the cat-and-mouse game they were playing with the information.” It turned out to be a false alarm.
– Humming. Glenn hums a lot in the movie during the re-entry, especially as the gravity forces build up on him. The astronaut makes no mention of doing so in his book. Long-standing New York Times space journalist John Noble Wilford unequivocally stated the movie was wrong: “Mr. Glenn did not hum ”The Battle Hymn of the Republic” during re-entry,” he wrote in a 1983 review of the movie.
SNIP, SNIP
CRISPR, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is a powerful genetic editing tool. It has been used to cure mice of sickle cell disease, fight cancer, and could someday help end Malaria. CRISPR has the potential to cure virtually any disease that is the product of mutations, such as diabetes or Alzheimer's. CRISPR, together with Cas9 (which helps it target a specific set of nucleotides to replace), can slice through DNA with ease and restructure it to fix what's causing a genetic disorder.
But CRISPR isn't just for humans or animals – it can be used on any living organism, including plants.
Geneticists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, for example, have discovered that we can restructure wheat genes to make them immune to powdery mildew. This could eliminate the need to use chemical compounds to control disease in crops. The challenge, according to MIT Technology Review, was that this is particularly tough to do in wheat because the plant has a hexaploid genome. The plant has three similar copies of most of its genes, thus, multiple genes must be disabled for the wheat to become resistant. Thanks to CRISPR, the scientists were able to change what's genetic make-up without inserting foreign genes.
A New Weapon
Another example comes from researchers at Abdullah University of Science and Technology's Center for Desert Agriculture. The team successfully gave tomatoes full immunity against the yellow leaf curl virus. Based on the reported results, “I believe that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be extensively applied as a new weapon at a molecular level to protect plants from DNA viruses,” Jianwei Zhang of the University of Arizona and the Arizona Genomics Institute, who was not involved in the work, explained.
According to historian, professor of history, and CNN contributor, Douglas Brinkley, 10-15% of President Donald Trump's voter base is composed of KKK, white nationalists, and “alt-right” figures.
Brinkley described a portion of Trump's support base a “hate community” when teed up by CNN's Ana Cabrera. Partial transcript below:
CABRERA: And yet this president has gone after political foes, members of his own party, even members of his own cabinet; calling them losers, cry-babies, pathetic, cowards, quitters. So, in that sense, is it surprising that he doesn't go after the KKK and white nationalists in the same way? BRINKLEY: It's abhorrent, but I don't think it's surprising. He has seemed to never want to cross swords with the alt-right, they promote this kind of hate speech. And he just, it feels that this is part of that, you know, maybe it's 15 percent, 10 percent of his base that adheres to a kind of neo-confederate line, that likes the Confederate Flag, that celebrates Robert E. Lee, and he sees those as white votes that he won last time with and is gonna need again, so he tends to become very weak tea – water things down – so as not to make enemies with that kind of hate community.

MELAKA: A former mosque chairman pleaded not guilty in the Ayer Keroh Sessions Court here today to a charge of cheating committee members of the Al-Hamideen Mosque in connection with the sale of endowment land belonging to the mosque.
Moktar Ali, 61, a liaison officer at the Melaka Development Corporation, was charged with cheating the Al-Hamideen Mosque committee members by deceiving them into agreeing to sell the land to one Yong Lang Yeow, 66, for RM140,000.
He was alleged to have convinced the committee members that the mosque was facing serious financial problems, including debts in quit rent, which he knew was not true as the mosque had sufficient funds.
The offence was allegedly committed at the Al-Hamideen Mosque, Km1, Kampung Bukit Cina here between December 2005 and January 2006.
The charge, under Section 420 of the Penal Code, provides an imprisonment for up to 10 years and whipping, as well as a fine upon conviction.
Deputy public prosecutor Nur Laila Mohamed Nazil offered bail at RM50,000 in one surety. However, lawyer Sulaiman Harmain Shah, representing Moktar, said his client had a wife and school-going children to support.
Judge Meor Sulaiman Ahmad Tarmizi then set bail at RM15,000 in one surety and fixed Aug 9 for mention.
The 2014 Major League Baseball off=season has been nothing less than eventful. Record deals and entire team swaps are only but a few points thus far. So what exactly is left? A whole lot. With the Cubs signing of one of the biggest free agents this year in Jon Lester, things just got a thousand times more interesting. In an agent's world, the $155 million Lester deal created leverage in some way or another for star pitchers Max Scherzer and Jaime Shields. Out of these three tremendous arms, Scherzer has the stats and hardware to prove his worth as the best starting pitcher in this year's free agent crop. A Cy-Young award winner who nearly had back-to-back 20 win seasons, Scherzer is a big time gun, but is he worth $200 million? The lavishly notorious offer made by Scott Boras this year can possibly put James Shields in an even better spot for a big-time signing.
Free Agent Head to Head: Scherzer v. Shields
There is no doubt in anyone's mind that if these two pitchers were to ask for identical deals, that Scherzer would be the first to sign. Nonetheless let's take a glance at the numbers to get the inside look on how these pitchers sum up head-to-head.
Including the postseason, James Shields has thrown a career total of 30,444 pitches with 1,999.2 innings pitched which adds up to 15.456 pitches per inning. Max Scherzer's career line sums up to 21,930 pitches thrown while tossing 1,302.0 innings to equal 16.843 pitches per inning. With nearly 700 more innings thrown than Scherzer, James Shields has proven his ability to perform efficiently per inning throughout his career.
Another stat to take notice upon is velocity. Scherzer does out throw Shields with a 95 mile per hour fastball but since 2011, Shields velocity has increased by 1.6 mph according to FanGraphs.com. Although Shields is 32 years old, his exponential increase in fastball velocity combined with his durable reputation as pitcher offers teams a less expensive alternative to Scherzer who is seeking a huge amount for his talent.
In reality what it comes down to is what kind of pitcher does an organization need. Is it a team like the Diamondbacks who are desperate for an all-star ace? Or teams like San Francisco and St. Louis who just need a strong dependable top of the rotation guy. I'm sure all 30 teams would love to put Scherzer on their staff but when General Managers are so desperately trying to manage payrolls and plan for the future, Shields looks like more of a viable option. Other tangibles to look into are what type of pitchers these two men are. Scherzer who is a powerful strikeout pitcher also generates plenty of fly balls, better suited for a bigger park. In contrast, Shields relies on his change up and splitter to get ground ball outs and the occasional strikeout.
Others might argue that the most important factor to look into is a player's postseason performance. Both pitchers have just about equal innings pitched and games played in their post season career. Although Scherzer had a rough outing in his last appearance in the 2014 playoffs he holds a 3.73 career postseason ERA compared to Shields' 5.46 ERA. It seems as though James Shields numbers leading up to the fall classic deteriorate which does effect his market potential, but judging off Kansas City's run last year, Shields was a key reason why they even reached the playoffs to begin with. These are also the ultimate in small sample sizes, and if one subscribes to the Sabrmetric approach that there is no such thing as “clutch”, focusing on these post-season stats may be foolhardy.
Max Scherzer may be younger and so far a tad more consistent, but James Shields has him beat in one of the most important categories in sports; leadership. This quality can not be measured by numbers or computers and is a character trait that only few possess to the extent that Shields does. All reports are that James Shields has been nothing but a positive force in the clubhouse dating back to his days in Tampa and it doesn't look like he is stopping anytime soon. After singing with the Royals in 2013, Shields immediately created a winning culture with his high energy and charismatic presence. He took the helm of young small market pitching staffs in Tampa and in Kansas City and lead both teams to World Series appearances. Every franchise foams at the mouth for a guy like Shields who is a presence in the locker room and ensures that all their players never lose their drive or motivation. The fire and intensity that Shields creates in himself and teammates is an imperceptible trait that has given him respect around the league. However the question that needs to be asked is, “Does this translate to more wins for the team that signs Shields when he is not on the mound?” Numerous studies have been done, and the numbers seem to suggest this leadership characteristic is a more false narrative than effect on wins and losses. Yet, just like Scherzer's supposed clutch ability it will be brought up.
At the end of the day though, it comes down to value for the money. The expensive price tag on Scherzer has to have brought some general managers to the realization that other options on the market may be a smarter move. Scherzer is the top dog but Shields is nothing short of a reliable fall back option for just about half the price. Both pitchers have their pros and cons but at the end of the day teams seeking a pitcher must pick their poison; one of the best right-handers in the league who is outrageously expensive, or a dependable workhorse who can lead a team to the postseason. It may be a very quiet off season for these two thus far, but look for their signing to immediately effect next year's World Series favorites.

Alfredo Despaigne said Thursday he was ready to play and eager to contribute to the Chiba Lotte Marines, who recently acquired the slugging Cuba international.
“Because I'm being given this chance, I want to do my best to contribute,” he told a news conference at the Marines' home park, QVC Marine Field.
The 175-cm, 104-kg Despaigne has hit 220 career home runs and is a three-time MVP in Cuba's domestic league, the Serie Nacional. He is set to receive ¥70 million for the remainder of the season.
“I hit the ball hard to all fields,” he said. “I think I'll be able to react and that it won't take time to adjust.”
He will take pregame practice with the first team on Friday at Seibu Dome although his schedule after that has yet to be decided.
Stephen Colbert returned to "The Report" last night after a brief vacation and didn't waste any time before jumping into Glenn Beck's August 28 "Restoring Honor" rally. For starters, just how many people attended? A scientific estimate said 87,000, but conservative pundits have thrown around numbers ranging from "several hundred thousand" to "a million," probably because, as Colbert pointed out, "I don't think people at that rally are interested in science."
So how did the number of people mysteriously multiply at Beck's rally? According to Beck, God had an influence, as exemplified by a flock of geese that flew over the mall the minute the rally started. "What are the odds of a flock goose taking flight at the exact moment tens of thousands of people start clapping their hands?" Colbert asked.
But enough about exaggerated numbers and geese. Colbert then got down to brass tacks and addressed the recent online petition to have him host a "Truthiness Rally" to counteract Beck's at the Lincoln Memorial.
"Look nation, I get it," Colbert said. "But you're petitioning the wrong person. Glenn proved only God decides rallies." So, to get a Godly opinion on whether or not he should go through with it, Colbert consulted his own prophetic goose, "Geese Witherspoon."
Whether or not Colbert will hold the rally is still up in the air, but he did announce that he will be making an announcement at some later date, due to Stewart making similarly vague remarks previously on his show. What will both fake pundits announce and when? Perhaps a collaborative plan for a "Truthiness Rally?" For now we can only wonder.

The 63rd Academy Awards ceremony, organized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), took place on March 25, 1991, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles beginning at 6:00 p.m. PST / 9:00 p.m. EST. During the ceremony, Academy Awards (commonly referred to as the Oscars) were presented in 23 categories. The ceremony, which was televised in the United States on ABC, was produced by Gil Cates and directed by Jeff Margolis.[2] Actor Billy Crystal hosted for the second consecutive year.[3] Three weeks earlier in a ceremony held at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California on March 2, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Geena Davis.[4]
Dances with Wolves won seven awards including Best Picture.[5] Other winners included Dick Tracy with three awards, Ghost with two awards, and American Dream, Creature Comforts, Cyrano de Bergerac, Days of Waiting, Goodfellas, The Hunt for Red October, Journey of Hope, The Lunch Date, Misery, Reversal of Fortune, and Total Recall with one. The telecast garnered nearly 43 million viewers in the United States.
Winners and nominees [ edit ]
The nominees for the 63rd Academy Awards were announced on February 13, 1991, at 5:38 a.m. PST (13:38 UTC) at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Karl Malden, president of the Academy, and actor Denzel Washington.[6] Dances with Wolves led the nominations with twelve total; Dick Tracy and The Godfather Part III tied for second with seven each.[7][8]
The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 25, 1991.[9] Kevin Costner became the fifth person to earn the Best Director Award for his directorial debut and to earn nominations for Best Actor and Best Director for the same film.[10][11] Best Supporting Actress winner Whoopi Goldberg was the second African American woman to win an award.

Ceremony information [ edit ]
Riding on the critical praise from last year's ceremony, the Academy rehired former film producer and former Directors Guild of America president Gilbert Cates to oversee production of the Oscar ceremony for the second straight time.[21] Two months before the awards gala, Cates selected actor and comedian Billy Crystal to host the show for the second consecutive year.[22] In a statement released by AMPAS, Crystal joked, "It's a great honor, and I hope to bring the show in under nine hours."[22]
As with the last year's theme of "Around the World in 3 1/2 Hours," Cates centered the show around a theme. He christened the ceremony with the theme "100 Years of Film" in celebration to the centennial of the development of both the kinetoscope by Thomas Edison and celluloid film by Eastman Kodak.[23] In tandem with the theme, the show featured an ambitious opening segment. Actor Michael Caine introduced the segment live via satellite from the Salon Indien du Grand Café in Paris, where the short film L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat made its debut in 1895.[24] After a brief clip of the film, the show cut back to the Shrine Auditorium stage where actress Jasmine Guy and other dancers performed whilst a montage of film clips were projected in the background.[25] Filmmaker Chuck Workman filmed a vignette featuring actors such as Sally Field, Andy García, and Anjelica Huston discussing the first movie he or she watched.[26]
Several other people participated in the production of the ceremony. Film composer and musician Bill Conti served as musical director for the ceremony.[27] Dancer Debbie Allen choreographed a dancer number showcasing the Best Original Score nominees.[28] Despite losing eight members of her band in a plane crash, a visibly emotional Reba McEntire performed the Best Original Song nominee "I'm Checkin' Out" from the film Postcards from the Edge.[29] At the beginning of the ceremony, wrangler Lisa Brown escorted host Crystal, and Beechnut, a horse that was prominently featured in the upcoming film City Slickers.[30]
Box office performance of nominees [ edit ]
At the time of the nominations announcement on February 12, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $458.2 million with an average of $41 million per film.[31] Ghost was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $213.5 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by Dances with Wolves ($104.3 million), The Godfather Part III ($62.5 million), Goodfellas ($41 million), and finally Awakenings ($36.7 million).[31]
Of the top 50 highest-grossing films of the year, 51 nominations went to 12 films on the list. Only Ghost (2nd), Pretty Woman (3rd), Dances with Wolves (8th), Dick Tracy (9th), The Godfather Part III (17th), Goodfellas (30th), and Awakenings (34th) were nominated for Best Picture, directing, acting or screenwriting. The other top 50 box office hits that earned the nominations were Home Alone (1st), The Hunt for Red October (5th), Total Recall (6th), Days of Thunder (12th), and Edward Scissorhands (22nd).[32]
Critical reviews [ edit ]
The show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Rick DuBrow of the Los Angeles Times wrote, "It was a long day's journey into night for Oscar, one of the most effective sleeping pills of the year." He also added that while host Crystal started out strong, his jokes fell flat as the night progressed.[33] The Washington Post television critic Tom Shales noted that Crystal, "followed many gags by instantly rating the reaction of the audience, as if it were up to them to please him instead of the other way around." In addition, he commented, "The Oscars seemed more of a fizzle than usual this year."[34] Columnist Dan Craft of The Pantagraph remarked, "The Oscar show has become innocuously hip and yuppified. Kitsch and nostalgia have given way to efficiency and upward mobility. Everyone is tiresomely well-behaved and, worse, well-dressed." He also commented that host Crystal's insider showbiz jokes fell flat and were confusing to television audiences.[35]
Other media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Columnist Harold Schindler of The Salt Lake Tribune wrote, "Billy Crystal kept things moving Monday night in such a manner that the extra quarter-hour was scarcely noticeable." He also said of the telecast's theme of film history, "The Academy used its film library to excellent advantage."[36] Film critic Leonard Maltin remarked, "Emotions ran high and they gave us all a chance to feel vicariously what it might be like to win this kind of award...good guys finishing first and the part of Hollywood we like best, a happy ending."[25] Orlando Sentinel film critic Jay Boyar complimented Crystal for invigorating the gala noting that his "clever remarks at the academy's 63rd annual awards presentation struck an entertaining balance between inside-Hollywood quips and general-audience jests."[37]
Ratings and reception [ edit ]
The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 42.7 million people over its length, which was a 6% increase from the previous year's ceremony.[38] An estimated 76 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards.[39] The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 28.4% of households watching over a 48 share.[40] It was the most watched Oscars telecast since the 56th ceremony held in 1984.[41]
In July 1991, the ceremony presentation received nine nominations at the 43rd Primetime Emmys.[42] The following month, the ceremony won three of those nominations for Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Program (Gil Cates), Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program (Billy Crystal), and Outstanding Writing for a Variety or Music Program (Hal Kanter, Buz Kohan, Billy Crystal, David Steinberg, Bruce Vilanch, and Robert Wuhl).[43]

What states other than New Jersey do not allow customers to pump their own gas at gas stations?
The Answer:
New Jersey and Oregon are the only U.S. states that currently ban self-service gas stations.
The purpose of these laws was to protect consumers and gas station owners from costly, and possibly deadly, accidents. Better education and improved technology, however, have made pumping gas much safer and easier for consumers over the last 50 years. Since the 1970s, self-service gas stations have grown in popularity.
The New Jersey law was enacted in 1949 and the Oregon law in 1951. Each statute has stood up to several challenges in those two states.
Disabled motorists are most interested in seeing such laws survive. For those motorists with a disability, pumping gas is not an option and they depend on the employees of full-service stations.
Despite requirements outlined in the Americans with Disabilities Act, many self-service stations do not provide a full-service option for disabled drivers, nor provide those services at self-service rates.

OTTAWA — A leaders' summit and signing ceremony for Canada's free trade agreement with Europe, scheduled for next week, will be cancelled if the European Union can't convince the Belgian region of Wallonia to sign on by Friday — leaving the deal Ottawa has laboured over for seven years in limbo.
Proponents of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement were holding their breath as European trade ministers were expected to finalize support for CETA Tuesday.
Canadian officials were hoping for a done deal, to be signed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Brussels next week and with implementation to begin next year.
CETA's supporters say it will increase bilateral trade by 20 per cent and boost the EU economy by 12 billion euros ($17.2 billion).
But Belgian politics intervened. Last week, Wallonia, a French-speaking region (population: 3.6 million) voted against CETA, largely over concerns its farmers would be adversely affected.
Despite a visit from Canadian negotiator and former trade minister Pierre Pettigrew on the weekend, the region's prime minister, Paul Magnette, dug in his heels, insisting Tuesday the blockade will continue.
The EU has told Belgium it needs an answer by Friday. But Magnette said the Walloons' democratic process is “incompatible” with that schedule, and there are still “too many problems” with the deal, according to Belgian news reports.
But International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland said she remained “cautiously optimistic.”
Explaining she's in constant touch with her European counterparts, she said, “My BlackBerry froze this morning, and I think it's because it had so much incoming traffic.”
Freeland argues Canada “has done its job” on CETA, including securing “strong support” from Germany and Austria, which were initially reluctant. It has also added an impartial “investment court” mechanism to settle disputes between companies and states, one of the sticking points in negotiations with the Conservative government.
Canada and the European Commission are also finalizing a joint declaration interpreting some of the more controversial elements of the trade deal.
“We appreciate that European politics is complicated,” Freeland said. “This is ultimately a question of whether Europe can summon the will to act in the international arena.”
If it can't manage a deal “with a country like Canada, this will send a clear and unfortunate signal,” her press secretary, Alex Lawrence, said in an email.
Peter Ziga, Slovakia's economy minister, who chaired the ministerial meeting Tuesday, has said, “If we don't agree with Canada, with whom will we agree?”
CETA is seen as an opportunity for Europe to show it can negotiate trade agreements despite a wave of protectionism sweeping across the West. Some British politicians also view it as a model for post-Brexit trade relations with the EU.
But no one will be lining up for trade negotiations with Europe after what Canada has gone through, said Jason Langrish, executive director of the Canada Europe Roundtable for Business.
“It's disappointing. … It just shows that Europe's a mess,” he said, adding negotiators have addressed Wallonia's concerns “time and time again … But by no means does it mean that CETA is dead.”
Though Wallonia's objections could be a bargaining chip as Belgium plans its next federal budget, they are a rallying point for those wary of international trade deals.
European news outlets featured photos of defiant Greenpeace activists who maintain that CETA is a “Trojan horse” for a future deal with the United States. Some advocacy groups in Canada, including the Council of Canadians, continued to express concerns over provisions in the agreement.
As tensions seemed to rise Tuesday, political circles in Canada and Europe briefly went aflutter over a fake flipping the bird.
The Belgian foreign minister's Twitter account posted a meme featuring prime minister Stephen Harper and a colourful insult to Canada. But a foreign ministry spokesman told the National Post the message was not authentic and the account had been hacked.
But concerns over Wallonia's veto power and its leader's defiance persist.
Though the feeling among Canadian observers is that a deal will still come about, Langrish said, the Walloons are capable of killing next week's summit.
“Will the Europeans be able to put on a show with some class and some showmanship?” Langrish asked. “Or are they going to limp this thing across the finish line?”

Well, I know that some of you may disagree with me here, but here is my take on this news:
Carnegie probably chose to bow out because the competition in the field of high-quality, accurate dinosaur toy figures has expanded significantly in the past 5 years or so, and that no doubt lowered their profit margin significantly.
Collecta vaulted to #1 in terms of both volume and quality in just 7 years or so, Battat is being re-introduced, and the Wild Safari line has also come to the front, vaulting over its older sibling thanks to the cutting-edge talents of Doug Watson.
Not to mention the high-quality competition from Papo and even that recently introduced Papo-look-alike "is it a toy or a statue" company that seems to use dubious propaganda methods to draw attention to its wares.
Carnegie has been stagnating for the better part of a decade, producing sculpts in varying scales, of varying quality, thus satisfying no one, and undoubtedly that took a toll on the bottom line.
I was vilified numerous times over the years whenever I dared to question the dinosaur-sculpting talents of Carnegie's sculptor. Every excuse in the book was made for the repeated shortcomings in their theropod figures, but the fact of the matter is that, compared to the competition, the accuracy of Carnegie's sculpts was tested over the past 6-7 years and has - apparently - been found to be wanting.
Being known as "THE" dino-toy brand for so many years probably lulled some folks into a false sense of security.
In any event, It's nothing more than basic business cycle stuff. Evolution, competition, survival of the fittest. Carnegie now goes the way of Bullyland and Schleich. Such is life.
Better to enjoy the plethora of first rate figures coming out from a half-dozen companies, than mourn the passing of a *pun intended* DINOSAUR.

Fifty-five years after the notorious failure of an Israeli sabotage operation in Egypt, Military Intelligence has finally gotten around to figuring out what went wrong. The answer? Pretty much everything.
An educational presentation about the 1954 Lavon affair prepared by the MI history and heritage division found that MI had not sufficiently trained the members of the sabotage unit, who were mostly amateurs and included several Egyptian Jews, and had failed to give them cover stories, plan escape routes or otherwise plan for the possibility that they would be caught.
"First and foremost, this is the story of the failure of Military Intelligence, starting with the choice of targets for the network's sabotage operations, the operational planning and the superficial and sloppy training, and ending with the method of execution, which totally failed to carry out the pointless mission, which had no chance of reaching the strategic goal its operators had set: the cancellation of the planned British evacuation of the Suez Canal," stated the MI analysis.
The Lavon affair - also known locally as esek habish, "the rotten business" - was a plan to discredit Egypt's government, then headed by Gamal Abdel Nasser, by bombing theaters, post offices and U.S. and British institutions, and making it seem as though Egypt was behind the bombings. The thinking in Israel at the time was that if the British were to give up control of the Suez Canal, it would be left in Egypt's hands, putting Cairo in a better position to exert pressure on Israel.
The agents were told "to undermine the West's trust in the [Egyptian] government by causing public insecurity" while concealing Israel's role in the sabotage.
However, the agents were caught. One committed suicide in prison, two were hanged and four got long prison terms.
Only in 1968 were the prisoners exchanged for Egyptian POWs - a time lag the MI analysis attributes to internal bickering and a preoccupation with assigning blame.

"The intelligence community heads' evasion of responsibility for the operation, like the internal preoccupation with the question of who among the leaders of the political establishment gave the order, led to the fact that over many years, no effort was made to get the 'rotten affair' prisoners released," the analysis found.
Code-named Operation Susannah, the incident led to the dismissal of Binyamin Gibli, the MI chief at the time, and the resignations of then-defense minister Pinhas Lavon and ultimately, the prime minister, David Ben-Gurion. In the years after the incident came to light, public debate centered around the question of who gave the order for the operation to go forward.
The educational presentation, which met with harsh criticism when it was distributed to the MI units in September, states that although at least six external committees investigated the incident, the mistakes had never before been investigated and analyzed within MI, the institution responsible for the operation.

New languages are fun, but often they're 'one trick > ponies' (like Snobol in the 60s was very good at string matching, but > it lost its niche eventually) [Warning: this message is almost entirely off topic.] There is nothing new under the sun. Have you seen Algol 68? As you might imagine, it's an Algol variant that came out in 1968. (Which makes it older than I am.) It begat Pascal, Modula, Oberon etc and is a cousin of C. (I think it's Lua's uncle.) There's a good Wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_68 It's a bit scary. It looks *just like a modern programming language*. It's got C-like types (although to be more accurate, C has Algol-68-like types). It's got user defined polymorphic perators (with user defined precedence). Keywords and identifiers occupy different namespaces. Identifiers can contain spaces! It's got block expressions. It's got OCCAM-like concurrency (there's a par keyword for running processes in parallel and built-in support for namespaces). You can use values before you define them! Most syntax elements have a short form and a long form, where the short form is designed for single statements and the long form for multiline statements. Example: # create a new type, 'vector', of an array of reals indexed 1..3 # mode vector = [1:3] real; # now create a matrix type similarly # mode matrix = [1:3, 1:3] real; # create some vectors # vector v1 := (1, 2, 3); vector v2 := (2, 3, 4); # create an operator that works on vectors # op + = (vector a, b) vector: begin vector out; for i from lwb a to upb a do out[i] := a[i] + b[i]; od; out # value of last expression in block is value of block # end # define a matrix from our vectors matrix m := (v1, v2, v1+v2); # get a reference to one of the rows of the matrix ref vector horizontal = m[2,]; # get a reference to one of the columns of the matrix ref vector vertical = m[,2]; There are a few features I haven't seen anywhere else, such as the universal loop construct which replaces both for...next and while...end, which I've never seen anywhere else: # loop in 'for' mode for i from 1 to 10 do print(i) od # ...and in 'while' mode while i < 10 do print(i); i := i + 1; od # ...and in both! for i from 1 to 10 while checkWhetherCancelled() do print(i) od # ...just loop, no counter! to 10 do print("Ten times!") od # ...minimum syntax do print("Loop forever") od # ...maximum syntax for i from 1 by 1 to 10 while checkWhetherCancelled() do print(i) od Algol-68 has some particularly interesting pointer semantics, nicer than C's IMO. This: int i; ...is actually sugar for: ref int i = loc int; 'loc int' is an expression that returns a new integer stored on the stack. (You can also say 'heap int' to create a new integer stored on the heap.) 'ref int' creates a pointer to an int. In other words, all variables are actually pointers. Unlike C, Algol-68 has distinct operations that work on the pointer and operations that work on the value; most operators will implicitly dereference their operands. If you want to, say, compare two references to see whether they're pointing at the same thing, there is a specific 'a is b' operator for doing so. Personally I think this is much more consistent and less ugly than C (and Go's) approach, where you have to know whether you're dealing with a pointer or a scalar before you can deal with it; but for some reason it's not a concept that seems to have taken off. ... So, to get back to the point: Go vs Algol-68. TBH, I think the 41-year-old language is richer, clearer and more expressive. It's certainly missing some features, like any form of object orientation, polymorphic functions, but the overall design is much more consistent and well thought-out. In 1968 Neil Armstrong was still pootling about in orbit and integrated circuits were rockets science. Why am I able to compare a language from this era with a contemporary one on an equal basis? Because, depressingly, state-of-the-art in programming languages hasn't moved much in those 41 years. I think that it's entirely plausible that if someone were to take the Algol-68 spec, redraft it in modern terminology (types instead of modes, names instead of variables, etc), update some of the odder areas such as transput, give it a catchy Web-2.0 name and produce a decent compiler for it, then it would be heralded as the next great development in programming languages. Which is kind of depressing... - -- ┌─── ｄｇ＠ｃｏｗｌａｒｋ．ｃｏｍ ───── http://www.cowlark.com ───── │ "There is nothing in the world so dangerous --- and I mean *nothing* │ --- as a children's story that happens to be true." --- Master Li Kao, │ _The Bridge of Birds_ -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.9 (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org iEYEARECAAYFAkr8NhEACgkQf9E0noFvlzjT7wCeJ6tM6FcNlpMBx9RZOZ+ncWkO gxIAoN2sYYXwo/IkcFefMs+rg1/Rfvrz =cdpP -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
WASHINGTON -- Officials say U.S. aircraft could leave as early as Friday for the first mission to help evacuate refugees from the crisis in Libya.
Senior defense officials said Thursday that flights from Ramstein Air Base in Germany were being prepared following President Barack Obama's OK to use military planes to take home Egyptians who fled Libya and are stranded in Tunisia. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because plans have not been officially announced.
Officials had no details on when the first flight from Tunisia to Egypt will be made after the aircraft arrive in North Africa, nor on how many refugees they would eventually take to Egypt. But they say it's likely the aircraft will be U.S. Air Force C-130 cargo planes, which can hold several dozen people.
IMSA could be set to make changes to its safety car procedures, while also planning to implement a new on-board camera ID protocol in the wake of Saturday's caution-filled and controversial Mobil 1 Twelve Hours of Sebring.
The second round of the TUDOR United SportsCar Championship featured a race record-tying 11 full-course caution periods, totaling more than five hours of the around-the-clock endurance classic.
It included a final yellow for a stopped DP car with 51 minutes remaining. The caution lasted 30 minutes and set up a dash to the checkered flag for the second consecutive race.
According to IMSA's VP of Competition and Technical Regulations Scot Elkins, they were unable to alter the safety car procedure during the event itself but are exploring potential changes to the regulations to ensure increased green flag running time in the future.
“We can't just change the rules at the end, unfortunately, to make it better,” Elkins said post-race. “So we have to go through the entire pass-around procedure. That's what it takes to do that. We had a lot of cars, it's not a short track. It takes a long time.”
The current procedure, outlined in the 2014 IMSA Rulebook, allows for a shortened yellow for any safety car period within 15 minutes of the previous caution or during the last 30 minutes of the race. Neither of those criteria applied in this case.
Elkins, however, admitted there could be changes to the procedure, particularly heading into next month's 100-minute race on the streets of Long Beach.
“It's something we try to improve and try to work on every single time and every single day,” he said. “It's really critical for the next race that we've got coming up because it's such a short race at Long Beach.
“We could effectively kill the race with a really long procedure if something happens. I don't have an answer yet, but we're definitely going to work on it very, very strongly before we get to Long Beach.”
On the subject of the incorrect call made to penalize Alex Job Racing in Saturday's race, due to misidentified on-board footage, Elkins said there will also be changes to help avoid a repeat situation occurring.
“We have some places in the rulebook now,” he said, “and we're going to make it a little bit better where we actually require any car that has an in-car camera to display the car number within view of the in-car camera so we don't have a mistake like we had tonight.”
IMSA penalized the No. 22 WeatherTech Porsche 911 GT America for an alleged incident with the No. 49 Spirit of Race Ferrari, based off on-board footage that had actually come from the No. 912 Porsche North America entry instead.
The Patrick Long, Joerg Bergmeister and Michael Christensen factory Porsche went onto claim class victory in GTLM without being given a penalty, while the AJR Porsche finished finished fourth in class after serving a stop-and-hold plus 80-second penalty for contact which it did not initiate.
IMSA apologized for the mistake but made no changes to the results or points.

A government watchdog agency has agreed to a request from Democratic senators to open an inquiry into whether the Environmental Protection Agency circumvented the Trump administration's own ethics rules when hiring certain agency employees.
In August, two lawmakers, Sens. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), asked the Government Accountability Office to launch the probe. Both Democrats serve on the Senate Environment Committee, which oversees the EPA.
GAO spokesman Chuck Young confirmed that the agency will launch the inquiry but said “work won't start for a few months.”
He added, “The exact scope of what we will cover will not be determined until work gets underway.”
As a demonstration of his campaign commitment to “drain the swamp” in Washington, President Trump issued an executive order on employee ethics at the beginning of his administration in January. Under that order, executive-branch employees cannot “participate in any particular matter” on which they had lobbied in the two years before their appointment.
The senators alleged to the GAO that, among other issues, the EPA got around that order by hiring certain political appointees under a provision of the Safe Drinking Water Act that authorizes the EPA to hire up to 30 people “without regard to civil service laws.”
The senators wrote that they are concerned that such “authorities are being abused,” noting that a “a number” of political appointees in supervisory positions had been hired this way.
“The whole point of ethics laws is to give the American people confidence that the work of their government is being conducted fairly, honestly, and free from special interest sway,” Carper and Whitehouse said in a statement. “But when an agency can just ignore those rules—and congressional oversight—the result often leads to corruption and scandal.”
The EPA defended the manner in which it has filled these positions as legal.
“The authority to hire under the Safe Drinking Water Act has existed since the 1970s,” EPA spokesperson Liz Bowman wrote in an email. “EPA's hiring practices are consistent with those of previous Administrations. Everyone has received an ethics briefing, is aware of their responsibilities and is committed to serving professionally.”
The senators' request to the GAO did not name specific employees they were concerned about. But in a May letter to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt that went unanswered by the agency, Whitehouse noted that Elizabeth “Tate” Bennett, appointed to serve as deputy associate administrator of the EPA's Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations, had recently worked as a lobbyist for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, which had lobbied the agency on the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan and other issues.
At the time, Whitehouse's office wrote that it was “virtually impossible” for Bennett, given her past work, “to do her job and comply with the ethics pledge.”
Like Obama did when he entered office, Trump issued an ethics pledge for executive-branch hires ostensibly to shut the revolving door between industry and regulatory agencies, and fulfill a campaign promise.
But according to Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor and former chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, the Trump administration has granted ethics waivers and utilized legal provisions, like that in the Safe Drinking Water Act, to ensure that some appointees avoid needing to take the pledge.
“Is it illegal? No, I don't think that,” Painter said for the EPA's actions spelled out in the two senators' letter.
But, mentioning Trump's “drain the swamp” rhetoric, he added: “What they're talking and what they're doing are two different things.”

Jews around the world lit candles on Tuesday night to celebrate the first night of the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, which celebrates the triumph of the Maccabees, Jewish warriors, over Greek forces in 165 B.C.E. As the story goes, when the Maccabees rededicated the ransacked Temple, they only found enough holy oil to last for one night, but it miraculously lasted for eight nights. Today, Jews celebrate Hanukkah by lighting candles in a Menorah for eight nights, eating foods fried in oil, and producing Taylor Swift parody songs.
Rick Perry, who likely has trouble celebrating a holiday that requires him to count to eight, chose to celebrate Hanukkah in a less traditional way. On Tuesday, he released a statement comparing Hanukkah to the Boston Tea Party.
Said Perry:
“It is fitting that the first night of Chanukah falls this year on the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party. The same spirit of freedom that inspired the Maccabees to rise up against a foreign empire motivated our Founding Fathers to rebel against the Crown on that fateful night. They knew, as the Jewish people know, that the few can overcome the many, that right can defeat might, that faith can transcend persecution. No matter how vast the darkness, all it takes is one candle to spread the light. Our Republic, like the light of the ancient Menorah, has lasted longer than anyone could have predicted. America remains a beacon of hope in difficult times for the world. And Chanukah reminds us of the power of faith to sustain a nation and ensure the security of our ally, Israel.”
Perry's historical analogy is wrong on many levels. While Rick Perry may claim that the Maccabees and the Boston Tea Partiers were both fighting for freedom, they were really defending two completely different things. The Maccabees were fighting for the continued existence of the Jewish people. The Boston Tea Partiers were fighting for lower taxes.
In addition, for most people, the main lesson of the American Revolution is not that “faith can transcend persecution”–especially not faith in lower taxes. But for presidential hopeful Rick Perry, pandering knows no bounds. He was able to hit two birds with one stone with his Hanukkah statement, trying to appeal to both the right-wing modern day Tea Partiers and all of the pro-Israel interest groups.
It is too bad that Rick Perry no longer celebrates Hanukkah as he did in 2010, when he danced an impromptu Hora with Orthodox Jewish rabbis in the Capitol. Relive that glorious moment in the video below:
Happy Hanukkah, y'all!
I made this point during the Dark ZP review, in my signature frivolous style, but it's an issue that stands out pretty prominently in The Bureau, too: there's a staggeringly wide gulf between the sight of human beings in conversation and the spectacle of dialogue-tree conversation in video games. They generally have all the warmth and emotion of watching two computers on the same network pinging each other. This might seem like a small thing in the grand spectrum of dodgy video game design practices, but it's a problem I'm noticing often enough that perhaps it's worth trying to think of a better way.
One thing that gets my fuckgoat is when a dialogue tree is used as an information vending machine. This is what I was complaining about in the case of Dark: the old "Tell me more about X" "Blah blah blah X blah blah blah X blah blah blah Y" "Tell me more about Y" routine. This is about as 'telling without showing' as exposition gets. It's a larger problem I've noticed with video game dialogue that whenever something needs to be established, be it story fact or gameplay mechanic, it tends to be done in the quickest, most efficient route from A to B. Dishonored in particular was lousy with it.
Conversation is your opportunity, as a writer, to make the characters engaging. No character is engaging when they're dryly describing things, or recounting events that have happened, or recounting events that are currently happening, or recounting events that have GOT TO happen and you're the ONLY ONE who can do it to SAVE THE DAY. We human beings are creatures of emotion, and emotion is what we respond to. Emotion is all the stuff that comes across in between the facts and figures of the situation. It's the ums and the errs, the drifting around, the subtle implications of what subjects make the speaker tense, or cheerful, or depressed, and which other characters the speaker's personality clashes with. If the narration of, say, Thomas Was Alone had been restricted to exposition along the lines of "This is Thomas, he is a rectangle, and he has to get to the level exit in order to SAVE THE DAY" then I doubt Danny Wallace would've gotten that BAFTA award for his performance.
And emotion is carried fairly effectively through movement, too, which is why Bioware Face - the name I have for two characters standing stock still, facing each other, maintaining eye contact and making occasional gestures that are completely unrelated to what they're saying - seems so wooden and jarring. Wander around and fidget with the ornaments or something, for fuck's sake, just stop staring at me like you're trying to kill me with your eye beams.
The approach games like The Bureau seem to take is that the sole major function of the dialogue tree is to allow players to decide in what order they want to scarf down the exposition and to give them the option of when to stop scarfing. Fully custom-designed conversations, right? But then you get something like what the character customisation did to, say, Brink: uniform blandness with a few details changed. So in The Bureau I'd avoid the character dialogues whenever I felt I could get away with it, and then the game was stuck trying to engage me by piling adversity onto characters I knew fuck all about.
shaduzLabs – maschinIO from Mickael Le Goff on Vimeo.
Ever thought you'd play Space Invaders on your Maschine? You might.
It's rough days for people who like standalone drum machine gear. Native Instruments' Maschine is great in combination with software, but it turns into a brick when disconnected from a computer. The mighty Akai has followed suit, replacing their vaunted MPC with more accessories for your computer or iPad. This stuff is the dream of marketers: you get all-in-one hardware/software solutions. But when you want to cut the cord from your computer or go beyond the stock functionality, it's another story.
One hack promises to turn all of that around. And it's making progress.
The project is called maschinIO. And it's more than a little ambitious, as you can see in this demo video at top.
Maschine wasn't engineered to work this way. Via normal operation, its display and pads are all operated by the computer host. Without the computer connected, and without the host driver, it's a paperweight.
But that same host communication opened up a window to hacking, and developer Vincenzo Pacella decided to do just that. By listening in on the chatter between hardware and software, he could work out how to essentially speak Maschine language to the drum pad controller. Then, making Maschine operate on its own is a matter of writing a graphics library and using an Arduino to substitute for the USB host. (Yeah, easy. Okay… you might need to be a bit obsessive to embark on such a project, but it's possible.)
Of course, you'll want to test the results. And that's how Space Invaders wound up running on the Maschine hardware, powered by Arduino as USB host but with a Mac or Windows desktop nowhere in sight.
With that proof of concept in mind, a lot became possible – and so maschinIO was born. The dream:
Mac, Windows, Linux, Arduino platform support
Standalone operation
CV/gate for connecting to analog gear
Completely new application logic (which you can write yourself)
Full control over the display
With that, you can make a standalone hardware sequencer based on the Maschine hardware interface. So, for instance, that includes using Arduino for simple host mode support for sequencer operation, and outboard gear for sounds – CV and modular being one option. Another use case would be continuing to use a computer for sound, but transforming the way Maschine works as a controller (in its display and software operation). Once the custom protocol and operation are open, the limits are really what you might do with it.
The original story (with lots of background):
Hacking Maschine – how it all started
That was September. Flash forward to now-ish. Space Invaders may have been a fun demonstration of the display, but it's not terribly useful musically. Now, you get an ever-popular Euclidean music sequencer, running on Maschine's hardware and display:
Vincenzo is making good progress, even if “it's taking waaaaay longer than I expected.” (It's always the way with these things. Keep the faith, Mickael!)
Compatibility is looking good, too: Linux on top of Mac and Windows communication, plus MK1 (the monochromatic early models) as well as MK2 hardware support.
Those of you who are interested in doing this sort of hack, lots of interesting tidbits in his updated story from Friday:
What happened to maschinIO?
For everyone else, I think you'll agree this is a tantalizing display of what Maschine might be. And we'll be waiting with eager anticipation to see when we'll get our hands on this ourselves. Having Maschine take on a second life away from the computer sounds fine indeed.

We previewed the NFC West on our latest "Around The League Podcast." Some big-picture thoughts are below. We've already previewed the AFC East, AFC North, AFC South, AFC West, NFC East, NFC North and NFC South.
Seahawks unanimous pick to take division crown
Last year, my choice of Seattle as division champ looked bold. (And incorrect.) This year, the Seahawks are the chalk choice. All four Around The League writers picked Pete Carroll's crew to win the division, with Dan Hanzus taking the Seahawks to win the Super Bowl and Marc Sessler picking them to win the NFC.
It's amazing that the loss of Percy Harvin hasn't dimmed our projections, but this is a complete team. Russell Wilson is only going to get better; he can make Golden Tate into a star. The Seahawks have the best running back group in the NFL. The pass rush is very deep, and the secondary is littered with Pro Bowl players.
Carroll and general manager John Schneider have built to this moment for four years. It's their time.
Small decline projected for 49ers
All four of us had San Francisco in the playoffs as a wild-card team. But three of us had the 49ers falling to 10-6, a decent drop after they lost just seven games in the last two seasons combined.
A decline would be surprising in one sense because the team gets a full season of Colin Kaepernick at quarterback. But it makes sense when you consider Kaepernick's wide receiver crew and the general malaise of the 49ers' defense down the stretch last season.
The 49ers are smarter than most teams. They think differently and aren't afraid to say so. They also have a coach who finds motivation in the smallest of slights. Perhaps all the Seahawks hype will fire them up.
Tough spot for rising Rams team
Sessler chose St. Louis as a wild-card team at 9-7. I thought that would be a more trendy pick heading into this season, but playing in the NFC West makes it difficult. The Rams lost only one game in the division last season, but that's very unlikely to happen again. They also have to face the NFC South, meaning the two best divisions in football face off in the regular season. (Sorry, NFC North.)
It's also worth wondering if expectations for the Rams' offensive talent is too high. It's a very young group that will have to improve a great deal just to be average.
Cardinals aren't talent poor
Arizona has a brand-new coach, general manager and coordinators, and yet this doesn't feel like a rebuilding team. Carson Palmer is better than he's given credit for and certainly is a "win-now" option rather than a long-term plan. Larry Fitzgerald, Michael Floyd and Andre Roberts help form a talented wide receiver group. On defense, Arizona boasts Pro Bowl talent like Patrick Peterson, Calais Campbell, Darnell Dockett and soon-to-be suspended Daryl Washington.
Like the Rams, the Cardinals have an uphill battle because of their schedule. This figures to be a dangerous team. Throw them in the AFC South, and they'd have a better chance as a surprise playoff team.

Sweden just woke up. (Sort of.) Per a report at the Washington Post, Sweden has closed her doors to migrants. (Sort of.) Unfortunately, better-late-than-never may not apply in this case.
…a country that prides itself on doing the right thing seemed to rally as one to embrace refugees fleeing for their lives. But after taking in more asylum seekers per capita than any other nation in Europe, Sweden's welcome mat now lies in tatters…the center-left government is deploying extraordinary new border controls and slashing benefits in an unmistakable signal to refugees contemplating the long trek to Sweden in the new year: Stay out.
As heartbreaking as that little boy's fate was, it was sickening that the photo was, and still is, so hyped when non-Muslims who die at the hands of Islamic terrorists hardly cause a ripple. Why doesn't the world spring into action against Islamic supremacy as Christians, Jews, Hindus and other non-Muslims are beheaded, crucified, enslaved, tortured, burned alive, drowned, knifed, shot, raped, and crushed, among other unthinkable forms of evil? The urge to embrace the Muslim victim while ignoring the Muslim supremacist is as self-destructive as it gets.
As for Sweden's pride in “doing the right thing,” I can only shake my head. Apparently national “pride” is dead and “doing the right thing” excludes self-preservation. As for the “unmistakable signal” to invaders to stay out, wouldn't border security be more effective? Then again, in our brave new world border security has taken on an aura of some wild and crazy notion that only a lunatic would entertain. Go figure.
Meanwhile, Sweden's idea of “stay out” isn't as strong as it sounds. “Stay out” is weaker than taking measures to ensure people don't get in. And then there's this:
Instead of a permanent home in Sweden, new arrivals will be eligible only for a temporary stay of between one and three years, with the government vowing to accept no more than the minimum number of refugees required under European Union law. Rules for bringing family members to Sweden will become much tighter. …The most tangible evidence of change, meanwhile, can already be seen in the ID checks aboard the trains, buses and ferries that connect Sweden with its southern neighbors, Denmark and Germany.
So Sweden will continue to admit colonizers and will allow them to stay for up to three years. Not exactly “stay out.” And good luck finding them and deporting them after their time is up. (See here, here, and here.) Not to mention dealing with the havoc they will continue to wreak on Swedish society during the one-to-three years they are allowed to stay. As for tightening rules for bringing family members, why not just pass legislation that makes it so no one can bring a single family member? (If the country is serious about deporting them after a maximum of three years, this makes sense from a practical perspective, as well.)
And then there are the newly implemented ID checks. It's a bit late to begin checking ID don't you think? And also a bit pointless since so many have forged documents.
Alas, apparently this is all do-the-right-thing Sweden can muster. Not only are these efforts weaker than they should be, but those in positions of authority still don't seem to understand the nature of the threat.
In ever-polite, welcoming and humanitarian-minded Sweden, the new policies have triggered intense soul-searching. Announcing the changes in November, the deputy prime minister choked back tears. Even those charged with implementing the new restrictions do so with great ambivalence. “I have everything. They've left everything,” said Anna Loenn, a police officer who led the checks at the first station on the Swedish side of the Oresund Bridge one recent evening. “It's heartbreaking what's happening.” Yet authorities say the changes were necessary, both for security reasons and to stem a flow of arrivals that was simply unsustainable.
The nation is approaching this from a sustainability viewpoint with respect to its ability to care for invaders instead of facing the reality of how these colonizers will transform their civilized society into something unrecognizable. The country is already far along that deadly road. When one in four Swedish women will be raped and the vast majority of those rapists are Muslim men, when life for Jews is reverting back to a time in Europe's history when Hitler rose to power, and when Swedes know they're on their own with little-to-no government protection against marauding Muslims driving crime rates through the roof, Sweden is no longer what it once was. Instead, it is a nation that is becoming Islamicized. (See here, here, here, here, here, and here.)
“We can handle the 160,000 people who came this year. But we can't handle it if there are another 160,000 people next year,” Johansson said, … “Our whole asylum system would break down.” The system very nearly did break down in the fall. With arrivals outpacing the government's ability to find shelter…. “We always take great pride in accommodating people in a dignified way,” said Mikael Ribbenvik, director of operations for the Migration Board, the government body in charge of caring for asylum seekers. “But we had to report on several occasions that we just couldn't handle the situation.”
The asylum system will break down. That's the concern. How about the fact that the nation is breaking down? Once again we see Sweden assessing her ability to care for invaders rather than confronting the cultural impact of importing hordes of Muslims from the Islamic world.
To the Swedish police officer interviewed in the WaPo article, who lamented “I have everything. They've left everything”: Don't worry. It will all be straightened out in due time as Swedes lose their country and colonizers transplant whole communities from Islamic countries. Soon enough Swedes will have nothing and the “new arrivals” will have everything. I can see the welcome banners at the airport now. “Welcome to the Caliphate!” Being Europe's first country to join will be a special source of pride I'm sure.
Concern is growing among Knoxville community groups about the tie for second place in the district four city council primary race.
Harry Tindell and Amelia Parker tied for second in the district four race with 488 votes a piece.
Lauren Rider won a majority of votes in district 4, but only the top two candidates move on to the general election in November.
Wednesday night, the Knoxville City Council will meet to decide how to break the tie between Tindell and Parker.
According to a statement from Mayor Madeline Rogero, city council is responsible for either casting the deciding vote or calling for a run-off election under state law. However, Rogero's statement goes on to say that due to timing of the primary and general elections, there is not time to schedule a run-off election to break the tie in district four.
This process is causing some concern among groups like the "2017 Knoxville City Council Movement."
"Our basic stance is that voters should decide the outcomes of elections," Alex Fields, a member of the movement, said. "The main thing is that we want the city council to proactively explore ways that this could be resolved."

Candidate Harry Tindell said he will accept the process city council decides to utilize to break the tie.
"I think that, you know, I did the best job I can, and now it's in somebody else's hands," Tindell said. "I'll let them make that decision."
However, candidate Amelia Parker said she questions whether the process needs to move as quickly.
"Are there other options the city council could pursue to put this election back in the hands of voters?" Parker added.
Nick Della Volpe, the current councilman for District 4, wrote on his Facebook page that it is a city council's responsibility under law to decide how to break the tie.
He wrote, "Council actions on the tiebreaker will be as required by state law and the city charter as interpreted and advised to us by the election commission and the city lawyers -- Knoxville's charter says two candidates will move on to the city-wide general election coming up in November. The charter is adopted by the people and cannot be changed unilaterally by council."
The city saw relatively strong turnout last month in the non-mayoral primary election, and community groups question whether a tiebreaker decision by city council will leave voters feeling disenfranchised.
Tory Mills, a member of the 2017 Knoxville City Council Movement, said, "We think it's important to continue that process and continue to give people a platform to lift up their voices and to vote for candidates that they want to see elected."
Knoxville Mayor Madeline Rogero's statement echoed that sentiment saying, "...for future elections, I believe the laws should be changed so that voters have the final say. I have spoken with Vice Mayor Duane Grieve, and he agrees. My staff and I are exploring options that could require changes to both state law and the City Charter. Although tie votes are extremely rare, the current circumstances have highlighted the inadequacy of existing law."
City council will meet to decide how to break the tie at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday, September 6th at the City-County Building.
DETROIT – Sedrick Staten's family came here from Alabama in 1969. He's been driving a Detroit school bus for 18 years. A member of Teamsters Local 214, his livelihood is being threatened because of the school privatization efforts of Robert Bobb, emergency financial manager of Detroit Public Schools, appointed by Gov. Jennifer Granholm.
Staten's story is moving. “I've been a loyal Detroit public school person all my life,” he said. “My mother was a custodian for 30 years, my brothers, my sisters, my whole family have always been affiliated with Detroit public schools. If I lose my job, it's going to make me think about moving out of Detroit. My kids love their schools. But if Daddy doesn't have a job, what am I supposed to do?”
Staten joined hundreds of other school workers, many with similar stories, at a rally at Bobb's office.
Rose Gant is a secretary at Webster Elementary School, and a member of the Detroit Association of Educational Office Employees, an affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers. She is fighting hard against the drastic cuts Bobb is pushing. “He wants us to take pay cuts, insurance cuts and retirement cuts,” Gant said. “We cannot get enough supplies in the buildings.” Standing outside the school system's administrative offices, Gant said the money should be spent in the schools instead of “down here.”
A special education aide who has worked for 10 years at the Mae C. Jemison School said Bobb wants her and her coworkers to take a 10 percent pay cut. “We don't make any money now and he's trying to take more,” she said. “It's going to be harder, much harder if they take more and give us less.”
Beth Thoreson, from AFT Michigan, said Bobb has threatened to privatize office employees, the first people anybody sees when coming into a school. “The people who are rallying today are the people that hold the whole school system together – the teachers wouldn't be able to do their job if it weren't for them,” she said.
“To outsource those jobs is to take away their ability to live in the city. Most of them do, and their kids go to school here,” Thoreson said. The typical school office employee has worked on the job for 15 years and earns $25,000.
Privatization is not the answer because in the long run it doesn't save money, she said. “To privatize the jobs of people who live in the city, that support other businesses in the city, becomes a vicious cycle. It's not just an impact on the schools; it's an impact on the entire city.” She also raised a concern shared by others: “Specialists have been brought in at huge amounts of money that could keep a number of these people at their jobs.”
Former Detroit Federation of Teachers President Virginia Cantrell, who now serves on the school board advisory council, said, “We need to get the class size down, books and supplies in the classroom, and we need to stop moving teachers around, four, five, six times a year. All that needs to be done are things that are common sense.”
She objected to Bobb trying to both be a financial manager and oversee academics. “None of us is smart enough to take on everything and be the master of everything. There's no check and balances.” The elected school board, not Bobb, needs to oversee academics, in her view.
Russ Bellant, a retired labor and community activist long engaged in the fight to preserve public education, said Bobb is embarking on a systematic plan to dismantle public education in the city. Up to 45 schools are scheduled to close. What needs to be done is to keep the schools open and fill them with students, instead of closing them, he said.
Michael Mulholland, secretary treasurer of AFSCME Local 207 representing Detroit's water and sewage workers, came to the rally because his union is also fighting a privatization effort that could affect upwards of 13,000 workers.

"The View" heated up over politics again Wednesday morning, specifically around the subject of Sarah Palin's readiness to be President.
"She doesn't know anything about it!" Whoopi Goldberg said, which set off co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck.
"In terms of experience, she's actually been leading a microcosm of the United States of America," Elisabeth responded.
Things heated up even more after Elisabeth took a swipe at Joe Biden, prompting Barbara Walters to say, "Every single day you never ever say, maybe there's another point, so this is your chance....Tell us now why you think that Sarah Palin would make a very good President."
Elisabeth's response? "Tell me why Barack Obama is qualified to be President."
Watch as Elisabeth eventually puts together a list which includes "she has been in charge of the National Guard during a time of war":

I'm going to pick on my colleagues over at Bloomberg Tech and their allegations that Bitcoin is suffering some sort of backlog. You guys are wrong! Bitcoin is doing just fine.
Complaining about a Bitcoin transaction backlog is like complaining that Ebay has a backlog because 90 people bid on a Honus Wagner baseball card and only one person got to win. I could bid a penny on Honus Wagner all day long, and still not get a card. That's not a backlog; that's just a crappy offer price.
See, a sad fact of capitalism is that goods and services cost money. Processing a bitcoin transaction is a service that miners perform in exchange for money, which they need to pay their electricity bills. Did bitcoin users presume that the network is a public service run by benevolent cryptoanarchists?
Bitcoin transactions are priced by size, like, BTC/kB. Transactions vary in size because you can combine multiple inputs and outputs and add programmable instructions. But a one-input-one-output transaction is about 192 bytes, and a reasonable fee for that transaction might be about 0.0002 BTC, or 25 cents. The fee is the same whether the transaction value is a million dollars or a nickel.
So here we have Roger Ver complaining that he paid $78 for his bitcoin transaction. Right, the transaction contained 416 inputs, so it was effectively 416 transactions squashed into one. 18.75 cents per transaction is not bad! And this is irrelevant, but the total transaction value was 32.5 bitcoin, or about $39,000. $78 is effectively a 0.2% transaction fee!
https://t.co/6EeRmpwLyF just paid $78 in TX fees for a single Bitcoin transaction. https://t.co/FVq16Vzqq9 pic.twitter.com/mOwHnaFPWP — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) January 5, 2017
Transaction fees have gone up recently, but overall transaction costs have stayed the same. Decreased, even. The cost of a transaction is what miners receive for including a transaction in a block. That's the fixed block reward plus a fee from the user. The block reward is the creation of new bitcoins, which is effectively inflation, so people don't really think about it, but it's still a cost. Block rewards decrease by 50% every four years, and the last decrease was last July, so transaction fees had to increase to compensate. The good news is that the inflation rate has gone down.
The bigger issue is that people don't understand how to calculate bitcoin transaction fees, so they submit cheapskate transactions and get all confused when miners don't want to include them. Here is a pretty good tool for estimating transaction fees and expected wait time. A lot of the wallet software out there sucks and doesn't do this for their users. Bitcoin could stand to be more user-friendly.
Finally, transaction fees are denominated in BTC, but people whine about them in dollars. Even if the transaction fees haven't gone up much in terms of bitcoin, the dollar-denominated price of bitcoin has increased by a lot, so the transaction fees look a lot higher these days when considered in dollars. But it's not Bitcoin's fault that your stupid fiat currency can't hold its value.

My previous RebelLabs post showed us that there still is a nice amount of interest among the developers in neat command line tools. This is great news as it means there are still lots of geeks reaching for their maximum l33t potential! This post will, as the title suggests, jump into 5 more tools that will hopefully tickle your fancy.
Whilst it is hard to find a set of tools relevant for every different command line professional or enthusiast, I can still wholly recommend glancing over these tools briefly. You never know when you'll get stuck in a terminal only environment or will need to impress a friend with your exceptional command line skills. So without further ado, here are 5 more command line tools you should consider using!
z
1. Install it once
2. Forget it's even there
3. Profit from its productivity: z.
OK, but what's it all about? Well, z allows you to quickly jump from folder to folder, without having to bother writing the full absolute or relative paths. To achieve this, it simply records all the folders you visit, and then ranks them based on a combination of the frequency and time of last use. Now all you need to do is type z part/of/path and hit enter. With this, z will automagically guide you to the highest ranking match.
To install z, download z.sh and source it in ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc, if you still haven't made the inevitable jump to ZSH. Now go about your regular flow, cd -ing all over the place, and you are done!
Alternatively, if you use the oh-my-zsh framework, simply add it in the plugins listing of ~/.zshrc.
$ vim ~/.zshrc plugins=(brew git mercurial mvn osx sbt scala vi-mode z)
By default, z stores its data in ~/.z, below are my contents after I cleared them and moved around a bit. After printing the data, you can see I moved to 2 different folders by specifying only a small part of the path, irrespective of the current folder. Take note that the directory name was matched mid-word in a case insensitive way — very handy!
All in all I highly recommend this great tool to anyone that spends any amount of time at the command line, whatever your background, interest or use case may be.
youtube-dl
The second tool of this post is the excellent youtube-dl. A cross-platform tool allowing you to, unsuprisingly, download Youtube videos. The easiest way to install is either via Homebrew or pip as shown below. Other download options can be found via the link above.
$ brew install youtube-dl $ sudo pip install --upgrade youtube_dl
At times, for whatever reason, you may want to download a presentation for archiving's purposes. Or better yet, imagine you spend the weekend in the Estonian countryside, devoid of internet, yet you really wanted to see the latest Virtual JUG sessions. A simple youtube-dl https://youtu.be/PQPvZkA-6bg suffices at this point.
Other nice things to take note of:
You are not limited to downloading from Youtube only, Vimeo for example is also supported.
Simply point to a Youtube playlist and youtube-dl will be smart enough to automatically download the full list.
As shown in the example image, youtube-dl will happily follow shortened URLs for you.
By default the highest quality video will be downloaded, however a simple youtube-dl -f $FORMAT $LINK will override this. You find available formats with the -F flag.
will override this. You find available formats with the -F flag. A veritable host of additional options are nicely documented and easily accessible via man youtube-dl .
shellcheck
I will assume that anyone spend significant some time at the command line will want to automate tasks using shell scripts. Bash itself is renowned for its many pitfalls, and even advanced scripters will from time to time bump into something unexpected. Unfortunately for us, a shell script has no undo button, and “unexpected” results may well be synonymous with “catastrophic” results.
Long intro short: we have a valuable tool on our side to guard ourselves against exactly this, shellcheck! In essence, it is a static analyser that will tell you where your script goes wrong.
Install shellcheck via your package manager of choice: Homebrew, Pacman, APT; build it from source, or run it inside your browser.
$ brew install shellcheck # pacman -S shellcheck # apt-get install shellcheck
This list may be of particular interest to you as it describes code samples that shellcheck can protect you against. To run, simply execute shellcheck my-script , it will read the shebang (#!) directive to decide whether to analyse as sh, bash or ksh.
As shown in the example output above, there is one syntax error, it's marked in red: spaces surrounding the assignment. However, shellcheck goes beyond that. In yellow markings is a warning of a potentially catastrophic event: what if toDelete is ever empty? Granted, the example is somewhat contrived, without –no-preserve-root there will be no damage should the statement resolve to /, but my point still stands! Finally, in green you will find general warnings on potential future mishaps that are best not to be ignored.
As a closing remark on shellcheck: use the neat Syntastic Vim plugin to integrate the tool inside Vim itself, configuring when it should run, how it should behave, etc. The same script that generated the ouput above now looks like the following, from our favorite text editor.
multitail
For the sys-admins and dev-opses amongst us: stop using tail -f , and start using, multitail, tail on steroids! This ultimate log-viewer allows you to do a couple of really cool things that make it worth mentioning. Alternatively you could always either use tmux or screen to get in-shell multiplexing, or just use a modern terminal emulator allowing you to do the splitting like that, such as iTerm2 or Terminator, however in these cases you may miss some of the features below.
Show multiple windows at the same time, in the same shell using ncurses.
Merge multiple logs in the same window, for example the stdout and the stderr log of the same application.
and the log of the same application. Perform filtering dynamically via in-menu editable regexes.
Use the predefined color highlighters to make the logs more legible, or define your own, again with regular expressions.
You know the drill how to install:
$ brew install multitail # pacman -S multitail # apt-get install multitail
For an actual example, here is a screenshot of a window where I'm developing JRebel by attaching it to Tomcat, running the infamous petclinic project. At that time I needed both Tomcat's own output and the JRebel one. Take note of the -CS flag, signifying “use this color scheme for all subsequent files”, followed by the name of the scheme.
As both logs color nicely with the Apache rules, they are set, finally followed by the actual paths of the logfiles.
$ multitail -CS apache "$TOMCAT_HOME/logs/catalina.out" "$HOME/.jrebel/jrebel.log"
tree
Our final tool in this post is the essential tree utility. Tree prints a nice, structured, tree-view of your directories, allowing you to instantly get an idea about the structure of your data, without having to ls, cd or z all over the place. If it is not yet pre-installed in your favourite *NIX, then grab it via your favourite package manager.
$ brew install tree # pacman -S tree # apt-get install tree
In its most basic form, you simply type $ tree to print the current folder's structure.
Personally, I prefer to spice it up just a little bit, adding some flags to print human readable filesizes, hidden files, and a nice total sizecount: $ tree -ah --du .
And that is about all I have to tell you about tree. It's really convenient to grep its output, it gives you an awesome representation of the filesystem, and I'm sure you'll love it from the first moment.
That concludes my list of command line tools that you won't think will change you live, but sure enough after some time you won't imagine yourself not using them. In fact, you'll likely curse every time you use a command-line-muggle's computer without these great tools installed. What are the hidden gems of your command-line-fu? Share your favorite command line utilities in the comments below, I really would like to learn new tricks.

New Delhi: In 2011 when Liquor baron Vijay Mallya had complete control over United Spirits Ltd (USL) almost Rs 170 crore were diverted from the company to the accounts of his Indian Premier League (IPL) team Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), according to a report published in DNA on May 29.
The transfer of funds was masqueraded as an allotment of his IPL team's shares to United Spirits Ltd, of whom Mallya was the principal promoter at the time of the transaction, according to the report.
That was an astronomical self-valuation of an IPL team which was barely three years old as a brand. The allotment of fully paid up shares at such a premium meant that Rs 170 crore were diverted from USL's account into RCB's accounts that year.
The shares were allotted by RCB to USL on March 11, 2011. Nominal shares worth Rs 10 were allotted to USL for an astounding sum of Rs 3,62,240 per share.
In fact, in the 2011 auction, which took place in the first month of the year, RCB were the most aggressive buyer. They retained just one player in Virat Kohli and put the rest on sale.
However, eventually RCB emerged as the team that spent the most on buying new players. After spending almost $8.6 million (about Rs 55 crore), RCB ended with players like AB de Villiers and Saurabh Tiwary who were bought for more than $1 million each. And as per the newspaper report, a part of the money diverted from USL was also used to pick up players like Zaheer Khan, Daniel Vettori, Cheteshwar Pujara and Dirk Nannes (who was later replaced by Chris Gayle during the tournament).
Mallya still holds a minority stake in USL after selling it off to Diageo in 2013.
Jon Stewart joined Stephen Colbert on the ‘Late Show' Thursday to share his thoughts on the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his supporters in an impassioned speech that has quickly gone viral.
In one of his first appearances since his 'Daily Show' retirement, Stewart pulled no punches. He called out the Republican candidate, to whom he referred as an “angry groundhog” for his RNC speech. He said Trump was merely “vomit[ing] on everyone for an hour.”
Stewart also had harsh words for Trump supporters who claim to want to ‘take back' America. “This country isn't yours. You don't own it!” he said. “You don't own patriotism, you don't own Christianity. You sure as hell don't own respect for military, police and firefighters.”
John Stewart finally broke his TV silence last night & it was glorious, necessary and 100 percent on point https://t.co/kuassNXlQW — Joe Haggerty (@HackswithHaggs) July 22, 2016
He singled out the hypocrisy he saw among RNC attendees who had campaigned against legislation providing health care support for 9/11 first responders.
“I saw a lot of people on the convention floor at Cleveland with their Blue Lives Matter rhetoric ,who either remained silent or actively fought against the 9/11 first responders' bill reauthorization.”
“I see you, and I see your bullsh*t!” he said.
Stewart expressed glee at the upcoming contortions many conservatives will have to endure to throw their support behind Trump, particularly over the traits and issues he shares with President Barack Obama.
Describing Trump as “a thin-skinned narcissist with no government experience,” Stewart also targeted Fox News host Sean Hannity over his hypocrisy in failing to criticize Trump over the same issues for which he spent eight years attacking Obama for, including elitism, divisiveness, inexperience and his dependence on a teleprompter.
“I'm sure it's easy for people without ethics or principles to embrace someone who embodies everything they said they hated about the previous president for the past eight years,” he said.
Members of the public have been urged to use electricity sparingly during the evening peak.
JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says about 25 percent of its generation capacity is currently offline and residential and business customers have been asked to reduce their consumption by 10 percent during evening peak times.
Yesterday, the energy giant announced that the system is strained and generating reserves are almost stretched to their limits.
"We have alerted our key industrial customers and have required them to reduce their load by a minimum of 10 percent," Eskom said in a statement.
Parts of Gauteng have experienced sporadic power outages for the past two weeks and earlier this year Eskom was forced to implement partial load shedding.
Spokesperson Andrew Etzinger explains the current situation.
"Twenty five percent of our generation feeds at the moment are out of service due to the result of technical problems. But the basic cause is we have an aging power feed to power stations. The power stations have not been adequately maintained for a number of years now because of pressure on the grid and they've been run extremely hard."
He said members of the public are urged to use electricity sparingly during the evening peak.
He says while Medupi will come online next year, the Kusile Power Station may only start feeding power to the grid in 2016.

PeaceMaker is a simulation of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. Players play as either the Palestinian president or the Israeli prime minister -- under calm, tense or violent circumstances. Players have to make numerous decisions in the midst and wake of challenging circumstances and events, such as suicide bombings and missile strikes.
When the players make decisions they are immediately assessed and converted into polls that show how the Palestinians, Israelis, Arab countries, Europeans, Americans and the United Nations think of their leadership. The goal is to make decisions that walk the middle path and reach peaceful consensus in the form of a two state solution.
In the process of the gameplay, players learn to think like politicians and negotiators. The game requires taking a variety of constituencies into consideration when making decisions; otherwise their decisions would be too myopic. To create a peaceful solution requires reconciling polar worldviews, which means having a working knowledge of each extreme and a sense of which series of decisions can chart a middle way that unites both sides of the conflict.
The Learning Principles of Gaming
What makes PeaceMaker, and videogames in general, powerful tools for learning is that a variety of effective learning principles are embedded within the game design. While there is a spectrum of learning principles embedded within good game design, I've distilled the list down to five cornerstones.
1. Just-in-time learning.
Videogames give you just enough information that you can usefully apply. You are not given information you'll need for level 8 at level 1, which can often be the case with schools that download files of information that are never applied. Videogames provide doable challenges that are constantly pushing the edge of a player's competence. This is similar to Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development.
2. Critical thinking.
When you play videogames you're entering a virtual world with only the vaguest idea of what you are supposed to do. As a result, you need to explore the physics of the game and generate a hypothesis of how to navigate it. And then test it. Because games are complex, you are continually reformulating and retesting your hypothesis -- the hallmark of critical thinking.
3. Increased memory retention.
Cognitive science has recently discovered that memory is a residue of thought. So what you think about is what you remember. As videogames make you think, they also hold the potential to increase memory retention.
4. Emotional interest.
Videogames are emotionally engaging. Brain research has revealed that emotional interest helps humans learn. Basically, we don't pay attention to boring things. The amygdala is the emotional center of the brain and also the gateway to learning.
5. We learn best through images.
Vision is our most dominant sense, taking up half of our brain's resources. The more visual input, the more likely it is to be recognized and recalled. Videogames meet this learning principle in spades as interactive visual simulations.
The New Gold Standard of Learning
Videogames are emerging as a new gold standard of learning because they effectively integrate many vital learning principles into their design.
Eric Hoffer, the San Francisco longshoreman and philosopher, said that "in times of change learners inherit the Earth while the learned find themselves equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists."
We are living in such times of rapid changes, and those who are most adaptive not only survive, but thrive. I believe videogames represent one of many new powerful forms of media that are tailored to our times, and can also be leveraged as a tool for learning that cultivates critical thinking and emotional engagement.
Computers and videogames represent the latest possibility of turning swords into plowshares: The first computers were used for code-breaking and calculating ballistic trajectories during World War II. And now, with the right kind of scaffolding, hopefully we can use computers and computer games to connect, collaborate and create a more peaceful world.

Now Stephen Merchant is joining in on the fun, in what is the never-ending Logan photo shoot.
There were already multiple posts today featuring new images for the upcoming third installment of Wolverine titled
Logan
. First director James Mangold released an image of Stephen Merchant as Caliban on his Twitter account. Now Merchant has posted a picture via his own Instagram account. In the film, Caliban is rumored to be helping Wolverine to take care of the aging Professor X. The character was first introduced as one of the Morlocks and has the mutant ability to track down other mutants and can also channel the emotions of people around him in order to increase his strength. He was at one point a member of the four horseman with Apocalypse. Check out the image below.
The Tank, Cruiser, Mk VII Cavalier (A24) was an interim design of British cruiser tank during the Second World War. It was derived from the A15 Crusader tank and was superseded by the A27 Cromwell tank.
Development [ edit ]
Early Development [ edit ]
Development of the Cavalier initially started as development of the Cromwell tank.
In mid-1940, the British were considering which tank should follow on from the new cruiser tanks then being developed. A specification was drawn up by the Directorate of Tanks and Transport which included the QF 6 pounder gun. This led to General Staff specification A23 for a cruiser version of the A22 Churchill tank from Vauxhall, and A24 from Nuffield Mechanization & Aero Limited based upon their Crusader tank design. Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company (BRC&W) also submitted a design based on the Crusader.
The Nuffield design used an uprated (410 hp) Liberty engine which was expected to give a top speed of 24 mph (39 km/h). Armour would be from 63 to 70 mm at the front, and the 6 pounder gun would be in a turret on a 60-inch turret ring.
The Tank Board meeting in January 1941 decided that as the tank needed to be in production by early 1942 it should be based upon an existing design to avoid the need for prototypes. Six tanks of the A24 Nuffield design were ordered that month, and the tank was named Cromwell.
Separation from Cromwell [ edit ]
Rolls-Royce's design team, working with Leyland's engineers, produced the Meteor engine. This gave a higher output than the Liberty for a similar size. Initially intended to be fitted to the A24, the new engine was not acceptable to Nuffield.
Working with Rolls-Royce and Leyland, BRC&W were able to produce a prototype of their version of the Cromwell design using the Meteor. This spawned a new specification for Cromwell, A27, using a new Leyland transmission. Leyland later had doubts about the Meteor and wanted to manufacture the Liberty instead, splitting the Cromwell programme further into A24, A27L, and A27M.
The General staff specifications now covered three tanks: A24 "Cromwell I" from Nuffield, A27L (Liberty engine) "Cromwell II" from Leyland and A27M (Meteor engine) "Cromwell III".
To avoid confusion Cromwell I was renamed "Cavalier". The Cromwell II become "Centaur" and the Cromwell III remained as the "Cromwell".
Production and design efforts separated from A27, and Cavalier became a separate tank.
Production [ edit ]
At the end of 1941, it was decided production of the Nuffield design would be by Nuffield and Ruston and Hornsby. The schedule had already slipped due to work on other projects and work to fit the 6 pounder to the Crusader tank. The first tank began trials in March 1942.
Production versions of the Cromwell delivered first, and provided greater performance than the Cavalier. Cavalier was judged unsatisfactory and the Nuffield order was reduced to 500 tanks. It never entered front-line service.
Design [ edit ]
Internally, the Cavalier was subdivided by bulkheads, which also functioned as structural members. The driver and hull gunner were in the front compartment, the fighting compartment was in the centre. The bulkhead behind the fighting compartment was the firewall from the engine, a Liberty Mark IV, and the final bulkhead separated the engine from the transmission.
Mechanically, the Cavalier was similar to the preceding Crusader tank, using Wilson steering and the Liberty engine. The newer Liberty Mark IV gave more power than the one in the Crusader. The operation of the steering brakes and gear changing remained pneumatic.
Outwardly, the design of Cavalier is very similar to the related Cromwell and Centaur. Cavaliers do not have the upper air intake of Cromwell, which is optional on the Centaur. Cavalier has shorter suspension arms. Cavaliers were built with hull types A and B. Exhaust exits through the hull rear plate using Crusader style angled louvres,[4] where Cromwell and Centaur both exhaust to the vehicle top.
The Cavalier turret was a six sided boxy structure. The mantlet was internal with a large opening in the front of the turret for the gun barrel, the coaxial Besa machine gun and the aperture of the No. 39 telescopic sight. The gun was of the "free elevation" type; the gun was balanced such that it could be readily moved by the gunner. This fitted with British practice of firing on the move.
Service history [ edit ]
Those that were built were used in training or auxiliary armoured vehicle roles. At least 12 Cavaliers were provided to France in 1945, and were operated by the 12th Dragoon Regiment of the French 14th Infantry Division.
Variants [ edit ]
Cavalier OP Produced in 1943. The gun was replaced with a dummy barrel freeing up room in the turret and hull for extra radios. It was then used as an artillery observation post.
Cavalier ARV The turret was removed and an A-frame jib and associated equipment added for use as an armoured recovery vehicle.
Surviving vehicles [ edit ]
Only two vehicles are thought to have survived, both in the UK.
The Tank Museum, Dorset, England. Cavalier(A24), which is in a bad condition and in storage (outside) awaiting restoration. [5]
Isle of Wight Military Museum, Hampshire, England. Cavalier(A24), which is the same condition as above. This vehicle was for sale and is awaiting restoration.[6]

Serena Williams got engaged last week to Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit. Ohanian happens to be white and many are wondering why Serena chose to marry a white man after dating so many Black men.
Well according to the greatest female tennis player and quite possible the greatest female athlete of all time, of all the men she dated, the white men especially her now fiancé, treated her better than the Black men.
“When I date someone I never see color,” Serena said, “I date who I have chemistry with, but I must say Alexis has treated me better than any Black man I have dated.”
Serena has dated a slew of Black men including rappers Drake and Common. She has also dated former NFL linebacker Lamar Arrington and basketball star Amare Stoudemire.

Hayden Ballantyne is set for a 10th season at Freo.
Fremantle's Hayden Ballantyne has agreed to terms for a one-year contract extension, which will see the exciting small forward in Freo colours for a 10th season in 2018.
The 2014 All Australian has kicked 232 goals in 151 games for Fremantle and sits second in the club's all-time goal kicking list behind Matthew Pavlich.
Ballantyne said he was excited about what Fremantle's emerging side can produce in 2018.
“It's great to sign on. It was exciting to see the young guys coming through this year,” Ballantyne said.
“They played some good footy. Hopefully, next year we can get some more wins on the board and continue to improve and grow our young playing group.”
General manager of list management Brad Lloyd said Ballantyne's leadership would help shape Freo's future.
“We're really happy to have Hayden committed for the 2018 season,” Lloyd said.
“He has made a significant contribution to the club since being drafted in 2008 and had big impact in games and is a strong leader at the football club."
It was a tough 2017 for Ballantyne, injuring his hamstring in Freo's JLT Community Series clash on 10 March against Carlton at Domain Stadium.
The injury saw Ballantyne miss the opening 12 games of the season, kicking 11 goals from the following 10 games, including two in Freo's season finale against Essendon.
After an interrupted start to the year, Ballantyne felt the season ended just as he was hitting his straps.
“I was flat when the season ended to be honest, as I was just starting to get a kick towards the end,” Ballantyne said.
“I only played 10 games but next year, I'll be pushing for a good pre-season and hopefully, a big season in 2018.
“It's only early in the off-season so I haven't set any goals for 2018 but I definitely will focus on having a big pre-season, staying fit and looking to play every game.”
Karen Louise Hill, my younger sister by one year and three days, died on March 27, at the age of 56, with her rich but challenging life unfinished. She died with an essay and a novel, both exploring the mental illness with which she had lived for 30 years, still circulating in search of publishers.

I know how hard it has been for me to finish my own books. But I can't truly know how difficult it must have been for Karen to finish her novel, Café Babanussa, given that she was beset by periodic psychiatric breakdowns during the years she worked on it. In periods when she reduced or entirely ceased taking her antipsychotic medications, she slipped gradually into debilitating illness. When she took her meds faithfully, she hated the results: they numbed her mind, hampered her creativity and made her gain weight. I imagine that writing, for Karen, must have felt like hauling a brick-laden wagon uphill. She had to calm her own mind to sit down and focus on her work, but the writing process stoked her anxieties. Still, she never complained about creating under the stress of her illness. Poems? Karen wrote dozens of them. Stories? Many of them, too. And then the novel.

Between all the written works, which remain mostly unpublished, Karen loved her daughter, Malaika, and her relatives, maintained her friendships, travelled when she could afford it to Cuba and Europe, gardened, baked pumpkin pies and Linzer tortes for family gatherings, and made hundreds of paintings and gift cards at the Creative Works Studio, a program on Gerrard St. for people living with mental illness or addictions. On March 21, 2014, Karen was released on a weekend pass from the psychiatric ward at Sunnybrook hospital. Things were looking good on that day, but getting her hospitalized two weeks earlier had been a painful ordeal for her family. On a late night in early March, when she had initially required hospitalization, Karen called 911 and was taken by ambulance to Sunnybrook. She was disoriented and paranoid. While waiting in the emergency area, she ripped out her IV unit and fled the hospital, on foot. It was a frigid winter night and she had no hat or mitts. Malaika and I got to the hospital an hour after she had arrived, but Karen had already taken off. I worried that she would suffer frostbite or wander into a forest and die of exposure, or that she would wander onto Bayview Ave. and be hit by a car. Malaika and I drove for more than an hour on nearby streets, looking for her, but we could not find her. Finally, hours later, Karen turned up back in her flat in the Bain Co-operative Apartments. She had walked many kilometres home from the hospital. Later, she told me that although she had bus tokens in her pocket, she had been convinced that the bus drivers could read her mind and would not let her in the doors. Blood had been smeared everywhere in her apartment, with blood from the hand that she had cut by ripping out an IV unit. Moments after I entered her apartment, the police showed up — wondering who on earth I was and why there was blood all over the walls. The officers heard me out and took her back to Sunnybrook. I spent the rest of the night with my sister in a locked hospital room until a psychiatrist showed up in the morning to interview and admit her. It was heartbreaking to witness her anguish: pacing constantly, unable to focus her eyes or to have a conversation. But at least she was safe. At the very time she fled from Sunnybrook hospital, Karen had been trying to publish an autobiographical essay about living for decades with mental illness and about escaping the psychiatric wing of Toronto General Hospital several years earlier. In On Being Crazy, she touched upon her paranoia at the time of her first escape: “The head doctors are constantly trying to hypnotize me with their eyes again. Drain the information out of me. Can't fight against it; they always win.”

My sister might have been temporarily crazy, but she knew how to sneak out of a psych ward. “I figured out that the easiest and most sensible thing to do would be to watch for a group of people exiting the ward and hide among them as they filed through the ward doors and onto the elevator. I got ready and an hour later that's exactly what I did.” And there you have my sister: mother, daughter, sister, friend, gardener, baker, painter, writer — and escape artist.

May 31, 2016, 12:42 PM GMT / Updated May 31, 2016, 12:42 PM GMT By Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann
First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the day's most important political stories and why they matter.
Why Hillary Clinton needs to win California next week
Yes, Hillary Clinton is just 72 delegates away from crossing the 2,383 magic number needed for a majority of delegates to win the Democratic convention. Yes, she's likely to hit that milestone before polls even close in California (due to the New Jersey primary and its 126 pledged delegates). And, yes, even if she loses in California by 10 points, her lead over Bernie Sanders in pledged delegates would still be twice the size of Obama's lead over Clinton in 2008.
But here's the reason why Clinton needs to beat Sanders in California next week: She doesn't want to give him any legitimate rationale to remain in the race beyond June 7 or June 14 (the final primary in DC). Why? Because as our colleague Dante Chinni writes, the moment Sanders exits the race, her poll numbers against Trump will increase. “[T]o get a better look at where the Clinton-Trump race might stand after the nominating dust has settled, we recalculated the latest NBC/WSJ poll with Clinton capturing 70 percent of the Sanders-only vote. The result: those Sanders-only voters are worth an extra five points to Clinton. In the NBC/WSJ poll, Clinton's advantage over Trump goes from three points to eight points and she leads 51 percent to 43 percent.”
Maybe that's why Clinton has canceled an event in New Jersey this week to spend more time in California, as NBC's Kristen Welker reported on “Today” this morning.
Even as Sanders continues to move the goal posts
Then again, one thing that Sanders has successfully done over the past month is moved the goal posts while trailing Clinton by 270 pledged delegates and more than 700 overall delegates. Here was Sanders before New York's primary, which he lost by 16 points: “We will win a major victory here in New York next Tuesday.” And here he was before the Pennsylvania primary, which he lost by 12 points: "You know what? I think we're going to win here in Pennsylvania next week." And here was Sanders on “Meet the Press” last Sunday: “I think we have a good chance to win in California, maybe win big, and maybe win four or five of the other states that are off on June 7th… California is the big enchilada, so to speak.”
Given these past statements, even if Sanders loses in California, it's possible to see him continue his campaign. But a loss in the Golden State would leave him without any legitimate rationale to flip superdelegates, especially when he trails in pledged delegates and the popular vote. And Sanders even acknowledged that reality on “Meet”: “Obviously, if we don't do well in California, it will make our path much, much harder. No question about it,” he said. The current Democratic delegate math:
In pledged delegates, Clinton currently holds a lead of 270 delegates
Clinton 1,770 (54%)
Sanders 1,500 (46%)
Clinton must win 33% of remaining pledged delegates to get a majority in pledged delegates
Sanders must win 67% of remaining pledged delegates to get a majority in pledged delegates
In overall delegates (pledged + super), Clinton holds an overall lead of 769 delegates
Clinton must win 8% of remaining delegates to reach 2,383 magic number
Sanders must win 92% of remaining delegates to reach 2,383 magic number
Do Trump's fundraising numbers for veterans add up?
As NBC's Hallie Jackson reported on “Today” this morning, Donald Trump will hold a news conference at 11:00 am ET to respond to criticism that his January 28 fundraiser for veterans didn't raise as much money as claimed. The Washington Post with more: “Last week — after intense pressure from the news media — Donald Trump made good on a promise he had made in January. He gave $1 million of his own money to a charity for veterans... On Tuesday morning, the day after Memorial Day, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has scheduled a news conference at Trump Tower in New York. He is expected to announce that he had made good on a separate promise to veterans, made at the same time as the $1 million pledge... In January, on the night of the fundraiser, Trump was (seemingly) clear about the night's total haul. "We just cracked $6 million, right? Six million."
But that figure appears to be false. Earlier this month, Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said the fundraiser had actually netted $4.5 million, because some big donors had not paid up. Then, a few days later, Trump said Lewandowski's figures were wrong. In fact, Trump said, the total fundraising haul was $5.5 million, after he had made good on his own pledge to give $1 million from his pocket.” The Clinton campaign will hold a conference call at 1:00 pm ET “to call out Donald Trump's hypocrisy by fraudulently touting his support for veterans when his actual record has been one of disrespect,” per a press release.
Forget the dream third-party challenge to Trump and focus on the real third-party challenge -- Gary Johnson
For all of the media attention on whether a prominent Republican will mount a third-party challenge to Trump, here's the reality: We already have a third-party challenge: former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. And unlike a Mitt Romney/Ben Sasse/Paul Ryan running -- which is UNLIKELY to happen -- Johnson will have ballot access. MSNBC's Jane Timm: “The Libertarian Party nominated former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson and former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld as its presidential ticket Sunday, as the party attempts to elevate itself into the mainstream during an election that's given the small party unprecedented opportunity.”
NBC|SurveyMonkey poll: Clinton leads Trump by 2 points
Finally, our weekly online NBC|SurveyMonkey tracking poll has Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by 2 points, 47%-45% -- down from 4 points last week (47%-43%).

There is no road to the White Sea Biological Station, which sits at latitude 66° N on the cusp of the Arctic Circle. Located on the shores of its namesake, the White Sea, the only way to get there is by boat in summer and snowmobile in winter since the waters of Kandalaksha Bay are frozen six months out of the year.
Inside the station is an unlikely photo studio where Alexander Semenov, 25, is sharing his stunning photographs of arctic sea creatures with the global online community.
“I'm trying to act like the Discovery channel, but as a single unit,” says Semenov.
Alexander Semenov on the White Sea Biological Station dock.
A marine biologist, photographer and head of the WSBS deep-sea diving team, Semenov has been stationed at the WSBS since 2007. Over the years he's developed a worldwide audience for his photography using Behance, Flickr and his personal blog and website.
“I think all the people in the world know how tigers and lions looks like, but only a few ever know about scyphozoan jellies - that they can grow up to 3 meters in diameter and have tentacles of 36 meters,” says Semenov. “I'm trying to bring these hidden worlds to the masses and it's much easier to do with internet.”
Semenov's first ventures into deep-sea photography were merely experiments. He spent his first summer at the research center, operated by the Biology Department of Lomonosovs Moscow State University, photographing invertebrates in the laboratory without any professional equipment. With an entry-level camera, low-light conditions and shaking tripod, Semenov was only able to make a few shots he describes as "not so bad” that he shared with his enthusiastic crew.
Soon after, the official WSBS underwater camera sunk – a loss Semenov actually considers a stroke of luck.
“We decided to buy a Canon 400D with some good macro lenses, underwater strobes and housing. When I got this piece of equipment, underwater photography became part of my job.”
Semenov grew up in a family of biologists, surrounded by “hundreds of books about nature, oceans and animals.” He focused on biology at gymnasium (the high school equivalent in Russia) and went on to specialize in marine invertebrates and squid brains at Lomonosovs Moscow State University. At age 19 and in his third year of University, he had his first underwater dive and his passion for deep sea science was fixed.
“When you read about marine life it's interesting, but it's only theoretical knowledge,” says Semenov. “When you see all this life with your own eyes it's an amazing experience. It was at that point I became a ‘real' marine biologist.”
Semenov's photographs have been used by scientists, teachers, book authors and encyclopedia editors around the world. His team has identified species that were previously unknown to inhabit the waters of the White Sea, but he says it is rare that his team discovers a new species entirely.
“The important thing is not to find new species but to understand how every creature you already know lives,” says Semenov. “There is not so much information about underwater worlds, because scientific diving isn't old at all, 60 years maybe. I try to make snapshots of the life-cycles of the animals I see: growth, feeding, copulation, reproduction, birth and death - all these moments can be seen and photographed.”
Semenov's team encounter an Octopus dofleini, an animal Semenov refers to as "The King of the Japan Sea." The Japan Sea borders Russia.
Gearheads will approve of his equipment: He uses a Canon 5DM2 body with a Canon 100mm/f2.8L macro lens in Subal housing with Inon Z-240 strobes, but for Semenov, the photos are more about the experiences behind them.
“Nobody knows what you feel on the other side of the camera,” says Semenov, who considers his photographs of a sea angel his biggest triumph (Clione limacina, seen on slide 3 in the gallery above).
“The sea angel is a planktonic pteropod mollusk, that lost its shell in the evolution process and became a swimmer,” explains Semenov. “Sea angels feed exclusively on Sea Butterflies (Limacina Helicina), also pteropod mollusks. Angels have six large hook-shaped buccal conuses, hidden inside their head; weapons with which to catch sea butterflies. When a sea angel hunts, its head divides in two parts and the hooks pull out.”
“All this process in the hunt lasts only for seconds, and sea angels swim at a crazy speed, but I shot it. Technically, I think it's my most amazing photo,” adds Semenov.
With only 40 to 60 minutes underwater on any given dive, Semenov also makes many photos in the laboratory where he uses a Canon 8-15mm fisheye, 16-35mm/f2.8L II and a Canon MP-E.
“In the laboratory you have unlimited time and hot tea, so it's much more comfortable to work,” Semenov stresses. But Semenov is not satisfied with his output just yet. He's looking for more modern equipment to ramp up the resolution on his images. “My dream is a Nikon D800E.”
While marine biology fans are used to alien-looking creatures from the deep sea, Semenov usually dives no deeper than 40 meters. Even so, he says it's unlikely he'll ever run out of compelling subjects.
“There are so many animals within the 40m water layer, that I could spend all my life exploring it and maybe I'd photograph 5 percent of the present biodiversity,” says Semenov. “When you dive every day for 3 to 4 months and see the same creatures every time and see what they do, you start to understand their life. With the photos, you can share your understanding with other scientists and get the full picture."

TRENTON -- Several aides to President Donald Trump regret the decision to actually throw away Gov. Chris Christie's transition plans, according to a report by the New York Times.
The report, published Saturday, examines how Trump often relies on people outside the White House for advice. Christie, a longtime friend, is among the 20 counselors listed in the piece.
The Times makes reference to months of reports that Christie and Jared Kushner, Trump's New Jersey-bred son-in-law and senior adviser, have a chilly relationship, and how that was reportedly part of the reason Christie was dumped as the chairman of Trump's transition team after the election in November.
The newspaper reported in February that a senior Trump aide "made a show of tossing" Christie's plans "into a garbage can."
Was Christie's transition plan for Trump thrown in trash?
But multiple reports in recent weeks said Christie still enjoys a close relationship with Trump, a former Atlantic City casino magnate, often speaking to him on the phone. Several people close to Christie have confirmed that to NJ Advance Media.
Trump has also named the New Jersey governor as chairman of a task force to find ways to fight the nation's opioid addiction epidemic.
The Times reported in Saturday's piece that Kushner has "shown a capacity to hobble his rivals, but few have been finished off."
"The most durable has been Mr. Christie, whose transition planning, several West Wing aides now concede, should not have been discarded," the report said. "He has been a frequent Oval Office visitor and has worked with the White House on the opioid addiction crisis."

In a development that shouldn't have been nearly as surprising as most of us took it to be, the Minnesota Vikings deactivated Bernard Berrian for Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals. The reason that it shouldn't have been surprising is that Berrian has just two catches in four five games this season for the Vikings. The reason that it was surprising was the fact that, even though he hasn't produced in a year and a half, Vikings' coach Leslie Frazier seemed to have a really strange devotion to the guy that he had deemed to be the deep threat in the Minnesota offense for this season.
Now, I know that last week I wrote this open letter to Bernard Berrian, in which I expressed the hope that he would be able to turn his season around and make a positive contribution to the team. However, in the formulation of that letter, I made a pretty severe miscalculation.
I made the assumption that Bernard Berrian still gave a rat's posterior about anyone other than himself.
Apparently, this is not the case.
The St. Paul Pioneer Press is reporting that the reason for Berrian's deactivation wasfor performance reasons, although Lord knows that performance reasons would be more than solid enough justification for it. No, it turns out that the reason was disciplinary . However, it had nothing to do with his Twitter exchange with Rep. John Kriesel earlier this week. Rather, it was because Berrian missed not one, but two meetings at the team hotel on Saturday. . .one for the team as a whole, and one that was offense-specific. . .leaving Frazier with little choice but to leave Berrian on the sidelines for Saturday's game. I mean, he doesn't even have the excuse of being in a road city where he might have gotten lost and gotten back late or something. . .no, this was for a home game, and dude simply didn't show up.
Seriously, you're a receiver on a team that was 0-4 going into Sunday's action that had two catches in the first four games, despite being on the field for over 200 snaps. And you're under the impression that you don't have to show up at meetings now? Particularly for a coach that has, inexplicably, justified and enabled your self-centered, "me first" behavior for the first four weeks of the year and has kept putting you out on the field despite the fact that you may, in fact, be the single least-productive player in the National Football League?
To hell with that, and to hell with Bernard Berrian. Devin Aromashodu showed more heart, fight, and guts in one game than Berrian has shown in the last year and a half. Did Aromashodu drop a pass or two? Yeah, he did. He also fought like hell on one of his receptions where Donovan McNabb scrambled around for a while and came back to him for a 21-yard pass, and made a very nice adjustment on a fluttering pass from McNabb that turned into a 60-yard pitch-and-catch to slow Arizona's momentum in the second half. I'd rather roll with a guy that has his ups and downs while fighting like heck than a guy that doesn't give a damn and apparently has a serious entitlement complex.
It's not as though he's not capable of hustling. . .after all, when he left his BlackBerry on an ATM in Las Vegas earlier this year, he had no problem with busting his tail to track it down. And when the folks at Kissing Suzy Kolber did some "mock tweets" after the Berrian/Kriesel confrontation, he showed some serious speed in slapping them with a lawsuit. But when it comes to the football field or something else that's related to the team? Nah, man. . .that's too much to ask for.
Seriously, if any of us were as bad at our job as Bernard Berrian has been at his for the last couple of seasons, our employers would have put us out on our rear ends a long time ago. . .especially if we had as many excuses as "B-Twice" seems to have. The fact that he made clear on Saturday that he, basically, doesn't even care, only makes things worse. If Berrian is as awesome as he keeps telling everybody he is, then he should have no trouble finding another job when the Vikings send him packing.
After the events of this weekend, I can only hope that we're significantly closer to that event taking place.
Wichita animal rescue group heading to Texas to assist in animal aid Copyright by KSNW - All rights reserved (KSN File Photo) [ + - ] Video
WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) - Tens of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes, and so have thousands of animals.
Beauties and Beasts animal rescue is planning on leaving for Texas Friday morning to head to the Houston area to rescue dogs.
"This will be a multi-step deal because we will go down and we'll do our first load which will be dogs that were already in shelters that don't have owners," explained Randi Carter, Beauties and Beasts. "Get them out of the way so people can get their Hurricane Harvey dogs into the shelter and give them time to actually get down there and find them."
Carter said she plans to take another trip at a later date to pick up dogs that were not picked up by their owners.
Side-by-side is a split-screen television presentation format originally introduced by sports network ESPN which allows the broadcast to show commercials and live sports simultaneously. It is primarily associated with ABC's telecasts of the IndyCar Series and ESPN's coverage of NASCAR. When used for NASCAR, it goes by the name of NASCAR Nonstop.[1]
While primarily associated with sports telecasts, the format has been used on other forms of broadcasting. CNN has also used a similar arrangement for commercial breaks during live news events.[2]
Background [ edit ]
The technology was adopted due to certain televised sports (such as auto racing and soccer) not having natural breaks in action to fit in commercial breaks. Sports such as football and baseball have timeouts and scheduled breaks, which allow for commercial time without viewers missing any actual game play. Auto racing had long suffered from commercial breaks interrupting live action, as races are never purposely halted outside of emergency situations. The only time during races which commercials could be shown without missing much action was during caution periods, but they are random and could not be counted on for regular intervals. In addition, the racing action technically does not stop during caution periods either, as competitive pit stops (an important aspect of the race) occur during yellow flag periods. However, with most networks such as FOX or ESPN, during side by side coverage it is seen that the screen with the commercials is 4 times bigger than the live sports screen. Fans complain that it should be equal size screen for both commercial and sports.
By network [ edit ]
ESPN and ABC [ edit ]
The technology uses a split-screen to show the feed of the live sports event on one side with no audio, while the traditional commercial is placed on the other side, with full audio. Typically, the square used for the commercial is larger and more prominent than that of the event. Sometimes, a small graphic showing the lap count and leaders' names accompanies the square, or the normal ticker is still shown in the layout. side-by-side is used during all national commercial breaks during the race but Side-by-Side is also used during local breaks.[3] Side-By-Side can also be used during the pre-race and the post-race segments. During red flag stoppage conditions, Side-by-Side has been used, but during lengthy delays, such as rain delay, commercials revert to traditional full-screen format.
ESPN first used Side-By-Side for an IndyCar event on March 19, 2005 during the Toyota Indy 300 at Homestead-Miami Speedway.[3][4] It was adopted for the entire season outside of Indianapolis. The format was first used for the Indianapolis 500 in 2006.
Starting in 2011, ESPN's coverage of the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Chase, began featuring the format.[1] Dubbed NASCAR Nonstop, the format was nearly identical to IndyCar's Side-by-Side. For NASCAR, however, the format was only to be used during the second half of the race.[5]
When Formula One returned to ESPN in 2018, ESPN used Sky Sports's UK coverage, and again used the format for its first broadcast. However, following heavy criticism from fans (at times cutting off the commentators when they were in the middle of sentences), ESPN televised the remaining races of the season with no commercial breaks starting from the Bahrain Grand Prix.
TNT [ edit ]
NASCAR on TNT used a modified split-screen format for their broadcast of the Coke Zero 400 at Daytona branded as "Wide-Open Coverage"; the running order ticker and all on-screen graphics were displayed in an enlarged panel at the buttom of the screen (race footage was displayed on the top portion of the screen). Commercials were instead shown in a box docked to the lower panel, while race footage continued to be displayed. Many of the commercials were unique and/or specially created for the race broadcast, and lasted up to 1–2 minutes in duration (as opposed to the 15-30 second duration of normal advertisements). Time was still provided for local ad breaks.[6]
The format was used from 2007 through 2012; the 2013 edition of the race discontinued the format.
NBCSN [ edit ]
Beginning in 2009, Versus, now known as NBCSN, became a new television partner with the IndyCar Series. During the race broadcast, they introduced IndyCar Non-Stop with a format and appearance nearly identical to that of Side-By-Side. The format has since been extended in 2013 to NBC/NBCSN's coverage of Formula One (branded as Formula One Non-Stop) until NBC lost the rights to ESPN for 2018, and again in 2015 in the networks' return to NASCAR (branded as NASCAR Non-Stop).
Fox [ edit ]
Fox, who started covering NASCAR[7] in 2001, resisted the use of the technology for many years. By about 2010, however, executives began exploring the concept.[7] In 2011, they conducted one experimental commercial break with a split-screen format.[7][8] Through 2011, Fox has preferred to air traditional, full-screen commercials, and if any action occurs during the break, their policy is to interrupt the commercial and return to the live action (e.g. at the 2013 Auto Club 400, the broadcast was in a commercial break when Clint Bowyer blew an engine and spun, so the feed immediately cut the commercial break right away; at the 2013 Aaron's 499, the feed was in commercial break when a crash occurred on lap 43). FOX returned to using the side-by-side coverage during the 2012 Daytona 500.
During coverage of the 2013 Cotton Bowl Classic, Fox experimented with a split-screen commercial format dubbed the Double Box.[9] During a natural game timeout stoppage, the broadcast showed a commercial in a prominent widescreen box, along with a small window in the upper right corner showing live game cameras. The empty space was filled with additional logos and graphics of the respective commercials. While the cameras were announced as 'never leaving the field,' the live action was limited mostly to teams in the huddle and no actual gameplay. They also adapted this for NASCAR broadcasts, starting at the 2013 Daytona 500.
Fox also used the side-by-side technology for purposes outside of sports: in 2013 and again in 2014 the network used its Double Box during live broadcasts of American Idol, showing a live camera feed with footage of the “Idol” stage, judges' table and backstage area, alongside commercial messages.[10][11]
RDS and TSN ( Canada [ edit ]
The French Canadian sports channel Réseau des sports (RDS, the French sister network of TSN), which is partially owned by ESPN, adopted a Side-By-Side-styled split-screen for its Formula One race coverage beginning in 2006. As TSN simulcasts the British feed, it was able to initially use ITV's commercial breaks. With the transfer of F1 rights to the BBC (and the fact that the BBC feed does not contain commercial breaks), Side-By-Side was introduced for F1 races on TSN beginning in 2009.
TSN also uses split-screen commercial breaks whenever it is simulcasting an ESPN event that uses Side-By-Side. During the Coke Zero 400, commercial breaks created by its "Wide Open Coverage" are also implemented using the setup.
Golf Channel [ edit ]
In October 2013, Golf Channel introduced a side-by-side style split-screen known as playing through during the final two hours of coverage of the final four European Tour events of the season.[12]
Criticism [ edit ]
Side-By-Side and its similar counterparts have been generally received with positive reviews from viewers, sponsors, and sanctioning bodies.[3][13] It has been criticized by others.[14]
The format receives criticism because it potentially devalues the advertisements, costing networks revenues, and waning the interest of the advertisers.[1] In addition, it has led to speculation that a similar technology might be implemented for in-game advertisements.[9]
Outside the United States [ edit ]
Since 2016, Brazilian channel Rede Globo has used a similar format. It's mainly used in F1 coverages, when they minimize the live screen and show the commercial around the live screen. They also use that format in football matches.
Louis has won contracts to supply supermarkets with his chocolates
Louis Barnett, from Kinver, Staffs, left school aged 11 after being diagnosed with dyslexia and dyspraxia and began making chocolates at home.
New contracts have meant he has had to expand his firm Chokolit and has moved to a factory in Bridgnorth, Shropshire.
He has taken on new staff, including his parents Phil and Mary Barnett.
Louis has been like this right from day one, he is a hard worker and is very enthusiastic about his product
Mary Barnett, mother
Louis said: "I've always been a very foody person and conscious of where my food comes from.
"I've been doing bits of baking and making cakes with my mum since I was about four or five and really it was just one of my passions."
The young entrepreneur started out with a 12oz (340 gram) chocolate machine, making one mould at a time for family and friends.
'Huge risk'
Now he produces hundreds of chocolates and has won contracts to supply Sainsbury's and Waitrose at Christmas.
His dad Phil quit his job to work with Louis and the 15-year-old's former home tutor Jan is also employed at the confectionery firm.
Mary Barnett said: "Louis has been like this right from day one, he is a hard worker and is very enthusiastic about his product.
"It's a huge risk, Phil has given up his job and we've put a lot of money in, but we believe that he'll do it."
WASHINGTON — Former presidents get lucrative book deals and high-paid speaking gigs. So there's no need for taxpayers to support them to the degree that the federal government has done in the past.
That's the reasoning behind legislation that the House backed on Monday slightly reducing the government pension of former presidents and capping how much they can bill taxpayers for office expenses and staff. The measure passed by voice vote.
Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.), the bill's sponsor, says the lifestyle of former presidents means taxpayers can pay less. He said President Bill Clinton earned more than $100 million in speaking fees after leaving office while President George W. Bush received $10 million for a book deal.
“Because of these opportunities, it's no longer necessary to provide taxpayer-funded support to former presidents in the same way as envisioned in 1958,” Hice said.
Similar legislation passed in the last Congress, but President Barack Obama vetoed it. He said it didn't provide enough transition time for compliance, but that he supported the concept of the bill and was willing to work with lawmakers on it.
The measure sets the pension for former presidents at $200,000 annually. It currently is $205,700. The bill also sets the office allowance at $500,000, but that amount shrinks in ensuing years, eventually to $250,000, and possibly even more depending on how much income a former president earns.
A gray pick-up truck speeds up to the metal gate at the entrance to Shilo, a Jewish settlement halfway between the Palestinian cities of Ramallah and Nablus and which is home to 2,500 people.
Dror Etkes, 41, puts on sunglasses and a blue cap. He is hoping not to be recognized. Settlers in the West Bank consider Etkes, who has spent more than nine years making note of every new house built in the more than 120 Israeli settlements here, their number one enemy. A settlers' newspaper once printed his picture with the caption "Dror Etkes, head of the peace movement's intelligence service."
So Etkes employs various tricks to gain admittance to the settlements. Nearly every one of them, for example, contains a minimarket. When the guard at the Shilo gate asks where he's headed, Etkes replies, looking bored, "To the minimarket." The guard believes him and opens the metal gate.
'A Bad Joke'
Just a couple hundred meters on, Etkes finds what he's looking for -- a "For Sale" sign advertising "10 family homes." From the top of a hill, Etkes watches Palestinian workers who are using wooden slats to prepare a framework for concrete. "The foundations are from December," Etkes states knowledgeably and clicks his camera shutter button.
Now Etkes has further proof that there has not in fact been a "freeze" on settlement building since November, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would have the world believe. In any case, the Israeli cabinet also made exceptions in the moratorium for public buildings such as synagogues and preschools, as well as allowing private homes already under construction to be completed.
The settlers' administration of Samaria in the northern part of the West Bank thus issued permits for 1,600 housing units -- nearly 10 times as many as in the previous year -- before the moratorium began. Etkes' latest research shows that settlers have also begun new construction projects since the moratorium took effect. At least 46 of the 120 official settlements are currently carrying out construction, the left-wing activist says. "Talking about a moratorium is just a bad joke."
Praising Netanyahu's Restraint
US President Barack Obama, on the other hand, praised Netanyahu for his "restraint" on the settlement question during the Israeli prime minister's visit to Washington two weeks ago. That comment struck Palestinian leaders in Ramallah as mockery, especially as it emerged around the same time that many of the settlements have the American tax system to thank for their development.
According to research by the New York Times, pro-settler groups have raised over $200 million (155 million) in the last 10 years. Such foundations in the United States can be exempted from taxes as long as they benefit "educational, religious or charitable" causes.
This raises some important questions. Do foundations deserve tax breaks even while pursuing clear foreign policy aims? And what happens when their aims run contrary to those of the US government?
Representatives of the foundations in question offer placating words. Sondra Baras from Christian Friends of Israel Communities (CFOIC), for example, says that her organization "does not have a political agenda." The organization, which is based in Colorado Springs, is tax exempt. "CFOIC does not advocate any particular political solution to the problems in the Middle East," she told SPIEGEL. "The support is ideological and Biblical in nature, not political."
'Humanitarian in Nature'
Steven Orlow, president of the One Israel Fund, another tax-exempted pro-settler group based in Hewlett, New York, makes similar comments.
"The activities of the One Israel Fund are exclusively limited to affecting 'quality of life' issues, the primary stress being on preventing the loss of Jewish life," he says. "The perception from our side of the Atlantic is that Europeans may well find the effort to save Jewish lives as political. From the American perspective, this is generally considered humanitarian in nature."
In reality, though, these foundations are unwilling to condone a separate state for Palestinians. "CFOIC does not have a political agenda, but it does support the right of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel," Baras says. "For thousands of years, this land has been called the Land of Israel and the Jewish people are the only people on this earth who have prayed and yearned for centuries to return to this land."
**Update** After writing this article, and sending it to Twitter, they subsequently suspended up to 1800 accounts and are investigating more.
The recent de-nationalisation of Isa Qasim, Bahrain's most prominent Shia cleric, sparked a massive public reaction in Bahrain and across the globe. The move, which made Isa Qasim stateless (ironically on World Refugee Day), is a common one in Bahrain. The government frequently remove the citizenship of those they deem to be dissidents.
As is the case with any public outcry, it didn't take long before it reached Twitter. However, Twitter activity related to the Isa Qasim incident indicates that there are automated Twitter accounts attempting to justify the decision against Qasim. This, in turn, implies that a company, country, individual, or individuals, are using software to distort the informationscape by generating sectarian, anti-Shia, and anti-Iranian propaganda.
Why suspicious?
How did this suspicion arise? If you look at the below screenshot, you will notice a number of things. That is, there are numerous accounts all tweeting at similar times, the exact same text, without a suggestion of a retweet. These all appeared after I searched for ‘Isa Qasim' on Twitter.
My curiosity piqued, I pulled some data from Twitter. Specifically, I requested from the Twitter API Tweets that included the phrase ‘Isa Qasim' (I did other searches in Arabic and with different English spellings of Qasim, but let's stick with this particularly one). I got 628 tweets back from the past few days. Of these, 219 were the exact same Tweet. That is, tweets with the text ‘Isa Qasim, the #Shiite #terrorist, telling followers to annihilate #Bahrain's Security Forces'. I then copied these 219 tweets and put them in a separate spreadsheet for easier analysis. See below for a screenshot
Evidence to suggest these are fake accounts, or automated
There are a number of things that suggest quite strongly that the tweets are automated and the accounts managed by either a machine or a small number of people.
Every one of those Tweets, with the exception of the first, (the original Tweet which was presumably copied), was launched from Tweet Deck – a program favoured by marketeers that allows one to manage multiple accounts from a single machine. In this case, this was the original: All the accounts have a similar, low number of followers and people they follow. All of the accounts were created in either February, March, June, or July of 2014, with the exception of a few, which were all created 18th or 19th February 2016. The accounts created in 2014 were also created across a span of two or three consecutive days within the same month. Here is an example: For those accounts created in February 2014, 7 were created on the 4th, while 10 were created on the 5th. For those created in March, 10 accounts were created on the 2nd march, 12 created on 3rd March, six created on 4th, 14 on 5th March etc. You get the picture… Accounts created on the same day tend to have a similar number of tweets. E.g. those accounts created on 2nd February 2014 all have about 400 Tweets to their name, all those created in March 2014 have about 3,500, and all those created in June 2014 have about 7000. Obviously this figure will change, yet the correlation between the date of account creation and number of tweets is interesting, especially given that the older accounts actually have fewer Tweets. The apparent anomalous accounts, created in 2016, are actually anything but. The interesting thing about those accounts is that, unlike the other accounts, which have no biographical information or banner photo, the ones created in 2016 do have a bio, and a header image. What's more, of the 43 accounts created in 2016, 14 were created on the 18th February, while the remainder were created on 19th February. Thus not only were they created on consecutive days like the other accounts, they bore the same characteristics of header image and biographical information. The biographical information that does occur is fairly generic. By doing a crudish corpus-based aggregation, and after removing a lot of commonly occurring prepositions, the most common word is ‘Allah', and various other religious idioms or pleasantries. See the below word cloud.
9. When you copy one of the Arabic Tweets, and paste it into Twitter's search facility, you get the Top Tweet, which in this case is the person who usually first Tweets it. What almost always happens is that the first person to Tweet the information was also one of the suspicious accounts. In particular, a lot of the recent tweets seem to originate with those suspicious accounts that were set up in 2016.
While this might just be a phenomenon within a cycle relating to recent tweets, it is more likely that the new accounts, which look more credible (i.e. have banner picture and biographical information) are control accounts, that mimic more credible sources, and are then copied by the rest of the bots. The only exception I have found so far is that the very few Tweets in English were copied from accounts that look legitimate. In addition to the English tweet examined above, another recent one included the text ‘The decision is a legal matter based on article 10c of # Bahrain's Nationality # law , codified within Bahrain's constitution'. This was written by Fawaz Al Khalifa, Bahrain's Minister of Information, and presumably copied. The majority of the Tweets are in Arabic.
They all Tweet the same, but what do they Tweet?
Twitter limits API requests to Tweets that have occurred in the past week or so. However, we can still go to the individual accounts and look at their content for an insight into their most recent concerns, which will logically reflect the ideology of whoever is behind them. Since all these accounts appear to copy from a Master Tweet, they are all essentially Tweeting the exact same Tweets, albeit at different rates, times, and frequencies (presumably this is to give an air of human agency). However, if you take two random accounts from the above list, and extract their tweets from the past week, arrange them in alphabetical order or date order, you will see they essentially tweet the same things. The homogeneity again adds credence that they are bots with a specific, collective agenda.
The discourse ?
Although the big data only goes back a week, we can see most of the Tweets bunch around the same thing. They condemn ‘terrorist' acts in Saudi's mostly Shia Eastern province, and acts by the ‘Shia' opposition in Bahrain. I use the term Shia here because it is mentioned frequently, as are derogatory terms, such as Rawafid (A term used to mean the Shia are ‘rejectionists' of the true Islamic faith).This Tweet, for example, ‘رد قوي من شاعر سعودي على روافض', translates as ‘strong response from Saudi poet against the Rawafid' (A video was attached of the poem in question). Often times, Iran is invoked, or the concept of fitna (discord). I won't go into too much detail about the exact content of the tweets but anyone is welcome to the data.
The relevant thing is that hundreds of what seem to be automated Twitter accounts are repeating propaganda that conflates acts of violence, terrorism, and unrest, with both Arab Shia and Iran. This strongly suggests that institutions, people, or agencies, with significant resources, are deliberately creating divisive, anti-Shia sectarian propaganda and disseminating it in a robotic, but voluminous fashion. The problems here are numerous, yet such accounts can not only contribute to sectarianism (hard to infer causal relations from this), but create the impression that polices, such as the denationalisation of Isa Qasim, have widespread popular support.
It is also interesting to note that among the many hashtags used by these accounts are Da'ish, the derogatory term used to describe the Islamic State. It could be that they wish to tap into that wider audience, in the hope that the message gets out – entirely possible given the generous hashtagging the accounts engage in. While the notion of bot accounts is probably not news to anyone, the evidence here hopefully highlights that much online sectarian discourse is perhaps inflated by those groups or individuals with specific ideological agendas, and the means to do so. Of course we know PR and reputation management companies offer such services, yet their work is often done secretively and behind close doors. Would be interesting to find out who is behind this.
It would also suggest that Twitter need to better regulate spam. On the plus side, if an account looks suspicious, you have an idea of what to look for in terms of date creation, Tweet numbers etc. Happy blocking 🙂

President Donald Trump meets with, from left, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other Congressional leaders in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Sept. 6, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on Congress and DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (all times local):
11:45 p.m.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says President Donald Trump supports and would sign into law legislation that offers a path to legalization for immigrants brought to the country as children and living here illegally.
The California Democrat told journalists that Trump signaled his backing in a White House meeting with congressional leaders on Wednesday and in conversation with her Thursday.
Pelosi says: “Obviously it has to be bipartisan; the president said he supports that, he would sign it, but we have to get it passed and that's a high priority.”
Trump is ending the Obama-era program that gave nearly 800,000 immigrants temporary work permits and deportation protections. He gave Congress six months to come up with an alternative.
___
10:33 a.m.
It turns out President Donald Trump sent his reassuring tweet about so-called “Dreamers” at the urging of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California.
Pelosi revealed the news to fellow Democratic House members at a meeting Thursday morning. She says she spoke to Trump by phone and asked him to tweet to make clear that “Dreamers” wouldn't be subject to deportation during the six months Trump has given Congress to find a solution for them.
That's according to a Democratic aide who was not authorized to publicly discuss the private meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity.
At issue is Trump's plan to dismantle protections for younger immigrants who were brought illegally to the country as kids.
___
10:16 a.m.
President Donald Trump is trying to reassure the hundreds of thousands of immigrants in a program his administration announced it is ending.
“For all of those (DACA) that are concerned about your status during the 6 month period, you have nothing to worry about - No action!” he tweeted.
He is referring to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which President Barack Obama created by executive order in 2012. Trump's administration said Tuesday it is rescinding the program but is giving Congress six months to take action on it.
Trump is navigating politically tricky waters. Portions of his Republican voters wanting a hard line on illegal immigration. Yet others in his administration and a majority of Americans support protected status for children brought to the country illegally by their parents.
It's no secret that we like to build things using Ruby here at Kontena, Inc. headquarters. And when it comes to web applications, Ruby on Rails is still one of the best frameworks out there. It's great to use because it is a full web application stack with nice conventions and excellent tools.
But usually all the fun stops when it's time to ship that Rails application using Docker. Although I have to admit; nowadays it's relatively simple if you just pick official rails base image and customize it to your application needs. This convenience comes with a steep price: your application image is getting really fat since Rails base image starts at 772MB. Sometimes this is not acceptable. So how can we put our Rails app to diet?
Diet Recipe: Alpine Linux
Our goal is to create most minimal, but fully featured Rails application image. To achieve that we need to start from a really small base image. Alpine Linux fits that bill and as a bonus it comes with nice package manager. Alpine image is unbelievable tiny, weighting only 5MB.
For the demo purposes let's use ruby-rails-sample from Heroku.
Let's start to build Dockerfile by defining base image:
FROM alpine:3.2
Then we need to update package manager index and install all necessary packages that our application needs to run. We combine these to single RUN command so that Docker does not need to create unnecessary image layers:
RUN apk update && apk --update add ruby ruby-irb ruby-json ruby-rake \ ruby-bigdecimal ruby-io-console libstdc++ tzdata postgresql-client nodejs
Next we add our Rails application Gemfile and Gemfile.lock .
ADD Gemfile /app/ ADD Gemfile.lock /app/
After Gemfiles are in place, we add one magical RUN command. First part adds all the build dependencies as a virtual group named build-dependencies . Second part installs bundler and runs bundle install command that installs all our application dependencies. After all gems are installed we finally remove virtual package group.
RUN apk --update add --virtual build-dependencies build-base ruby-dev openssl-dev \ postgresql-dev libc-dev linux-headers && \ gem install bundler && \ cd /app ; bundle install --without development test && \ apk del build-dependencies
Why we need to combine all these commands to a single run clause? This trick ensures that virtual group ( build-dependencies ) packages does not grow image at all. The extra "fat" comes only from the installed gems.
Finally we add application sources to image, chown them to nobody user and switch container exec user also to nobody (because we don't really need root user here) and define default command to be executed when container starts.
ADD . /app RUN chown -R nobody:nogroup /app USER nobody ENV RAILS_ENV production WORKDIR /app CMD ["bundle", "exec", "unicorn", "-p", "8080", "-c", "./config/unicorn.rb"]
Now the Dockerfile is done. See the complete Dockerfile below:
FROM alpine:3.2 MAINTAINER jari@kontena.io RUN apk update && apk --update add ruby ruby-irb ruby-json ruby-rake \ ruby-bigdecimal ruby-io-console libstdc++ tzdata postgresql-client nodejs ADD Gemfile /app/ ADD Gemfile.lock /app/ RUN apk --update add --virtual build-dependencies build-base ruby-dev openssl-dev \ postgresql-dev libc-dev linux-headers && \ gem install bundler && \ cd /app ; bundle install --without development test && \ apk del build-dependencies ADD . /app RUN chown -R nobody:nogroup /app USER nobody ENV RAILS_ENV production WORKDIR /app CMD ["bundle", "exec", "unicorn", "-p", "8080", "-c", "./config/unicorn.rb"]
With our Dockerfile in place, we can build it:
$ docker build -t ruby-rails-sample .
After build is complete, we can check the resulted image size:
$ docker images | grep ruby-rails-sample ruby-rails-sample latest 9549afd8770e 1 minute ago 72.96 MB
~73MB, not bad if compared to official Rails base image that can easily grow to over one gigabyte.
We are using these same practices to produce Docker images for our open source project Kontena - a new "developer first" Docker container orchestration platform written in Ruby. Although, our images are using slimmer Ruby framework called Roda.

Russia will deploy its own orbital space station in 2017, using parts of modules originally destined for the International Space Station (ISS), according to Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper.
The latest development follows an announcement by the country's deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin earlier this year that Russia would not use the ISS after 2020, Sputnik reported, citing the Kommersant report, which cited a source close to the Central Research Institute of Machine Building, which is administrated by the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos).
“The new station will be located in a geometrically favorable location with the possibility of an extended field of view of the Earth's surface,” the source told Kommersant. “As much as 90 percent of Russia's territory and the Arctic offshore area will be visible from the new space station, while the ISS' field of view covers not more than 5 percent of the region.”
According to the Kommersant report, one of the principal tasks of the space station will be to test spacecraft bound for the moon. The spacecraft would be first delivered to the space station, before an attempt to reach the moon.
The newspaper said that the project's costs are as yet uncertain, but added, citing sources, that modules and devices developed for the Russian segment of the ISS would initially be used for the project, helping Moscow avoid additional costs.
In May, Rogozin announced that Russia would deny use of the ISS' Russian segment to the U.S. after 2020, and ban the use of Russian-made rocket engines for launching U.S. military satellites, in an apparent response to American sanctions imposed on Russia over the crisis in eastern Ukraine.
“The Russian segment can exist independently from the American one. The U.S. one cannot,” Rogozin said at the time. “After 2020, we would like to divert these funds [used for ISS] to more promising space projects.”
Online auction of Kingfisher House was managed by an arm of the state-run State Bank of India.
Highlights Auction for Kingfisher House opens and closes without anyone bidding Base price of Rs. 150 crore too high, say sources An arm of the state-run State Bank of India was conducting the e-auction
An online auction of one of Vijay Mallya's flagship properties in Mumbai, Kingfisher House, opened and closed today without any bidders.The base price of Rs 150 crore for the office at Andheri in Mumbai's western suburbs was "too high", say sources.The e-auction was managed by an arm of the state-run State Bank of India, one of the 17 banks trying to recover at least a billion dollars loaned to Mr Mallya's grounded Kingfisher Airlines.On Friday, Mr Mallya has been summoned for questioning as part of an investigation related to one of the bank loans.Sources in the Enforcement Directorate, which has summoned Mr Mallya, say "it has to be a personal appearance, he can't send his lawyer."Mr Mallya is reportedly in the UK amid attempts to recover over Rs 9,000 crore loaned to Kingfisher Airlines, which stopped operating in 2012. "I am not an absconder," the businessman tweeted last week.The banks had asked the Supreme Court to stop Mr Mallya from travelling abroad but the government told the court that he had left the country on March 2.On a request from the banks, a court recently put on hold the payment of $75 million or 515 crores by Diageo to Mr Mallya as part of a settlement under which the liquor baron would step down as the chairman of United Spirits.Ranked the 45th-richest Indian with a net worth of $1 billion by Forbes in March 2012, Mr Mallya is known to have lavish homes in Mumbai, Goa, Delhi and also London. His flamboyant lifestyle also features a fleet of luxury cars and a yacht. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who was targeted by the Congress in Parliament over the tycoon's "escape", said: "Every penny from Mallya will be recovered."
An enemy of the American people came into my office Friday night to talk about a story he was working on.
The story was about a 17-year-old kid involved in a controversy at his school. The enemy of the people was concerned because the kid is going through a difficult time. Telling the story could make things worse. In the end, the enemy of the people decided to keep gathering information but not rush to publication.
Just before that conversation, I had spent a couple of hours talking to aspiring enemies of the people from the University of Texas Enemies of the People School. A half-dozen of them had come from Austin to interview for the one-year fellowships we award to young enemies who are interested in working in our Washington, D.C., and Austin bureaus.
One enemy of the people mentioned she takes a full class schedule, has a leadership role at the student newspaper and logs 20 hours a week at a news organization in Austin. I asked her whether she came from a family of enemies of the people, and she said yes, as a matter of fact, her mother was an enemy of the people, but she died a couple of months ago. I said I was sorry and she said, “It's OK,” but I knew it was not OK and will never be OK.
In my job I oversee about 250 enemies of the people. We have enemies of the people who make maps, cover high school baseball, send tweets about the Cowboys, assign book reviews, critique restaurants, track North Texas home prices and write profiles of tech entrepreneurs. One enemy of the people spends his days talking to grieving families and carefully crafting the stories of the dead.
As we cruise down the highway with our bros in Final Fantasy XV, it's worth reflecting on the notable bromances and friendships throughout the series. Final Fantasy has a strong lineage of bros and I've collected some of the best of the bunch so you can learn what it means to be a real bro.
Luneth and Arc (Final Fantasy III)
These two bros have a pretty good thing going on. Arc's a timid kid but whenever he gets picked on, Luneth is there to have his back. Because that's what bros do. When both are chosen to be Warriors of Light, they fight bravely to defeat the evil Cloud of Darkness. Having accomplished their task, the two just head right back home to do bro things like sitting far away from each other in the hot tub and sharing brewskis.
Kain and Cecil (Final Fantasy IV)
These bros have a pretty rough relationship but that's ok, bro! It happens to the best of us. Cecil is a dark knight from the Kingdom of Baron. Kain is their best Dragoon. After the two bros are tricked into blowing up a village of summoners, they part ways. Which sucks because Kain totally gets mind controlled by the villainous Golbez.
But Cecil knows that there's still good in Kain, bro. He can fight back, bro! When Kain is finally free from his mind control, Cecil welcomes him back. After that, he's a valuable party member. Once a bro, always a bro!
Bro pulls a bit of a chump move by not showing up to Cecil and Rosa's wedding though...
Sabin And His Muscles (Final Fantasy VI)
Sabin is Edgar's twin brother and one of the princes of the Kingdom of Figaro. After his brother rigged a coin toss so that Sabin could enjoy a life free from obligations to the throne, Sabin ran off and got buff as hell. How buff? Mother fucker suplexed a train!
He's not the smartest bro of the bunch but he's super reliable, building a friendship with the samurai Cyan and wild boy Gau. If you ever need someone to help you move into a new apartment or spot you at the gym, Sabin's your bro.
Reno and Rude (Final Fantasy VII)
Professional bros. Reno and Rude are members of the Turks and act as shady intelligence agents for the evil Shinra Power Compay. It's just a day job though and when they're not busy pulling the trigger for a few extra ducats, they're off vacationing or just having a good time.
These bros have a great attitude about their lot in life. Cloud and his party beat the shit out of them time and time again but they don't really hold a grudge. If given the chance, they actually back away from the final fight with the party. Presumably, they smoke a bit and listen to some bitchin' tunes.
Heck, they even return to help everyone out in Advent Children. Turns out these bros are pretty cool after all.
Zack and Cloud (Final Fantasy VII)
Oh gosh, gang. Where to begin with these bros? Zack is basically the nicest person ever. He's a SOLDIER for Shinra. Kind of like a cross between a knight and a black ops agent. Cloud totally wants to be a SOLDIER but didn't make the cut. Bummer, bro.
But Zack's super cool and takes time to encourage Cloud. When they both end up assigned to a mission to Cloud's hometown of Nibelheim, things seem cool until that Sephiroth dude gets upset. He burns down the town and nearly kills everyone until Cloud stop him.
After that, the two are experimented on by Shinra. Cloud's in rough shape but Zack gets him out of there and drags his catatonic arse as far as he can. When there's nowhere left to run, Zack goes out fighting to save his bro.
It's a bit more complicated from here but basically Cloud thinks his bro is so cool that he starts acting like his bro to cope with all of his loss. That's hardcore.
Biggs and Wedge (Final Fantasy VIII)
Biggs and Wedge are low tier soldiers for the Galbadian army. Biggs is the alpha bro and Wedge is cool with that. They get all the crummy jobs. They guard a communications dish between being knocked off it by wind demon. They are demoted and have to work at an even crummier jail only to have Squalled and everyone break out. That's, like, rough shit bro.
They just can't get a break. But no matter what, they stick together. Fed up with the crappy time they have had in the army, the pair quit and walk off into the sunset. Get yourself a bro that looks at you the way that Wedge looks at Biggs, gang.
Marcus and Blank (Final Fantasy IX)
Tantalus is professional actors and thieves. They're all pretty great but Blank and Marcus are probably the closest bros. Blank helps the party escape the Evil Forest but is petrified and turned into stone. Marcus, being the best bro ever, spends a huge portion of the game on his own quest to find a 'Supersoft' in order to save his stoned friend.
After that, they immediately rush to help fellow bro Zidane and the rest of the party escape the clutches of the bad guys. That's some hardcore dedication that shows exactly why Blank and Marcus are such great bros.
Luzzu and Gatta (Final Fantasy X)
This is a sad one, gang. Luzzu and Gatta are Crusaders volunteering to protect folks from monsters. When the time comes for a big offensive against the unstoppable Sin, they're both eager and willing to do their party to defeat the beast for good.
It doesn't work out. Depending on some player choices, either Luzzu or Gatta will die. The survivor doesn't take it well. Can you blame them? Losing a bro sucks. But the important thing is that they eventually snap out of their funk and work to train new Crusaders to carry on the legacy of their fallen bro.
Vaan and Balthier (Final Fantasy XII)
Vaan wants to be a sky pirate. Hell, I want to be a sky pirate. So when he meets Balthier during a robbery of the royal palace, it's the chance of a lifetime. They keep things low key. Balthier lets Vaan make his own mistakes all the while imparting simple tips from time to time.
By the end of it, he trusts Vaan enough to pilot his airship. That's kind of a big deal. All of Balthier's advice helps Vaan grow into a pretty damn good pirate. Thanks, bro!
Snow and the Whole Goddamn World (Final Fantasy XIII)
Snow's an idiot but he's our idiot. Questing to rescue his fiancée, he stumbles into a lot of trouble but always encourages people to work hard. Wherever he goes and whoever he is with, Snow is a bro who really believes in you.
He also throws bitching parties. After a complicated series of events that sees the end of the world and the complete destruction of time, Snow spends most of Lightning Returns as the patron of the city of Yuusnaan. People go there to drink, eat, fuck, and basically have a great time. Great party, brah! You're not the worst after all.
Ramza and Delita (Final Fantasy Tactics)
Talking politics with your bro can be a disaster sometimes. These two don't completely make it work but they do better than most in Tactics. Delita was a commoner taken in by Ramza's noble family. After losing his sister to the machination of other nobles, including Ramza's brother, he sets out on a quest to game the system, get rid of the fat cats, and become king.
Ramza's on his own mission to defeat a host of demons who infiltrated the Church. It's difficult but the two help each other from time to time. Some of Ramza's greatest foes are also Delita's political enemies. Some of Delita's political rivals are helping the evil demons. When one bro helps themselves, they also help the other.
It's a pretty good arrangement although neither one of them completely gets what they want. Ramza stops the demons but is marked as a heretic by history. Delita becomes king but may or may not be stabbed to death by his queen. Still, even in those last moments, Delita thinks of his bro.
Noctis, Ignis, Gladio, and Prompto (Final Fantasy XV)
These boys are perfect bros. They chill together, play video games together, cook each other food, and fight reawakened behemoths together. Noctis might be a prince but that doesn't get between him and the rest of the gang.
I won't give more details here but suffice it to say that these bros go through some serious shit and throughout it all, they are totally by each other's side.
Under London's streets lies a hidden gold mine.
It stretches across more than 300,000 square feet under the City, the finance quarter in the heart of Britain's capital. There, beneath the pavement and commuters of Threadneedle Street, lies a maze of eight Bank of England gold vaults – each stacked with gold bars worth a total sum of around £141 billion ($200 billion).
The bars sit on rows of blue numbered shelves. Every bar weighs precisely 400 troy ounces (about 12kg), making each currently worth some £350,000 ($500,000), comfortably more than the average price of a house in the UK. Each bar looks subtly different depending on where it was refined. Some bars have sloping edges to make them easier to pick up; others look more like a loaf of bread.
There is no smell here: metal has none. There is no noise, either, on account of the vaults' thick concrete walls.
What there is, however, is one of the world's most important traded assets. Deals are still done in gold in almost every country in the world. Its price is a crucial barometer for consumer confidence. Prices rise when markets are uncertain, and before US elections – like now.
“Gold is a hedge against uncertainty,” says Jonathan Spall, a long-time gold trader and now managing director of G Cubed Metal.
These vaults lie right at the heart of this volatile, incredibly important market.
About one-fifth of all the gold held by the world's governments is in London
About one-fifth of all the gold held by the world's governments is in London. In total, 6,256 tonnes of gold are stored in vaults in and around London – collectively worth about £172 billion ($248 billion).
The Bank of England vaults alone hold 5,134 tonnes, including the official reserves of the UK Treasury and the vast majority of the physical gold traded in London. Gold owned by 30 other countries is also in these vaults along with the hoards of about 25 banks.
So much gold is kept in Britain's capital partly to keep it near where the metal is traded. It's also a reflection of the security of London's vaults.
Hiding your stash
The Bank of England vaults were built in the 1930s. During World War II, when Britain's bullion was secretly moved to Canada to continue the war effort if Britain was overrun, one vault was used as a staff canteen for Bank of England employees. Vintage advertisements for the P&O cruise line, enticing Bank employees away to holiday, are still plastered across the walls. Later, in the 1940s, the vault was used as a bomb shelter.
But since 1945, the vaults have been used primarily for gold.
Storing your assets in a huge safe might seem more fitting for a Tudor monarchy than a modern central bank
Storing your assets in a huge safe might seem more fitting for a Tudor monarchy than a modern central bank. But the Bank of England still uses not only vaults, but several 3ft-long keys for access. Insiders believe that electronic access alone could be more prone to abuse. (You do still have to speak a password into a microphone and a computer matches your voice against a saved sample).
The bars arrive in London by surprisingly traditional methods, too. Some come by sea, shipped from refineries like PAMP in Switzerland or Rand Refinery outside Johannesburg in South Africa.
In the cargo hold of commercial passenger planes, you often find gold, fresh flowers, and dead bodies – Ruth Crowell
Gold is also moved on regular passenger aeroplanes. “In the cargo hold of commercial passenger planes, you often find gold, fresh flowers, and dead bodies,” says Ruth Crowell, chief executive of the London Bullion Market Association.
But more difficult than finding transport can be finding a place to house it. Because much of the City of London is on clay ground and because gold is such a dense substance, you can only stack the bars so high before the vault starts sinking into the clay, Crowell says. (The weight of a City skyscraper is spread over a larger footprint, which makes that risk less likely).
This is less of a problem in other cities. In Manhattan, which sits on bedrock, the Federal Reserve Bank can stack bars from floor to ceiling.
As a result, there are restrictions on how much gold can be stacked in the Bank's vaults. On the top level, the gold bars can only be stacked four pallets high. On the lower, they can only be stacked up to six.
This means London needs to spread out its gold more to stop it sinking, and needs more vaults of smaller sizes.
Each owner attempts to keep their vault's location secret
As a result, it isn't just the City's streets that are paved with gold. There are seven smaller vaults inside the M25 (the motorway that encircles Greater London) owned by banks like JP Morgan and HSBC, including three at transport companies around Heathrow Airport.
Each owner attempts to keep their vault's location secret. When CNBC journalists visited JP Morgan in 2011, for example, they had to surrender their mobile phones and travel in a car with blacked-out windows.
Getting your gold fix
It isn't just vault locations that are kept under wraps. The gold market itself is secretive and steeped in tradition and ritual, particularly around the fixing system used for setting the price.
The price setting meetings or “fixes” – in which there are now 12 direct participants hailing from the UK, US, Canada, China and France – take place twice a day. When a price matches supply and demand, the price is fixed.
If a participant wished to pause proceedings, he would raise a small UK flag
Until 2015, this was done verbally: a chairman would try different prices on the participants, each of whom would say if, at that price, they would be buyers or sellers. From 1919 until 2004 fixes were done in person in the City of London. Originally, if a participant wished to pause proceedings – to change between buying and selling, for example – he would raise a small UK flag.
In 2004, the fixes were moved to a conference call. Only last year did the system change to a more modern electronic auction platform run by the Intercontinental Exchange, which also owns the New York Stock Exchange.
“If everyone knows there are two key points in the day to show up, you get the best liquidity balance between buying and selling,” says Matthew Glenville, chief operating officer of the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration.
This ‘spot' price is then used as a benchmark for people buying and selling gold around the world, a market where transactions total around £85 billion ($120 billion) a day.
Portable assets
During good times, gold is less in demand. But when the economy is tough, the metal is highly prized as a safe haven asset – not quite like storing cash under the mattress, but still a way to hedge against risk in other markets.
Since the 1,000-point Dow Jones plunge of August 2015, the average price of the morning fix has increased each month
As a result, gold increases in value when markets are volatile. Since the 1,000-point Dow Jones plunge of August 2015, the average price of the morning fix has increased each month, rising from £705 ($1,000) in December to £870 ($1,250) in March. When stock markets slump, governments and private investors ditch equities and buy gold – like Russia and China are doing now.
Even so, only 32% of the world's yellow metal is actually held by governments, banks and investors under lock and key. About 12% is used industrially, such as in electronics circuits. And more than half is used for jewellery.
China and India are particularly significant markets for jewellery, together accounting for half of world demand. In India alone, an average of 30 to 40 grams of gold are purchased for each of the country's 10 million weddings each year.
“China and India, between the two of them, accounted for less than 10% of global demand in 2000,” says Ross Norman, chief executive of the bullion dealer Sharps Pixley. “Now it's north of 90%.”
With the current volatility of major currencies and stock markets, it's little surprise that gold has returned to fashion. One sign? The opening of London's first high street gold showroom in January.
Sharps Pixley is located directly across from the private clubs White's and Boodle's in the heart of the upmarket St James's neighbourhood. The building, which is owned by The Apprentice star Lord Sugar, has an exclusive and club-like interior with dark timber, brass and a large chandelier.
If you want to get your hands on some bullion today, Sharps Pixley sells gold over the counter, in bars ranging from a kilogram (£28,058) down to one gram (£33.89).
But with prices on the increase, you'd best bring your gold card.

Suwido Limin was a longtime University of Palangkaraya professor who founded a volunteer firefighting brigade and spent two months in the field during last year's haze crisis.
After the fires last year, his condition worsened, and he was diagnosed with cancer in February.
Limin, an ethic Dayak, also helped draft a regulation on indigenous rights in Central Kalimantan that has been submitted to the provincial government for approval.
Last year's forest and peatland fire catastrophe is a memory now. But it may have claimed another life this week, with the passing of one of Indonesia's foremost advocates for the environment and indigenous rights.
Suwido Limin, 61, died on Monday from a cancer colleagues believe was the result of years spent battling the annual fires and haze, which are caused by the large-scale drainage and drying of peat swamps for palm oil and timber plantations.
Limin's health had deteriorated since late last year, when he spent two months fighting some of the worst fires yet with a volunteer brigade he founded, in his native Central Kalimantan province. In February, the longtime University of Palangkaraya professor was diagnosed with cancer.
“It feels like losing a parent,” said Kitso Kunin, field coordinator of the the Center for International Management of Tropical Peatlands, which Limin helped establish.
He died “because of the smoke,” added Kunin, a former student of Limin's who later became his colleague. “Whenever there were fires, he was active in the field.”
Half a million Indonesians suffered from respiratory ailments during the 2015 crisis, according to the government, which said last October that 19 people had died from the haze.
The long-term health effects of exposure to the toxic fumes remain poorly understood, but scientists in Palangkaraya measured “extremely hazardous” levels of ozone, carbon monoxide, cyanide, ammonia and formaldehyde in the city where the haze turned the air a noxious orange color.
Limin, an ethnic Dayak, was born in Bawan village, in Central Kalimantan's Pulang Pisau district, one of the most-burned last year.
He graduated from Lambung Mangkurat University in 1982 and went on to attend the the Bogor Agricultural Institute and the University of Hokkaido, where he earned a doctorate in peatland management in 2007.
Limin has been active in fighting the fires since 1997, when they were the most devastating. He was a fierce advocate of protecting peatlands, said Bernat Ripoll Capilla, co-director of the Borneo Nature Foundation, which worked with Limin for more than a decade.
“We are very said because he was very important in the study and conservation of peatlands in Kalimantan,” Capilla said. “He had very strong leadership.”
Limin was seen by many as a father figure at the University of Palangkaraya, where he undertook frequent collaborations with students. He helped secure protected status for the northern section of Sebangau Forest as the Natural Laboratory for the Study of Peat Forest, an important research area.
Bjorn Vaughn, a photographer who has lived in Kalimantan for seven years, worked with Limin during the 2015 disaster.
“I am moved by Suwido's commitment as he and many others fought an impossible battle against the fires,” Vaughn said. “He had the biggest understanding of peat fires and how to prevent them, and I hope his message is heard.”
Limin also chaired a team to draft a regulation on indigenous rights in Central Kalimantan, an important part of the follow up to the landmark 2013 Constitutional Court ruling that gave indigenous peoples control over their customary territory.
“It wasn't infrequent that he'd stay in his office until night,” said Simpun Sampurna, director of the Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago's branch in the province. “We did a lot of work together.”
The regulation has yet to be approved by the Central Kalimantan government, Sampurna said. He added that he would remember Limin for his perseverance and energy.
“Being friends with him was inspiring. It showed me that if we are consistent, we can accomplish a lot.”
Mohamed Helmi Hangul told AFP Mrs Chandler was "very anxious" A British couple kidnapped by Somali pirates three months ago have said they are in urgent need of help. "We have not much time left and are being badly treated", Rachel Chandler told a journalist from the French news agency AFP who met them in captivity. She and husband Paul, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, were captured while sailing towards Tanzania on 23 October. Mr Chandler, 60, said the couple could not meet the pirates' ransom demands and begged the UK government to help. The pirates have threatened to kill the couple if their demands for $7m (£4.4m) are not met, but the Foreign Office has said it does not pay ransoms or give substantial concessions to pirates. 'Please help us' The latest news of the couple came after a surgeon was allowed to briefly examine the pair on Thursday, accompanied by an AFP photographer. During the examination, AFP reported, Mrs Chandler said: "Please help us, these people are not treating us well." The surgeon, Mohamed Helmi Hangul, said she was in a poor state of mental and physical health. I'm old, I'm 56 and my husband is 60 years old. We need to be together because we have not much time left
Rachel Chandler "She is sick, she is very anxious, she suffers from insomnia," Mr Hangul told AFP. "But I think she's mainly mentally unwell, it seems. She's very confused, she's always asking about her husband - 'Where's my husband, where's my husband?' - and she seems completely disorientated," he added. The couple have been separated by their captors and are being held apart from each other in rugged areas between the coastal village of Elhur and the small town of Amara, further inland, AFP said. "I'm old, I'm 56 and my husband is 60 years old. We need to be together because we have not much time left," she said. Mr Chandler appeared in better health than his wife but was also under extreme stress, AFP said. Mr Chandler said: "I just want to say please, to my government, get me and my wife out of here. "We have no money and we can't pay a ransom. We just need the government to help, anyone who can help us out of here. I gave them some advice and told them: 'Your hostages can die, all you want is money so treat them well, let them re-unite'
Mohamed Helmi Hangul "This is 98 days of solitary confinement, no exercise. I don't know what to do. "Will somebody please help? The government or somebody else." Mr Hangul said Mr Chandler "had a bad cough and seemed to have some fever". The surgeon, who had initially travelled to his hometown of Hobyo in early January to start building a hospital there, told AFP it took him three weeks to get permission from the pirates to visit the couple. Mr Hangul said he had not been allowed to take drugs with him but left a prescription with the captors. "I gave them some advice and told them: 'Your hostages can die, all you want is money so treat them well, let them re-unite.' "They said that they agreed but I cannot be sure what they've done." In a statement, the Foreign Office said: "We are monitoring the situation very carefully and are doing everything we can to help secure a release. "We remain in regular contact with the family and are providing support. We call for the safe and swift release of Paul and Rachel." 'Business, not ideology' The BBC's East Africa correspondent, Peter Greste, said the pirates were "unlikely to back down without trying to extract some kind of cash from the family". However our correspondent added: "One thing that has to be said is that in all of our experience with these types of situations, the kidnappers have not harmed their captives - this is about business, not ideology." Mr and Mrs Chandler spoke to the doctor in the presence of the AFP photographer, the first journalist to see the hostages since their kidnapping. The couple had been travelling to Tanzania from the Seychelles when they were captured.

(ANTIMEDIA) On Thursday afternoon, the House of Representatives passed a controversial bill that would ban state and local food labeling laws in favor of a federal standard for voluntary labeling of genetically engineered (GE) foods.
In a vote of 275-150, the House approved House Resolution 1599, known as the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act to supporters and the DARK (Deny Americans the Right to Know) Act by critics. Before the bill can become law, it will need to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Obama. AP reports that Senator John Hoeven said he is working on legislation. The White House has not signaled whether or not it will support the bill, but Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has supported GE crops in the past.
After the bill passed, Rep. Mike Pompeo, author of the bill, criticized mandatory labeling laws as unnecessarily costly. “Precisely zero pieces of credible evidence have been presented that foods produced with biotechnology pose any risk to our health and safety,” Pompeo said. “We should not raise prices on consumers based on the wishes of a handful of activists.”
Currently, three states have passed GE labeling bills: Vermont, Maine, and Connecticut. Maine and Connecticut's laws do not go into effect unless their surrounding neighbor states also pass similar legislation. If the new federal bill becomes law, it will overturn current state laws requiring labeling of GE foods, as well as prevent future labeling laws from being passed at the state or local level.
“It's outrageous that some House lawmakers voted to ignore the wishes of nine out of 10 Americans,” said Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs for EWG. “Today's vote to deny Americans the right to know what's in their food and how it's grown was a foregone conclusion. This House was bought and paid for by corporate interests, so it's no surprise that it passed a bill to block states and the FDA from giving consumers basic information about their food.”
More than 300 organizations, companies, and food industry and social justice leaders oppose the bill. Supporters of labeling laws say consumers have a right to know if their food is genetically engineered. Some critics also fear the increasing use of herbicides and pesticides that results from the proliferation of genetic engineering. The crowds are split between blanket opposition to genetically engineered foods and those calling for more studies to trace the effects of human consumption. Others oppose the GMO industry for limiting research and questionable business practices.
Supporters of the bill say the labels will cause food prices to rise and cause confusion about the safety of GE food. At a recent House committee hearing, Gregory Jaffe, Biotechnology Project Director with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, stated that since there were no known nutritional or safety issues connected to GE food, there should be no need for labels.
Under the bill, the federal government would be given more power to legislate what foods are worthy of labeling and which are not. Not only does this bill fly in the face of state sovereignty, it also further empowers government institutions, which are already in bed with the biotech industry. Currently, companies can choose to voluntarily label their products as “GE Free” or “GMO Free.” They can also seek third-party verification through groups like the Non-GMO Project. If the bill becomes law in its current form, companies wanting to label their food “GMO Free” will have to apply for that status and be certified by the Department of Agriculture. The Food and Drug administration will also create rules on how the word “natural” can be used on food packaging. Overall, this will give more power to the increasingly corrupt government and its corporate partners.
Of course, the solution to this is the same as it has always been: we need to look to our communities and ourselves for solutions. We should strive to support and start farmers' markets and community gardens and farms. Also, rather than looking to government to help us stay healthy, we should use our power as consumers to only support those business and institutions that align with our morals and principles.
Keep an eye on this bill as it moves to the Senate. Look out for what companies, organizations, and people support taking away your right to know what's in your food and stop doing business with them. Pressure the companies you do support into voluntarily labeling their products before the government takes away that right. As always, the power lies in the hands of the people.

Dear John, Dear Roger, Dear Conrad A Sun-Times Correspondence October 21, 2004 |
[Editor's note: Earlier this month during contract negotiations at the Chicago Sun-Times, film critic Roger Ebert sent an e-mail to Publisher John Cruickshank saying he would support his colleagues in the Chicago Newspaper Guild if they went out on strike, prompting this exchange between Ebert and Hollinger International chairman Conrad Black.]
Roger Ebert writes ...
Dear John,
It would be with a heavy heart that I would go on strike against my beloved Sun-Times, but strike I will if a strike is called.

The recent revelations about Hollinger mismanagement have left me feeling betrayed, and I know they did you, too. There were obviously millions of dollars winging away to the Radler and Black billfolds while we worked in a building where even basic maintenance was ignored.
I realize I am not underpaid. Far from it. I do not anticipate getting a raise under a new contract. But I have been a Guild member since 1967 and I will stand with my fellow Guild members if this comes to a crisis.
I hope a reasonable solution can be found that will prevent a strike at this crucial time in the paper's history.
Best, Roger Ebert
... Lord Black replies ...
Dear Roger,
I have been disappointed to read your complaints about the former Hollinger International management. I vividly recall your avaricious negotiating techniques through your lawyer, replete with threats to quit, and your generous treatment from David Radler, which yielded you an income of over $500,000 per year from us, plus options worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, and your own Web site at the company's expense. You know the successful efforts we made to improve the contents of the Sun-Times, to improve industrial relations, to strengthen it with the acquisition of the Southtown, and the Gary and Copley newspapers.
It was our management that revived the newspaper and moved it to new presses, which it had urgently needed for many years. As you know, and as Sun-Times management has pointed out, none of the payments that are the subject of the present controversy are related to the compensation levels at the Sun-Times. In the light of these facts, and the many kindnesses David Radler and I showered on you, your proletarian posturing on behalf of those threatening to strike the Sun-Times and your base ingratitude are very tiresome.

Sincerely, Conrad
... Roger Ebert answers
Dear Conrad,
One of the things I have always admired about you, and that sets you aside from the general run of proprietors, is that you so articulately and amusingly say exactly what is on your mind. I am not at all surprised by your letter to me, because I would assume that is how you would feel; what is refreshing is that you say so.
Let me just say in response that I have never complained about my salary at the Sun-Times, but to describe my lawyer as ''avaricious'' is a bit much; he engaged in spirited negotiations, as he should have, and he and you settled on a contract. It goes without saying that any contract negotiation includes the possibility that either party might choose to leave rather than to sign. I hope you are grateful that I did not demand an additional payment for agreeing not to compete with myself. Since you have made my salary public, let me say that when I learned that Barbara received $300,000 a year from the paper for duties described as reading the paper and discussing it with you, I did not feel overpaid.
Although it is true I now have my own Web site, you make it sound as if the Web site was some kind of present from the company. For years my reviews and other writings have represented more than half the total hits on the Sun-Times Web site, and presumably more than half of the paper's income from it. I am the most-read film critic on the Web. The elegant new Web site, rogerebert.com, has been an astonishing success. Since it is a joint venture, presumably both the paper and I will benefit from its success.
I enjoyed immensely those times when I had dinner or conversation with you and Barbara, and with David and Rona. You are all charming, witty, and intelligent. You can imagine my dismay when I read auditor's reports indicating the company was run as a ''kleptocracy,'' and that, between you, you allegedly pocketed 97 percent of Hollinger's profits. This while the escalators in the building were actually turned off to save on electricity and maintenance. It is hard to believe that the departing millions were not somehow related to compensation levels at the Sun-Times, since management pleaded poverty in its negotiations.
Advertisement
I recall the friendly dinner we had on the day you bought the paper. I observed, ''Well, there's one thing for sure. You can't get to the right of the Tribune.'' You exchanged an amused look with Barbara. You did indeed position the paper to the right of the Tribune, in an overwhelmingly Democratic city and marginally Democratic state, trumping my proletarian posturing with your own aristocratic, not to say medieval, persuasion. But I admire you for sticking to your ideological guns in the face of the common sense which cries out that the Sun-Times naturally, obviously and by tradition belongs in the center. If you had been as forthright about your finances as about your politics, we might not be having this correspondence.
Sincerely, Roger

One provision that troubles me a great deal is a provision that permits the government under FISA to compel the production of records from any business regarding any person, if that information is sought in connection with an investigation of terrorism or espionage.
Now we're not talking here about travel records pertaining to a terrorist suspect, which we all can see can be highly relevant to an investigation of a terrorist plot. FISA already gives the FBI the power to get airline, train, hotel, car rental and other records of a suspect.
But under this bill, the government can compel the disclosure of the personal records of anyone -- perhaps someone who worked with, or lived next door to, or went to school with, or sat on an airplane with, or has been seen in the company of, or whose phone number was called by -- the target of the investigation.
And under this new provisions all business records can be compelled, including those containing sensitive personal information like medical records from hospitals or doctors, or educational records, or records of what books someone has taken out of the library. This is an enormous expansion of authority, under a law that provides only minimal judicial supervision.
IDEAS Rachel Kramer Bussel writes on sex, dating, books and pop culture.
In a controversial, much-criticized post Wednesday on LinkedIn Pulse, business writer Bruce Kasanoff derided Jennifer Lawrence for daring to do the unthinkable (to him): bare her breasts in Vanity Fair magazine. Originally titled “Why Jennifer Lawrence's Breasts Confuse Me” and later changed to “Why Jennifer Lawrence Confuses Me,” Kasanoff's piece was riddled with ill-considered and outmoded ways of thinking about bodies, nudity and ownership of our stories. Kasanoff deleted the inflammatory article Thursday, telling Time.com via email, “My intention is to help people, not upset them.”
“If someone outraged me by publishing naked photos of my body, I'm pretty certain my next move would NOT be to then pose semi-naked for a national magazine, especially with a cockatoo,” Kasanoff wrote. As a man, Kasanoff will never know what it's like to be a woman whose nude photos were stolen and leaked for the entire world to see, nor the ways that violation affects her. Yes, male celebrities such as Nick Hogan, son of Hulk Hogan, have also had their nude photos leaked, which is problematic, but they are less likely to come under the kind of scrutiny Lawrence has. In Hogan's case, for instance, most of the commentary has focused back on women, namely photos of his mother, which the New York Daily News deemed “worse” than his own nude images, and of photos he'd possibly taken of underage girls. Male nudity simply doesn't cause the same moral panic that female nudity does.
From a young age, girls are taught that our bodies, by the very nature of existing, are and should be on display, primarily for men's pleasure. We all navigate that landscape differently, but there's no single right approach to take. Frankly, we're damned if we do indulge in the male gaze and damned if we don't. But what's missing from that worldview is that there are other gazes–namely, our own. By choosing to gaze back, to be unashamed and proud, we can take back a little of that power that's so often used to belittle and make women feel that we are only sexual objects. By making that proactive decision to strip down for a camera, we are the ones saying first that we're sexual subjects.
Posing nude, or topless, can be part of our self-expression. Of course, it doesn't have to be, which is exactly the point: I doubt a celebrity as powerful as Lawrence was in any way coerced into baring her breasts, which means she got to make the decision about who would see those photos (Vanity Fair readers). She didn't with the nude photos taken in private. That point is made repeatedly clear by her statements about the leak, saying it was “against my will” and made her “feel like a piece of meat that's being passed around for a profit.

Kasanoff's piece tries to play both sides of the fence, such as when people claim it's okay to wear anything we want, but we shouldn't wear something too enticing lest we be assaulted.
On Twitter, journalist Felix Salmon made a similar point, contrasting Lawrence's statement to Vanity Fair–“I don't want to get mad, but at the same time I'm thinking, I didn't tell you that you could look at my naked body”–with an image of her topless, entirely ignoring the context she so clearly provided. At the risk of being redundant, having private, personal nude photos stolen and published is the complete opposite of consenting and posing for nude photos intended to be published in a widely read national magazine. There's nothing similar about them except the nudity. By choosing to pose nude with her head held high, literally and figuratively, she's making it clear that it wasn't her body being ogled she objected to per se, but instead the illegal, nonconsensual manner in which the stolen photos were obtained. Lawrence is being chastised for daring to say that she is okay with nudity when it's on her terms, as if once her photos have been released without consent, she should lose that privilege forever. The implications of that idea are extremely disturbing. As Brooke Burchill writes, also at LinkedIn Pulse, “The discussion here isn't whether or not she wants to be seen as sexual, it's whether or not she is in control of her own sexuality and how it is portrayed by the media and consumed by the public.”
I've posed for nude photos, both for lovers and for publication. Does that mean that anyone anywhere has the right to use the private photos for any purpose they like? Of course not. Yet Kasanoff and numerous commenters seem to think that once any woman bares her body, whether in private or public, they are immediately branded with the modern equivalent of a scarlet letter and forfeit all right to control anything that happens with their images. Witness Vanity Fair commenter SJWarrio, who wrote, “if she didn't want the photos online she could simply not have them taken, it's not like it was a paparazzi case, on the leaked photos, she KNOWS that somebody is taking them, her naked, looking at the lens.” The crime, it would appear, is in taking off her clothes, in brazenly, openly owning her sexuality.
Kasanoff paid lip service to his declaration that “Lawrence has the right to do anything she wants,” but then undermined that right by saying she is sending “confusing signals” by posing topless. No, she's not. She's saying, “Don't steal photos of me (or anyone else), and don't look at stolen photos because they are available because a crime was committed.” She's also saying the complementary but not contradictory, “Feel free to look at these photos I opted to pose for of my own free will.” The only way to see these two viewpoints as “confusing” is to be confused about the nature of consent. Lawrence herself makes this very clear in the article, saying, “I started to write an apology, but I don't have anything to say I'm sorry for.” Exactly. Yet scolds seem to think she owes them an apology for having the audacity to publicly claim her right to both pose topless for a magazine and have her privacy respected and not illegally invaded.
Whatever Jennifer Lawrence decides to do with her breasts and the rest of her body, they still belong to her–even if she's letting us look at them.

LG UltraGear VR headset LG will soon launch a high-end tethered VR headset. This head mounted display is likely to be called LG UltraGear.
Show page summary
At the Game Developer Conference early this year, LG showcased a new VR headset. Until now, this prototype was named LG VR HMD (head mounted display), but thanks to a recent trademark, we can now report how this virtual reality headset is likely to be called.
LG UltraGear head mounted display
Our Dutch friends over at Mobiel Kopen just discovered LG filed a trademark application with the EUIPO for the name LG UltraGear. The application was filed two days ago and is categorized as: ‘Head-mounted holographic displays; Virtual Reality headsets'.
Specifications of the LG UltraGear
The LG UltraGear will be a high-end tethered VR headset (PC-connected). Just like the HTC Vive, the new HMD will make use of the SteamVR tracking technology from Valve. Also the controllers show clear similarities with the Vive. The headset design will be slightly different, LG's VR headset will feature a flip-up design, meaning you can lift the front of the headset out of your face if you need to take a break.
The prototype virtual reality headset featured two 3,64″ OLED displays with a resolution of 1440×1280 pixels and a refreshing rate of 90Hz. This makes LG's headset resolution better than the current HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. As it was a prototype, things can still change.
Mixed Reality capabilities
Furthermore, there is talk this head mounted display may also offer Mixed Reality. This idea was brought up by Toms Hardware Guide back in March, when they got the change to go hands-on with the prototype device. The headset already had two dummy holes for a pair of passthrough cameras on the front of the HMD.
At the Game Developer Conference LG said it would use the feedback and suggestions of developers to finalize its high-end device. Therefore the product specifications may still change. LG did not yet mention a release date of price indication. We believe the Korean manufacturer will launch its LG UltraGear VR headset at the CES in January 2018.
How do you turn almost 60 acres of little-used land into a bustling business destination and a key stop in the mayor's SmartTrack plan? Elizabeth Church reports on all the pieces that must fall into place to develop the former Unilever site into something more
(Photos by Chris Young for The Globe and Mail)
On a weekday morning, the windswept lot at the bottom of the Don Valley looks like a reminder of Toronto's past rather than a promise of its future.
Once a base of industry and hundreds of jobs, the site of the former soap plant sits empty but for the tractor-trailers dotted around a parking lot advertising its owner, developer First Gulf.
There is a lot riding on this property and the industrial strip that extends from it to the east – what area councillor Paula Fletcher calls the last large stretch of “old growth” employment lands left in the former city. Plans to make it a hub for new office development will take years to unfold, but several decisions in the coming months will shape how that happens. Revitalizing the property is a key part of the financial plan behind Mayor John Tory's proposed SmartTrack light rail line. And since taking office, the mayor has made personal appeals to Ottawa and Queen's Park to get money for the flood protection that must come before any development here or in the Port Lands to the south. The fate of the eastern Gardiner Expressway – before council this spring – also will have a major impact on access to the site.
If all goes as planned, the former industrial property, together with the Port Lands, will be transformed from a place commuters race by on highways and in trains to their destination, and it will be a selling point for the city in its quest to retain and attract corporate headquarters and new jobs.
“It will be a great magnet for us – not just the Unilever site but the entire precinct,” Mr. Tory said in an interview. “We can go out and try to attract global companies. When you start from scratch like this you have that opportunity.”
For that to materialize, a number of pieces must fall into place. Ringed by highways and tracks and sitting on a flood plain, the former Unilever property can't be developed without solving what those involved in the project call the three Rs: river, road and rail. It also requires a meeting of the minds at all three levels of government.
The incentives to push forward are high. First Gulf – which declined to be interviewed for this article saying it is in a “consultation phase” before it finalizes plans – wants to transform its 29 acres into Toronto's version of Canary Wharf, a reference to London's revitalized port lands. When adjacent lots held by the city and private property owners are included, the potential area of development doubles to 60 acres. Plans envision a new corporate centre for 50,000 or more office workers that stretches east from the Don Roadway between Eastern Avenue and Lake Shore Boulevard.
Details of the development have yet to be finalized, including the fate of the former soap factory. First Gulf held its first community consultation earlier this month and has yet to submit plans to the city. It is working on a master plan for the area.
For Mr. Tory, the new commercial development is an important component of his SmartTrack plan. The proposed commuter rail line would run right past the site, which is now poorly served by transit. The office development would provide the boost to the city's tax base that is the foundation of Mr. Tory's plan to fund his transit plan. Its workers would fuel demand for the new service that would run on the existing rail line. Likewise, reliable transit will be required to entice tenants to venture east across the Don.
“The development is important to SmartTrack and SmartTrack is important to the development,” Mr. Tory said.
SmartTrack or some kind of transit hub is essential to developing this parcel as well as the Port Lands, he said. Development of the site won't make or break SmartTrack, he contends, but says he is confident the property will be revitalized.
Any development proposal hinges on getting hundreds of millions in federal and provincial funding for flood-proofing and the long-planned naturalization of the mouth of the Don River.
“That is a key puzzle piece that has some urgency to it,” Mr. Tory said.
The approaching federal election and the need for the Conservatives to gain support in vote-rich Toronto have raised expectations that funding will fall into place in the coming months. Mr. Tory has made a personal pitch for the money to both the province and the federal governments. He is actively working to arrange a meeting among himself, Ontario Infrastructure Minister Brad Duguid and federal Finance Minister Joe Oliver in an effort to secure a deal, according to a city hall source.
Mr. Duguid said he is eager to have the meeting and is supportive of the flood-proofing plan, but there are issues, such as who would be responsible for cost overruns, that need to be determined before the province will make a financial commitment. “We need to do our due diligence,” he said.
Cindy Wilkey, co-chair of the West Don Lands Committee, believes the plans for the former factory site may be what is needed to finally get funding for the planned improvements to the Don River. “It's a catalyst already. It has governments talking,” Ms. Wilkey said, describing the site as “a big swath of land that is ready to be awakened.”
For this to happen, the site that for so long has been cut off from the downtown must be integrated with the city at its doorstep.
“It is one of the better located, most poorly connected sites in Toronto,” says Gregg Lintern, the city's director of planning for the area.
For decades, the soap-factory site has had one way in and out and that road has limited access and is an approach to the northbound lanes of the Don Valley Expressway. To the north, the rail lines cut it off and ramps to the Gardiner Expressway and DVP tower over it and limit access from the south and west.
Grafting the site onto the fabric of the city will be a challenge, Mr. Lintern says. Plans to extend Broadview Avenue south and bring transit in that way would require it to “punch through” the railway lands. Solving the approach problem will require the reconfiguration of the Gardiner or the dismantling of its eastern section. First Gulf, an early supporter of the removal option for the highway, last year proposed moving the section of roadway east of Cherry Street north and adjacent to the rail lines. The move would keep the link between the Gardiner and the DVP while reducing the footprint of the highway.
Mike Williams, the head of economic development for the city, believes the stretch of employment lands in the city's east end will help Toronto compete with other markets in the 905 and beyond, offering an alternative for office space that is somewhere between the bank towers of the downtown core and suburban corporate centres.
The local councillor, Ms. Fletcher, who fought successfully to keep the area south of Eastern Avenue as employment lands, calls the development “transformative” and says because of that it warrants careful planning. “There are some difficult decisions here. There can be no knee-jerk reactions,” she said. “This is a jobs hub for the city's future.”
THE THREE Rs
The River
The first step for any development is flood-proofing for the east side of the lower Don River. After years of study, an environmental assessment that contains plans to naturalize the river's mouth has been approved by the province, but the work remains unfunded. Plans are for equal contributions of $325-million from the city, province and federal government. Toronto deputy city manager John Livey said the city's share will come through development charges. Federal Finance Minister Joe Oliver has said there have been “productive conversations” about the request. The Ontario government is proposing a third-party review of the business case for the project and its costs before it cuts a cheque.
The Road
City staff is expected to report to the public works committee and council this spring with a revised look at options for the Gardiner Expressway east of Jarvis Street. The report will include cost and funding proposals for a new “hybrid option,” proposed by developer First Gulf, that would see the path of the elevated highway shifted northeast of Cherry Street. Other options include maintaining the eastern portion of the expressway or tearing it down. A decision on the expressway was deferred during the last term of council, and there is now pressure for action given the crumbling state of the elevated roadway.
The Rail
Even before SmartTrack, First Gulf envisioned a train stop on its site. Bringing transit to the area – along the rail corridor, as a subway relief line or as a southern extension of Broadview Avenue – is a requirement for attracting commercial tenants. “Nothing will happen without unlocking the transit piece,” Councillor Paula Fletcher says. A regional rail line such as SmartTrack will give the site “an incredible level of access,” city planning director Gregg Lintern says. Transit options will also influence the scale of development, he said.
CrossFit.com has been posting a single Workout of the Day (WOD) on their main page since 2001. This seemingly innocuous act has snowballed into the most disruptive fitness movement the industry has ever seen. It has led to over 9,000 independently owned CrossFit® Affiliate Gyms, and over 200,000 competitors in the Sport of Fitness™.
As far as we can tell, more people follow crossfit.com (AKA “Main Site” or “.com”) programming than any other single source of programming. It is the only official source of programming that is put out by CrossFit HQ. As such, we think it is very useful to analyze the characteristics and trends contained within the crossfit.com programming. It is worthwhile for followers of “.com” programming, as well as coaches who program for their gyms, to spend some time studying and researching these things.
In 2003, Coach Greg Glassman, the founder of CrossFit, published a “Theoretical Template for CrossFit's Programming“. In it he detailed some of the concepts behind his programming philosophy, and gave us a small window into his genius. For some people, the crossfit.com WOD seems to be somewhat of an enigma. Many have criticized the seeming “randomness”, “lack of structure”, and “lack of progression” in the programming. Some have suggested or insinuated that little thought goes into deciding what workouts, what types of workouts, and what order of workouts get assigned on crossfit.com. We categorically reject this notion, and can see a lot of deliberate thought and careful planning evidenced in the crossfit.com programming.
On Beyond the Whiteboard, we've been entering in the “Main Site” WOD daily since we launched in 2008. In this series of articles, we will be analyzing various characteristics and trends found in the Main Site programming.
In Part 1, we are looking at the programming based on Workout Modality. In Part 2, we look at Movement Selection and Frequency. In Part 3, we look at Workout Selection and Frequency.
Modality Analysis
In this article, we will look at what Coach Glassman refers to as “Modality”. There are three different movement modalities in CrossFit: Monostructural Metabolic Conditioning or “cardio” (“M”), Gymnastics or Bodyweight (“G”), and Weightlifting (“W”). Categorizing movements by modality is one way to look at the balance we find in a WOD. A big part of the magic in CrossFit programming is the way these modalities are combined.
To give an example, “Fran” contains Pull-ups (“G”) and Thrusters (“W”), giving it a “GW” modality. “Helen” contains Running (“M”), Pull-ups (“G”), and Kettlebell Swings (“W”), giving it an “MGW” modality.
Looking at the graphics above, you can see that the most common modality assigned on crossfit.com is “W only”. A close second is “GW”. In fact, 71% of the workouts assigned on crossfit.com contain at least one weightlifting movement. The least commonly assigned modality is “MW”, followed by “MG” and “M only”. Comparing the actual programming to the Theoretical Template linked above, we can see quite a bit of deviation. It's worth to reiterate that Coach Glassman stresses in the article that they do NOT base the crossfit.com on any set template. The crossfit.com programming evolves over time, and later we will look at how the mix of individual modality types have trended over the years.
Below we can see the breakdown of single (“M”, “G”, or “W”), double (“MG”, “MW” or “GW”), and Triple (“MGW”) modality workouts. Single modality workouts are most commonly prescribed, followed closely by double modality workouts. Triple modality workouts are seen less than 10% of the time.
Yearly Trends by Modality
Over the years, we have seen different trends in the crossfit.com programming. Some years certain modality combinations were featured heavily, while others were neglected. I imagine some of this was intentional, and some of it can be chalked up to “constantly varied”. Below we will look briefly at each modality combination, broken down by year.
Single Modalities:
“G only” by Year
In 2008 and 2009, we can see “G only” accounting for roughly 20% of the workouts. By 2012-2013 it has fallen to roughly 11%.
“M only” by Year
In 2008, “M only” accounted for 10% of the workouts. From 2009-2012 it hovered around 6%. In 2013, we saw it jump back up to almost 8%.
“W only” by Year
“W only” has hovered around and below 30% for the entire period. We see a roughly 3% drop-off from 2010-2012, but it was the highest every in 2013 at 30.9%. “W only” has always been a prominent modality in the programming. It was only overshadowed by “GW” in 2010 and 2012.
Double Modality:
“MG” by Year
“MG” has hovered around 7% throughout this entire period, with a low of 5.5% in 2010 and a high of 8.2% in 2008. In 2013, we saw a 1% drop to 6.2%.
“MW” by Year
“MW” started in 2008 at 2.1%, and then slowly grew to a peak of 6.1% in 2012. In 2013 we saw a reversal in the trend, and it dropped back to 3.8%, its lowest level since 2008.
“GW” by Year
“GW” has varied quite a bit over the years. Its lowest share was 21.2% in 2009, and its highest was 33.8% in 2012. In 2010 and 2012, it was the most prescribed modality.
Triple Modality:
“MGW” by Year
“MGW” grew steadily from 2008-2011, where it peaked at 13%. It dropped to 9% in 2012, and recovered in 2013 up to 12.4%.
Concluding Thoughts
Hopefully you were able to glean some interesting insights through our presentation above. Keep in mind that modality is just one piece of the puzzle. In future articles we will be looking at movement selection and frequency, as well as other characteristics such as workout duration, rep ranges, and loading.

The Seahawks used to be an afterthought among free agents, butsays Pete Carroll completely flipped the script. READ
The Seahawks will have yet another advantage entering the 2014 offseason. Coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider have a created a player-friendly environment and winning atmosphere that is attracting veteran free agents to a northwest corner of the country that was formerly an NFL outpost.
"When I first arrived, we never really got any respect over here, and we felt like people kind of ignored us," wide receiver Sidney Rice said this week, via NFL Media columnist Michael Silver. "As you see now, more and more people are coming in this direction. ... It's basically word of mouth. This is where you want to be. And when guys get here, they always end up asking, 'Why didn't I come here earlier?' And then they never want to leave."
That word of mouth not only lured Rice, but also defensive ends Michael Bennett and Cliff Avril to Seattle.
"People want to come here and play for Pete," Bennett said after last Saturday's victory. "He just lets you be yourself. And we're only gonna get better, too. We're so young, man. It's gonna be great to see us grow."
Defensive Player of the Year candidates Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas believe players across the league will choose to sign with the Seahawks because they want a chance to win.
"Guys who come to this team are in awe," Thomas told Silver. "It's a fun organization, a light atmosphere, and we work hard. ... We have genuine respect for one another. It's a great place to be."
The allure of Seattle is bad news for the rest of the league. Since Wilson's contract cannot be extended until 2015, the Seahawks will have a competitive edge in roster building for at least another calendar year.
As an astute Vernon Davis pointed out last June, Carroll and Schneider are constructing a dynasty in the Pacific Northwest.

"Crocodile Rock" is a song written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, and recorded in summer 1972 at the Château d'Hérouville studio in France (it was listed as "Strawberry Studios" in the album's credits), where John and his team had previously recorded the Honky Château album. It was released on 27 October 1972 in the UK and 20 November 1972 in the U.S., as a pre-release single from his forthcoming 1973 album Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player, and became his first U.S. number-one single, reaching the top spot on 3 February 1973, and stayed there for three weeks. In the U.S., it was certified Gold on 5 February 1973 and Platinum on 13 September 1995 by the RIAA.[2]
In Canada, it topped the chart as well, remaining at No.1 on the RPM 100 national singles chart for four weeks from 17 February – 10 March. It was the first song released as a single on the MCA label (catalogue #40000) after MCA dissolved its Uni, Decca, Kapp and Coral labels. (John had previously been with the Uni label.)[3] "Crocodile Rock" is dominated by a Farfisa organ, played by John. The lyrics take a nostalgic look at early rock 'n' roll, dating and youthful independence of that era. Elton John band members, including Davey Johnstone on guitars, Dee Murray on bass and Nigel Olsson on drums, were also performers on the song. Elton John, however, did all the vocals, including the falsetto backing vocals.
Inspiration [ edit ]
The song was inspired by John's discovery of leading Australian band Daddy Cool and their hit single "Eagle Rock", which was the most successful Australian single of the early 1970s (with 1,000,000 sold),[4] remaining at No.1 for a record of 10 weeks.[5][6] John heard the song and the group on his 1972 Australian tour and was greatly impressed by it.[4] A photo included in the album packaging features John's lyricist, Bernie Taupin, wearing a "Daddy Who?" promotional badge. The song also appears[to whom?] to have been strongly influenced by songs from the late 50s-early 60s ("when Rock was young"), including Del Shannon's 1962 "Cry Myself to Sleep" and "Little Darlin'" (recorded in 1957 by The Diamonds and The Gladiolas), and lyrically by "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley and his Comets ("While the other kids were rocking around the clock..."). The opening riff heavily resembles "Let's Dance" by Chris Montez, and the chorus resembles "Speedy Gonzales" by Pat Boone.
In a 1974 lawsuit filed in the US District Court of Los Angeles by attorney Donald Barnett on behalf of "Speedy Gonzales"' composer Buddy Kaye, it was alleged that defendants Elton John and Bernie Taupin illegally incorporated chords from "Speedy Gonzales" which produced a falsetto tone into the Crocodile song co-written by defendants. The parties reached a settlement between them and the case was then dismissed.
Taupin also stated in an interview with a magazine that "Crocodile Rock" was a funny song in that he didn't mind creating it, but it wouldn't be something he'd listen to; it was simply something fun at the time. John has dismissed criticism of the song that it was "derivative", quoted in the booklet for the 1995 reissue of Don't Shoot Me ... as saying, "I wanted it to be a record about all the things I grew up with. Of course it's a rip-off, it's derivative in every sense of the word."
John has played the song numerous times in concert, including a ballad version he performed at the Greek Theater with Ray Cooper in 1994. Live versions released include an audio version from 1974 on the Here and There original LP and 1995 CD reissue, and a video concert version on the Elton 60 – Live at Madison Square Garden DVD release.

Scout Schultz. Remembering Scout Schultz/Facebook
A student at Georgia Tech was shot dead by a police officer Saturday night after refusing to comply with orders. 21-year-old Scout Schultz, who identified as gender nonbinary and used they/them pronouns, was in the midst of what their family's lawyer says was a mental health crisis. A video of Schultz's final moments, filmed from a window shortly before midnight, shows police officers pointing their weapons and shouting “drop the knife!” and “do not move!” Scout Schultz responds, “Kill me.”
While the shooting is still being examined by state investigators, it's not too early to make an informed prediction about how the Georgia Tech police will attempt to justify Schultz's death. They will almost certainly argue that this was a clear-cut case of police officers facing a potentially lethal threat and making the reasonable decision to protect themselves from lethal risk.
Some version of this argument has been used to defend countless police officers in the wake of shootings that have struck many Americans as avoidable. Timothy Loehmann said he was scared for his life when he shot Tamir Rice in Cleveland; he thought Rice, who was holding a toy gun, was brandishing a real weapon. Randall Kerrick said he was scared, too, when he shot Jonathan Ferrell outside Charlotte, North Carolina; he thought Ferrell was lunging toward him with an object in his hand. Dante Servin was also scared when he shot Rekia Boyd in Chicago; he thought one of her friends had pulled out a weapon.
In each of those cases, a prosecutor, jurors, or a judge accepted the premise that an on-duty shooting can be justified as long as the officer in question had a reasonable (if objectively unwarranted) fear of losing his life if he didn't apply lethal force. There's a certain pragmatism embedded in this logic. Police officers need to make instantaneous high-pressure decisions. If we insist on punishing them for sometimes making the wrong call, we'll hinder their ability to do their jobs. The logical conclusion of this line of argument, then, is that we have to tolerate a few bad, even fatal, decisions in order to make it possible for police to make good ones.
That's the theory. The facts on the ground are that, according to the Washington Post, 963 people—including 44 who had toy weapons, 48 who were unarmed, and 241 who were known to suffer from mental illness—were shot and killed by police in the United States last year. It may be true that some of those shootings happened because well-intentioned, well-trained officers were forced into impossible situations. It's also true that a lot of those shootings might have been avoided if American police officers weren't trained to be so afraid of the citizens they're supposed to be protecting.
In May 2015, I wrote about the “grim canon of videos” shown to police officers during training. These videos, many of which are shot with dashboard cameras, show a succession of officers being murdered because they waited too long to use deadly force. As I wrote at the time, the videos are meant to serve as “a chilling reminder to never lose sight of the unpredictability [officers] face on the street—and to resist any political pressure they might feel to forget their training in the face of danger.”
One particularly famous video in law enforcement circles shows the 1998 murder of Deputy Kyle Dinkheller of Georgia's Laurens County Sheriff's Office. The three-and-a-half minute “Dinkheller tape” shows the deputy pulling over a car on the side of a highway and getting a rifle pulled on him. After ordering the man to put the gun down five times, Dinkheller gets shot, and the man runs back into his truck and drives off.
“There were multiple times when he would have been justified in using deadly force against that individual with the rifle, and he either hesitated or chose not to do it,” said Dave Grossi when I interviewed him in 2015. Grossi, a former police lieutenant in upstate New York who spent 12 years as a private law enforcement trainer, told me videos like the Dinkheller tape teach recruits to avoid making tactical mistakes.
The most striking conversation I had about these videos was with Emanuel Kapelsohn, who sits on the board of directors of the International Association of Law Enforcement Firearms Instructors. “One of the biggest problems we have in police training today,” Kapelsohn told me, “is getting officers to understand when they need to use force and getting them to be willing to use it.”
He pointed to a news story about an officer who declined to fire his gun at a suspect who was running toward him while holding his hand in his pocket. Although the officer was feted in the press for his restraint after successfully making the arrest, Kapelsohn sharply criticized his approach after watching body-cam footage of the incident. “From a professional point of view, the officer made an extremely poor tactical decision and needs to be retrained, not commended,” he said. “Whether Ferguson was going through his head, I don't know. Whether Staten Island was going through his head, I don't know. But an officer has to be prepared and trained and capable of shooting someone even though he doesn't want to. This was someone who needed to be shot, should have been shot.”
That's the mindset of a person whose job it is to train police officers on how to use their guns. As I wish I'd emphasized when I originally wrote my 2015 story, it's a mindset that is undermined by the relative infrequency with which police officers are killed in the line of duty. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, firearms-related officer fatalities peaked in 1973, when 156 officers were shot and killed, then dropped to an average of 87 per year in the 1980s, 68 per year in the 1990s, and 57 per year in the 2000s. In 2016, 64 officers were fatally shot, five of them during the sniper attack in Dallas that July and three more 10 days later during a Missouri man's rampage in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
No doubt one of the reasons these numbers are not higher is that police officers are trained to fear for their lives. It's thanks in part to the Dinkheller tape and others like it that officers who think they might be in fatal danger tend to act quickly to neutralize the threat. But it is impossible to draw this connection, or to say that police training keeps officers safe, without considering the trade-offs involved, and what those trade-offs mean for civilians—particularly black people and the mentally ill, both groups that are shot by police at a disproportionate rate.
I'm reminded of a December 2015 piece written by my colleague Jamelle Bouie after prosecutors announced that the officers responsible for killing Tamir Rice wouldn't be charged. He wrote:
Part of policing is risk. Not just the inevitable risk of the unknown, but voluntary risk. We ask police to “serve and protect” the broad public, which—at times—means accepting risk when necessary to defuse dangerous situations and protect lives, innocent or otherwise. It's why we give them weapons and the authority to use them; why we compensate them with decent salaries and generous pensions; why we hold them in high esteem and why we give them wide berth in procedure and practice.
Along these same lines, Dallas Morning News columnist Steve Blow wrote a piece in March 2015 interrogating an oft-repeated mantra that has been called “the first rule of law enforcement”: that the “No. 1 duty of a police officer is to go home to his or her family at the end of the shift.”
Blow wrote:
[It] sounds so obvious at first that of course we nod along.
But wait. Really? Is that the No. 1 duty of a police officer?
If so, then an officer is always right to shoot in any dangerous encounter. Or potentially dangerous. Or conceivably dangerous. Or most any time.
If self-preservation is the first and foremost priority of a police officer, then you get what we have seen in recent months and years—a series of unsettling police shootings.
After acknowledging that he lacks the courage to do what police officers do, Blow continued:
I so appreciate their willingness to assume the risks of the job.
But there's the crux of the matter. They have willingly taken a job that involves personal risk. It also requires split-second decision making that must go beyond simple self-preservation.
If going home safely becomes the overriding priority, that can become another way of saying, “Shoot first and ask questions later.”
How much risk is it fair to ask a police officer to take? Speaking as someone who has never patrolled a dark alley, answered a 911 call, or raced to the scene of a shooting spree, my first inclination is to say, “I don't know and it's not for me to judge.”
My second inclination, though, is to say that it's a police officer's job to take risks the rest of us are unable or unwilling to take. That is why the vast majority of police officers, the ones who perform their duties admirably and selflessly, deserve our respect and admiration. The reason we revere cops isn't their dedication to protecting their own lives. It's their dedication to protecting ours.
With the 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs having come to a close and the NHL's best of the best having been decided, let's take a look at the best of the worst.
1929-30 Boston Bruins
Perhaps the most dominant team that the NHL has ever seen, the 1929-30 Bruins boast the highest single season points percentage of all time with a .875 percentage. Their 38-5-1 record would roughly translate to a 71-9-2 season over an 82 game schedule. That is absolutely absurd. With nearly half their roster being Hall of Famers, it's no surprise that the '29-30 Bruins were able to dominate. What is surprising, however, is that they were swept in the Stanley Cup Final (in the best of three series) by the Montreal Canadiens, who had gone a much-less dominate 21-14-9 over the course of the regular season.
1944-45 Montreal Canadiens
After posting one of the most dominant seasons in NHL history in 1943-44, the Canadiens seemed to be back with a vengeance. Led by Hall of Famers Elmer Lach, Maurice Richard, and Toe Blake, among others, and backstopped by the great Bill Durnan, the '44-45 Canadiens were heavily favored to win the Stanley Cup. After posting a 38-8-4 record and finishing 13 points ahead of the second place Detroit Red Wings, the Canadiens were, shockingly, bounced in the first round of the playoffs by the eventual Stanley Cup Champion Toronto Maple Leafs.
1950-51 Detroit Red Wings
Every team dreaded facing the Red Wings during the 1950-51 NHL season. The team had a potent offense – they scored the most goals in the NHL that season – and a very solid defense and goaltending which helped the Red Wings to allow only 139 goals against that season, the second fewest in the league (only the Maple Leafs allowed less, with 138). However, what teams and fans alike feared the most was the team's superstar Gordie Howe. Not only did he lead the league in goals, assists, and points, but he also played an extremely physical game, racking up hits and penalty minutes. Howe also had a phenomenal supporting cast that included Hall of Famers Terry Sawchuk, Sid Abel, Ted Lindsay, Red Kelly, and Marcel Pronovost.
This star studded team finished at the top of the standings, but were upset in the first round by an underdog Montreal Canadiens team who had amassed an abysmal record of 25-30-15 through the regular season.
1970-71 Boston Bruins
The '70-71 Boston Bruins were a terrifying team to face. Every line was dangerous, every player a scoring threat, and the team's best were among the league's best. That year, incredibly, seven of the NHL's top ten scorers were Boston Bruins. Boston players also took home six awards after the season, including Bobby Orr winning the Hart and Norris Trophies, Phil Esposito taking home the Lester B. Pearson Award, and Johnny Bucyk winning the Lady Byng Trophy. To top it all off, they were backstopped by Hall of Fame goaltender Gerry Cheevers.
Despite their regular season success, the Bruins' Stanley Cup hopes were stomped out in the first round of the playoffs by the Montreal Canadiens and Ken Dryden, who would go on to win the Cup.
1975-76 Philadelphia Flyers
Coming off of back-to-back Cups, a “threepeat” seemed to be in the cards for the Flyers. Captain Bobby Clarke and the Broad Street Bullies powered through the regular season with a 51-13-16 record. The team was feared league-wide for not only their skill, but for the physicality and straight up dirty play that they brought to the table. Unfortunately for the Flyers, they had to face one of the greatest teams of all time, the '75-76 Montreal Canadiens, in the Stanley Cup Final. The Habs had only lost 11 games that year and only lost one more en route to the Stanley Cup Final, where they swept the Flyers.
1982-83 Edmonton Oilers
The '82-83 Oilers had prime Wayne Gretzky, need I say more? Wayne and the Oilers tore through the regular season, scoring at a torrid pace. The team's 424 goals scored was good for best in the league, 74 more than the Chicago Blackhawks' 350. Oilers players held four spots among the NHL's top ten scorers; Gretzky led the way with 196 points, far ahead of second-best Marcel Dionne's 124 points. The Oilers continued to dominate throughout the playoffs until they were stopped in their tracks and swept by one of the all-time greatest dynasties, the New York Islanders.
1983-84 New York Islanders
By the start of the 1983-84 NHL season, the New York Islanders had established themselves as one of the greatest dynasties of all time. They had already won four straight Cups, and they were looking for one more. The Isles had kept the majority of their core from their previous Cup run intact while adding a young Pat LaFontaine, who would have gone to be a Hall of Famer, to their lineup. They had a great regular season, potting 104 points, and a great playoff run. This all culminated in a Cup Final for the ages; a clash of the two greatest dynasties of all time – one at their peak, one on the decline – a rematch between the New York Islanders and Gretzky's Oilers. The Islanders lost in five games.
1992-93 Pittsburgh Penguins
Any team with a prime Mario Lemieux should be a good team, but the '92-93 Penguins took it one step further; they were a great team. Coming off of back-to-back Cup wins, the Penguins, like the '75-76 Flyers, were looking to “threepeat”. The team was as dominant as ever; they won the President's Trophy with 119 points, had eight players score over 60 points, and their captain won five NHL awards. It seemed as if the Pens were destined to win the Cup yet again. The New York Islanders, however, gave destiny the middle finger and beat the Pens in seven games, before losing to the Canadiens in the next round.
1995-96 Detroit Red Wings
The 1995-96 Detroit Red Wings were so dominant that they are considered to be not only among the best of the worst, but also the best of the best, despite their failure to win the Cup. Posting the single season wins record with 62, Detroit solidified themselves as favorites to win the Stanley Cup. Their core consisted of seven Hall of Famers including Sergei Fedorov, Steve Yzerman, Paul Coffey, Igor Larionov, Nicklas Lidstrom, Dino Ciccarelli, and Slava Fetisov. Their Hall of Fame core also had an amazing supporting cast and very solid goaltending. The team carried their momentum all the way to the Western Conference Finals, where they were stomped into submission by a red hot Patrick Roy and the Colorado Avalanche.
2005-06 Detroit Red Wings
The '05-06 Red Wings were Nicklas Lidstrom's team. Lidstrom had a career year, claiming a spot on the First All-Star Team and winning the Norris Trophy. Riding Lidstrom's strong play, the Red Wings had a President's Trophy season and won 58 games, which was only 4 short of the record they'd set ten years prior. The '05-06 season marked the beginning of the transition from the aging core that led Detroit to three Stanley Cups in the late 90's and early 2000's to the new, younger core that would lead the team to back-to-back finals in '07-08 and '08-09. The powerhouse Red Wings were stomped out in the first round by the eighth-seeded Edmonton Oilers, who would make it all the way to the Cup Final before losing to the Hurricanes and a red hot Cam Ward.
2006-07 Buffalo Sabres
Oh what could have been. The Buffalo Sabres of the mid 2000's had assembled some of the most star studded lineups that we've seen in recent years, and that all came to a peak for the 06-07 season. Boasting game breakers such as Danny Briere, Thomas Vanek, Chris Drury, Jason Pominville, Derek Roy, Maxim Afinogenov, Jochen Hecht, Brian Campbell, Teppo Numminen, and Ryan Miller in net, the team was the favorite in the Eastern Conference. The Sabres powered through the first two rounds of the playoffs – they only lost two games before being stopped in their tracks by a surging Ottawa Senators team. Over the next few years, the Sabres lost almost their entire core due largely in part to an incompetent GM and cheap ownership. The team has yet to return to the success they saw during the mid-late 2000's.
2006-07 Nashville Predators
The '06-07 team is the best that the Predators have ever iced. This team was absolutely stacked, the perfect mix of veterans and young guns. The team's roster included established stars such as Jason Arnott, Paul Kariya, and Kimmo Timonen, as well as up-and-comers Shea Weber, Ryan Suter, Scott Hartnell, Alexander Radulov, Dan Hamhuis, Rich Peverley, and Martin Erat. To top it all off, the Preds acquired Peter Forsberg late in the season to help with their playoff push. After finishing the season with 51 wins and 110 points, the Predators postseason quickly came to an end as they were beaten handily by the San Jose Sharks.
2008-09 San Jose Sharks
The thing that the San Jose Sharks of the late 2000's and early 2010's will be most remembered for is disappointment. Perennial favourites, the Sharks always seemed to fall short, and the best team they've ever iced was no different. After winning the President's Trophy and posting the best regular season record ever recorded by a Pacific Division team in 2008-09, it finally seemed like it was going to be the Sharks' year. However, just like every time it was supposed to be the Sharks' year, it wasn't. San Jose was bounced in the first round by their cross-state rivals, the eighth-seeded Anaheim Ducks.
2010-11 Vancouver Canucks
The 2010-11 Canucks were one of the most balanced teams that the league has ever seen. Although the spotlight was on their top scorers, Daniel and Henrik Sedin (first and fourth in scoring that year respectively) and their superstar goaltender Roberto Luongo, the Canucks also had a great supporting cast, which included the likes of Ryan Kesler, who managed to pot 40 goals while being a top two-way player, the always pesky Alex Burrows, and the experienced Swede Mikael Samuelsson. They had this all while icing an extremely solid top six defensemen consisting of Alex Edler, Dan Hamhuis, Christian Ehrhoff, Kevin Bieksa, Sami Salo, and Keith Ballard. The team managed to tie the Sharks record for best regular season for a Pacific Division team and, like the Sharks, clinched the President's Trophy. The '10-11 Canucks seemed like the team that would finally bring the Cup back to Canada. Unfortunately, like the Sharks, the Canucks also disappointed. After a fantastic showing in the first three rounds, Luongo had some very bad games in the Cup Final. Boston Bruins' goaltender Tim Thomas, who was playing the best hockey of his career, put the Canucks' Stanley Cup hopes to rest.
2015-16 Washington Capitals
Essentially the Eastern Conference version of the Sharks, it always seemed like it was going to be Washington's year, but just like the Sharks… well, you know the story. Over the 2015-16 season, the Capitals iced the deepest and most complete team in franchise history. The team bolstered their blueline and added key pieces up front such as Matt Niskanen, Brooks Orpik, T.J. Oshie, and Justin Williams while maintaining their already stacked core of Alex Ovechkin, Nicklas Backstrom, John Carlson, Braden Holtby, and Evgeny Kuznetsov. Young stars such as Kuznetsov, Andre Burakovsky, and Tom Wilson also improved, making the '15-16 Capitals team the perfect storm and easy favorite to win the Cup. After posting a 56 win, 120 point season the Capitals fell apart in the second round of the playoffs and lost to the Penguins, as they've done many times before.

Just days after admitting that some 500 million its email accounts were hacked (allegedly Russians, of course), the Yahoo confessional continues as Reuters reports, somewhat stunningly that, Yahoo secretly built software to search all of its customers' incoming emails for US intel officials. Yahoo's reaction to this: we are "a law abiding company."
Following claims of state-sponsored attacks of its customers' email accounts, Reuters reports, Yahoo also hacked its own customers' accounts...
Yahoo Inc last year secretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers' incoming emails for specific information provided by U.S. intelligence officials, according to people familiar with the matter. The company complied with a classified U.S. government directive, scanning hundreds of millions of Yahoo Mail accounts at the behest of the National Security Agency or FBI, said two former employees and a third person apprised of the events. Some surveillance experts said this represents the first case to surface of a U.S. Internet company agreeing to a spy agency's demand by searching all arriving messages, as opposed to examining stored messages or scanning a small number of accounts in real time.
According to the two former employees, Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer's decision to obey the directive roiled some senior executives and led to the June 2015 departure of Chief Information Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now holds the top security job at Facebook. This suggests that the previous news of a massive hack at Yahoo previously blamed on Russians may have been all the doing of Marissa Meyer herself, under pressure by the NSA.
Mayer and other executives ultimately decided to comply with the directive last year rather than fight it, in part because they thought they would lose, said the people familiar with the matter. Yahoo in 2007 had fought a FISA demand that it conduct searches on specific email accounts without a court-approved warrant. Details of the case remain sealed, but a partially redacted published opinion showed Yahoo's challenge was unsuccessful.
Some Yahoo employees were upset about the decision not to contest the more recent directive and thought the company could have prevailed, the sources said.
They were also upset that Mayer and Yahoo General Counsel Ron Bell did not involve the company's security team in the process, instead asking Yahoo's email engineers to write a program to siphon off messages containing the character string the spies sought and store them for remote retrieval, according to the sources. The sources said the program was discovered by Yahoo's security team in May 2015, within weeks of its installation. The security team initially thought hackers had broken in. When Stamos found out that Mayer had authorized the program, he resigned as chief information security officer and told his subordinates that he had been left out of a decision that hurt users' security, the sources said. Due to a programming flaw, he told them hackers could have accessed the stored emails.
U.S. phone and Internet companies are known to have handed over bulk customer data to intelligence agencies. But some former government officials and private surveillance experts said they had not previously seen either such a broad directive for real-time Web collection or one that required the creation of a new computer program.
"I've never seen that, a wiretap in real time on a 'selector,'" said Albert Gidari, a lawyer who represented phone and Internet companies on surveillance issues for 20 years before moving to Stanford University this year. A selector refers to a type of search term used to zero in on specific information. "It would be really difficult for a provider to do that," he added.
But don't think for a minute it was only Yahoo: as Reuters adds, "it was likely that the NSA or FBI had approached other Internet companies with the same demand, since they evidently did not know what email accounts were being used by the target. The NSA usually makes requests for domestic surveillance through the FBI, so it is hard to know which agency is seeking the information."
Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft Corp, two major U.S. email service providers, did not respond to requests for comment.
Which probably means we can expect more dramatic revalations at that "other" free email company.
"Yahoo is a law abiding company, and complies with the laws of the United States," the company said in a brief statement in response to Reuters questions about the demand. Yahoo declined any further comment.
So - to clarify - after "Russian" hackers hacked 500 million Yahoo accounts, Yahoo itself hacked ALL user accounts.

THE GUERRILLA ANGEL REPORT — While the scientists who ran the study admit more research is needed, they disclosed that the cardiovascular disease mortality rate for trans women on hormonal therapy is higher than the general population. Trans men, however, are apparently not affected in the short-term.
The research also provided insight into other hormone treatment-related adverse effects.
The study was conducted by Katrien Wierckx, MD, and her team at University Hospital in Ghent, Belgium. The results were announced at the European Congress on Endocrinology earlier this month.
Wierckx: “Our main finding concerning hormonal therapy in transsexual persons is that hormonal therapy seems to be safe in transsexual men in the short and middle term (around 8 years) . . . [however] our results substantiate the few other studies published in the past 2 years, which observed that transsexual women have more cardiovascular diseases compared with the general population. . . .”
———
The comment stating that the findings substantiates earlier studies is troubling, if this holds up, it'll become a factor for some. However, if the tradeoff is depression leading to suicide, then this concern would be of no consequence. I do think everyone needs to be informed though.

With the labor market picking up, more college graduates are getting jobs that require bachelor's degrees. (Photo11: Emily Varisco, AP)
Employers are recruiting freshly minted college graduates more intensively this spring and not just to be food servers, cashiers and call center representatives.
Melissa Remmey, 22, who graduated from Wake Forest University in North Carolina last week with a political science degree, recently weighed four job offers, including positions as a business liaison, an analyst and a sales and marketing associate.
"I was surprised at the number I got," she says. "I heard a lot of 'no's' from companies" last fall. The Doylestown, Pa., resident accepted a Boston-based job from Oracle in sales and business development.
Even when U.S. unemployment hit 10% in 2009, the jobless rate for college graduates was about half the size. Many, though, were overqualified for their positions.
Since last summer, the share of working recent college grads in jobs that don't require at least a bachelor's degree has fallen to 44.6% from 46% and online postings for workers with degrees have increased, according to a report this month from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
That means that six years after the Great Recession ended, the share of recent graduates who are underemployed is still elevated compared with the pre-recession average of about 41%. The study defines recent grads as those who earned their degrees within the past five years.
Yet the drop in their underemployment rate is the first since the measure began rising in 2011, according to New York Fed economists and study authors Jaison Abel and Richard Deitz. The economists say higher-skill jobs are finally increasing more rapidly after lower-skill positions in sectors like restaurants and retail dominated payroll growth early in the recovery.
Since last year, the Labor Department has reported healthy gains in occupations such as computer professionals, engineers, accountants and architects
"What surprised us is the softness in demand for college graduates" until recently, Abel said in an interview.
One reason for the lag is that many employers slashed low-paying jobs aggressively in the recession and reinstated them quickly as the recovery began, says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. By contrast, they were slower to lay off more skilled workers, and needed to see a sharper economic upswing before adding to their ranks, he says.
Another factor is that after the recession many companies struggling with lower revenue cut their training budgets and sought to hire from a large pool of unemployed but experienced workers. With job growth accelerating last year and the unemployment rate at a near-normal 5.4%, employers are more willing to hire college grads and train them, says Amy Glaser, senior vice president of Adecco Staffing. "They're having to get creative," she says.
Although Remmey has never worked in sales, she says Oracle valued the skills she honed at Wake Forest, including research, writing, analysis and giving presentations.
Consulting giant Deloitte this year boosted its hiring of college grads for federal government consulting jobs by the most since the recession, in part because the pickup in the economy is spilling into the public sector, says Jim Hagy, who oversees that recruiting for Deloitte.
At Wake Forest, 144 employers attended career fairs on campus this year, up from 122 in 2014, says Mercy Eyadiel, who heads employer relations for the school. Many students, she says, are receiving multiple job offers.
Despite the upturn, many recent college grads are still struggling. When she graduated from Manhattan College in 2012 with a degree in English and religion, Lindsey Farmer hoped to land a job as an administrative assistant and rise through the managerial ranks. But she repeatedly lost out to workers with experience in the field.
So she took a $10-an-hour job as a ticket seller at a dine-in movie theater near her hometown of Issaquah, Wash., eventually rising to assistant manager.
"Once you graduate with a bachelor's, you think you'll be at the top of the earnings pool," she says. "But then you realize it's not like in the movies."
Recently, Farmer landed a job as a guest services manager at a Washington resort, a gig she hopes will be a springboard to owning a hotel. But even that position, she says, didn't require a college degree and her employer placed more value on her experiences abroad.
"I definitely feel like I lost time," says Farmer, who earns $13.50 an hour and finally has health and 401(k) benefits. "I thought I'd have a house by now and would be taking amazing vacations."
A 2012 study in the American Economic Journal found that college students who graduate in a weak labor market initially lose 9% of their annual earnings on average, but erase those losses in 10 years.
"They do catch up," says study co-author and UCLA economics professor Till Von Wachter.

Shocking undercover investigation finds restaurants offering live bear cubs ‘to eat on request' washed down with tiger bone wine in the ‘lawless playground' of Laos' Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone
American social psychologist, Paul Piff, has built a career on studying how wealth and privilege affects moral behaviour. Through a wide variety of methods – including rigged Monopoly games and monitoring luxury car drivers – Piff has produced an intriguing, though controversial, collection of evidence that wealth and status makes a person more likely to act badly.
Tiger meat and bear paws on menu for Chinese tourists in Laos, says report Read more
The rich act more selfishly, break more rules, feel more entitled, and display less empathy and compassion, according to Piff and his colleague's findings. Most of his research has occurred near his place of employment, the University of California, Berkley, but Piff may want to consider conducting his next experiment in Laos' Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone.
Lying on the banks of the Mekong River, the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone is a large resort city catering especially to Chinese tourists and run by the Hong Kong-based Kings Romans Group. The luxury casino provides the main draw, as gambling is illegal in China; but the resort also includes a shooting range, more than 70 shops and restaurants, gardens, spas, and a bustling trade in endangered species' parts, at least according to a new report by the Environment Investigation Agency (EIA) titled Sin City.
At another restaurant, Fantasy Garrett, one can order something dubbed “sauté tiger meat.”
The report calls the zone a “lawless playground” with “not even a pretence of enforcement”. Indeed, even in a region of the world where wildlife trafficking is rampant and consumption of endangered species common, the report's findings are shocking.
Eat a bear, drink a tiger
At the God of Fortune restaurant, for example, undercover investigators viewed a live, caged bear cub and python – both of which were “available to eat on request,” according to the report. The menu also openly included such fare as bear paw, monitor lizards, pangolins, geckos, and a variety of snakes and turtles. And one could wash all that down with a jar of purported tiger bone wine.

At another restaurant, Fantasy Garrett, one can order something dubbed “sauté tiger meat”. The restaurant also displayed a large aquarium, but not filled with fish. Inside, was a fully mounted tiger skeleton with a sign advertising the restaurant's tiger wine, where crushed tiger bones are added or steeped in rice wine.
In the case of the tigers, this captive population represents a larger population than all of Laos' wild tigers
One could be sceptical, as tiger wine is sometimes faked. But the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone actually has the tigers to back up their claims of being able to consume and drink the great cats. Undercover investigators with the EIA and the Education for Nature Vietnam (ENV), visited a tiger and bear farm inside the zone housing a total of 38 Asiatic bears – for eating – and 35 tigers. In the case of the tigers, this captive population – destined to be killed, defleshed, and mixed with rice wine – represents a larger population than all of Laos' wild tigers. The country is thought to be home to only a single population, no larger than 20 mature individuals.
The tiger-bear farm also plans to significantly expand operations.
“The keeper told investigators the plan is to acquire a total of 50 [female tigers] for breeding, with the aim of producing 500 tigers within three years and up to 1,000 tigers in the long term,” reads the report.
Across the zone's shops, investigators found stuffed tigers and tiger skins, rhino horn shavings, beads and carvings from the helmeted hornbill, and a single leopard skin.

Even the casino brandishes wildlife products, namely ivory. Investigators found “carved whole tusks, bangles, beaded bracelets, pendants and other trinkets” openly-displayed where gamblers hoped for luck.
Echoing Piff's research, Debbie Banks, the Head of the EIA's Tiger Campaign, said “wealth and status are definitely the drivers of demand”.
Experts are increasingly calling attention to the role of status in the illegal wildlife trade in this part of the world. As China – and much of East Asia – has experienced a runaway economic boom, snorting powdered rhino horn, displaying tiger skins, or purchasing ivory has become a way to flex one's power and wealth.
“Stuffed tigers, tiger skins, carved ivory and helmeted hornbill casques are luxury products, purchased for vanity and increasingly as assets, just like gold or jade. The tiger bone wine that is openly for sale is marketed to men as a ‘strengthening tonic,'” Banks said, adding that “the open trade makes it feel like an illegal wildlife supermarket, where you can just browse, pick and choose without any fear of enforcement.”
Golden Triangle: Drugs to wildlife trafficking
The Golden Triangle is a region in Southeast Asia criss-crossing three countries (Laos, Burma, and Thailand) and known for its massive opium and heroin production with a number of feuding drug lords to go with it. But the region has also become a tourist draw.
Signs are in Mandarin, yuan is the main currency, and most workers are Chinese. The place even runs on Beijing time.
To take advantage of the region's growing popularity, in 2007 Kings Romans Group entered into a 99-year lease for 10,000 hectares in the region. The company was granted 3,000 of these hectares as a duty-free zone, dubbed the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone.
“The stated aim of the agreement is to attract foreign investment in trade and tourism to drive local economic growth and alleviate poverty,” reads the EIA report.
Just a two-hour drive from China, tourists don't have to feel like they've left home. Signs are in Mandarin, yuan is the main currency, and most workers are Chinese, according to the EIA. The place even runs on Beijing time.
The tax-free zone has also enjoyed political patronage from Laos. Both the president and prime minister of Laos have visited along with the local governor.
“The Chinese businesses and consumers are exploiting weak enforcement in Laos, but the Laos government can't pretend they are ignorant of what is going on,” said Banks.
And the EIA report that one of the major reasons why this border town has become a wildlife trafficking haven is Laos' lax laws – and little enforcement even for what is on the books.
Legal confusion
Laos' 2007 Wildlife and Aquatic Law prohibits the use of some animals, such as tigers, elephants, rhinos, and bears. However, there is a loophole: one can use these animals so long as it has government permission. Furthermore, captive bred animals can be traded so long as they are at least second generation. But this requires registration with Laos' government, something that the undercover investigators found was lacking in some of the zone.
The 2007 wildlife law, though, also bars government employees from either running a wildlife business or taking a share from one. This could be problematic, given that the government of Laos is also said to have a 20% financial stake in the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone, further entangling domestic politicians with the resort.

But Laos has international obligations as well. The country has been a signatory of Cites since 2004, making it illegal to export or import wild specimens (or their parts) of many of the species found in the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone.
“Most of the wildlife for sale at the [Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone] has been obtained in contravention of Cites,” argues the EIA report.
Banks said that “on paper, Laos authorities could walk into the [Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone], seize, arrest, prosecute and launch investigations into the criminals controlling the trade.”
But no one is expecting a crackdown anytime soon.
“The track record of investigators and prosecutors elsewhere in the country to date suggests that is unlikely at the best of times, and would be a real challenge given the [political] connection,” noted Banks.
In order for the situation to change, Banks said action has to “come from the top”. She recommended “a clear message and direction from the prime minister to establish a special task force of investigators and prosecutors dedicated to wildlife crime. The law must also be strengthened, including revisions to end the breeding of tigers and trade in farmed tiger parts and products.”

But, Laos is not the only country on the hook, according to the report. China also needs to act, given that the special economic zone is run by a Chinese company, visited by Chinese tourists, and made to resemble China as much as possible. And the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone is not an aberration. There are also a number of other border towns with similar wildlife markets, also seemingly meant for wealthy, Chinese tourists.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Menu at a restaurant in the special zone. Photograph: EIA
“There needs to be greater investment [by China] in intelligence-led enforcement to pursue the Chinese businesses and individuals who are running operations at the [Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone]... These shouldn't be periodic operations that are co-ordinated once a year, but full-time, multi-agency operations,” said Banks. “If any country can put the resources into these specialised investigations, it is China.”
The profile of illegal wildlife trafficking has risen in the media and international politics in recent years, especially given the worsening poaching crisis of elephants and rhinos in Africa. The US government has issued new regulations on wildlife crime and launched new partnerships to combat the epidemic abroad, including funding. In the UK, Prince William has been passionately vocal on the subject, and last year, London hosted the first ever high-level meeting on wildlife trafficking. Finally, Interpol, the world's police organisation, has launched an initiative to combat wildlife crime.
Yet, Banks, said the actions by the international community still amount to “tip-toeing around.”
“International organised wildlife crime is not a new or emerging threat, the role of serious and organised criminal networks controlling illegal wildlife trade has been well documented for over 15 years,” said Banks, who argued that “it's time to ramp up the pressure for faster action and the international community should not shy away from calling for trade suspensions under Cites.”
Moral conundrums
But even if governments step up the fight against wildlife trafficking, there is still the problem of seemingly insatiable demand in the region. A demand so great that today China has more tigers in captive farms – bred solely for killing – than there are wild tigers on the planet: around 5,000 versus 3,200.

“Promises to end illegal tiger trade are empty unless the law and policy in China is changed to end domestic trade in all tiger parts and products, and destroy stockpiles of tiger parts, including captive bred tiger parts,” said Banks, who argues that this trade is only fuelling poaching of wild tigers and other big cats as substitutes.
But it's hardly just tigers. Experts estimate that somewhere between 22,000-35,000 elephants were slaughtered annually for their tusks in Africa in the last few years. Also, four of the world's six rhino species are on the precipice of extinction, pushed, in part, by current or historic demand for their horn.
Ecosystems in Asia are literally being emptied of turtles, snakes, frogs, mammals, and even birds to feed demand
Lesser-known species, such as pangolins are vanishing from forests across Asia at a rate that eclipses big, charismatic animals. Indeed, ecosystems in Asia are literally being emptied of turtles, snakes, frogs, mammals, and even birds to feed demand for luxury foods, traditional medicine, and the newest pet craze, creating what's been dubbed “empty forests” syndrome.
While poor people certainly do consume forest animals too – especially in forest-dependent communities – many of those in Asia's black markets are actually going to rising middle and upper classes, ie those who can afford such seeming luxury.
“What we've been finding across dozens of studies and thousands of participants across [the US] is that as a person's levels of wealth increase, their feelings of compassion and empathy go down, and their feelings of entitlement, of deservingness, and their ideology of self-interest increases,” said Piff in a 2013 TED Talk. “In surveys, we found that it's actually wealthier individuals who are more likely to moralise greed being good, and that the pursuit of self-interest is favourable and moral.”
Facebook Twitter Pinterest A caged tiger bred for slaughter in the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone. Photograph: EIA
Piff has not studied whether wealth decreases compassion for non-humans, though it's not a big stretch to assume it would. On the bright side, Piff has also found that change is possible and such behaviours are never fixed.
“In fact, we've been finding in our own laboratory research that small psychological interventions, small changes to people's values, small nudges in certain directions, can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy,” he said.
A number of campaigns are now targeting people across East Asia with those psychological nudges through advertisements and celebrities. They hope to undercut the social prestige of displaying a tiger skin or eating bear paw or ordering pangolin soup. While social change is usually not rapid, it must come fast if it's to be in time to save Asia's vanishing natural heritage.
Leading artificial intelligence researchers have warned that an "AI arms race" could be disastrous for humanity, and are urging the UN to consider a ban on "offensive autonomous weapons." An open letter published by the Future of Life Institute (FLI) and signed by high-profile figures including Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Noam Chomsky, warns that weapons that automatically "select and engage targets without human intervention" could become the "Kalashnikovs of tomorrow," fueling war, terrorism, and global instability.
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has reached a point where the deployment of such systems is — practically if not legally — feasible within years, not decades," states the letter, citing armed quadcopters (a technology that has already been deployed in a very crude fashion) as an example. The letter notes that although it's possible that the use of autonomous weapons could reduce human casualties on the battlefield, this itself could be a mistake as it would "[lower] the threshold" for going to war.
"Autonomous weapons are ideal for assassinations [and] destabilizing nations."
"Unlike nuclear weapons, [autonomous weapons] require no costly or hard-to-obtain raw materials, so they will become ubiquitous and cheap for all significant military powers to mass-produce," states the letter. "It will only be a matter of time until they appear on the black market and in the hands of terrorists, dictators wishing to better control their populace, warlords wishing to perpetrate ethnic cleansing, etc. Autonomous weapons are ideal for tasks such as assassinations, destabilizing nations, subduing populations and selectively killing a particular ethnic group."
A backlash against AI weapons could hamper research
The letter ends by warning that the development of autonomous weapons could tarnish the field of artificial intelligence and create a "major public backlash" that would impede potentially beneficial AI research. The authors conclude that this "should be prevented by a ban on offensive autonomous weapons beyond meaningful human control" and are urging the UN to take action.
The FLI is not the only organization campaigning in this area, but semi-autonomous weapon systems are already proliferating, with the US Air Force predicting that "by 2030 machine capabilities will have increased to the point that humans will have become the weakest component in a wide array of systems." Critics and proponents alike have also noted that it can be difficult to draw the line when it comes to what is and what isn't an autonomous weapons system.
Other signatories to FLI's open letter include Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Skype co-founder Jaan Talinn, and Demis Hassabis, the CEO of DeepMind, a British artificial intelligence company acquired by Google last year. The FLI has previously published open letters on similar topics, including one in January this year calling on researchers to focus on the "societal benefits" of AI.

Homeschool Tracker helped organize my senior's studies, she's been accepted to five universities so far! The Ivy League schools said it was an outstanding transcript!
One of the biggest hurdles for getting our kids accepted into college can be demonstrating to admissions officials that our student's homeschool education included all the rigors of traditional school (and more!). A professional homeschool transcript can go a long way in accomplishing this goal.
In this post, we'll go over 5 tips to help you plan and create a great homeschool transcript for your high schooler.
1. Have a plan
It is absolutely critical to decide what information you need or want on your home school transcript well in advance of creating it. Knowing all the information that you want included on your student's transcript ahead of time will help you plan out your their high school career and your responsibilities as their teacher.
If you are unsure on what to include on a high school transcript, take a look at some example homeschool transcripts to see if your schooling plan is on track to complete a similar transcript. Does your state have specific requirements for high school? Will you be tracking grades, GPA, credit units, and activities? These are all important elements to include in a professional transcript.
2. Keep accurate records
Keeping accurate records in your home school will make creating a transcript much easier. Having a system to track and record your records will give you the data to create a transcript with confidence. While we certainly endorse Homeschool Tracker for its ability to keep accurate records and generate a home school transcript with ease, you need to choose the system that works best for you. The key is to choose a system, learn it, and be consistent!
If you need an editable transcript template, based on the same format used by thousands of Homeschool Tracker users, download our free homeschool transcript template instantly.
3. Stay on track
The same way you want your students to stay on track with their schoolwork, it is also incredibly important for you to keep up with your record keeping. Creating a transcript at the end of each school year is a great way to do this. This process will effectively “test” your record keeping to make sure you and your system are working well. Not only will you have a running transcript of your student's work, but it will make creating their “final” transcript a breeze.
Besides, who doesn't like to see how they are doing along the way?
4. Remember to be flexible
One of the greatest advantages of homeschooling is the ability to be flexible! Just because we're trying to capture our student's experience in a formal document, doesn't mean we still can't enjoy being flexible! You can display this flexibility right on the transcript.
If your student didn't finish an entire course in one year - no sweat! You can continue that course the following year and still include it on the transcript. On the flip side, maybe your student finished all their high school coursework and requirements in less than the standard four years. Again, this isn't a problem as long as it is clearly captured on the transcript.
5. Don't wait until graduation
It can be extremely difficult to create an entire high school transcript after the fact. Pouring through old records, grades, curriculum, and trying to synthesize all that information into a 1-3 page document is a daunting task to say the least. This is why it is important to start early and add to your transcript along the way.
For those that do find themselves deep into high school without a good system in place, you can still use Homeschool Tracker. Check out our guide on how to include information from prior years without spending hours entering data.
Conclusion
As homeschoolers, we devote significant time, energy, and effort into providing the best for our child's education. Having all our hard work, and more importantly, our student's hard work reflected on a transcript is a great way to cap off an excellent high school experience.
If you start early with a solid plan, keep accurate records along the way, stay on track while remaining flexible, and don't wait until it's too late, you will be celebrating your transcript as much as your student's success!

The idea that a Republican candidate for president could have a “Mormon problem,” as many headlines and Trump himself have alleged, is remarkable—and not just because an estimated 70 percent of LDS voters lean right. For at least their first hundred years as a religious group, Mormons were largely regarded by their fellow countrymen as foreigners and threats. The history of Mormon persecution in the United States may be unsettling for those who aren't familiar with it: The governor of Missouri once ordered the extermination of all Mormons in the state. The Church's founder, Joseph Smith, was murdered by a mob in 1844. The group was involved in multiple wars with neighboring settlers and the United States government, started and stoked by fears of its religious teachings.
But gradually, Americans got more used to the idea of Mormons, particularly after the Church put an end to the practice of polygamy and Utah was admitted to the U.S. as a state at the end of the 19th century. By the mid-20th century, a Mormon man, Ezra Taft Benson, simultaneously served as Eisenhower's secretary of agriculture and part of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles, the main governing body of the LDS Church. In 1968, a prominent Mormon businessman, George Romney, ran for president of the United States, and even though he didn't beat out Richard Nixon for the nomination, he got tapped to be his former opponent's secretary of housing and urban development. Around this time, “observers agree that Mormons received unprecedented positive press,” wrote the Brigham Young University professor J.B. Haws in his 2013 book, The Mormon Image in the American Mind. “Mormons had so successfully shed the ‘pariah' label that, instead of painting them as a threat or a menace, national reporters characterized Latter-day Saints as upstanding, moral, and patriotic people—and, if anything, a little quaint.” During Romney's presidential run, few reporters focused on his identity as a Mormon, Haws found.
When Mitt Romney ran for president in 2012, though, this certainly wasn't the case; most Americans seemed either amused or bemused by his faith. The stage show The Book of Mormon, which satirizes the LDS Church, had recently opened to acclaim; The New York Times Style section even ran a piece on what it means to be a “hip” Mormon. Yet, party officials and members of the media wondered widely at the time whether Romney would have a “religion problem,” finding himself unable to attract conservative evangelicals who were skeptical of the LDS Church. According to Pew research, roughly one-fifth of American voters said they were uncomfortable with Romney's faith, and half either didn't know or didn't believe that Mormonism is a Christian religion.
Romney ended up losing his bid for the White House based on the larger racial and age-based deficiencies of his coalition, not because other religious conservatives refused to vote for a Mormon. Even though he lost the election, perhaps he accomplished something else. “Maybe 2012 did help us solve the Mormon problem,” said Max Perry Mueller, a professor at the University of Nebraska Lincoln. “They aren't an ‘other' anymore, and that's what's amazing.” Trump's own rhetoric may be a blunt instrument for measuring which groups have become “normal” by putative white, middle-class American standards: While he hasn't hesitated to toss out insults about Hispanics, Asians, Muslims, Seventh-Day Adventists, Jews, and the disabled, he has praised and pleaded with Mormons for their votes.
Hundreds of people including patients, caregivers and veterans, joined together at the State House on Tuesday afternoon to rally against an item in Gov. Gina Raimondo's proposed budget that would change the medical marijuana program.
At the core of the rally, which took place at 4 p.m. in front of the State House and organized by Rhode Island Patient Advocacy Coalition (RIPAC) and the Responsible Caregivers of Rhode Island, are taxes and the amount of plants that can be cultivated.
Under the proposal, patients and caregivers will have to get a tag for each plant or seedlings they grow. For patients that cost is $150 per plant and for caregivers the cost is $350.
Those changes are not acceptable and target the more than 10,000 people in the program who need the medical marijuana to deal with chronic illness, according to JoAnne Leppanen, executive director of patient advocacy group, RIPAC.
"We need the governor to retract the medical marijuana program proposal," Leppanen told NBC 10 News. "It's based on fantasy numbers about what life is like in the program."
Leppanen said patients will not be able to afford the cost of the tags in addition to the cost of electricity, nutrients and other materials necessary to grow the marijuana. Currently, it's less expensive for patients to grow their own marijuana than it is to purchase it at one of the three compassion centers in the state, according to Leppanen.
"If everyone gets pushed to the compassion center, not everyone is going to be able to afford it," she said.
Lena Lyles, 40, of East Providence, Rhode Island said she'd love to be out working and helping the homeless but that it's difficult with her condition, Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a chronic pain condition most often affecting someone's limbs, usually after an injury or trauma to that limb.
"I've been in four different nursing homes and I've had IV, morphine and go to a pain management clinic," she said. "Since starting the marijuana things like my inflammation- which is very severe with CRPS- is totally diminished."
Doreen Beattie, 53, of Middletown, Rhode Island said she's been battling arthritis for years and was at the state house to advocate for herself and others.
"With this taxation, no one is going to be able to afford it," Beattie said. "It's way out of control, you're better off just legalizing it.
"You'll get so much more money off of legalizing and taxing that, you're not hurting anyone and you're leaving the medical marijuana patients alone," she added."
RIPAC took its concerns to the State House.
"They are listening and talking about striking a balance. But what do you think will happen? We are going to say no way to $350 but OK to $200?" Leppanen said.
Much needed structure
Raimondo said she has been in talks with various groups about the proposal, which would raise approximately $8 million for the state, and is considering their concerns.
"Over the past month, our office has engaged with patients, caregivers, medical professionals and other members of the medical marijuana community," Raimondo wrote in a statement to NBC 10 News. "We appreciate hearing the concerns about patient access and will be taking them under serious consideration. This proposal brings much needed structure to the program and ensures that medical marijuana is available to patients who need it. We look forward to continuing the discussion with patients and advocates as we move through the legislative process."
The proposal also puts a squeeze on the number of plants that can be grown by patients and caregivers. Under the existing program, growers can have up to 12 mature plants and 12 seedlings. That will change if the proposal goes through. The proposal cuts the number of plants to six and doesn't differentiate between plants and seedlings.
"Price will be out of reach and now they've also cut it down from 12/12 to 3/3 -- that's a 75 percent reduction," Leppanen said.
Proposal equals problems for patients
The price change and decrease in plant growth, which is likely targeting a specific category of growers -- commercial growers, according to Leppanen -- will actually cause more problems for patients, the same group that is supposed to benefit from the program. One of those problems is with opioid addiction.
"If you are sentenced to a condition that produces chronic pain the challenge is how are you going to manage it," she said. "People are managing it using opioids and opioids are not the way to manage long-term pain."
Some patients with chronic illness who are using opioids are trying to reduce dependency because of the addiction associated with opioids and the digestive issues that some patients experience with opioid use and turning to medical marijuana instead, according to Leppanen.
"It will be a crying shame and will be dangerous to have people return to opioid dependency," she said.
Veterans at the rally say they were there for freedom. "This is about making sure that people who layed their lives on the line for our country don't come back and not be pumped up with prescriptions.
A growing business for some
Leppanen went on to say that she believes the governor's concern is really about one category of growers, those who were initially selling excess grow or overages in small amounts to compassion centers that are now selling large amounts of their growth to compassion centers.
A provision in the proposal creates a cultivation license.
"What happened was they were growing for patients and then grew large plants to sell to compassion centers," Leppanen said. "All of a sudden we had a group of people in Rhode Island who could make a living growing marijuana and I think that's part of what gets the Attorney General's office a little freaked out."
Leppanen said she's voiced her concerns with the Attorney General's office but was told that there are people out there growing hundreds of plants. "They say it's like the Wild West out there, but that most people are trying to stick to the law," she said of her conversation with the AG's office. "We say if there are people growing hundreds of plants and have medical marijuana cards, the police should go out and get them."
There's been a in the state. Senate Majority Leader Dominick Ruggerio, has co-sponsored a bill to treat marijuana like alcohol by making it legal. The intent would be to regulate and tax it, similar to alcohol. Leppanen thanked some lawmakers who were present during the rally on Tuesday.
The Attorney General's Office said Peter Kilmartin has had some concerns with the Medical Marijuana Program, some of which have been addressed in the past by the legislature.
"We continue to have concerns and will express them with the Governor's office after we complete our vetting of the proposal," Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for the attorney general, told NBC 10 News. "The Attorney General supports a robust program protecting legitimate patients of the program."
Defense Secretary Affirms Commitment to Asia-Pacific Region
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis participated in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Defense Ministers' Meeting-Plus today in Clark, the Philippines, chief Pentagon spokesperson Dana W. White said in a statement following the meetings.
“Meeting participants recognized the importance of the ADMM-Plus as an inclusive platform for high-level discussions of strategic defense and security matters including North Korea, terrorism and maritime security, as well as to promote practical cooperation and confidence-building among their defense establishments,” she said..
Mattis ‎reaffirmed the United States' commitment to allies and partners across the region, and to a free and open Indo-Asia-Pacific, which includes a strong ASEAN that speaks with one voice on regional and global issues, White said.
The secretary stressed the importance of international cooperation to pressure North Korea in order to realize the shared goal of complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, she said.
Mattis congratulated the Philippines on its recent successes against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in the southern Philippines, White said. To improve counterterrorism cooperation among ASEAN members, the defense secretary proposed to convene a tabletop exercise to discuss lessons learned from the campaign to defeat ISIS, as well as a workshop on regional terrorist threats at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, she said.
The defense secretary highlighted maritime security as a natural area for deeper cooperation between the United States and ASEAN, and proposed to hold a new maritime exercise with ASEAN partners in 2018, White said, as well as to host a maritime security dialogue featuring regional navies and maritime law enforcement. The secretary reaffirmed the United States' commitment to freedom of navigation, and to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows.
Mattis congratulated the Philippines on a successful year as ASEAN chair in 2017 -- the 50th anniversary of ASEAN and the 40th anniversary of U.S.-ASEAN relations -- and expressed his best wishes to Singapore's chairmanship in the coming year, she said.
Vietnam
Mattis met with Vietnamese Defense Minister Gen. Ngo Xuan Lich on the sidelines of ADMM-Plus today, White said.
The two leaders exchanged views on regional security and emphasized the need for continued ASEAN cooperation to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific, she said. They also reaffirmed their intention to deepen the bilateral defense relationship, particularly in the area of maritime security, and highlighted progress made since their August meeting in Washington, White added.
Mattis underscored the United States' commitment to work with partners such as Vietnam to promote a peaceful and stable region, she said.
Texas arrival of new mosquito-borne virus called inevitable
Spread of the virus in the Caribbean from Oct. 2013- present. (UTMB) Spread of the virus in the Caribbean from Oct. 2013- present. (UTMB) Image 1 of / 23 Caption Close Texas arrival of new mosquito-borne virus called inevitable 1 / 23 Back to Gallery
Doctors at UTMB in Galveston say a U.S. outbreak of a new, debilitating mosquito-borne disease is inevitable after locally acquired cases of it showed up in the Caribbean and Latin America for the first time.
Chikungunya (PRON chik-en-gun-ye) is spread by mosquitoes and has been gradually spreading throughout the world since an epidemic broke out in Asia in 2006.
"If the virus is loose anywhere in Central or South America it will very quickly spread everywhere," said Dr. Scott Weaver, Director of the Institute for Human Infection and Immunity. "Through land travel, it could make it to Texas."
Texas is one of 23 states in the U.S. where the two mosquitoes capable of carrying Chikungunya can survive. In northern states, cold climates kill them off.
The disease causes severe flu-like symptoms including joint pain and typically incapacitates people for a week or sometimes months. Some sufferers report symptoms up to two years later, according to experts. The name comes from a Makonde word for "that which bends up," a description for people with arthritis.
So far, the only cases reported in the U.S. have been confined to single cases where a traveler has returned home with the disease. There have been 8 million cases worldwide, according to UTMB.
Having more than 700 locally acquired cases reported across the Caribbean, a number which is rising daily, means the disease has made it into the local mosquito population and can be spread much more rapidly.
Last week three cases were reported on the South American mainland in French Guiana, leading UTMB to predict an outbreak in the U.S. by 2016.
All it takes is someone carrying the disease coming to the U.S. and being bitten by a mosquito here to infect the local bug population.
However, Weaver said any outbreak is likely to be limited.
"I don't think we'll see a widespread epidemic, it will more likely be limited to local pockets of cases," Weaver said.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a Level One watch for travel to several islands of the Caribbean including St. Martin and Martinique, advising travelers to avoid mosquito bites by covering up and using repellants. Canada's public health authority advises the same.
The CDC knows first hand the seriousness of mosquito-born diseases. The agency estimates the West Nile virus has infected 37,000 people at a cost of $778 million since it first arrived in the U.S. in 1999.
West Nile virus has also killed 1,500 in those 14 years.
Experts say Chikungunya is rarely life threatening and potential vaccines are currently going through their first clinical trials.
Detained former Sen. Ramon “Bong” Revilla Jr. urged the Sandiganbayan to exclude dubious foundations and ghost projects from his pending plunder case because they are not alleged in the original complaint.
Revilla, through his lawyer Estelito Mendoza, asked the court's First Division to reverse its April 21 resolution including evidence on the “fictitious nature” of ghost projects linked to suspected pork scam mastermind Janet Lim-Napoles.

Revilla argued that the issue would only stray from the gist of the P224.5-million plunder charge filed against him in June 2014.
“The said resolution must be reconsidered because the accused [Revilla] cannot be placed on trial based on matters that are not found in the Information,” the motion read.
He argued an information does not only mark the start of criminal prosecution but also extends to the preparation of evidence to be presented during trial.
He maintained that prosecutors should stick to the allegation that he received kickbacks for allocating his Priority Development Assistance Fund to Napoles's nongovernment organizations.
For the senator, the Napoles-linked NGO projects is not relevant to the allegation that he received kickbacks and should be excluded from the trial.
Revilla argued the April 21 resolution effectively amended the allegations against him when the court ruled in favor of presenting evidence not included in the original information.
His camp argued that the non-implementation of the projects showed only the alleged misuse of funds for Napoles's personal gain but not the senator's.
“Any connection that needs to be established between Revilla and Napoles must be found on the face and on the wordings of the Information alone,” Revilla concluded.
But the Ombudsman's Office of the Special Prosecutor argued the fictitious nature of the projects is vital in establishing Revilla's alleged receipt of commissions.

It added that Revilla was charged in conspiracy with Napoles and “their respective culpabilities are to be treated collectively and not individually.”
Revilla's plunder trial is currently scheduled to start on June 1 but it has constantly been delayed since January over various issues regarding the presentation of evidence.

DOVER, New Hampshire – Chris Christie can cross state lines, but he can't escape Bridgegate.
Indeed, the scandal followed the New Jersey governor more than 250 miles to this crucial, early voting state on Friday, when a woman confronted the potential presidential candidate at a town hall about the politically-motivated plot – allegedly carried out by his former allies – and what it says about who he allows in his inner circle.
At Fury's Publick House, an Irish pub where the town hall took place, Durham resident Eileen Sahagian told the governor that he was going to get “a slightly tougher question from an old Jersey girl,” and noted she was born and raised in Teaneck, N.J., while her father used to work in Fort Lee — the borough affected by traffic jams created by the lane closures on the George Washington Bridge in 2013.
“When I heard about the bridge scandal, I was beyond horrified,” she told the Republican, noting that while she believes the governor's insistence that he didn't know about the scheme, “people with whom you work with very closely somehow got the idea that that was okay.” She then expressed concern about what that said about his management style should he become president. Sahagian added, “I feel like the people of Fort Lee were the sacrificial lambs. It reminds me of feudal times … when the king would say ‘who cares about the peasants.'”

Christie, who is struggling in the polls – especially after federal prosecutors brought charges exactly a week ago against three of his former allies over the scandal – told Sahagian and the standing-room only crowd that he too was horrified when he found out that people close to him were involved. The governor stressed, however, that he quickly fired those he believed were to blame, reiterated that he had no prior knowledge or involvement in the scandal, and emphasized that there have been three probes into the incident that have not uncovered any new evidence.

“I can't promise you, nor can anybody who is in a position of responsibility in the government that they will be able to prevent every bad thing form happening. The best you can say is that I've learned from the mistake,” said the governor. “I don't believe [those charged] thought this was okay by me because if they did, they would have told me. That's the greatest proof. If they thought they were doing something I would have loved, why wouldn't they tell me?” During his six-minute response, he later added, “mistakes are going to happen. It matters what you do in the aftermath.”
Federal authorities maintain three of Christie's former allies plotted together to create traffic jams on the bridge – on the first day of school—to punish Democratic Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for not endorsing Christie's re-election bid. Then, the three allegedly used the excuse of a bogus traffic study to cover up their actions.
Former Port Authority executive (and Christie appointee) David Wildstein pleaded guilty last Friday for his role in the politically-motivated lane closures. A grand jury also unsealed a nine-count indictment against Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff and Bill Baroni, the governor's then-deputy executive director of the Port Authority, for their alleged involvement in the scheme. Both pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges that included conspiracy and fraud, and a trial date has been tentatively set for July 7.

After the town hall, Sahagian told reporters that she didn't know if she was satisfied by the governor's answer, adding “we're going to see how it comes out in the courts to see if the truth is out there.” Another reminder of Bridgegate was outside the town hall, where half a dozen protesters – who identified themselves as Democrats—held signs that read “Depose Christie” and “Chris Christie, bridge to nowhere.”
The rest of the town hall was friendly, with the governor taking about a dozen-and-a-half questions on several hot-button issues. On climate change, he reiterated what he said earlier in the week in New Hampshire, that “I think global warming is real. And I do think humans contribute to it.” Christie said he had “grave concerns” about Common Core.
He also took a jab at potential competitor, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, arguing she is “completely pandering” on immigration.
Christie branded himself as a truthteller, willing to take on even unpopular issues like entitlement reform. “You're not going to have to worry about not knowing what I think,” he said, referencing his outspoken personality. He also said that unlike several in the emerging GOP presidential field, he has experience dealing with a Democratic-controlled legislature. “I've had to fight and cajole and charm and punch and yell and hug and do everything that I can do to try and get progress in our state. I think that's extraordinary training for Washington D.C.,” he said.
John Gens, a 71-year-old surgeon from Portsmouth who was in attendance, said he liked Christie's demeanor and that he “seemed to stick to his word.” Gens said he believed Christie did not know about the lane closure scandal and that the issue was “not important” enough to be a dealbreaker.
Next week, Christie will be back in New Hampshire, which is quickly emerging as a do-or-die-state for the governor should he run in 2016. During that trip, he's expected to deliver an economic policy speech. The governor has said he'll make a decision on whether or not he'll run for president either this month or next.
Oxford University batsman Sam Agarwal has set a Varsity match record by scoring 313 not out against Cambridge.
It was the first treble century in the history of the match, which was first played in 1827, and bettered the 247 for Oxford in 2005 by Salil Oberoi.
"It's a fantastic feeling," Agarwal told BBC Radio Oxford.
"It doesn't hit you until you realise what other people say and all their messages and kind words, the good thing is the team is in a good position too."
The 22-year-old struck three sixes and 41 fours in his innings at Fenner's, which lasted just over seven hours.
He also shared a record fourth-wicket partnership of 194 with Matt Winter (51) before Oxford declared on 550-7.
"It was quite a sticky pitch and I thought getting in was the hardest part but after that it was quite easy to score," said Agarwal.
"I just wanted to break the innings down into blocks so 50 then 100 and just carrying on batting, in the past I've been a culprit of giving it away too easily once I get to three figures.
"The big milestone was never in my sight it was just a case of batting and getting the team in the right position and it just happened that I got 300."
Agarwal, who was born in India, made a first-class century earlier this season in Oxford's defeat by Warwickshire.
He has also played a number of games for Surrey's second XI this summer but is not contracted to the county.
"I'm really looking forward to continuing to work with Surrey, my next step is to score runs for them this summer and hopefully pursue a career path in cricket with them," he added.
Revealed: The teen pregnancy map of the U.S. where girls in New Mexico are three times more likely to conceive than those in New Hampshire
Report shows teen pregnancy rate from 2005-2008 dropped 5 per cent or more in 7 states, while rising 5 per cent or more in 16 states
Teen pregnancies overall have reached a 40-year low
Data collected is from 2008, the most current figures available
A new report has revealed that New Mexico has the highest teen pregnancy rate among U.S. states, with 9.3 per cent of births and abortions occurring between 15-19-year-olds.
The lowest rate was reported in New Hampshire, with 3.3 per cent, according to the report from the Guttmacher Institute in New York.
The data collected is from 2008 - the most current figures available.
Geographic data: This map shows the state trends in rates of teen pregnancy per 1,000 teens
Facts and figures: Teen pregnancy rates have declined in all 50 states between 1988 and 2005, but in more recent years, the rate decreased by 5 per cent or more in seven states, while increasing by 5 per cent or more in 16 states
New Mexico was followed by Mississippi, Texas, Nevada and Arkansas.
The Guttmacher Institute says in its report that teen pregnancy rates have declined in all 50 states between 1988 and 2005, but in more recent years, the rate decreased by 5 per cent or more in seven states, while increasing by 5 per cent or more in 16 states.
While some of the figures may appear alarming, they are a part of a trend that appears to show teen pregnancy overall is dropping - mostly due to the use of contraceptives.
Trends: While some of the figures may appear alarming, teen pregnancy overall appears to be dropping - mostly due to the use of contraceptives
Livescience reported earlier this month that nationwide figures on teen pregnancy have hit a 40-year low.
Guttmacher senior researcher Laura Lindberg said in a statement: 'There are a few key factors driving the long-term declines in teen pregnancies.
'It is now the norm for teens to use contraceptives at first sex, which creates a pattern of continued contraceptive use down the road.
'Additionally, teens increasingly use the most effective methods, including hormonal methods and long-acting contraceptive methods like the IUD. By contrast, there has been less change in teens' levels of sexual activity.'
The pregnancy rates included any children who may not have been born due to abortions or stillbirths.
The institute admits that race and ethnicity in regard to teen pregnancy was difficult to measure, because some states do not or could not provide the data.
According to the report, the estimates of pregnancy rates among white teens were available for 20 states, the figures among black teens for 27 states and the rates among Hispanic teens for 21 states.
CTV Atlantic has pleaded guilty to breaching the Youth Criminal Justice Act by broadcasting video showing the faces of two young offenders involved in a violent home invasion more than a year ago in Cole Harbour.
The broadcaster was in Halifax provincial court on Tuesday to face two counts of breaching a publication ban. A representative of the company entered the guilty plea.
The video aired on Aug. 24, 2015 — the day three 17-year-old boys pleaded guilty to charges related to a home invasion that left a teenager partially paralyzed by a gunshot.
A Nova Scotia Legal Aid lawyer complained to police when she heard the next day that images of her client leaving court — with his face clearly visible — were broadcast on TV. Christa Thompson, who laid the complaint, said the footage showed two of the teens walking out of the courtroom with sheriffs and being escorted to the elevator.
The Youth Criminal Justice Act shields identities of Canadians who are accused or convicted of crimes committed while under the age of 18.
"I'm pleased to hear that CTV is taking responsibility," Thompson told CBC News on Tuesday, adding the goal of protecting young offenders' identities is to ensure they have a chance at rehabilitation.
"To violate the ban, I think, does undermine the purpose and principles contained in the act."
'Serve as an example'
CTV News is a division of Bell Media Inc., which has so far declined to comment on the case while it's before the courts.
Sentencing will take place on March 21.

Thompson said it's a good reminder for media about their duty to protect the identities of youth involved in the justice system.
"I would … hope that this case would serve as an example to keep the requirements of the act in the forefront," she said Tuesday.
A law professor at Queen's University has said these types of charges are exceedingly rare in Canada. Nicholas Bala told CBC News last month that he could think of only two or three such cases in the past 25 years.
Bala also said a fine — rather than jail time — is the most likely outcome because police are pursuing a corporation and not an individual.
Three youths and one adult, former amateur boxer Markel Jason Downey of Cole Harbour, were charged in the December 2014 home invasion.
Ashley MacLean Kearse, of Cole Harbour, was shot during the crime. She was paralyzed from the chest down.
First Solar And GE Team Up For Next-Generation PV Power Plants
March 20th, 2014 by Joshua S Hill
Combining First Solar's thin-film CdTe modules and GE's new ProSolar 1500 Volt inverter/transformer system and backed by a recently established technology and commercial partnership, the new utility-scale PV power plant design intended to maintain high power delivery while lowering installation and maintenance costs.
“This is a significant step in establishing the next generation of utility-scale PV power plants,” said Mahesh Morjaria, First Solar's Vice President of Product Management. “Partnering with an industry giant such as GE, we are able to take our power plant design to the next level, and bring additional value to our customers.” Morjaria also noted that future generations of First Solar modules will increase optimization, benefiting from advances gained in part from the acquisition last fall of GE thin-film PV technology.
“GE is known throughout the industry as an established leader in power generation technology. With our ProSolar inverters, we were able to draw from our experience developing and manufacturing technology for traditional power plants to create a highly efficient solution with industry-leading capabilities,” said Joe Mastrangelo, CEO of GE Power Conversion. “The inverters' design enable our customers to apply engineering design that significantly increases efficiency of energy production. Together with First Solar, we can help customers get the most out of their solar power systems.”
First Solar has already identified projects under construction for initial deployment of the new 1500v system, which allows an increase in the size of the solar array while reducing the number of inverters.
Two more apparent members of “cannibal cop” Gilberto Valle's fetish-oriented social network were arrested Monday for allegedly plotting to kidnap, torture, and kill women (though not to eat them). One was a former librarian at Stuyvesant High School named Robert C. Asch, who was fired in 2009 after he was accused of inappropriately massaging some of the students. The other was Richard Meltz, police chief at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Bedford, Mass.
The equipment Asch allegedly brought with him to meet an undercover F.B.I. agent posing as a co-conspirator Monday morning did not suggest he still had massages in mind: “He brought two bags with him to the meeting point, near Battery Park. Inside were a Taser gun, meat hammer, skewers, zip ties, cleaning supplies and a dental retractor, according to the criminal complaint.” The woman they were allegedly there to stalk, however, was not a stranger but another F.B.I. agent, and both Asch and Meltz, with whom he allegedly conspired online, were arrested.
As the riots continue around London, UK residents have turned to Amazon in order to either protect themselves or to gear up for looting of their own. In fact, sales of baseball bats have seen a 5,000% increase of their sales position, as shown on the “Movers and Shakers” page.
The most popular item is a Rucanor aluminum baseball bat, followed up closely by a telescoping military police baton. Widespread incidences of looting and car burning, along with property damage and violence seem to be running rampant in the news and it seems that people are either trying to protect themselves or they're gearing up to do damage of their own.
While police in the UK are attempting to find looters via Flickr, we'd be willing to bet that police will be knocking on the doors of those who buy the products too.

Yousef Ikhlayl, top left-hand corner, attending a demonstration in Beit Ommar less than six months before he was killed by Israeli settlers. Palestine Solidarity Project
On 28 January 2011 at 6:30am, Yousef Ikhlayl, 17, went with his father Fakhri to their farmland on the outskirts of the West Bank village Beit Ommar, where they prepared the land around their grapevines. At approximately 7am, two groups of Israelis from the illegal settlements Bat Ayn and Kiryat Arba were taking a “hike” in the privately-owned Palestinian agricultural land belonging to the residents of Beit Ommar (“Palestinian killed in clashes with settlers near Hebron,” The Jerusalem Post, 29 January 2011).
There was no indication that the settlers were planning on shooting. Yousef's father reported that the first shot fired by the settlers hit his son in the head. The settlers then began shooting in the air and the surrounding areas to prevent others from approaching, as his father screamed desperately for help.
Yousef was carried to a car that drove him out of the agricultural valley and to the main road, where an ambulance “rushed” him to the hospital in Hebron, passing two Israeli military checkpoints on the way. At the hospital, Yousef was put on a respirator, though he had no brain activity. He passed away soon after.
At his funeral the following day, as is common practice with the Israeli military involving martyr funerals, soldiers numbering in the hundreds invaded Beit Ommar and attacked the funeral with tear gas, rubber-coated steel bullets and even live ammunition, as the Palestine Solidarity Project reported (“Funeral of Yousef Ikhlayl attacked by Israeli military, dozens injured,” 29 January 2011).
The murder of Yousef Ikhlayl, the impunity with which the settlers acted and the military's behavior at the funeral are common occurrences in the occupied West Bank. The death of a Palestinian, even a child, is rarely noted and quickly forgotten in much of the world. The killing of Yousef was, however, a profound event for myself, the Palestine Solidarity Project (PSP, the organization I co-founded) and popular resistance in the Hebron district as a whole.
Never safe
PSP began farmer-accompaniment programs in the areas surrounding Beit Ommar — particularly the areas near Bat Ayn settlement — in 2006. We did so because of the extreme violence and the regularity with which settlers from this colony would attack farmers, particularly in the Saffa valley near where Yousef was killed.
Yousef was a regular participant in all of our activities, including demonstrations, farming actions, summer camps, English classes and even a photography workshop we held in 2010. He was a fixture at PSP events, volunteering to set up for conferences and often babysitting my young daughter as we held meetings and tours for international activists. I have vivid memories of Yousef carrying my baby, Rafeef, around the yard of my house, pointing out tree leaves and flowers while my husband, PSP co-founder Mousa Abu Maria, and I met with international delegations and the local popular committee.
Yousef was quite familiar with the Israeli settlers from the area and their potential for violence. Perhaps it was because of this familiarity with them that he did not run when they arrived in the area. He had been with PSP dozens of times as we accompanied other farmers to their land, as settlers watched from the hillside or hurled rocks at us from hundreds of meters away. Perhaps he assumed this time would be no different; but maybe it would have been different if we had been there with his family. I wonder about what he thought when the settlers approached. I have often thought in the last year if things had been different if international activists had been there; if I had been there.
Our farmer-accompaniment program in the area throughout the years, though it had led to literally dozens of arrests of Israeli and international solidarity activists, was completely successful in deterring settler violence during the accompaniment.
In the end, the settlers roamed the area freely, shooting at residents and youth who began throwing stones for two hours. Two hours before Israeli soldiers, who are responsible for the security of Area C — 60 percent of the West Bank under Israeli military control — could persuade the residents to return to their homes.
The aforementioned Jerusalem Post article adds that twenty settlers were detained at the scene by the military — a highly unusual occurrence, possibly due to the presence of international and Israeli activists who had arrived in the area after the shooting — but were all released the same day.
Israeli impunity
During the two hours that the settlers stayed in the area, PSP activists arrived and began taking pictures of them to provide to the Israeli police responsible for investigating attacks by settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank. Shortly after the murder, Yousef's father and the activists who took the pictures went to the Israeli police station (located in the settlement Kfar Etzion, next door to Bat Ayn) and filed a formal complaint.
Yousef's father provided the photographs to the police and even identified a few individuals he saw closest to him and his son when he was shot. In a democracy, one would think this level of evidence, combined with the heinousness of the crime, would lead to a thorough investigation and speedy indictment. But, as we all well know, that is not what happens when settlers attack Palestinians.
In December 2011, Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights organization that monitors the criminal accountability of Israeli civilians and Israeli military forces in the West Bank, released an updated report on the rate of which Israeli civilians are prosecuted for crimes committed against Palestinians in the West Bank.
Yesh Din discovered, after researching the progress of 700 individual complaints filed with the Israeli police in the West Bank by Palestinians, that 91 percent of all complaints end with the investigation being closed without an indictment, including 85 percent of cases involving violence. The most common reason for closing a case (which can be done either by the police or by the police prosecutor) is “perpetrator unknown,” though a full 2 percent of all cases were closed because of a “lack of public interest,” which begs the question, “which public?” (“Updated data monitoring hundreds of investigations: 91% of cases closed without indictments,” 15 December 2011).
The report reveals that only 7.4 percent of cases involving settler crimes committed against Palestinians from 2005 to 2011 actually ended in an indictment. The statistic regarding crimes committed by Israeli military personnel against Palestinians, which are investigated by a separate entity, is a negligible 3.5 percent ending in indictments.
Yesh Din's full report shows a series of failures, from the process of filing an initial complaint, to the police investigation, to the process inside the prosecutors' office for initiating an indictment. In Yousef Ikhlayl's case, Yesh Din discovered that while an investigation was conducted by the police (which may have only constituted the interview with Yousef's father) and the file was turned over to the prosecution, the case has inexplicably been stalled for months because the prosecution's office has refused to assign the case to an individual attorney, a step necessary before a final decision can be made on whether an indictment will be handed down.
It is obvious that individual justice for Palestinian victims of settler crimes — even when the victim is an unarmed child — remains elusive. Perhaps, as was suggested in an op-ed that appeared in Israeli daily Haaretz about the murder of Mustafa Tamimi, knowing the individual perpetrator, and pursuing a case against the individual, only serves to alleviate the responsibility of the system as a whole (“A courageous Palestinian has died, shrouded in stones,” 13 December 2011).
However, violent, ideological settlers, and their counterparts in the Israeli military, will only continue to act with total disregard for the basic human rights of Palestinians if they are assured that they will not face consequences. The death of a civilian, particularly a child, should result both in a black mark on the society that condones it, and the prosecution of the individuals responsible.
A call to action
Yousef Ikhlayl's murder was overshadowed by world events taking place in January 2011. Activists and sympathetic journalists alike were focused on the massive uprising in Egypt that had just erupted, as well as other developments during the Arab uprisings. Beit Ommar, Yousef's hometown, had fallen into the background as settler violence had decreased in previous months and the demonstrations in Nabi Saleh were gaining attention.
The community of Beit Ommar and the Palestine Solidarity Project have called for an international day of action on Saturday, 28 January, to commemorate the one-year anniversary of Yousef's death and ensure that he will not be forgotten.
People all over the world will hold demonstrations in front of Israeli consulates, and will plaster their cities with posters of with his face (which can be found on the website).
We are calling for an end to Israeli impunity, and the world to remember that behind statistics and policy reports, the victims of Israel's murderous policies are real, live people. It is imperative that the international community not only hold Israel accountable for its criminal acts, through movements including boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS), and solidarity work in Palestine, but also to humanize the victims of these crimes. Yousef Ikhlayl was a goofy, quiet and dedicated boy. He had a sheepish smile and made my daughter laugh. We will not forget him.
Bekah Wolf is a co-founder of the Palestine Solidarity Project, and has worked in the West Bank since 2003. Further details on the day of action to demand justice for Yousef Ikhlayl can be found on the PSP website, www.palestinesolidarityproject.org. PSP can be followed on Twitter at @PalestinePSP.

San Antonio Spurs vs. Miami Heat American Airlines Arena Miami, FL. February 9, 2016, 7 p.m. Spurs Time TV: FSSW Radio: WOAI 1200AM
A game against the Miami Heat doesn't mean what it used to for the San Antonio Spurs. It's not quite the "Finals Preview" that it was before LeBron took his talents away from South Beach, but the Heat haven't exactly collapsed in Mr. James' absence.
Miami currently holds the fourth seed in the East, and they sit atop the Southeast Division, just percentage points ahead of the Atlanta Hawks. Although they've been playing win-one-lose-one, and win-four-lose-four for the past month, the Heat are 6 games over .500 on the season even though their point differential is an underwhelming 0.0.
Dwayne Wade has been both durable and productive this season, playing in all but three games so far and averaging almost 19-5-4. Chris Bosh is their best player, bringing 19 and 7 every night along with his versatile defense. Goran Dragic isn't scoring like he has been for the past three seasons, he's taking fewer shots and making a lower percentage too.
But the Heat's biggest issue has been how to manage, tame, and make the most of Hassan Whiteside's considerable talents. Early in the season, much was written about how Miami's defense was better when the 7-footer shot-blocking phenom was on the bench. But Eric Spoelstra may have figured some of that out, as Whiteside is now a part of a couple of the Heat's best performing five-man units. So expect to see him share the floor with Wade, Dragic, Bosh or Luol Deng, and Gerald Green or Justise Winslow -- even if Whiteside doesn't start.
Alas, all of this is much ado about nothing if Tim Duncan returns. Now, nothing has been released officially, but the Spurs listed him as questionable in their latest injury report, and that's the best news regarding his status since his sore knee has been holding him out of games. If he plays, expect the Spurs to romp. (UPDATE: Duncan will not play.) If he doesn't dress, then San Antonio should still take it, something in the high-single digits seems right. Let's call it 9.
Game prediction: Spurs by 9

As always Tony must dominate Fisher.
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration ordered the Syrian government on Tuesday to suspend its diplomatic and consular missions in the United States, requiring all personnel who are not legal U.S residents to leave the country.
The order, three years after the start of Syria's bloody civil war, essentially shutters the Syrian embassy in Washington and its honorary consulates in Troy, Mich., and Houston, Texas. It comes in response to a decision by President Bashar Assad's government to suspend consular services for Syrians living in the U.S.
"We have determined it is unacceptable for individuals appointed by that regime to conduct diplomatic or consular operations in the United States," U.S. special envoy to Syria Daniel Rubenstein said in a statement.
However, Rubenstein said the U.S. wants to continue diplomatic relations with Damascus, "as an expression of our longstanding ties with the Syrian people, an interest that will endure long after Bashar Assad leaves power."
"The United States will continue to assist those seeking change in Syria, to help end the slaughter, and to resolve the crisis through negotiations - for the benefit of the Syrian people," Rubenstein said.
More than 140,000 people have been killed in the war that began in March 2011 as an uprising against Assad's government. It since has largely divided along sectarian lines, with a chaotic mix of mostly Sunni rebels pitted against Syria's minorities, including Christians, Shiites and Alawites, who largely have sided with the government or remained neutral. Assad himself is part of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
Tuesday's order should not affect Syria's mission at the United Nations, although the State Department earlier this month already imposed restrictions limiting its ambassador to New York.
Syrian-Americans had complained that Ambassador Bashar Jafari was seeking to divide their community by traveling around the United States on a propaganda tour in support of Assad's government.
The State Department restrictions ban Jafari from traveling outside the five boroughs of New York City.
Diplomats from several countries, including some of those listed as state sponsors of terrorism, are required to get approval before traveling outside a 25-mile (40-kilometer) radius of Manhattan.
Behind every performatively woke man is a dark past he's desperately trying to make sure you don't see. Such appears to be the case with Devin Faraci, film critic at Birth.Movies.Death. —and a man who's garnered a reputation for being a “good” guy (if not a little holier-than-thou and obnoxious ).
But after tweeting his outrage over Trump's “grab them by the pussy” comments, Twitter user @spacecrone tweeted at him, accusing him of doing exactly that.
@devincf quick question: do you remember grabbing me by the pussy and bragging to our friends about it, telling them to smell your fingers? October 9, 2016
@devincf I've been forced to think about you a lot since these trump tapes came out. October 9, 2016
Faraci claimed on Twitter that he had no memory of the event, and asked for forgiveness (though he did not technically offer an apology). He hasn't addressed the accusation again online, though many others are supporting @spacecrone, and saying he's been a creep for a long time.
Ok, I think I've learned enough about male feminists and what they're really doing. Yep, thats what I figured. Re: Devin Faraci — Ian Plakias (@IanPlakias) October 10, 2016
Devin Faraci has been outed so many damn times. How long until people actually get it? He's not an ally. https://t.co/ZvMzO6PLAb October 9, 2016
Devin Faraci sexually assaults women, tries to goad people into suicide & cyber-stalks basically everyone but sure, fandom is the problem. — Kayleigh Anne (@Ceilidhann) October 9, 2016
But that'd suggest Devin Faraci actually values women's voices and value feminism as something more than making him look better. — Rose!!! On Ice (@composerose) September 1, 2014
@spacecrone spoke more about her accusation on her timeline, saying he stuck his hand down her pants and told mutual friends he had “fingerbanged” her. “I've avoided making that public for over a decade but I guess my rage at trump has uncasked the Gorgon in me,” she wrote . She also said she had given him opportunities to apologize before, and he never did.The democratization of language has made it incredibly easy for anyone to appear liberal and open-minded. Call enough things “problematic,” ask for men to “do better,” or mention “rape culture” or “gender is a construct,” and you've strung together enough buzzwords you don't have to prove you've got the beliefs to back them up. To really be waked, you have to learn to separate the performance from the person. And that's a lesson marginalized people have had to learn far too often.
Notable tech companies from China and Russia are taking strides into the heart of the global technology community.
Aliyun, the cloud computing offshoot of Business-to-business tat bazaar Alibaba, has become an Advisory Board member of the Xen Project, maker of the popular (if frequently-perforated) open source Xen hypervisor.
The Xen project says Aliuyn “has been contributing vulnerability fixes to the project for some time.”
Xen Project Advisory Board members have the right to “propose and vote upon changes and additions to Xen Project test and validation infrastructure” and enjoy access to project leaders and the chance “to share technical and marketing priorities, and endorse new strategies for the project.” Financial contributions aren't required.
The benefits of joining the board can be understood if one considers that ARM-CPUs-for-servers aspirant Cavium in June 2014. When Xen 4.5 debuted in January 2015, Cavium was a major contributor and the project's code played nicely with its Thunder line of processors.
Citrix, Google, CA, AWS, Oracle, Intel, Rackspace, ARM, NetApp, AMD and the Linux Foundation also enjoy seats on the board.
Alibaba's ascension to the board reflects its use of Xen at scale for its e-commerce and cloud computing operations. The company doubtless has much to share with other members and with the Xen-using populace in general.
Over at the OpenBSD foundation, meanwhile, someone's had to go to the bank to deposit a cheque from Russia's top online concern Yandex, which has signed up as a silver supporter. That level of sponsorship means Yandex has handed over between US$10k and $25k .
Yandex is a Google analog: its search engine dominates Russia's market and it also operates email and maps services, offers a browser and makes its dough from advertising.
Alibaba and Yandex joining these open source efforts confounds their home nations' occasionally-expressed intentions to build technology ecosystems less dependent on US companies. Both China and Russia have cited post-Snowden security concerns as the reason they're keen to rely on indigenous technologies. With their tech giants now participating in global efforts alongside US entities, technological isolation looks rather harder to achieve. ®
I love the Baseball Hall of Fame, of course. But there is something about the Hall of Fame that bothers me … and it has bothered many, many friends who have visited the museum: The Plaque Gallery is a major letdown. It just is. The room itself is nice enough. There's a bit of reverence wafting in the air. People talk in hushed tones for whatever reason. There are a few cool statues around.
But you go in there and you see all these plaques on the wall in the order of year inducted and … yawn. I mean it's nice. Yawn. It's fine. Yawn. Look: It's boring. And I say that as a zealous fan of baseball and history. I'm sure some people will disagree, but everyone I know will say their favorite part of the Hall of Fame was the movie room, or the stats room, or the art room, or just seeing one of the amazing artifacts like the bat Bobby Thomson used or the glove Don Larsen wore or whatever. I never hear anyone say their favorite part was looking at the plaques. It's nice, it's pleasant, you've got to do it. But it just kind of just sits there.
And it is with this in mind that I have this proposal for the Hall of Fame. And I think this proposal will not only make the plaque room the highlight of the museum, it will help the museum deal with both its own split personality and the approaching storm of steroid users and suspected steroid users and possible steroid users ...
The idea: The Golden 100.
It's a two-part plan. Before getting into the two parts, let's just say first that the Hall of Fame RIGHT NOW, like Congress, is split up into two houses. I just wrote about this. In one house are the greatest players who ever lived -- Joe D. and Jackie and Tom Terrific and the rest. In the other is a mishmash of owners, managers, umpires, pioneers, contributors, Negro leaguers, old-time players, controversial selections and so on.
Since the beginning, all these people have been treated the same way: They're all just regular old Hall of Famers. Tom Seaver, voted in with 98.8 percent of the vote, is a Hall of Famer. And so is Jesse Haines, a blandly good pitcher from the 1920s and 1930s who never even got nine percent of the writers' vote (despite appearing on the ballot 12 times) and was voted in by a Veterans Committee dominated by Haines' longtime teammate Frankie Frisch.
That's fine … but those two are clearly not in the same class. They should not be in precisely the same Hall of Fame, either. Ernie Banks and Dave Bancroft … Joe DiMaggio and Jake Beckley … no. You should not be looking for Tom Seaver and just happen upon Jesse Haines any more than you should be wandering through Disney World looking for Space Mountain and instead come upon a teeter-totter.
Bill Simmons, of course, has his Basketball Hall of Fame Pyramid, and what I'm suggesting is something of an offshoot from that and other ideas I've heard through the years.
Step 1: Create a special room in the Hall of Fame for the 100 best players in baseball history.
This is the Golden 100 … or the inner circle … or whatever you want to call it. This Hall within the Hall brings so many advantages. Just at the start, it would be amazing fun to do and would be a huge promotional boost for the Hall of Fame. I'm just throwing around ideas, but I could see them dividing the vote into three parts:
1. A fan vote on the Internet (30 percent)
2. A special BBWAA vote (40 percent)
3. A specially chosen panel of experts (30 percent).
Wouldn't this be amazing? They would vote for the 100 best players in the Hall of Fame, and those 100 plaques would get put into this incredibly cool room with cool music and lighting and interactives and whatever else the museum curators can come up with. THAT would be a showstopper. THAT would be the room every visitor would remember forever. And MAN would that create some great arguments.
But I think the way to make it even cooler is this: You make it a living Hall of Fame. That is to say every so often -- every five years? -- you have the vote again. Greg Maddux gets inducted into the Hall in 2014. Well maybe in 2017 you have the next Golden 100 vote. Where does Maddux rank on that list? Who leaves the 100? I mean, this would be incredible and news-making every time.

The Three PED Arguments There will plenty to say about this year's Baseball Hall of Fame. Predictions. Laments. Debates. Challenges. But… More» There's one other point I want to make about why I love the Golden 100: There are some people in the Hall of Fame who really don't belong there. I don't mean that to be cruel; I mean they just happened to have lucky timing or they were elected in a way we no longer see as viable or details have emerged since their election that make their Hall of Fame candidacy questionable. That's only going to continue. I suspect that at some point we will find out that someone in the Hall of Fame -- maybe more than one person in the Hall of Fame -- used steroids. It seems kind of inevitable … steroids have been around for a long time.
Well, what can we do about that? What can we do about any of it? I'm totally opposed to taking back awards or throwing people out of Halls of Fame or denying history. I haven't voted for the Heisman Trophy since Reggie Bush was pressured into giving his back. But, with this Golden 100, you aren't doing anything of the sort. Once you're in the Hall of Fame, you stay in the Hall of Fame. But you might no longer be in that inner circle. I think this would keep the Hall of Fame vibrant and current and in the present.
But I don't think just adding the Golden 100 is enough. There's another step.
Step 2: Redefine the standard of the Hall of Fame itself (a.k.a. "Make It Bigger").
What fun is a Hall of Fame without Buck O'Neil? Without Gil Hodges? Without Dick Allen? Without Tommy John? Without Billy Martin? This is especially true when there are so many players in the Hall of Fame who were not as good, not as valuable, not as worthy, not as interesting. You can list off a bunch of players who would make the Hall of Fame so much more fun, so much more lively, so much more interesting and controversial and spirited and perhaps most of all so much more FAIR.
Look: Lou Whitaker was probably better than more than half the second basemen in the Hall of Fame right now. I don't think you can look at the list of second basemen and then look at Whitaker's career and think otherwise. His career WAR, just as a starting point, puts him sixth among the 17 qualified second basemen in the Hall, right between Frankie Frisch and Charlie Gehringer. His blend of power, excellent defense, ability to get on base -- rare and excellent.
And yet, because the writers have their own standard (Whitaker, amazingly, got just 15 votes his one year on the ballot) and because the ever-shifting veterans committee has ever-shifting values, and because of quirks in the system … Lou Whitaker has no way of even being CONSIDERED for the Hall of Fame at the moment, must less a way of being elected.
More and more, I want a bigger Hall of Fame. I don't mean a lesser Hall of Fame, just a bigger one -- and I don't think the two have to be confused. If the Hall of Fame has Andre Dawson, it could (and should, in my opinion) have Dwight Evans. If it has Kirby Puckett, it could (and, in my opinion, should) have Tim Raines. I'm not talking about lowering standards. I'm talking about maintaining them. If Bruce Sutter is a Hall of Famer, Dan Quisenberry is too. If Jim Rice is a Hall of Famer, what about Dale Murphy? And so on.
And so I would work at expanding the Hall of Fame in a smart and fun way. There are many, many ways you can do it. Would you lower the required Hall of Fame vote from 75 percent to a simple majority? I'd be good with that. Could you clarify or even eliminate the character clause, which I think does way more harm than good? I'd definitely be good with that. Could you create a panel of smart baseball people to nominate a bunch of halls of Fame candidates who have been overlooked and give them a real shot at getting in, rather than coming up with new and confusing veterans committees? Absolutely. And there are plenty of other ways to go about it. I think a bigger Hall of Fame would be a win on so many fronts. It would make the Hall of Fame experience as a fan better.
But it only would work, I think, if within it we still have that extreme standard, that Golden 100, that living and breathing room with the 100 greatest players ever -- which is what I think most people would come to think of as the REAL Hall of Fame.
As mentioned, I think this also could help provide an answer to the question of steroids and the Hall of Fame. See, here's the problem: Right now I think the writers feel that if they vote Barry Bonds or Roger Clemens or Mark McGwire or whoever into the Hall of Fame, they are voting those guys into the mythical place of Ruth and Gehrig and Mays and Aaron. Obviously, they don't want to do that.
Of course, they don't care so much about the Hall of Fame of racist Tom Yawkey and confused Bowie Kuhn and organized-crime figure Alex Pompez and dubious curveball inventor Candy Cummings and mediocre-hitting first baseman George Kelly and ball-scuffing Don Sutton and spitter-throwing Gaylord Perry and "Win Any Way You Can As Long As You Get Away With It" whirlwind Leo Durocher. Nobody could say they don't want Clemens in THAT Hall of Fame.
And this gets to the heart of things: THAT Hall of Fame exists. It's real. It's open daily. Look, pure baseball performance -- purely what the eyes saw and the record books show -- says Barry Bonds is obviously a Hall of Famer. Roger Clemens is obviously a Hall of Famer. Mark McGwire, through some combination of natural strength, unnatural strength and hitting prowess, was the greatest home-run hitter the game has ever known (one homer per 10.6 at-bats … well ahead of Ruth, Bonds, and the rest).
I think the Baseball Hall of Fame is emptier without them. At the same time, I understand why so many voters don't want to enshrine them into Joe DiMaggio and Roberto Clemente's Hall of Fame.
And that's the final and most subtle beauty of the Golden 100: You don't induct players into the DiMaggio, Clemente Hall of Fame. You induct them into a big and bold and flawed and fascinating Hall of Fame where baseball is celebrated. Dwight Gooden was probably the best young pitcher in the history of the game. Maybe he's in this big Hall of Fame. Roger Maris his 61 homers in a season when no one thought that was possible. Maybe he's in this big Hall of Fame. Joe Jackson … Pete Rose … I don't know, maybe there's room for them too. It would be a place for the people who tell the story of baseball.
Then, beyond, there's this deeper and utterly exclusive place that features only the greatest players, only the players who rose above their time, capped at only the 100 best players who ever lived. And maybe Barry Bonds never gets into THAT place. Maybe Roger Clemens never gets into THAT place. That would be something the voters would determine over time.
This way we don't have to pretend they never happened and were never great. I think that's what bothers me most about the way Hall of Fame voters respond to the steroid users. Why would you not vote Barry Bonds into the Hall of Fame? As punishment? Is that what the voting is about now? Because he cheated? Is that consistent with the Hall of Fame voting history? Because he would not be a Hall of Famer without steroids? Does anyone believe that? Because it would be unfair to the players who didn't cheat? Where were those players' voices during the steroid era?
Because he brought shame to the game? Is that really it?
See, the current Hall of Fame voting procedure puts sportswriters in position of moral arbiter … judge and jury … and I don't think most sportswriters are qualified for the job. In the millions of discussions about steroids, baseball and the Hall of Fame, I almost never hear anybody ask the really hard questions:
• How much did steroids improve their performance?
• What percentage of players do we think were using?
• What is the culpability of baseball for looking the other way and capitalizing on the huge offensive numbers being rung up?
• What is the moral difference between amphetamines and steroids?
• How much should a person lean on vague suspicions and statistical oddities when determining if a player used steroids?
And so on. These are all really hard questions … and I don't think we have particularly meaningful answers to any of them. I think that if the Hall of Fame would put in the Golden 100, we'd have a better chance of dealing with the questions.
And in the meantime, we wouldn't have to pretend that Roger Clemens doesn't have a place in the same Hall of Fame as Tammany Hall politician and prohibition era brewer Jacob Ruppert.
WordPress has had it with copyright holders who abuse the DMCA takedown process to censor perfectly legal content. Through a lawsuit they demand $10,000 in compensation to cover the damage they, and one of their users suffered through a false DMCA takedown notice.
Automattic, the company behind the popular WordPress blogging platform, has seen a rapid increase in DMCA takedown notices in recent years.
Most requests are legitimate, aimed at disabling access to copyright-infringing material. However, there are also many overbroad and abusive takedown notices which take up a lot of the company's time and resources.
Last November, WordPress decided to take a stand against these fraudulent practices. The company teamed up with student journalist Oliver Hotham who had one of his articles censored by a false takedown notice.
Hotham wrote an article about “Straight Pride UK” which included a comment he received from the organization's press officer Nick Steiner. The latter didn't like the article Hotham wrote, and after publication Steiner sent WordPress a takedown notice claiming it was infringing on his copyrights.
Through a lawsuit filed in a California federal court, WordPress and Hotham now hope to be compensated for the damage this abuse caused them.
“The information in the press release that Hotham published on his blog did not infringe any copyright because Hotham had permission to publish it. It was a press release, which by its very nature conveys the intent to ‘release' information to the ‘press',” WordPress' attorney explains to the court.
The company says that as an online service provider it faces overwhelming and crippling copyright liability if it fails to take down content. People such as Steiner abuse this weakness to censor critics or competitors, and they have to be stopped.
“Steiner's fraudulent takedown notice forced WordPress to take down Hotham's post under threat of losing the protection of the DMCA safe harbor,” WordPress argues.
“Steiner did not do this to protect any legitimate intellectual property interest, but in an attempt to censor Hotham's lawful expression critical of Straight Pride UK. He forced WordPress to delete perfectly lawful content from its website.As a result, WordPress has suffered damage to its reputation,” the company adds.
Since Steiner failed to respond in court WordPress and Hotham have requested a default judgment. In a recent filing they demand a total of $10,000 in damages as well as $14,520 in attorneys' fees.
During a House Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on the DMCA takedown system earlier this year, Automattic General Counsel Paul Sieminski also stressed the importance of this issue to lawmakers,
“The system works so long as copyright owners use this power in good faith. But too often they don't, and there should be clear legal consequences for those who choose to abuse the system,” Sieminski said.
In a few weeks we'll know if the court agrees.
Kennesaw State University appears to be interested in an eventual consolidation of its athletics facilities east of Interstate 75 near its football stadium and track and field facility.
A set of renderings of the Kennesaw State University campuses from a November presentation at a Marietta Town Hall appears to show a desire to consolidate the school's athletics facilities east of Interstate 75 near Fifth Third Bank Stadium.
Currently, the Owls play baseball at Stillwell Stadium that opened in 1984 and softball at Bailey Park that opened in 2004, both of which are on the south end of the original KSU campus west of I-75.
Prior to the building of KSU Soccer Stadium (now Fifth Third Bank [football] Stadium) the Owls played soccer near both of those facilities on campus at the corner of Chastain and Kennesaw State University Roads.
The plans from November show a potential new effort to free up the space currently occupied by the baseball and softball fields to potentially be used as academic and/or residential expansion.
Efforts to free up property on the original campus would apparently be part of an effort to make the bulk of academic facilities on the Kennesaw campus all within a 10 minute walk of one another.

Readers explain why they choose to be child-free Neoleg / Shutterstock
Slate recently asked readers who are child-free and happy to let us know all about it—and did you ever! We're posting some of our favorite responses on the blog this week.
Name: Brad Carty
Age: 54
Location: Frankfurt, Germany
I am a 54-year-old man who had a vasectomy at the age of 30. Although I had an uneventful childhood—not particularly happy or unhappy—I cannot remember ever wanting to be a father myself. When I was in a serious, long-term relationship in my 20s, my girlfriend and I discussed possibly adopting a girl if we got married: I never had any interest in sports or other “typical” male things, and worried that I would not be able to relate to a little boy, and she preferred a daughter as well. However, once that relationship ended, I quickly realized that I really didn't want any children at all, and eventually had myself rendered incapable via surgery.
There were several reasons for my decision, but the main one was that I always wanted to have the freedom to change jobs. I don't hear this discussed very much, but most people—if they are responsible and loving parents—do not avail themselves of professional opportunities because they would be too disruptive for their children. They cannot accept too many transfers, even for more money, because the kids are “settled” in a school and neighborhood, have friends they don't want to leave, and because they would be the “new kid” and therefore, presumably, traumatized. Likewise, a parent who is dissatisfied with his/her current profession can't quit and start training for something else because it is too risky in terms of finances and loss of seniority; even changing companies within the same profession can result in inferior health insurance plans and a reputation for being disloyal. I saw quite a few of my friends made miserable because they couldn't tell their boss to stick it, couldn't leave the town they'd lived in for decades (often their whole lives), couldn't take any risk whatsoever because they were putting their children first.
I agree that a parent should put the children first; however, I am convinced that I would resent them for ruining my life once I did so. That may not be fair, but I know myself well enough to know that this is what I would feel. I'm also pretty sure I'd self-destruct, professionally and personally, if I had to do the same thing in the same place for decades. I'm told that the loved one feels for a child more than compensates for every sacrifice, but the risk of having a child and then discovering I don't have that love, or that it isn't enough, is too great. I'm also told that the unconditional love you get from your child is the greatest reward imaginable, but (a) I've always observed it to be quite conditional indeed, and (b) I've never wanted love I haven't earned—those who do should raise a dog, not a child.
I have a surprising number of male and female friends from my youth who have never become parents, although there have been a few marriages and divorces over the past 30 years. Some ended pregnancies, others couldn't find a partner they wanted to raise children with (which is painful for some, because they thought they would like children and expected to become parents some day). The friends and family members with now-grown children don't seem to be particularly enriched as a result of the experience (on the other hand, I've often heard their anguished tales of difficulties and disappointments with their kids over the years). I've seen some appalling, even monstrous behavior by friends' children that they accept with a sigh and the gentlest of chastisements: Apparently, today's children are to be given everything they want and have nothing taken away, because their friends all have everything they want, and no child should be made to feel deprived and therefore inferior.
How do I feel today about the decision I made nearly a quarter century ago? I can testify with complete honesty that I have never for one second regretted not being a parent. It has caused me to be very selective in dating, and has undoubtedly turned off the majority of women I could have dated: I've swum in a very small dating pool! On the bright side, I never had to agonize over an unwanted pregnancy, never felt compelled to marry for the sake of a child, and didn't feel pressured to wed while I was still young enough to be a vigorous dad. Needless to say, I was able to travel, go to concerts and the theater, and buy myself nice things while others were paying for orthodontia. Eventually I married a woman who felt as I did, and for the past 10 years we've lived in various cities in Europe (again, I can change jobs whenever I wish). I can't imagine any other life—I certainly can't imagine it being any better than the one I have.

No Kids for Me, Thanks: I'd Rather Die Alone
No Kids for Me, Thanks: I Don't Enjoy Alien-Parasites
The UBC Free Speech Club is certainly polemic in their defence of the right to say what they want. Whether or not it's effective is a different question entirely and one that I'd like to address in brief.
Given the current political climate, I don't think what they are doing as individuals or as an organization is at all surprising. The value of shocking statements in politics at all levels — from the mixed, small town/student government environment of campus, all the way to national (US) and international (Brexit) politics — is obvious. It's having a definite moment, and whether or not it will be a flash in the pan or a long-lasting current is difficult to say.
What's true is that these kinds of politics are inextricably linked to the idea that the voice of certain — and rather large — cohorts of the population isn't being heard. In this way, it's a brand of damaging identity politics, a sort of tribalism and takes part in the same behaviors that the supporters of both populist politics and men's rights (which is a difficult term) often charge other groups — feminists, activists for minority or immigrant rights, proponents of political correctness — with encouraging, towards divisive ends.
In either case, the AMS has shown itself to be apolitical in chartering the group behind the yearly anti-abortion demonstrations, so even a contentious club has a good chance of being chartered. This by itself undermines then-president of Free Speech Louis Jung's assertion that the club's charter was refused because it “isn't a feminist masculinities club.”
The UBC Men's Rights Club was probably not rejected for wanting to work on issues such as biases in legal proceedings about child custody or towards presenting an additional perspective to the Sexual Assault Support Centre's Healthier Masculinities program. Here are the goals expressed by Phillip Johnson of CAFÉ with which the UBC Men's Rights club is associated.
They probably were not rejected for presenting an opinion that club members feel is contrary to some institutionally enshrined feminism. The protests organized by UBC Lifeline are very unpopular, and yet by following proper procedure and cooperating with the AMS, UBC and UBC Security to book time and space, their protests have been staged successfully for years.
Perhaps instead it comes from the somewhat unpalatable reaction that the AMS's decision drew from supporters. To draw a parallel, I'd like to mention the actions of certain members of Hong Kong's Umbrella Movement when they were to be sworn in as members of the SAR's Executive Council. Their refusal to take the oath that all other members had taken, combined with a variety of antics including opening umbrellas in the chamber, led to a refusal to seat three members.
One doesn't have to look very hard to see a certain similarity between this and the AMS's unwillingness to deal with a group whose members go by handles like “DJdeportation” on Twitter and draws support from a club whose leader bluntly proclaimed the AMS's decision “bullshit.”
Coupled then with proceeding to place a male symbol on the engineering cairn, just steps away from the site of commemorations for the Montréal Massacre, the overall picture they paint of themselves is that they are a volatile group, impulsive and more bent on expressing displeasure than following due process or cooperating with others to achieve their goals.
The real reason they aren't being taken seriously is perhaps because they aren't acting seriously. One could petition, could rewrite their club's proposal, could speak with the SASC program directors with the aim of forging an unlikely but perhaps productive alliance — a variety of ways forward were open. Through their actions, the club's organizers and supporters have loudly rejected all of them. The firebrands have burned their bridges and are now frustrated they can't cross the river that lies between fringe group and recognized clubs.
As I'm sure members of the Free Speech Club would agree, one has a right to say what they believe and they've certainly said it. However, there's no such right to being taken seriously. That they have to earn.

Hey, corporations using our public airwaves, don't you think the American people have a right to know this?
German Television network ARD recently conducted an interview with the world famous (some may say infamous) whistleblower, Edward Snowden, which has been intentionally blacked-out by all corporate media outlets in the U.S., and virtually ignored by other broadcast networks. The video has even been removed from YouTube almost immediately after each time it's been uploaded. One might be able to reasonably assume it contains important information that authorities would prefer the general public didn't know anything about. This appears to be a problem unique to the U.S., however. In Germany and across most of the rest of the world, this interview was treated as a major political event—both in print and in broadcast—that was in no way, shape, or form swept under the rug. To the contrary, it is almost as much a topic of discussion abroad as is Justin Bieber's DUI here in the states; and when the general populous of a nation is better informed about some kid's inebriated joy ride than they are about the policies which directly affect their very freedom and privacy, it's time to re-evaluate what our values and priorities are as a culture.
Instead, the media is quick to dismiss Snowden as a traitor rather than focus on the content of what he's revealed. But Snowden had an answer for that too:

Každý zaregistrovaný uživatel redditu (redditor) má možnost vkládat na stránku obsah ve formě textu nebo odkazu. Obsah se vkládá do tematických kategorií zvaných subreddity, kde uživatelé mají možnost o obsahu hlasovat nebo k němu psát vlastní komentáře. Každý uživatel má vždy možnost dát každému příspěvku jeden hlas, a to buď pozitivní (upvote), nebo negativní (downvote). Příspěvky s větším hodnocením mají pak vyšší prioritu při zobrazení dalším uživatelům. Rozdíl kladných a záporných hlasů se pak uživateli, který příspěvek předložil, započítává jako body, nazvané karma. Stejný systém funguje také u komentářů pod příspěvky.
Reddit umožňuje zobrazování obrázků a přehrávání videí z různých internetových přehrávačů. Funkce redditu může být dále rozšířena různými doplňkovými pluginy do prohlížeče, jako např. Reddit Enhancement Suite. Existují také různé aplikace, které usnadňují zobrazení obsahu z redditu na chytrých telefonech.

The New Zealand government-appointed Flag Consideration Panel, charged with looking at over 10,000 publically submitted proposals for a new national flag, has whittled down the list of submissions to a shortlist of 40 designs.
© Flickr / Backbone Campaign Leaked TPP Doc Reveals 'One Size Fits All' Plan to Boost Multinationals
The 16-person panel will now subject the shortlist to further examination and scrutiny, including extensive intellectual property checks, reducing it to four designs, which will then be voted on in a national referendum between late November and early December of this year.
An open letter signed by the panel's members stated that new flag must be "unmistakably" New Zealand's, noting that the design must be "timeless, can work in a variety of contexts, are simple, uncluttered, balanced and have good contrast." The letter also noted that the new flag should aim to celebrate the country "as a progressive, inclusive nation that is connected to its environment, and has a sense of its past and vision for its future."
The panel said that its decision on the shortlist was guided by input it had received from "thousands of Kiwis across a range of communities" telling them "what is special to them about New Zealand."
© resources.news.com.au The 40-design shortlist of flags which might replace New Zealand's current flag following national referendums to be held later this year and in March 2016.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, who authored the initiative to change the flag, is said to favor a silver fern design to replace the present flag.
As the New Zealand Herald explains, the silver fern is believed by many New Zealanders to be emblematic of the country, much like the maple leaf is widely considered symbolizing Canada. The symbol is widely used by sports teams, by the military, and by emergency services, and is present on the country's money, on passports, and on the planes of the country's national airline.
Other popular symbols include the Southern Cross constellation, which is present on the current flag alongside the Union Jack, and the Koru, an unfurling silver fern frond symbolizing new life, growth, strength and peace.
The flag-changing initiative has been subject to some public criticism over its cost, estimated at NZ$26 million (equivalent to about $17.09 million US). Opposition Labour Party leader Andrew Little argued recently that the second referendum should be abandoned if the first attracts less than half of eligible voters.
Pax Zwanikken, a Sydney, Australia-based New Zealander who submitted roughly 20 flag designs, saw two of his proposals make the shortlist of 40. The graphic designer told The Guardian that while "there is a strong sentiment that this process isn't something the public really asked for at this time…it's happening now so I think we should turn our energy towards making sure that this money isn't wasted and that we take the opportunity to create something good out of it."
Following the referendum set to take place later this year, a second referendum will be held in March 2016, when New Zealanders will choose between the existing flag and the new design. New Zealand's current flag was formally adopted in 1902.
Former Secret Service officer Gary Byrne told Sirius XM host Stephen K. Bannon on Tuesday's Breitbart News Daily that he wrote his controversial new book Crisis of Character , about his time working in Bill Clinton's West Wing, in part because he thought it was important to give American voters a clear look at Hillary Clinton's character before the 2016 presidential election.
“I realize that people in the Secret Service, uniformed division officers like myself, aren't supposed to talk about these things. But somewhere across the threshold, it's important for the people to know what the truth is. And Mrs. Clinton is not a leader,” he declared. “My experiences in that White House, they went from comical to almost fear, because of the way she behaved. There's no way she's going to function as Commander-in-Chief. She couldn't function as the First Lady, normally. Anybody that has that dangerous behavior where she irrationally yells at people over the simplest things — she's not a nice person. She's not a leader. At best, she's a dictator, and she's a poor one.”
Byrne is well aware that he has broken the “code of silence” assumed to exist between the Secret Service and their protectees. He said it was an action he did not take lightly.
“What I saw in the Nineties, during President Clinton's administration, what I saw of his wife — if the American public saw it, there's no way that she would even have been chosen as the Secretary of State, and she never would have run the first time. It's time that people find out the truth,” he said.
“I'm not talking about little things,” Byrne stressed. “I'm talking about flaws in character. This is an important thing. People don't understand what being the President of the United States is. I'm telling you, even President George Herbert Walker Bush, who was Vice-President for eight years, had no idea what it was, when he stepped into Ronald Reagan's shoes. And even though Bill Clinton was President, and she was pseudo-president or chief of staff, I'm telling you, the things that go on in a day, in a four hour period in the morning, for the President of the United States, is overwhelming. And if you don't have the type of character where you can deal with these things, and have the mentality where you can fix the problem, and not get wrapped around the axle with the anger of what happened, you're not a leader. And that's what I saw from her.”
“Clearly, I feel strong enough about what I saw that it is time to come forward,” he said. “If I don't say something, none of these other guys will.”
When Bannon mentioned an incident recounted in the book, where Hillary Clinton put her arm around Byrne and said he was her “favorite guy,” Byrne said he knew it wasn't true when she said it.
“She doesn't see anybody as her ‘favorite guy,'” he said. The incident in question involved a women's group from Arkansas taking a tour of the White House. Hillary Clinton wanted them to wait in the Oval Office until she could meet with them, but Byrne said that was a violation of security protocol. Clinton brushed off his attempt to show her the relevant rules in the “Green Monster” handbook, berated him for not being “user friendly,” and declared the uniformed division of the Secret Service was “a bunch of a-holes.”
Under this pressure, Byrne devised a compromise where Clinton's guests could safely wait in the Roosevelt Room. After he gave them the White House tour, Hillary Clinton reappeared for what he thought would be another dressing-down, but instead she's praising him as “one of our favorite people here at the White House” and a “great tour officer” to the visitors.

“She can just turn it on, and turn it off,” Byrne said. “She's like the ultimate Jekyll and Hyde. She has no respect for us. My impression of the Clintons, especially Mrs. Clinton, is that she can't stand law enforcement, and especially she can't stand the military.”

After more than a year abroad, I followed some gluten-free bread crumbs to San Francisco.
When I told Marisa where I was headed, she surprised me by saying that she had been planning to move to the Bay Area as well. I was slightly worried about being in the same city as her again, but it seemed as if the 16 months away from each other had renewed our mutual appreciation and made our friendship healthier.
I was relieved to hear she was moving to Oakland, across the bay from me in San Francisco. It seemed like a good compromise: to have her in my everyday life again, but not every day.
For a while I felt encouraged. I had made it to the gay Mecca; nothing would stop me from finding my bearded other half now! But if you want to make God laugh, make an OkCupid profile.
I went on tea dates with meditators, sex dates with polyamorists, friend dates (that turned into sex dates) with married men and myriad unremarkable dates with both nice guys and jerks. None of them led anywhere. And Marisa had no luck, either. Turns out your problems follow you; go figure.
And then I turned 40 and found myself in a state of crisis. Since being told, at 18, that I was clinically depressed, I had faced many dark moments in my adulthood — a handful of which made me crash-land for months or even years with one relative or another.
Suddenly, I found myself again saying, “This was not part of the plan,” conveniently forgetting that I never really had a plan to begin with. I couldn't move back in with my parents or siblings at this point. So I asked Marisa if I could stay with her for a while.
It was yet another humbling moment in my life, sleeping on her sofa while her two little boys tried to get to the “candy” in Uncle Ephi's prescription bottles. I felt laden with shame trying to figure out how I had become that low-functioning middle-age clown you see on sitcoms: the hairy, interloping barnacle with an affinity for couches. The ambiguously gay uncle (Guncle) with a perpetual 5 o'clock shadow and an inappropriate joke.
Balfour Beatty, working with Populous, Buro Happold and the London Legacy Development Corporation, have repurposed the iconic London 2012 Olympic stadium, originally built to host London's 2012 games. Their latest video (see below) talks us through the redesign, highlighting how they are championing sustainable practices throughout the project.
According to the video, the stadium, which is now home to West Ham United FC, will have a capacity of 54,000 people for football matches and 80,000 for athletics events and music concerts.
Sustainability and skills building
Sustainability has been at the very heart of the redesign. So far the work undertaken has included the reuse of 19,000 tonnes of recycled demolition materials, 6,000 m of cable, 3,800 lights and 1,000 mechanical and electrical components. This will undoubtedly help send a message out to the refurb and retrofit industry of what can be done to try and push the industry towards reducing the volume of waste to landfill. (According to a report by the Wates Group, the UK construction industry sends 36 million tons of waste to landfill sites each year.)
The regeneration project has also been doing its bit to tackle the skills shortage, with Balfour Beatty creating 50 local apprenticeships and over 300 training opportunities across the site.
Continuing a legacy
Stephen Tarr, Managing Director of Balfour Beatty's Major Projects business said, “From the very beginning we were focused on continuing the legacy of this historic venue, transforming it from its original use of a single-purpose venue to a multi-functional world class venue providing numerous opportunities and uses for generations to come.
“We have utilised some of the most complex engineering techniques on this project, capitalising on our in-house capabilities and expertise to ensure the project was delivered safely to a high specification whilst boosting the local economy through employment opportunities; it's a project we are all immensely proud of.”

Our correspondent savours the natural beauty and the traditional lifestyles on the islands, under threat from commercial developments
“This rock is a dragon, left here before the last great war.”
“Look at the top of the cliff. We call that rock Ferdowsi, as it looks from afar like the great poet.”
Locals have stories for the rocks and cliffs that resemble birds, animals or mythical creatures. “We grew up with our grandparents taking us on long walks and telling us about the rocks,” says Ali Hormuzi, a 44-year-old resident.
Colourful mountains in shades of pink, red, purple and yellow overlook shorelines where turtles and flamingos roam or sunbathe.
This is Hormuz island in the Persian Gulf, the mostly forgotten land of colours in the Strait of Hormuz, 5km from the mainland, and southeast of Bandar Abbas, major port and capital of the province of Hormuzgan. The island was visited among others by Marco Polo. Ibn Battuta who came twice between 1330 and 1340, wrote that the island's city was “fine” and “large...with magnificent bazaars.”

The island was once settled by tens of thousands but its population has fallen below 10,000. Many have been unemployed since relations with Oman, an important trading partner, soured during the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005-2013).
“Before, most men on the island were involved in trade with Khasab, a coastal city in Oman,” says Ali. “We would go in the morning and come back at night, never leaving the special reserved area for Iranians. I never saw the rest of Khasab despite going there for years. We just weren't allowed in.”
A Londoner in Iran, off the beaten track Read more
Locals would bring goods back to Hormuz, and then sell to traders in Bandar Abbas and Qeshm, a neighbouring Iranian island. “Technically, it was smuggling, since it was all done under the rug,” Ali explains.
Ali has worked hard to make ends meet since trading with Oman declined. Smuggling, qhachagh, is a word you hear all over the Persian Gulf islands, including Qeshm, from where I have travelled the 60km to Hormuz.
In some ways the islands are distinct from the rest of Iran. The wind-catchers – long, rectangular structures that cause airflow from the cooler undergrounds to the main rooms – in old homes are even more intricate than those found in Yazd, in the central desert. The cats resemble Siamese cats more than any feline you will find in Tehran, Isfahan or other mainland cities: one can only imagine they arrived on trade ships.
Unlike many parts of the country where women have shed traditional regional attire, the women of Qeshm and Hormuz mostly wear the colourful bandari pants, loose at the top and tight at the bottom with vibrant embroidery. A loose cotton chador with rich, bright flower patterns covers their heads.

But despite deep trade and cultural ties to India and Pakistan, locals know themselves to be Iranian first and foremost. Rice is cooked the particular Iranian way, steamed and then crisped at the bottom and along the edges - tahdig.
Local cuisine, especially on Qeshm, which sees most tourists, is plentiful and delicious, with seafood offered once the sun sets and residents get out by the water. Octopus, fish and shrimps are sautéed with onions, tomatoes and local spices, and put into a sandwich with pickled cucumbers and cabbage. A local mix of ten spices and herbs including turmeric, cloves, dried rose petals and cinnamon makes meals exemplary.
In recent years, with the absence of hotels across the islands, people have begun turning their homes into restaurants and hostels. The most famous is nakhoda (captain) Amini, a sailor turned restaurateur in Tabl village, on Qeshm island. He has a dozen rooms, and theirs is a family business: his wife cooks, he manages, the children and grandchildren take care of affairs.
Guests are given a notebook to sign, and captain Amini says he now has a sack full of them, and plans to publish a book on his 20 years in the business. There are notes by people from as far away as Australia and Germany, and there is a family from Spain staying in the room next to me.
Traditionally, homes on the islands were all built with wind-catchers. But today, on Qeshm, Loft village is the only place where they can be found. Following an earthquake in 2005, the houses were rebuilt with cement and air-conditioning. “It's an archaeological artefact,” a woman tells me, pointing to her wind-catcher.
Lotf village is also known for its view of the Persian Gulf, and as we walk the village in the late afternoon, at least a dozen European tourists are waiting on a hill to watch the sunset. “Where are the Iranians?” I ask a resident. “In the shopping malls,” he answers.
With sanctions against Iran, smuggling has supplied the Dubai-style malls sprouting up. Most of the merchandise came that way, a storeowner in Qeshm city centre tells me.
Qeshm was declared a free trade zone under the presidency of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (1989-1997), following a boom in Kish, another island in the province. The quest to create a business-friendly environment around glitzy island resorts in the Persian Gulf began under the Shah. After he built a villa on Kish, his regular trips were well publicised and led to the establishment of the Development Organisation of Kish.
Whole villages were razed to make way for large-scale projects. Following the 1979 Revolution and end of the Iran-Iraq War in 1988, the vision was carried forward despite tight economic sanctions. There are now many Iranian free trade zones including not just Kish and Qeshm but Chabahar in Sistan-Baluchistan province and most recently Arvand in Khuzestan.
What makes Qeshm different from Kish, known throughout Iran as a shoppers' haven, is that many locals own stores and malls. But while locals that are savvy enough to jump ship can prosper, those wedded to the traditional pastoral life are pushed into deep poverty. In Kish, locals live in almost slum-like conditions beyond the high rises and shopping malls.
Naeem, an acquaintance in Qeshm, has been smuggling fuels like petrol to Dubai since he was 14. “It's been lucrative,” he tells me. “I have a house, a car, and will be fully paying for my own wedding next week.” Weddings on the island are seven-day affairs where the entire village is fed many times, so paying for one's own at 25 years of age is an achievement.
From 2014 to 2015, the number of petrol smugglers has dwindled. “The profit used to be threefold,” says Naeem, who is trying to get into tourism, while still transporting cargoes of clothing and foodstuffs from time to time. In summer of 2014, Naeem counted more than 100 petrol smugglers in one day. In 2015, “I see less than half a dozen on the same road. “The guards have cracked down hard,” he says.
Toyota Hilux pickup trucks are invariably used, and as we drive along the coast, Naeem points out one after another: “smuggling clothes”, “gas.” On Naz island, off the coast of Qeshm, he takes a child's shirt from the water and puts it in the back of his pickup. “It's brand new, that's alarming. Sometimes smuggling ships have to dump their load if they notice guards coming close. I'll take it to show the rest of the boys in the village, they have to be careful these days.”

The “boys” stick together, and inform one another of things they've seen. As soon as we see guards stopping three Toyotas with gasoline in the back, he calls several friends and warns them to keep watch. As we hear the call to prayer from a mosque, he asks to stop: “I try to never miss Friday prayers, especially the sermon.” In Qeshm, the population is predominantly Sunni Muslim.

Fishing is a main source of income across the Persian Gulf islands, but one that has always been associated with a more humble lifestyle. Driving around Qeshm, the fishing villages are always more simple than where smugglers, merchants, dhow constructors or mall-owners live.
Regardless of occupation, the flow of outside investments disrupts quiet lives. Within Qeshm city, a long man-made beach was built in front of homes by the water, and turned into a road, despite objections from residents. “We used to sit by the coast every afternoon and drink tea,” says a resident. “Now we can't even let our kids outside for fear of the cars.”
Arang Keshavarzian, professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic studies at New York University, writes: “Iran's free trade zones in the southern Gulf currently rest on a tacit alliance between state officials, members of the military, and cross-border traders, a coalition that is not conducive to economic growth, egalitarian re-distribution of resources, or democratisation.”
Corruption is a word one hears everywhere on the islands. In 2013, the newly appointed head of Qeshm free trade zone spoke of “a vast loose financial mafia” that had been “looting the island's riches en masse.” A large incomplete building that was to be the headquarters of the Heritage Organisation sits in ruins near Holor village, half built because the head of the project disappeared with the budget, neighbours allege.
Qeshm airport was bulldozed in a plan for a multimillion dollar development project with hotels, theme parks and a vast shopping mall called Golden City. While a new airport has opened 60km from the city, Golden City remains unbuilt with long walls surrounding the land. Two cab drivers and two shop owners and a local resident all echo one another. “It was bought off by Ahmadinejad cronies for less than 30,000 tomans [£6.70, $10.50] a square metre,” says one. “They tore down an airport, just like that.”
The far smaller island of Hormuz is facing tough economic times. While Oman and Iran again harbour closer diplomatically, Khasab remains shut tight to Iranians. Unemployment is rampant on Hormuz and I notice drug addicts in the street, a rare sight in Qeshm. There are also almost no cars. “Only a few dozen people own them here,” says Ali.
The island has only one small medical clinic, where a general practitioner works a few hours each day. The sick and pregnant must travel by boat to Bandar Abbas to see specialists.
“Most people these days get by through fishing, but there's less of that than there used to be, or driving around tourists but that's only in the winter and early spring - then it gets too hot,” Ali tells me. “In the summer, we just hang out indoors all day and spend from our pockets [what has been made in busier times]. If you haven't earned enough, you're in trouble.”
Hormuz has been trying to get in on the riches of the free trade zone, Ali says, but each time the plan has gone awry. Most recently, in February 2015 Ali Larijani, speaker of the Iranian parliament, announced that adding Hormuz island to the free trade zone was under consideration in parliament.
The promise alone made real estate prices skyrocket. “I bought 100 square metres of land by the Persian Gulf ten years ago,” says Ali. “Back then, it was 30,000 tomans a metre ($10.50 or £6.70 at today's exchange rate). Now, it's more than 400,000. I wish I'd bought more.”
Each time there is news of Hormuz joining the zone, says Ali, businessmen from Tehran and Isfahan come and buy land. Still, 400,000 tomans (£ 90, $140) is cheap compared to prices in Tehran, where a typical house or apartment in downtown sells for at 9m tomans (£2,014; $2,700) a m, or the northern regions by the sea, where development land costs 1 to 3m tomans.
The house Ali has built by the water is humble, made of cement with no facade. But it is located by luscious beaches. There are no guarantees that such scenic landscapes will remain unscathed if business starts to thrive on the island.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hormuz ochre is a blood-coloured earth pigment. Photograph: Tehran Bureau
Hormuz is best known for its ochre, a red-coloured earth pigment that has made miles of this land look majestic. Traditionally, the ochre was used in everything from decorative arts to wedding ceremonies and even as a spice for fish and torshi (pickled vegetables). Now the ochre is transported by the truckload and exported. Out in the countryside among the multicoloured mountains, the dirt of tractors and trucks belonging to the mining facility can be seen from miles, razing the land, and emptying dirt into the nearby water.
The ochre is mined by a company whose primary shareholder and owner is best known as an outspoken government critic following the June 2009 protests. But residents here care little for such things, or for his denial that he owns the bulk of the company. They call him the “earth thief.”
Unlike those on Qeshm, Hormuz island inhabitants are in no way wealthy, and so it will be capital brought from outside the island that will dictate the rules. As I walk on the island's beaches – possibly the most serene and untouched in the world – I cannot help but wonder what this place will look like once the townspeople get their wish and resorts are built nearby.
Washington's Farewell Address,
To announce his decision not to seek a third term as President, George Washington presented his Farewell Address in a newspaper article September 17, 1796.
George Washington
Frustrated by French meddling in U.S. politics, Washington warned the nation to avoid permanent alliances with foreign nations and to rely instead on temporary alliances for emergencies. Washington's efforts to protect the fragile young republic by steering a neutral course between England and France during the French Revolutionary Wars was made extremely difficult by the intense rhetoric flowing from the pro-English Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, and the pro-French, personified by Thomas Jefferson. In his farewell address, Washington exhorted Americans to set aside their violent likes and dislikes of foreign nations, lest they be controlled by their passions: “The nation which indulges toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave.” Washington's remarks have served as an inspiration for American isolationism, and his advice against joining a permanent alliance was heeded for more than a century and a half.
George R.R. Martin continues to crank out words at a feverish pace on why he isn't cranking out words at a feverish pace, and every time he does, someone floats the same morbid hypothetical: What if he dies before he finishes A Song Of Ice And Fire? And in one of his seemingly daily interviews, this time with Swiss newspaper Tagesanzeiger, Martin has responded. “I find that question pretty offensive, frankly, when people start speculating about my death and my health,” he says. “So fuck you to those people.” Martin punctuates his declaration with a defiant middle finger, in a clip that has already become a GIF you'll see now see affixed to every discussion of his productivity, his storytelling decisions, and any time a character dies on Game Of Thrones from here on out.

Martin does acknowledge that, at age 65, “lately, I've been slowing down,” though he hesitates to ascribe it fully to advancing age. Rather he attributes the increased wait between novels to the many demands placed on him by the series' success, and all those tangential things he has to attend to now—the TV show, the merchandising, the blogging, the throwing out of first pitches, the giving of constant interviews about how his writing has been slowed by constantly giving interviews, etc. “A writer's work is not just limited to writing the books… not in this modern age,” Martin concludes, in a lament that's unlikely to elicit much sympathy from impatient fans. For Martin's thoughts on that, see above.
Besides, Martin doesn't see any way—or any need—to appease them:
I don't know what I can do about it—I can't write many more than one word at a time. I'm 65 years old now; I've been writing professionally since 1971. I know my working methods. I don't work when I travel, I don't work in hotels, I don't work on airplanes, I don't work on trains. I work at home, when I have a nice, big uninterrupted block of time in which I can really lose myself in my work. And it's worked for me for my entire adult life. I'm not going to change it now because some people are too impatient to wait for the next book.

In conclusion, George R.R. Martin is practically begging someone to pull a Misery on him, and this interview will one day be entered as evidence for the defense.

Full report, clarification and details about the most amazing day/night ever below! Just a warning this may get very long but I am such a high right now I don't even care :)
OKAY! So the autograph line was INSANE, thankfully we had tickets that got us near the front so that was incredibly helpful. It was very fast and there wasn't much more than a quick “thank you Heidi”, a quick look at those beautiful blues and that amazing hair before we were moved along. If you're interested in seeing what I got signed you can see that here.
After that was photos, again it was super quick and my best friend and I had a photo together and separate and when it came to both of us he said “ooh double trouble!” and we died a little inside.
Later on was his panel, which we managed to somehow luckily get into the second row right next to where he entered. The panel was amazing, even though it was hot and we had to open the doors for ventilation. He also went to grab his wine and said “oh shit! Something's fallen in my wine!” when a bug had fallen in it, which was hilarious. There were copious amounts of swearing and waffling of course, and he gave the most touching recount of his first meeting with Stephen Hawking. Someone asked him if he'd work with Simon Pegg again after what he did and before the girl could finish asking the question he yelled “NO!” but then laughed it off and said he would absolutely love to work with any of the Star Trek cast again. Hopefully the video will become available in the near future.
Now. Here comes the ohmygoddidthisreallyhappen part. We had a meet and greet but his autograph line was so huge that it was about 40 minutes late, which we were all totally fine with of course! He must have been exhausted so it was lovely that he decided to keep signing until he had done everyone. There were 50 of us and we were divided into groups of 10, and put at a table with wine and cheese. I was the first one into the room and sat at the back corner, and when someone tried to sit next to me one of the staff said not to sit there, because that's where Benedict was going to sit.
I was just like OHMYGODWHAAAAAAAT!? So we all got chatting and drinking and then Ben walks in to a huge cheer and he brought two of the Hobbit dwarves (Stephen and John) with him! Being a huge Hobbit fan I was ecstatic about this, and the first guest to sit with us was John Callen. He was lovely and chatted about all kinds of things, and demonstrated meeting Prince William using my hand. Next was Stephen Hunter, he was so nice and let us all take a look at his Hobbit ring which all of the dwarves had made as a momento. Then, there was the batch. At this stage he was just wearing his white T-shirt, (he had awesome polka dot socks btw) and he came over with nibbles and a wine glass. He was literally 10cm away from me, I couldn't believe my luck! He asked if we had any questions so I asked him about Malaysia, which he said he adored and he spoke a bit about The Lost City of Z and how he'll be filming in a similar climate. I also asked him about if he liked certain cars and he spoke about his childhood cars, voicing for Jaguar and driving a bike in London. He also said how he felt like this was much better than the photos and auto sessions for having a real conversation, and I mentioned that I'd never been to something like this but was really enjoying myself, and he smiled and said “oh that's so good!” He made sure to look the person who he was talking to right in the eye, (in this case me eek!) and it was incredibly engaging. After that one of the other lovely girls on my table asked about the drunk scene in Sherlock, and he laughed and said most of it was improvised, but they really had done that rumoured gay club scene and he wished it had made the cut. He also gave us a little bit of his Sherlock in this deleted scene and it was hilarious, I can't believe I actually got to see his drunk Sherlock with my own eyes like what!? Then as quick as a flash he was off to the next table, but not before we tried to yell the loudest CHEERS! And we all clinked wine glasses.
As he left we all waved like crazy, he blew us kisses and gave us one of his shoddy hand heart things, it was the beeeeest.
Best. Day. Ever. I met the most amazing people and we had so much fun together! I feel incredibly privileged to have experienced this amazing opportunity and I truly, truly hope you all get to meet this wonderful, kind, and patient man. As always I am happy to answer any questions or give further context/clarification.
EDIT: On Sunday I went to the con again and had Benedict sign this amazing piece of artwork. He remembered me from the night before, which was just crazy awesome! At the end of the day over 2000 people attended his panel, which I talk a little bit about here :)
Inside: How to discipline and respond to a child when they say "I Hate You."
When your child says “I hate you” you may feel startled and unsure how to respond.
It can be helpful to understand why children say such hurtful words and how you can respond in positive, respectful manner to help your child feel and do better.
When children feel disappointed, frustrated, angry or other difficult emotions, they may say hurtful words. Sometimes those words are “I HATE YOU!” or “I hate you so much mom!”
“I hate you mom!”
That small phrase packs quite the emotional punch – especially if it's the very first time you hear it.
Last summer, while on vacation, my four year old son asked for a toy at a store and I declined to buy it. My son's eyes squinted and his face tensed up as he said ever so clearly “I hate you!”
I had never heard such words from my son before and it was quite the surprise.
The secret message behind your child's hurtful “I hate you” words
“I hate you” is often code for something beyond what we are hearing. Children aren't always able to express all their feelings in eloquent ways. Especially when they feel overwhelmed or upset. The words they use tend to represent more of how they feel on the inside than what they really think about us.
What these hurtful words from our children actually mean is more like:
“you are really not understanding what I need right now.”
“you are not listening to me.”
“we are totally disconnected right now.”
“I feel hurt.”
“I have big feelings and don't know how to explain them.”
“I wish you would see things from my perspective.”
“what you want and what I need are not in sync. “
As parents we give so much love, of course hearing “I hate you” can feel really hurtful.
It's tempting to be reactive or dismissive and say things like:
“Fine! I hate you too”
“Whatever”
“Nah, you don't you are just saying that”
“Go ahead, hate me all I want but I'm not cooking you dinner!”
“How dare you say that, go to your room!”
“Haha – good one, I've been waiting to hear that!”
The problem is none of those words help restore connection or help children learn to deal with overwhelming emotions.
Responding calmly to “I hate you” isn't always easy. In that moment, your child really needs you to be sensitive, compassionate, loving and empathetic.
You can transform hate into connection by being loving enough, in that moment, for the both of you.
On that day when I didn't buy a toy for my son I said to him: “Wow you must be really upset right now.” Tears started flowing and a tiny, shaky voice said “Mom, I'm really mad that Georgy died”
My in laws dog had passed away that very same day and we had found out just a few minutes before going inside the store. My son went on, “now you won't buy me the toy I really like” and more tears came about.
The tears had hardly anything to do with the toy I wouldn't buy and so much to do with loss and grief so I offered some kind words. “Sounds like a really tough day?”
“YES” my son answered clearly upset.
I asked my son if he would like a hug and he melted into my arms. He had no hate in his heart at all. He didn't mean to be disrespectful. He just didn't have the right words or the maturity to handle his sadness.
Some positive ways to respond to a child when they say “I hate you”:
Say nothing but stay close: your child may have more upset feelings to unload.
Try saying something gentle and understanding:
“ you must be really hurting”
“my words weren't what you wanted to hear”
Reflect what you think is happening:
“I can see that what I said/did/ may have been very upsetting to you.”
“I hear you. You hate me right now.”
“Ok. You didn't like what I just said/decided.”
Accept that time to cool off may be needed:
“I want to listen to you when you feel ready to share with me.”
“I'm here for you, when you feel ready.”
“I think you want space, so I will go now AND I'm happy to listen to you whenever you want to talk.”
Hearing “I hate you” is not easy and there are no magic words to say back to erase it. Listening, empathizing, connecting and remembering to be loving enough for the both of you can make a difference. The aim of disciplining children when they use unhelpful words can be to create opportunities for understanding and connection. Hate is a powerful word, with big feelings behind it.
Our children need guidance in these moments so they will be able to do better. Don't be afraid to show kindness to a child that is feeling hate. What ever kindness you give to your child will surely grow.
Peace & Be Well,

Cleveland Browns running back Willis McGahee (26) smiles during the third quarter against the Minnesota Vikings at Mall of America Field. The Browns defeated the Vikings 31-27. (Photo11: Brace Hemmelgarn, USA TODAY Sports) Story Highlights RB Willis McGahee was released by the Denver Broncos in June
He was signed by the Cleveland Browns after they traded RB Trent Richardson to the Colts
In a nine-year career with Buffalo, Baltimore and Denver, McGahee has rushed for 8,067 yards and 63 touchdowns
BEREA, Ohio – Cleveland Browns tailback Willis McGahee bears no grudge against the Denver Broncos for releasing him in June, but he'd sure love to see his old team again.
In January.
McGahee, 31, is fueled by a vision he wants his young teammates to buy into: the postseason. The Browns are a surprising 3-2, tied atop the AFC North with the Cincinnati Bengals and Baltimore Ravens.
"Who says we can't go play Denver?'' McGahee told USA TODAY Sports Wednesday. "I'm not jumping the gun. But it could happen. We're here to shake things up.
"Why not the Browns? If we take care of business, the path is set. It's time for a new beginning -- a new (AFC) face out there.''
Released by the Broncos over concerns about his ability to rebound fully from a torn medial collateral ligament and a compound fracture of his right leg suffered in November, McGahee has shaken off rust as he rounds back into shape. A two-time Pro Bowl player who was on the street for three months, he has rushed for more than 1,000 yards four times.
VIDEO: Top storylines for Week 6
He sees in the surprising Browns (3-2) glimmers of the 2011 Broncos, who went on a magic ride, led by quarterback Tim Tebow. After rallying to make the playoffs, Denver beat the Pittsburgh Steelers in the wild-card round before losing to the New England Patriots.
"When I first got to Denver, they were the same way as this team -- a young team, the offensive line was together for a few years, and it clicked,'' McGahee said. "I didn't know how good this defense was until I got here.''
McGahee insists he isn't bitter that he might have lost his best chance to win a Super Bowl ring when he was dumped by the Broncos, given the way Peyton Manning is tearing up defenses with 20 touchdown passes and only one interception.
POWER RANKINGS: Where are the Browns?
"Denver did what they had to do, and I don't have any grudge,'' McGahee said. "I texted Peyton when he threw all those touchdowns (seven against Baltimore) and said, 'Good job! Congratulations!' I've learned through the years never to hold a grudge. This is a new chapter in my life, helping another team.''
Many believed the Browns were waving a white flag on the season when they traded running back Trent Richardson for a 2014 first-round pick. That's when the Browns signed McGahee, off the couch, to fill the void.
"People thought it was over," McGahee said. "No, we're fighting for the guys inside this locker room. Once guys got a taste of three straight victories, the sky's the limit. People thought we weren't going to do too much this year because we're young. But guys are playing with heart, character and style.
"I'll be happy with us getting to the postseason -- just to get a taste in these guys' mouths.''
Unsung quarterback Brian Hoyer was supposed to play the part of Tebow in this storybook, but the hometown hero, who led the team to two straight wins, suffered a season-ending torn anterior cruciate ligament last Thursday against the Buffalo Bills.
Brandon Weeden, who had lost the starting job, replaced Hoyer and led the Browns to a 37-24 victory. But is Weeden good enough to lead the Browns to the playoffs?
PHOTOS: HOW WARM ARE THE HOT SEATS?
"Oh, yeah," McGahee said. "He completed some balls in that game that were big. He was the starter before. I don't know what happened before I came here. But from what I've seen – he's the guy.
"Sometimes when you're on that sideline and you watch another person succeed, it humbles you and makes you want to work harder.''
McGahee has rushed for 127 yards and a touchdown on 49 carries for the Browns, including 72 yards and a touchdown against the Bills. If offensive coordinator Norv Turner wants to take some of the pressure off Weeden, the Browns will need McGahee to flirt with the 1,000-yard mark again.
"I'm up for the challenge – if I touch the ball enough, I will get it,'' McGahee said. "Norv told me, 'We're going to run the ball now.' That's all I needed to hear."
McGahee said hall of Fame running back Jim Brown encouraged him when the two spoke a couple of weeks ago: "He's just really happy to see Cleveland doing good things again," McGahee said.
In his nine years with Buffalo, Baltimore and Denver, McGahee rushed for 8,067 yards and 63 touchdowns. It's been an amazing career for a back who tore his left anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in the 2003 Fiesta Bowl.
"I want to play four more years,'' McGahee said. "That would be 15 years for a guy who was supposed to never play football again."

If it was simply an exhalation of relief, I would know what to do. But it's not. I find myself at this time of winter holiday feeling more fractured than ever. I don't see my children anymore. One has indicated he wants no further contact, and the other continues as he has for almost twenty years. I don't understand how any of this happened, but it has. I suspect it's the tendency to hold others in a place of our own choosing that's in play here. But then it can be hard to let go of past hurts, real or imagined through a child's eyes.
It's not been an easy road, being a mother. An empath, I could see the larger picture so I always wanted to be fair, occasionally to the point of indecision. I didn't want either child to feel that I didn't believe them, or that their voice mattered not. However, I never suffered from the debilitating syndrome of trying to be my child's friend. I saw moms who did that and shuddered as I saw the damage they were doing. No, I was always their mother. But now the one who still occasionally speaks to me has reduced me to someone on the fringe. Although a matter of perspective, I suppose there's some truth to that.
I suppose I've expected too much from them. We've had somewhat of an alternative lifestyle, given that we homeschooled after a point, and were martial artists with our own dojo. And although I basically lived as a witch, I never found the right words to tell anyone until a few years ago. It had always been a private reality for me, growing up as a witch and an empath as well. It was my safety. It was my truth, but I never felt safe enough to tell anyone other than a few who suspected in high school and college. After that, I worried about staying employed, married, etc. Witches weren't as mainstream as they are now. And I feel horrible that I wasn't on the front lines of that struggle, aligned with my sisters and brothers in that effort. But it is what it is and I can't go back and change any of it.
So the exhalation I believe is about looking at my life and accepting what is. Maybe someday my boys will forgive me for being a mother who encouraged them to consider the “possibility of”, to convey that they could accomplish anything they chose, and to live with integrity and purpose. Or maybe they'll just forgive me because they realize that there was no roadmap for a mother with gifted children. Because I'm not the only one. Maybe they'll realize I did the best I could do, that I never abandoned them, no matter what the situation, no matter the circumstance.
Maybe they'll exhale as well and realize that they'll always have a home in their mother's heart.

The US Army has been an early adopter of using video game technology as part of combat training. Virtual reality systems, such as the Dismounted Soldier Training System (DSTS), even put the soldier into the “game,” using body sensors and virtual reality goggles. But now the Army is doing this with soldiers in a different way—using their actual physical fitness to affect how their on-screen avatars look and perform in simulation.
Virtual Battlespace 3, developed by Bohemia Interactive, is a full-on, multiplayer, networked first-person shooter for the military set, designed both for combat training and actual mission rehearsal. Its predecessor, Virtual Battlespace 2, became the standard simulator for NATO ground forces training, and it's been in use for more than five years. But now the Army is rolling out VB3 as its “flagship” virtual training platform and incorporating it into virtual reality systems like the DSTS and the Close Combat Tactical Trainer, in part because of the added realism of the latest simulator.
Part of that realism is in avatar customization. If a soldier is overweight, their avatar will be overweight too. “When they tested this last year,” Robert Munsey, an analyst with the Army's Training and Doctrination Command (TRADOC) Capability Manager for Virtual and Gaming, told the Army News Service, “one of the soldiers said, ‘I look fat.' And the other soldier sitting right next to him said, ‘That's because you are fat.'”
Virtual Battlespace 3 certainly isn't the first gaming system to reflect a player's fitness on-screen. Nintendo's Wii Fit and Wii Fit U have adjusted the appearance of players' avatars based on their Body Mass Index (BMI) and body control on the Wii Balance Board. But VB3's use of fitness input goes beyond appearance. VB3 also models the endurance of players based on their Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) scores.
There's a “fatigue bar” at the top left of the game's screen that shows an individual's endurance, reflecting his or her ability to move quickly or perform various tasks. How quickly it drops is affected by the soldier's APFT score—those at the lower end of the score range will find their virtual selves tire a lot faster than those who score at average or above. “Then the small-unit leaders have the capability to understand the performance of their squad,” Munsey said.
Another part of that additional realism is reflected in how it uses soldiers' personal data to configure their virtual selves. Unlike Halo or Titanfall, an avatar can't just pick up any weapon—soldiers won't be able to equip with weapon systems they haven't been qualified on. Qualification scores are also an input for how effective soldiers are with the weapons they carry.
VB3 can be used by Army units to train on a variety of tasks anywhere they can get access to networked computers. It should provide training on over 100 types of Army-specified “combined arms” tasks—including setting up and operating a checkpoint, aerial assaults, and calling for artillery support. Using its multiple map support and procedural terrain filling, it can model a three-dimensional operational area of up to four million square kilometers, with “high detail insets” for areas of specific interest. It also includes improved artificial intelligence for civilians and adversary forces, using “ambience” plug-ins to model urban or rural civilian activity and insurgent group behavior.
Louise Bours seeks to challenge Labour in its heartland NHS policy area but her efforts are overshadowed by continued row over Ukip's racist ‘bad apples'
Ukip would spend £130m per year on fighting dementia – £650m over the next parliament – double what the Conservatives have pledged, the party's health spokeswoman will announce on Monday.
In a speech in Rochester – which is represented by Ukip MP Mark Reckless – MEP Louise Bours will set out the party's health policies, steering away from Ukip's usual focus on immigration and Britain's membership of the EU.
Ukip health spokeswoman rejects Nigel Farage's views on NHS reform Read more
Ukip will challenge Labour on its key battleground of health, repeating a pledge to invest £3bn more on NHS frontline services, and will target elderly Conservative supporters by promising to increase funding for elderly social care to £1bn per year.
Bours, who admitted to having known “absolutely zero” about the NHS when she started as the party's health spokeswoman, will announce plans to require NHS managers to be licensed as doctors and nurses are, to scrap hospital parking charges – a move funded by tackling health tourism – and to abolish the Care Quality Commission.
Ukip would scrap tuition fees for medical students on a means-tested basis and reinstate the role of “state enrolled nurse”– an assistant nurse who is trained on the job – to create more homegrown medical talent.
Ukip says it would save billions from the country's budget by leaving the EU, slashing foreign aid and cancelling HS2, giving them funds to channel into the NHS and other areas of public services.
The announcement will come the day after a former Ukip councillor in Thanet, Rozanne Duncan, said she had “no regrets” for comments she made on the documentary Meet the Ukippers, broadcast on Sunday night.
Labour candidate: we face 'existential threat' from Ukip in south Read more
Duncan told the documentary makers that “the only people I do have problems with are negroes”. She was expelled from the party when details of her comments emerged.
The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said that a “virus of racism” was “undoubtedly present at the heart of [Ukip]” and that such comments should be taken very seriously as the Eurosceptic party is now one of Britain's main political parties.
“It is true that all political parties have their bad apples and will occasionally have candidates or elected representative saying totally unacceptable things, but the problem that [Ukip has] got is that there is a pattern here”, he said.
“My problem has been all along that the kinds of things Ukip representatives are saying about eastern Europeans are exactly the same kinds of things that people were saying about black and Asian people, like my father, who arrived here in the 1960s and 1970s.”
Umunna said he was not suggesting that every member of Ukip was racist and said that many people would vote for Ukip for reasons that had nothing to do with race. “But when we see extremism, we are entitled to point out to the public that this is what comes with that package”, he said.
“Ukip is a problem for British democracy”, he said. “I think where we see extremism it needs to be challenged.”
Umunna refused to be drawn on the question of whether Labour would ever go into government with Ukip, saying that his party was aiming for a majority and would not speculate on possible coalition partners. But Labour sources say that a number of shadow cabinet members would refuse to sit in a government with the party.
ROCKLIN (CBS13) – A Rocklin resident has asked the City Council to consider a ban on smoking that some say goes way too far.
The Rocklin City Council was asked to consider making it against the law for smokers to smoke anywhere outside on their property.
One homeowner complained about smoke coming from a neighbors' backyard, saying it caused health problems for their kids.
But before going to the city council, the family first asked their neighbors to stop smoking.
One couple agreed, according to their son.
“They felt that there wasn't any reason to put the household in any sort of health risk,” Eric Croslin said explaining his parent's position.
But some smokers and even some non-smokers saying this ban goes too far.
“So what about people who have children in their home and they don't want to smoke in their home?” asked non-smoker Tamara Davis.
“As a smoker, I think that smokers should be considerate,” said Rocklin resident and smoker Ryan Malonson. “But on your own property, that's unacceptable. It's not going to pass.”
It is already against the law for smokers to light up near businesses, parks and playground in California.
Rocklin City Manager Rick Horst originally told CBS13 the city was considering the ban. However, after the story ran and was picked up by a prominent national website, Horst contacted CBS13 and said the city has “no intention of considering the matter.”
On 3 March 1876, large hunks of flesh fell from the sky over Olympia Springs in Bath County, Kentucky.
According to a New York Times article published the following week, the phenomenon occurred right nearby the house of one Allen Crouch, whose wife was outside making soap when it happened. “The meat, which looked like beef, fell all around her. The sky was perfectly clear at the time, and she said it fell like large snowflakes.”
If this was a documentary, the words "MEAT SHOWER" would appear on screen right now, with trickles of little red meat flakes falling behind. A few select flakes would fall in front of the words for effect.
Back at the Crouch residence, a Mr Harrison Gill - whose veracity was described by the The New York Times as "unquestionable" - visited the day after the alleged flesh falls and noted the presence of meat sticking out of the fences and scattered across the ground. At least one of the hunks measured 10 centimetres squared, but most were about 5 x 5 cm. They were apparently fresh when they fell, but having been left out all night, they were now spoiled and dry.
Two unidentified gentlemen turned up to taste the meat-rain and declared that it had the flavour of either venison or mutton.
"WTF is even going on here?" The New York Times didn't say at the time.
The first explanation came three months later, when someone called Leopold Brandeis received and analysed some of the specimens that had been preserved in glycerine. He announced that the ‘meat' was not actually meat at all. "At last we have a proper explanation of this much talked of phenomenon,” it was reported in Scientific American that year. "It has been comparatively easy to identify the substance and to fix its status. The Kentucky 'wonder' is no more or less than nostoc."
A type of cyanobacteria that forms colonies surrounded by a protective gelatinous envelope, nostoc is known to swell up into a translucent jelly-like mass whenever it rains. Because it's so inconspicuous when dry, for many years, people believed nostoc to float on the breeze until it rained, which caused it to fall from the sky like hail. Colourful nicknames such as "star jelly", "witch's butter", and "star-slubber" were thrown around.
Brandeis identified the Kentucky nostoc as belonging to the species Nostoc craneum, which he described as "flesh-coloured” in The Sanitarian. But really, it honestly just looks like the colour of seaweed. It tastes like frog or spring chicken legs, he said, and had ballooned and fallen upon the Crouch residence when it rained.
But wait a minute, what rain? Didn't the Crouches report it to be a perfectly clear night? Brandeis!
Fortunately, Brandeis didn't play a completely useless role in the investigation, because he had given a couple of mystery meat samples to experienced histologist and president of the Newark Scientific Association, Dr. A. Mead Edwards, who said it was likely the lung tissue of a human infant or a horse. Another histologist, Dr. J.W.S. Arnold, studied the specimens and agreed, concluding in The American Journal of Microscopy and Popular Science that they consisted of some kind of animal cartilage and lung tissue.
Eventually, seven samples were examined by several scientists, who confirmed two to be lung tissue, three to be muscular tissue, and two were said to be made of cartilage. So how did they come to be involved in the Infamous Kentucky Shower of Flesh?
Enter the man with the best explanation for the "shower of quivering flesh” that we're probably ever going to get - Dr L. D Kastenbine, who wrote in a 1876 edition of the Louisville Medical News that it was, quite literally, a coordinated bout of projectile vulture vomit.
Having obtained a sample of his own, Kastenbine set fire to it and observed that it smelt distinctly of rancid mutton. “The only plausible theory explanatory of this anomalous shower appears to me to be that suggested by the old Ohio farmer - the disgorgement of some vultures that were sailing over the spot, from their immense height, the particles were scattered by the prevailing wind over the ground," he wrote. “The variety of tissue discovered - muscular, connective, fatty, structureless etc - can be explained only by this theory.”
Two species of vulture are found in Kentucky - the black vulture (Coragyps atratus) and the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) - both of which are known to projectile vomit their stomach contents away as either a defence mechanism or to make themselves light enough for flight. So maybe?
Or, you know, it was this guy:

Story highlights Vice President Biden takes part in an online discussion on gun violence
Sen. Feinstein warns of an "uphill road" to get her proposal passed
The NRA says it is "confident" Congress won't pass Feinstein's measure
The proposals come almost six weeks after the Newtown school massacre
On one side were pegboard panels mounted with various assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons -- including a Bushmaster similar to the one used in last month's Newtown school massacre.
Behind the stage stood police officers supporting a renewed ban on such firepower. One by one, victims of gun violence told their brief stories and expressed support for a new federal ban being proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein on some assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons.
Almost six weeks after the Connecticut shooting rampage that killed 20 first graders, Feinstein said she planned to introduce her measure later Thursday, with Reps. Carolyn McCarthy of New York and Ed Perlmutter of Colorado doing the same in the House.
Feinstein's proposal would upgrade an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 and also outlaw ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.

She said the goal is to "dry up the supply of these weapons over time."
"These massacres don't seem to stop," the California Democrat lamented, listing notorious rampages of past years known by the lone name of their locations -- Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Tucson and Oak Creek.
"We should be outraged at how easy it is" for attackers to get hold of the semi-automatic weapons or large-capacity magazines used in those slaughters, Feinstein told the event at the U.S. Capitol that she organized.
Her legislation is opposed by the nation's powerful gun lobby, led by the National Rifle Association. That means that despite a push by the White House and Democrats for tougher gun control steps, Feinstein's full measure is given little chance of winning congressional approval.
In a statement on Thursday, the NRA said that Feinstein "has been trying to ban guns from law-abiding citizens for decades."
"The American people know gun bans do not work and we are confident Congress will reject Senator Feinstein's wrong-headed approach," the organization added.
In a sign of the gun lobby's influence, a nine-day sports and outdoor show scheduled to take place in Pennsylvania next month was postponed Thursday because the NRA withdrew its support over the decision by organizers to ban the display of "modern sporting rifles" -- the kind of semi-automatic weapons targeted by Feinstein's proposal.
At her Washington event, Feinstein acknowledged that enacting a ban was "really an uphill road," adding: "If anyone asks if we can win this, the answer is we don't know, because it's really uphill."
She then made a plea for people to call their senators and House members to declare "enough is enough," adding that a mobilized public is "stronger than the gun lobby."
Later Thursday, Vice President Joe Biden made a similar appeal in an online discussion on Google, saying: "Make your voices heard."
He insisted that a reasonable ban on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as strengthening background checks, presented no threat to the constitutional right to bear arms.
"It's not about keeping bad guns out of the hands of good people," Biden said. "It's about keeping all guns out of the hands of bad people."
President Barack Obama called for renewing the assault weapons ban as part of his package of gun control proposals announced earlier this month in response to the December 14 Newtown school massacre and overall gun violence in America.
Feinstein's measure would stop the sale, transfer, importation and manufacture of more than 100 specialty firearms and certain semi-automatic rifles, as well as limiting magazines to 10 rounds or fewer, she said. Not all of the weapons in the bill meet the technical definition of assault weapons.
The restrictions would not apply to guns owned before enactment of any law. Feinstein noted her proposal exempts from the ban more than 2,000 models used for hunting or sporting purposes.
"They are by make and model exempted from the legislation," she said, adding that the old ban had 375 such exemptions.
Those exemptions were an apparent effort to garner support for the measure from conservative Democrats and others expected to face fierce lobbying by the NRA and constituents.
Supporters of more gun control acknowledge the constitutional right to bear arms, but argue that rifles capable of firing multiple rounds automatically or semi-automatically exceed the reasonable needs of hunters and other gun enthusiasts.
They also contend that high-capacity ammunition magazines provide the capability for mass shootings such as the Newtown massacre.
Opponents contend the Second Amendment forbids the government from this type of limit on weapon ownership by citizens.
They worry that such a weakening of gun rights would signal a shift that would leave citizens defenseless against criminals and, some also argue, against potential future government tyranny or abuse. Instead, the NRA has called for increasing armed guards at schools to protect students.
Speakers at the event organized by Feinstein rejected arguments that anyone beyond the military or law enforcement officers needed such firepower.
"How are you going to hunting with something like that?" asked Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, pointing to the assault weapons displayed to his left. "You kill something, there's nothing left to eat."
Continuing bloodshed on the nation's streets -- with dozens dying every day from gun violence -- should be enough evidence to overcome the past inability to get gun control legislation enacted, he argued.
"If the slaughter of 20 babies does not capture and hold your attention, then I give up because I don't know what else will," Ramsey continued, thrusting a pointed finger for emphasis.
At Feinstein's request, people who were injured or lost loved ones to gun violence, including several from the Virginia Tech massacre, then offered their support for her efforts.
Some told of losing a parent or child. Others described how attackers inflicted carnage so quickly.
Pam Simon, a staff member to Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, said she was a few feet away from the congresswoman on the day both were shot outside a Tucson grocery store.
"On that day, 30 bullets were delivered in less than 30 seconds," Simon said.
Some of the weapons on display Thursday are currently against the law in the District of Columbia, and Democratic sources told CNN that Feinstein coordinated with police on being able to have the guns there.
NBC's David Gregory was recently investigated for holding a banned ammunition magazine on the network's "Meet the Press" program broadcast from Washington. No charges were brought in that case.
Obama's proposals include expanding and strengthening background checks on gun buyers to ensure all sales include screening to prevent weapons from going to criminals and the mentally ill.
While the gun lobby has indicated support for some improvements in background checks, it remains opposed to other steps, saying they won't prevent criminals from getting weapons.
Instead, gun advocates urge tougher enforcement of existing laws and making criminals serve their full sentences.
Biden led a panel assembled by Obama in December to examine gun control steps after the Newtown shootings, which sparked a fierce public debate over how to prevent such mass killings. Biden's recommendations formed the basis of the package of proposals Obama announced this month.
A recent CNN/Time Magazine/ORC International poll indicated that Americans generally favor stricter gun control, but they don't believe that stricter gun laws alone would reduce gun violence.
In announcing his gun control package, Obama also signed executive actions that call for tougher enforcement of existing laws and require federal agencies to provide data for background checks.
New York state recently enacted a series of new gun regulations, the nation's first since the Newtown shootings. Ten other states are reviewing some form of related action.
The issue is among the most politically divisive in the country, as demonstrated by the decision by Reed Exhibitions to postpone the nine-day Eastern Sport and Outdoor Show scheduled to start February 2 in Harrisburg.
On Tuesday, the NRA withdrew its support for the show due to the decision by organizers to ban modern sporting rifles from exhibition.
"We had called on Reed Exhibitions to reconsider their decision; unfortunately they have steadfastly refused to do so," an NRA statement said. "As a result, the NRA will not be participating in the upcoming show in Harrisburg or in any other shows hosted by Reed Exhibitions that maintain this policy."
In announcing Thursday that the show was off, a Reed Exhibitions official said the intent of excluding "certain products" was to focus on hunting and fishing traditions of the event.
"It has become very clear to us after speaking with our customers that the event could not be held because the atmosphere of this year's show would not be conducive to an event that is designed to provide family enjoyment," said Chet Burchett, the company's president for the Americas.
"It is unfortunate that in the current emotionally charged atmosphere this celebratory event has become overshadowed by a decision that directly affected a small percentage of more than 1,000 exhibits showcasing products and services for those interested in hunting and fishing," he added.
I first met the author Robert Greene when I was a sophomore in college. A few weeks after that meeting, I was not a sophomore anymore. In fact, I was no longer in college.
Last month, I wrote of a few of the lessons I'd received in the last ten years from another author, Tim Ferriss. As essential as the things I've learned from Tim were, they pale in comparison to what I've learned from Robert—a man who has shaped my career and my worldview. His books alone—The 48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction, 33 Strategies of War, The 50th Law, Mastery—would have been enough to change my life. His behind the scenes work for powerful politicians, CEOs and athletes are the stuff of legend. But as luck would have it, I didn't just have to rely on legend. I was absurdly fortunate to have the opportunity to work for a time as Robert Greene's apprentice and in the years since, on the marketing of his books. I've also, at almost every major juncture or decision in my life, been able to call him and ask for his advice.
Most people won't have this kind of opportunity or access. Not everyone is even going to take the time to read his unusual, challenging books (they're missing out). They're not going to get tailored advice or get to watch him up close. So I've tried to recreate the next best thing: a list of the most essential things someone can learn from Robert Greene and pass them on to you.
1. Alive Time or Dead Time? Early on in my career I had a pivotal conversation with Robert. I was working full-time at a really good job but planning my next move, saving my money and thinking about what I might do next. I told him I wanted to write a book one day, but I wasn't sure what, how or when or what about. He told me, Ryan, there are two types of time: Dead time—where we are just waiting and Alive time—where we are learning and active and leveraging. And then he left it there with me to decide which I would choose. I wrote Alive Time or Dead Time on a notecard and for years it was on my wall—so I would never forget. I squeezed every ounce of life out of that job and it set up the career I have now.
2. Be Amoral in Your Assessments, Be Ethical In Your Actions The criticism of Robert's works is that they are sociopathic or unscrupulous. Of course, anyone who has ever met Robert Greene knows that he is an incredibly kind, generous and principled person. Is that a contradiction? Absolutely not—in fact, it's actually the underlying message of all his books. Robert taught me how to look at the world objectively. When I see an unethical person, I don't get upset. I just see who they are, I study what they are doing. Then when it's my turn to make the right decision in my own life, I make it. Robert's books are like a biology textbook. They explain what various species do. But as humans we're free to make our own choices in our own lives—and we should choose well (as he has done).
3. Objectivity Is Everything Again, it's not about seeing the world negatively—it's about removing that impartiality we project on it. When I interviewed Robert for The Daily Stoic's website, he told me about his favorite passage from Marcus Aurelius. The one about “seeing roasted meat and other dishes in front of you and suddenly realizing: This is a dead fish. A dead bird. A dead pig.” As he explained to me: “I've tried to bring that across in my writing. For instance, to deconstruct things like power and seduction and to see the actual elements in play instead of the legends surrounding them.”
4. Be Better Than People Expect That whole thing about Robert not being the evil person that some people assume after reading about his books? I like that. When you create public work, people naturally make assumptions about you. I think your goal as a creator should always be that the real you are surprisingly better than the assumption they make. You should be nicer, funnier, smarter, more open-minded, cooler, more informed. It's a lot of work to do this—but it's impressive.
5. Make Your Way to the Inside Robert's metaphor for mastery is being on the inside of something. When we start a new sport, when we get our first job, when we approach a field we haven't yet studied, we are on the outside of. But as we put in the work, as we familiarize ourselves with every component, as we develop our intuitive field, we eventually make our way to this inside. This is a metaphor from Robert I think about constantly. I don't want to be an outsider on anything I do, I want to make my way inside it.
6. Take Notes Like a Pro I've already written about my notecard taking process that I learned from Robert when I was his research assistant. I still remember the day I went to his house and he showed me the thousands of notecards he'd assembled for the 48 Laws of Power and walked me through how to do it myself. All I can say is that since learning it about 10 years ago, it has totally transformed my process and drastically increased my creative output. It's responsible for helping me publish five books in five years, (along with other books I've had the privilege of contributing to), write countless articles published in newspapers and websites, send out my reading recommendations every month, and make all sorts of other work and personal successes possible.
7. Make Time for Strenuous Exercise From Robert I also learned that swimming is a great productivity tool. Why? Because it requires total isolation: no music, no phone, no possible interruptions. Just quiet, strenuous exercise. I've had some of my most productive brainstorming sessions in the pool. Even at 57, Robert swims 1.25 miles 3-4 times per week and does some other form of exercise on the other days. It's why he is so productive as a writer and thinker. The other part of this is: The harder a time you're having with a project, the tighter the deadline—the more time you have to make for exercise and the harder you have to push yourself while doing it.
8. Learn The Art of Patience In 2009, I wrote an article about stoicism on Tim Ferriss's website. This was probably my biggest stage as a writer at that point—and then a few months later, a small publisher emailed me to ask if I wanted to turn that article into a book. It was as if everything I had hoped for was coming together. But I wanted to check with Robert first—did he think I should do it? He told me he was happy for me but actually suggested I turn the book offer down. He said that I was still learning and improving as a writer—that my life experiences were accelerating and that the book would be better each day I waited. He was teaching me to be patient. It's easier to be patient when nothing is happening though. To turn down a life-changing opportunity? That's the real test. And he was right. (Ultimately, I published The Obstacle Is the Way 5 years later and its success is something I owe to his lesson.)
9. OK Is Not Good Enough As a research assistant, I would come up with an example that I thought fit what he was looking for. Robert would review and go, “Yeah I think this makes sense, but I know there's something better.” At first, I didn't get it—wasn't the whole point to finish this book? He wanted an example that worked and I found one. But it's that sense of perfectionism that is the difference between a mediocre book and a timeless one. Today, I use that as one metric to judge a project: Did I throw away some pretty good stuff? If I didn't, it means I've settled.
10. It Starts By Wanting to Create A Classic One time I asked Robert, how do you make these books that last so long. What's the secret? His answer was simple: “It starts by wanting to create a classic.” It doesn't happen on accident. It has to be intentional.
11. Forget ‘Let Others Do All The Work, Take All The Credit' Ruthlessly stealing the work of the people beneath you is one of the most controversial laws of power. It's a reality of the working world. We think of the President's inspiring speeches, not his speechwriters. We think of a celebrity's good looks, not their stylists or their makeup artists. So you'd think it would be tough working for Robert—in fact, Robert is incredibly generous. I mean, even the fact that I am able to write this article and talk about these things is proof. Robert's graciousness is another lesson I learned and one I try to follow now with my own research assistant (Thanks Hristo Vassilev, you made this article possible.)
12. Avoid Tactical Hell Robert defines tactical hell as place where we are reactive to other people's demands and needs, driven by emotions, and never thinking ahead. The antidote to tactical hell is strategy. We must be strategic in everything we do.
13. Crush Your Enemy Totally One of the most prominent leaders of the Haitian Revolution, Toussaint L'Ouverture, once replied to an opponent: “If you have a hog that eats chickens, you may put out its one eye, you may put out its other eye, but it still will eat chickens whenever it can.” Asked what it means, he replies: “It means that the wicked are incorrigible.” It is a less intimidating summary of Robert Greene's law: “Crush Your Enemy Totally.” You realize that sometimes in war total annihilation is what is required—you can't afford to make enemies for life. But the better lesson can be this: Avoid finding yourself in situations where you put yourself in a position to create lifelong enemies—reacting emotionally in situations is easy. Self-restraint? Not so much.
14. Be a Private Person I met Robert's longtime girlfriend last week for the first time. We'd known each other for almost ten years. I'd been to his house while she was there! But he's a private person. He separates his work from his personal life. I respect that.
15. Plan All The Way To The End If you don't know where you're trying to end up, no strategy will get you there. Robert taught me to consider the end. I know what the cover of my books looks like in my head, I know what reaction I want it to provoke, I know how many copies I want it to sell and I know the life I want to lead because of it. I'm not guessing. I know. And I've planned.
16. Always Say Less Than Necessary My favorite law in The 48 Laws of Power (and the one I remind myself of the most) is basically: Shut Up. “Powerful people,” he writes, “impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish.” I think of this law when I am about to tweet, when I am considering an email, when I am coming up with marketing materials. Less is almost always more.
17. Master On-And-Off Thinking Creative breakthroughs are the result of tension. You have to ratchet it up and then switch to something else. Then, as Robert writes, “with the feeling of tightness gone, the brain can momentarily return to that initial feeling of excitement and aliveness, which by now been greatly enhanced by all our hard work.” When people say they work for 8 hours in a row, I know they're either lying or being inefficient. You have to go off and on, hot and cold. It's where the magic comes from.
18. It's All Material From Robert I learned a wonderful, freeing phrase: “It's all material.” Everything bad that happens, everything frustrating or delayed or disappointing—all of it can be fueled for a book. It can teach you something that helps you improve your business, it can become a story you pass along to a friend. Don't get upset about the things that happen. See it as collecting data. Observe it. Turn it into material.
19. Shun Distractions If you call Robert in the middle of the day, he won't answer. Because he's working. That might seem like a minor accomplishment but any writer knows how much discipline that takes. You're sitting there, the words aren't coming and you're begging for any excuse to stop. Robert's discipline is an inspiration for me and I use it as a model. I don't often meet it, but I try. I remember he once compared the noise my phone made and how quickly I picked it up to check to a “rat in an experiment.” There's a reason I have turned off all alerts on my phone. I'm not nearly as productive as Robert is, but I am getting better.
20. It Takes Time Robert published his first book at age 39. It didn't hit the New York Times Bestseller list until more than a decade later. I got lucky in the sense that some of my success came when I was very young. But when I get impatient, I think about Robert's journey. I remind myself that the next level might require waiting as long as he did, that I need to be patient. That things take time. Things that rush into this world are often rushed right out. Play the long game.
21. The Even Keel Is Essential I have not once seen Robert get upset or yell. Not during the chaos at American Apparel, not at his publisher, not at internet trolls, not at me for messing up. He is imperturbable. That doesn't mean things don't bother him. From what I understand, he is particular and likes things a certain way. But none of this can make him lose his cool. It's this discipline that it is the first step to a truly strategic mind.
22. Concentrate Your Forces This is one of the laws of power, but I actually learned it by watching Robert. When you write a successful book, you get all sorts of new opportunities: speaking, consulting, starting your own company, doing the whole guru thing. But if you notice, he hardly does any of that. He just writes really really really great books. This is not a coincidence. He has decided to say no—a lot. I say yes to more (I'm younger and I have a slightly different personality), but I always use him as a model: Concentrate most on the one thing you do that's special. Ignore the rest.
23. Cultivate a Monk-Like Existence When I first started working for Robert, he drove a very old Volvo. His house is nice but I'm sure he could afford a bigger one. I remember when Robert bought himself a nice car. This was a guy that's sold millions of books, I thought, what gives? A couple years later, we had lunch and he mentioned that it had a total of like 9,000 miles on it. He had barely driven in it. Then I realized that what's important to him is to sit at his desk and do his writing. Part of what makes him such a great writer and craftsman is the monk-like existence he has cultivated. He doesn't need to go do a speech in Cleveland to pay for his speedboat. He doesn't care about your fancy restaurants or his zip code. He cares about his work.
**
This is all a fraction of what I've learned from Robert, and hopefully a fraction of what I will learn, but still—if that were it, it would be enough to make me endlessly indebted.
If you apply more than a few of these lessons you will be too.
The Food Craft Institute's 7th annual Eat Real Festival, the outdoor food extravaganza that showcases local, organic and sustainable fare, kicked off today in Oakland's Jack London Square. We heroically sampled our way through many of the vendors' more offbeat and unusual dishes, so here are 12 stellar items that you can also try this weekend (and everything's priced under $8, too.)
WTF SF: Slow-roasted Angus brisket with egg noodles
I guarantee the lines will be long at What's the Feast SF's booth -- as it was for us during the opening day lunchtime rush. But it's definitely worth the wait, as their only regular appearance is at the Stonestown Farmers' Market on Sundays (although they're available for catering). The slow-roasted Angus brisket with a sweet Asian barbecue glaze is dished over garlicky egg noodles and garnished with pickled cucumbers; it's a delicious combination of sweet, salty and sour flavors.
Hella Vegan Eats: Birthday Burger
You may have spotted the colorful truck (and equally animated staff) of the Hella Vegan Eats truck at various farmers' markets around the Bay Area. You can't go wrong with ordering their lively 'Birthday Burger,' which is stuffed with an organic seitan-beet patty, local and organic smoked Rhizocali Tempeh 'bacon,' slices of heirloom tomato, Russian dressing, dill pickles and pancake buns speckled with funfetti (add avocado for $1.) Or you try their mac & 'chorizo' tacos and the three alluring donuts they've got for dessert: caramel brownie, chocolate cheesecake and maple 'bacon.'
Burma Bear: Palata
While the plates of smoked baby back ribs or pulled pork over coconut rice were calling our names, we decided to try the palata, a pan-fried, vegetarian flatbread dish paired with an aromatic green curry dipping sauce. It's reminiscent of Indian paratha and great for sharing with your friends as an appetizer. If the tent is mobbed by festivalgoers, check out their brick-and-mortar venue at the Second Act Marketplace on Haight Street in the city.
La Marcha: Seafood paella
Gigantic paella pans cooking up huge portions of rice, seafood and vegetables always draws huge crowds, and La Marcha's bustling tent that emanated big clouds of steam was no exception. Plans to open up a tapas bar in Berkeley are currently in the works, so for now, they're still in pop-up mode at events. Their signature paprika-and-saffron infused paella dish was bursting with meaty chunks of chicken, chorizo, shrimp, roasted garlic, sweet red peppers, English peas and Spanish Bomba rice.
Bombzies BBQ: Korean BBQ chicken bowl
While Asian barbecue is fairly commonplace, the large, hungry crowds that congregated around the smoky grills filled to capacity with Korean, Vietnamese lemongrass and Thai-coconut flavored chicken were a sure sign that we had to try Bombzies BBQ. The tender, flavorful meat is served as kabobs or as a heaping bowl of rice topped with the complimentary add-ons of kimchi and green onions.
Eat On Monday: Fried calamari tacos
There's chicken, braised oxtail and even ice cream tacos for sale at Eat Real -- but the salt-and-pepper fried calamari corn tortilla tacos topped with jalapeños, shredded cabbage, cilantro and a spicy crema-remoulade-like sauce won us over instead. They've also got buttermilk fried chicken sandwiches and mini chipotle cheeseburgers if you want to try their other tantalizing-looking dishes.
BOK SSAM: Spicy chicken and waffle sandwich
Brace yourself for the decadent (and delectable) fried chicken and waffle sandwich from the folks at BOK SSAM, especially if you're watching your waistline. Billed as a "Korean-American comfort food" catering company, you'll spot plenty of photos of these food porn-ready sandwiches on Instagram. There are two Korean sauces to choose from: sweet soy-garlic or a sweet-and-spicy gochujang, a thick, fermented soybean-red chili sauce.
Southern Comfort Kitchen: Mac n' cheese balls
The Southern Comfort Kitchen crew -- overseen by three brothers from New Orleans -- have lots of calorie-busting courses on deck, including hush puppy-sized mac & cheese balls. Made with sharp cheddar and smoked Gouda, they're rolled in Italian bread crumbs and then deep-fried to crunchy perfection. Dip them in the housemade marinara sauce and then fight the urge to curl up and take a nap next to their truck afterwards.
Jeepney Guy: Slow-roasted pork belly
We were bursting at the seams by the time we waddled over to the Jeepney Guy booth (a common form of public transportation in the Philippines), but we couldn't resist sampling a bite of their lechón, or slow-roasted pork belly -- especially after we saw the glistening racks of meat lazily turning in their mobile rotisserie. Jeepney Guy caters events if you want to wallow in your own personal supply of crispy skin and succulent pork at a private party.
Girl Friday Zeppole: Savory zeppole
Save room for dessert, because there's also a wealth of sugary, deep-fried delights available at Eat Real. Girl Friday Zeppole's Italian fritters are made to order, so your zeppoles arrive piping hot after they're poured into paper cones. While most folks gravitate towards the sweeter versions made with powdered sugar and lemon zest (with a choice of vanilla bean crème fraîche, Earl Grey chocolate ganache or seasonal blackberry stout dipping sauces), we had to try the sole savory option prepared with smoked salt, parmesan cheese and herbs that matched well with the creamy, mild chili pepper harissa sauce.
Mamacita Café: Cardamom donut kebab
Born through a successful Kickstarter campaign, Mamacita Café is both a mobile pop-up and an innovative workforce program that supports young women in Oakland by training and hiring local high school students. Their popular 'donut kebab,' or three tasty donut holes skewered on a stick, came in three flavors at Eat Real: a 'very berry' jam, cardamom glaze (our choice) and a vegan nectarine jam. We passed on the scoop of Fenton's vanilla ice cream (although we would have ordered it under normal, non-food-festival-gorging circumstances.)
Bowl'D Acai: Original Gangster
In an attempt to cleanse our palate and unclog our arteries, we made a beeline at the end of our moveable feast towards the bright silver Bowl'D Acai truck. Their 'OG' is made with a blend of açaí berries, strawberries, bananas and coconut water topped with organic One Planet granola, fresh fruit and coconut shavings and honey. They also had two other punny smoothies -- the 'Hella Green' and the 'Berry White' -- if you want a healthier alternative to the ample beer, cider, wine and spirits for sale as a part of the Drink Real festivities. (But we indulged in both.)
As a final pro tip: Be sure to bring lots of sunblocks as you wander through the festival tomorrow and Sunday (here's an online map to help you plan ahead); it's looking to be another warm weekend according to the weather forecast. You can also check the schedule to find out more about the numerous DIY demos, tastings, live music performances, kids' activities and other events happening at Eat Real. And if you somehow manage to explore everything going on, the first annual Town Eats Festival, co-hosted by Oaklandish and Lungomare, will be in the western section of Jack London Square (East Bay Express has more info about the event.)
Advertisement Standoff ends with arrest, death of OPD K9 Authorities called to serve court-ordered mental health evaluation Share Copy Link Copy
A man who held law enforcement in a standoff that lasted 26-hours shot and killed an Omaha Police K9 before his arrest Saturday night.The K9, named "Kobus," had been with the department since 2008.Mark L'Heureux, 59 surrendered to law enforcement shortly before 7:00 p.m., after walking out of a house near 83rd and Keystone Drive. During the lengthy standoff, L'Heureux allegedly fired at Douglas County Sheriff's deputies.Deputies initially went to the home Friday afternoon to serve a mental health warrant. L'Heureux locked himself alone in the home and refused to come out, according to Chief Deputy Tom Wheeler.Investigators said L'Heureux had several guns and ammunition inside the home so SWAT officials, negotiators and the Omaha Police Bomb Squad were on the scene.The ammunition included three fully automatic handguns, one semi-automatic handgun, two rifles, a shotgun and two revolvers, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office said Sunday.Monday, OPD released a photo of an officer's shield that had been struck by a bullet:In a statement Saturday night, Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said "discipline and professional coordination" brought the standoff to a close. "While there was no human loss of life during the standoff, the Omaha Police Department suffered the tragic loss of our K9, Kobus," said Schmaderer.The Chief said Kobus was going to be retired in the next several months. "Kobus died in the line of duty in order to protect the lives of sworn law enforcement," Schmaderer said.Officer Matthew McKinney was Kobus's handler and partner.Around 1 a.m. Saturday, investigators began deploying gas into the home. Neighbors reported hearing booms throughout the day as that happened. Wheeler said the gas did not have any effect on L'Heureux, or the standoff."The death of Kobus is tragic for the Omaha Police Department and especially for his handler, Officer Matthew McKinney," Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert said in a statement Sunday morning.Her statement continued:"Our police dogs provide more than safety to officers and citizens, they are part of a family. He provided a great service at the scene of a dangerous standoff. We appreciate the work of all law enforcement agencies and thank the officers involved to bring this situation to a close"Daylight Sunday revelead damage the home sustained as authorities attempted to force the suspect out.Around a half dozen tear gas cartridges littered the sidewalk, and broken window showed where neighbors say police were shooting them through.Neighbors in the area say this wasn't L'Heureux's first run-in with police.Many said L'Heureux has shown troubling behavior in the past, including harming neighbors' dogs, trespassing, and shooting fireworks at people.Jody and Daniel Rifehad a bird's-eye view of the 26-hour ordeal from their upstairs window, witnessing every tactic authorities used, and the moment L'Heureux surrendered.“We stood there, we sat right there from our bedroom window and opened up the window so we could hear the noises too. The glass shattered, big booms…and then they flooded the house with water and they tried everything to bring him out,” said Jody Rife.“All the commotion going on and all that, and just trying to see what's gonna happen, what's gonna happen to the family, what's gonna happen to the neighborhood,” Clark said.Police say L'Heureux has been booked on three counts of attempted first degree homicide, four counts of use of a weapon to commit a felony and one count of harassment of a police animal.
A week ago, the US allowed a warship to travel within 12 nautical miles of the man-made island that China had created in the South China Sea. It was supposed to send a signal that the US did not recognize the sovereignty of China's island. China was not pleased. The Chinese naval commander told his US counterpart that a minor incident could spark a war in the South China Sea.
In the meantime, an interesting Reuters story narrated how the Pentagon was “frustrated" by the vacillation in the state department and the White House in the US government.
A Pentagon report said that China had reclaimed more than 2,900 acres of land as of June, 17 times more land than the other claimants combined over the past 40 years.
Whether the US delayed the decision on the naval patrol out of concern to avoid a possible misunderstanding or it waited until international opinion against China built up would not be known until some of the US government documents are de-archived years later. But, it is possible to discern the contours of a possible US response to China taking shape. The US is right to be cautious and gradual in confronting China. The latter's reaction can be unpredictable and dangerous.
Around the same time as the Reuters story appeared, David Pilling of Financial Times wrote that China was caught between its old self-image as a wounded giant and its new one as a risen power able to enforce its version of events.
This description is apt and it was very much evident from an insightful book that his colleague James Kynge had written years ago (China Shakes The World). Indeed, China's victimhood will come in the way of its ill-concealed aspiration to occupy the pole position as the sole global superpower—a position that the US has enjoyed for a quarter of a century now.
The impression that one is left with on finishing Kynge's book is troubling. China has a strong sense of self-righteousness to its claim to be the Middle Kingdom of the earth. It believes that it has been robbed of that position by the treachery of the West and therefore, it feels that it is morally acceptable for China to adopt any means to reclaim that position.
After all, in China's calculation, it is not seeking any change to the global political order but merely restoring the order that ought to have prevailed.
This delusion is dangerous, for it blinds China to many of its own weaknesses that caused its relative downfall. Its denial of its own role in historical events is complete and the memory is irretrievably erased. Its sense of entitlement combined with its victimhood creates a propensity for the country to react disproportionately to any perceived or real threat to its supremacy.
Hence, it is reasonable for the US to tread carefully. Perhaps it is not entirely passive but it might have deliberately allowed that impression to gain currency and circulate as it went about “encircling" China with its own string of pearls.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement has been wrapped up. China is welcome to join it but on the terms that others have already negotiated and signed on to. It is unlikely that the US Congress would derail the agreement. The US agreement with Iran—assuming that it does not unravel by January—would erode the effectiveness of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation with its anti-American undertones.
Finally, while this columnist has not been an admirer of the US Federal Reserve in a long time, he has to applaud the deft U-turn that the institution had managed to make in its October monetary policy meeting.
The Federal Reserve, after appearing to lose control over monetary policy in September citing international factors as the reason, has brought a possible rate hike in December back on the table. Whether or not the rate hike is too little, too late after six years of keeping interest rates at zero is beside the point. That is a topic for another occasion.
What it can do is reignite volatility in financial markets of vulnerable emerging economies. China is clearly one of them. Not only is its economic growth slowing, but it is trying to keep its currency from sliding even as it wishes to cut interest rates to stimulate more borrowing (as though China has not had enough of debt) and more investment.
If the Federal Reserve raises the federal funds rate in December, China's capital outflows would resume and the currency would come under pressure. Both tendencies would reinforce each other. China has considerable short-term external debt that would become a bit costlier to service when interest rates in the US go up.
Therefore, while many were sceptical of our thesis when Pranay Kotasthane and I co-wrote a paper in August as to whether the US was ready to pull the plug on China, now I think it is becoming clearer that the US has been going about the job with quiet efficiency.
Quite how China's newfound ally—the UK—would react to the unfolding chain of events will be interesting to watch. Geoeconomic and geopolitical developments in 2016 will not be good for the fainthearted.

Perry: Trump's campaign is a 'barking carnival act'

WASHINGTON – Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry stuck to his guns Wednesday, taking another jab at what he calls the "barking carnival act" of his fellow Republican presidential contender Donald Trump in their ongoing feud.
"Let no one be mistaken -- Donald Trump's candidacy is a cancer on conservatism, and it must be clearly diagnosed, excised and discarded," Perry said at a Washington forum for the Opportunity and Freedom PAC, an independent group that has raised nearly $17 million in support of his bid. His remarks came on the eve of Trump's visit to Laredo, where he plans to tour the border on Thursday.
The former Texas governor added a new insult to his growing repertoire of analogies for Trump's campaign: "Empty calories."
The bad blood began in June when Perry slammed the real estate tycoon's characterization of undocumented immigrants as criminals and rapists, making Perry one of the first in the GOP field to question whether Trump's views reflect the Republican Party, which has been trying to make inroads with Hispanics and other minorities.
Since then, Perry has coined the phrase "Trumpism" for his opponent's campaign, which he described as "a toxic mix of demagoguery, mean-spiritedness and nonsense." At Wednesday's forum, Perry reopened fire on Trump for his remark attacking the war record of Republican Sen. John McCain, a former Navy pilot and POW.
"[Trump] breathes the free air thousands of heroes died protecting," Perry said, firing back. "And he couldn't have endured for five minutes what John McCain endured for five and a half years."
The cross words come as Trump has taken a double-digit lead in some polls. Meanwhile, Perry has registered support in the single digits, leaving him in danger of disqualification for the opening Republican presidential debate August 6. Talking to reporters after the forum, Perry minimized the importance of the debate in Cleveland.
"I'm not concerned about being on the stage," he said. "What I'm focused on is spending time in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina."
The forum of Perry supporters included former Dallas state representative Kenneth George, who highlighted the importance of the Hispanic vote in the 2016 elections. Trump also came under fire in the forum.
"Donald Trump provides actually an opportunity for Republicans," said Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the American Principles Project's Latino Partnership. "It can hurt the Republican party if Republicans remain quiet. Let [Trump] be on stage in the debate, but let's isolate him by denouncing forcefully what he's saying."
The Perry campaign also released a video of Trump's previous compliments about the former Texas governor, which can be viewed above.
In a rather surprising move, Nintendo has announced that it plans to introduce a brand new game console as early as next year. The catch? The new console will be specifically targeted at emerging markets, such as China and India, and lower-income gamers. With a rapidly growing middle class in these countries — especially in China — with lots of money to spend on entertainment, this is a very savvy move for Nintendo. It remains to be seen how much this move will impact the company's western gaming efforts and the losing battle against the Xbox One and PS4.
Just yesterday, during Nintendo's anemic quarterly earnings call, it appeared that the Japanese video game company was happy to sit back and take a slow-and-steady approach with the Wii U and 3DS consoles. The company said it planned to set up a new “health” division, but that was about it. Seemingly, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata was keeping something up his sleeve (other than bananas).
Speaking to a number of reporters in Tokyo yesterday, Iwata said the company will develop and release an entirely new console, possibly as early as next year. This new console will be targeted squarely at developing markets, and it won't just be a cheaper version of the Wii U or 3DS. “We want to make new things, with new thinking rather than a cheaper version of what we currently have,” Iwata told Bloomberg. “The product and price balance must be made from scratch.”
While Nintendo is undoubtedly targeting the full set of BRIC countries — just like every other big company in the world at the moment — China, with its rapidly growing, lots-of-expendable-income middle class, is surely the primary target of this new console. It isn't a coincidence that just last week, following a lift of a 13-year ban on international consoles, Microsoft would begin selling the Xbox One in China. Microsoft though, as far as we're aware, will be selling essentially the same Xbox One console that it sells in western markets, presumably at a similar price point. Speaking to Reuters, Iwata said that “for us, Microsoft's approach wouldn't work.”
I think it's a very, very smart move for Nintendo to push into emerging markets with a cheap console. After all, the company's core strength is creating awesome games — and if Nintendo has proven anything, it's that you don't need expensive hardware to create fun and compelling gaming experiences. It's easy to see how a $50 console — with a bunch of first-party Mario, Zelda, and Metroid games — could take the developing world by storm, netting Nintendo hundreds of millions of new customers, much in the same way that the Wii's innovative motion controls cast the gaming net much wider than it had ever been before.
What does this mean back home in the west? Probably not a whole lot. Nintendo has never shown much interest in competing directly with Microsoft and Sony. For better or worse, the company likes to do its own thing. There could potentially be some crossover between the company's current consoles and this new cheaper device — but if anything, games will probably flow from the Wii U/3DS to the new console, rather than vice versa.
There is another particularly nasty possibility: This new console could pull Nintendo's attention away from the west. It's possible that Nintendo is working on two next-gen consoles at the same time, but unlikely. With Nintendo yet again skipping its E3 keynote this year, and this new console aiming for a 2015/2016 release window, it might be a long time before the Wii U is replaced — especially if the new console takes off in the meantime. After all, Nintendo will follow the money: If it's selling just a couple of million Wii Us in the west, but hundreds of millions of cheaper consoles (and games) in the BRIC countries, you probably shouldn't hold out for a new Zelda title or Pokémon MMO.
Smoked Sausage & Cheesy Rice
This tasty smoked sausage skillet dinner is a complete meal cooked in one pan. Quick, easy and totally delish.
It was love at first sight when I saw this posted on one of the recipe groups I run on Facebook!
A member shared this off a recipe page called “Janet's Appalachian Kitchen.” This lady doesn't have a website, just a Facebook page where she shares her wonderful recipes, otherwise I'd give a link, but she's easy to find if you want to follow her page.

I love all the ingredients in this. I had kielbasa and used that in place of the smoked sausage. I can't really tell the difference between the two to be honest. I also used fresh broccoli and had some frozen diced red bell peppers in the freezer. I did buy the extra-sharp shredded cheddar as Janet specified just that in the recipe–and with good reason. It makes it taste so much better than just regular sharp.
This was just so good, I couldn't stop eating it!! You can't ask for more than something abundantly tasty and so easy to make.
This is a wonderful way to use leftover rice too!

Our 2013 NFL Tech Series provides a quick hit of tech insight on all 32 NFL teams up until kickoff of Week 1 of the regular season. Each feature includes the latest tech advances implemented by the organization in the effort to advance the team's success… in a wide variety of venues. Stadium experience, fan engagement, mobile technologies, player performance and health, statistical data gathering and analysis… any and all aspects of the organization's procedures in the effort to find success in the NFL is on the table. We're uncovering those efforts, investigating those innovations and pondering the benefit they might provide, for the team, players and fans alike… today and looking forward.
Today's focus is on the Minnesota Vikings as they look ahead to a competitive year following Adrian Peterson's MVP award and the final season at Mall of America Field.
The Minnesota Vikings are on an upward trend. After a strong season from the team and MVP Adrian Peterson last year, the Vikings are embarking on a journey to not only improve the team but the fan experience as well. With most of the new tech focus in Minnesota geared towards the new stadium, the idea this year is to engage with fans and bring them along for the journey; after all, this is the last season at the 31-year-old Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome!
Social Engagement
Last season, most of the Vikings social efforts were geared toward the incredible season from Adrian Peterson. They initiated a campaign through Facebook called “28 for 28” for the final weeks of the season, which introduced 28 reasons why Adrian Peterson deserved to be named the NFL's 2012 MVP. This kept fans connected and provided a platform to express their passion for the team and the season's MVP. Director of Corporate Communications, Jeff Anderson wanted the fans involved, “through a variety of highlight clips, images, opinions from analysts, as well as a fan submission. The creative campaign allowed our fans to participate and provided a complete argument promoting Adrian as the MVP.”
Collaboration between Vikings Entertainment Network and the team's marketing and communications departments has allowed an entirely new level of connection with their fans through the team website and social media platforms.
Now a season and MVP trophy later, the Vikings want to continue to highlight their star running back and exclusive content from the team. During training camp, the Vikings gave Adrian Peterson a helmet camera to film the first person view of him at practice. Fans could see what the league MVP views in the backfield and the video became very popular.
Also the Vikings are looking to have a much bigger presence on Instagram to provide some behind-the-scenes access to the organization. Team photographer Andy Kenutis will be snapping unique photos and videos using the new official Vikings Instagram profile, vikingsphotog. The Vikings have a geo-targeted social media plan in place for their game in London in September, and is looking to play off the fact that this is their final season at Mall of America Field in the H.H.H. Metrodome.
Uniforms
After a successful season last year, the Vikings are introducing a new look. With the fans input, the Vikings designed a more modern and classic uniform that embodies the Vikings tradition. Features include a matte purple helmet with a black facemask, a brighter gold accent, unique new font and numbers featuring curves that reflect the bow of a Vikings ship, and single gold and white stripes on the shoulders and pants reminiscent of early Vikings uniforms.
To promote the new uniforms, they launched the “Vikings Uniform Insider” campaign, a social reward program that gave fans a chance to earn 12 teasers – videos, images and other insights – into the new uniform design process. Fans registered with their name, email and zip code and connected with the various social media platforms. As they engaged with those platforms, they earned points that allowed them to unlock up to three teasers per week over the four weeks leading up to the uniform unveiling.
“These uniforms embrace the strong tradition of the Vikings but add a contemporary feel that speaks to the future of this organization,” said Vikings Owner/President Mark Wilf. “We believe Vikings fans will be extremely proud of the new uniforms.”
New Stadium
The Vikings are in the midst of creating a state of the art, tech savvy, multi-purpose stadium for the future of Vikings football. As previously mentioned, this is the last season at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome for the Vikings as they plan to open a new stadium in 2016. Construction begins on the Metrodome in 2014, so the following two years the Vikings will play at TCF Bank Stadium, which is the University of Minnesota's football stadium. Unfortunately, for Vikings fans used to a dome, the '14 and '15 seasons will be played outside in the rugged Minnesota winters.
However, it shall be worth the wait for one of the most advanced stadiums in the country. This stadium is a $975 million project that will be designed with stunning architecture and efficient functionality. With the largest transparent roof in the nation, and operable doors that open to the downtown skyline, the facility's openness and sleek geometric exterior will make it unlike any other stadium.
Some of the stadium features include:
Approximately 1.6 million square feet.
65,000 seats, including some of the closest to the field in the NFL; expandable to 73,000 for a Super Bowl.
Up to 125 suites and 7,500 club seats, including suites and clubs at the field level, some of which will put fans closer to the sideline than in any other NFL stadium.
Seven levels, including two general admission concourses with 360‐degree circulation and various views into the bowl.
Highest quality HD video boards in the NFL located in both the east and west end zones and video ribbon boards throughout the interior of the seating bowl.
Over 1,200 HD flat screen televisions throughout the concourse for all fans in attendance to view the game.
Lightest and most efficient roof structure in the nation for a major new stadium, which will include a single large steel super truss providing primary support for the main long span roof
Largest clear ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) roof in the country and the first on a stadium in the nation, allowing connection to the outdoors from a climate‐controlled environment.
Largest glass pivoting doors in the world that will open to the west plaza.
Application for LEED‐certified status.
Parking ramps with skyways from the north and south sides of the stadium and connections from the facility to the downtown skyway system.
“The design reflects the true story of the Minnesota community with its international style driven by climatic response and energy conservation,” said Bryan Trubey, design principal, HKS Sports & Entertainment Group. “The interior volume makes it the most versatile, multi‐use building in the country with the most advanced digital age technology.”
The stadium will have the newest state-of-the-art technology in order to keep fans connected to family and friends during games, and the facility will include a team restaurant and a Hall of Legends.
One of the coolest features of the stadium is the ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) roof that covers the southern half of the stadium. The glass-like substance will make fans feel as if they are sitting outside without being exposed to the elements. It will diffuse some of the direct sunlight and radiant heat to create a more climate control atmosphere but with the sense of being outside.
The stadium is built to deflect the bad Minnesota weather as well, so issues like the roof collapsing never happens again. Jeff Anderson stated “several characteristics of this roof are designed for the Minnesota climate. First, the slope of the stadium – rising from approximately 205 feet high in the east to approximately 270 feet in the west – will give the facility a unique ability to shed snow. Secondly, the translucent ETFE material will allow more sunlight and radiant heat through the roof, which combined with the natural rise of heat from inside the stadium will help melt the snow and ice. So where will all of that snow and ice go? Diverters will redirect it into gutters and collection basins located on the edges of the roof, keeping snow and ice from falling to the ground below.”
Looking Ahead
Since most of the efforts and time are spent on making the new stadium as great as it is be, the Vikings are not wasting time on upgrading any of the features at Mall of America Field this year (which makes sense). They do have an app that features content from the team and new stadium updates, but they are saving major upgrades for the future. The Vikings have a dedicated page on their website that features updates about the new stadium as well.
The Vikings have big plans for the future. With new jerseys and a new stadium brewing, the Vikings are reshaping their identity. Hopefully the new stadium will give Minnesota leverage to host a Superbowl in the future. In the meantime, Vikings fans are looking forward to setting on sail on their new ship!
John Linnell and John Flansburgh of They Might Be Giants have been making music for 30 years, and they still haven't run out of things to say. While other bands with that kind of longevity just go through the motions and secretly hate one another, the Johns somehow manage to get along and keep making good records.
Their 15th record, Join Us, has been three years in the making. During that time, They Might Be Giants have been putting out wildly successful kids' albums, and Join Us marks their return to "adult" rock n' roll.
We were lucky enough to spend some time on the phone with John Linnell, trying to figure out what this record is all about. It turns out that after 30 years, a band can just make music without having to explain themselves. Join Us is a Might Be Giants record: you'll either get it, or you won't, and Linnell is totally okay with that.
Join Us is out July 19th.
Jay Hathaway: The narrative around this album so far seems to be about going back to your original sound. That seems kind of strange for a band that's always been about trying new things.
John Linnell: I would say that we're very intuitive when we're working, so we don't have this charter that says we're going to go back to our original plan or something like that. I'm not even sure who makes up the narrative at this point. We did a set of interviews for the press release, and [the writer] was like, "What's the story? How are we going to talk about this Album #15? What can you say that you didn't say about the last one?"
I'd say that we mostly have the luxury of not having to say what the hell it is we're doing, what's different about the new project, y'know. That's how we work. The chatter is after the fact.
I guess it always feels like we're, in some sense, trying to get back to the original impulse, however we are approaching it formally. We're trying to make music from scratch, you know.
This album, for example, Join Us, when we started recording, there wasn't a notion of it being a particular kind of album. We obviously are changing all the time in ways that we're not necessarily even controlling. Just getting older and having your perspective change is a way of evolving.
I'm sorry. I'm kind of coming up with excuses for why I can't explain what the theme of the new album is.
JH: Flansburgh said in an interview that he felt The Else was "too aggressive" and that you guys were in a more natural place with Join Us. Do you agree with that?
JL: I think he's right about The Else. It was something we noticed while we were making it. I said something along the lines of "This is the least cuddly record we've ever made." But again, that wasn't something we planned out.
Here are some observations I've made about this one: I think Flansburgh is really opening up his lyric writing in a way that -- I mean, he's had songs in that direction in the past, but his lyric writing on this album -- can I say record, or does it just sound like I'm 80 years old? -- his lyrics are much more elliptical and free-associative in a very interesting way. He's freed himself up in a very cool way in his lyric writing.
JH: That's always seemed like your department.
JL: That's true. I think in the past, my lyrics have been the ones that have been the least concrete and the most obtuse. It's kind of interesting to me to see John writing stuff like -- well, he's not doing the same thing I have done. He's coming up with his own language and style, and it's really good.
JH: I recently read about a study that analyzed a bunch of pop lyrics and decided that music is more self-centered and aggressive now --
JL: Oh, I saw that. Yeah, yeah. I was kind of amazed at the conclusion they drew. Not only did they say that statistically the words "I" and "me" showed up in lyrics, but they said that this proves that people are more self-centered than they used to be. That's kind of a big leap.
It would be kind of like saying that because there are a lot more slasher films, people are more homicidal than they used to be. It's the same kind of leap, I think, to go from the art, the artifice to saying "this is the way people are living their lives now, and this is the way they think now." I think that's a huge mistake. I think it's a huge fallacy. Lyric writing is very often mistakenly thought to be autobiographical, and in our case, that's the biggest mistake of all.
JH: Do you think your lyrics have moved in one direction or another over time -- more inward-looking or more outward-facing?
JL: Mine personally, as opposed to John's? I'm interested in how his lyrics have changed. I have less to say about my own lyric writing, because I'm kind of inside of it. I think it's a cliche about getting older, but I feel more comfortable with the formal parts of it. I've written a lot of songs, so I kind of know the ropes in some sense. Nothing to say about the quality of it, but I know how it works. I wouldn't say I've gotten more personal, though. We've always had the notion that the most interesting thing you can write about is something in your imagination. Real life and autobiography, at least for us, doesn't hold a candle to stuff you can just make up.
JH: Do you worry about the current generation of kids being more self-centered? You're raising a kid now, so are you at all alarmed by this internet-enabled exhibitionist phase people seem to be going through?
JL: I'd be worried generally about kids being too self-involved and not thoughtful. I think honestly it's a stage of growing up. Babies are incredibly self-involved, children less so, and you hope for your own kids that as they get older, they get more interested in other people and more concerned about other people. It keys into politics. The political position that is self-interested is kind of a more childish position. When you start worrying about other people and realizing that your fate is tied to the fate of those around you, that's a more grown-up attitude. That's what I want for the culture as a whole. That's what I want for the political endgame: for people to care about each other.
JH: Are there things that you'll try now, musically or just in life, that you wouldn't when you were younger? Or do you think it's kind of gone the other way, where you're ...
JL: ... less comfortable.
JH: Yeah!
JL: I dunno. I think John already said this. We are essentially uncomfortable people, in a certain way. But maybe we're more comfortable with being uncomfortable, because we realize that's what we're like. And we're not in high school anymore, so it's not such a problem socially.
I'd say there are things we tried in the past few years that we were nervous about early on, and at a certain point, we kind of realized it was good to get more other people involved and we felt less like we were diluting the project. We made a bunch of records with just us and a producer, and then we started having a regular band involved, and we've given more responsibility to the other guys. We've worked with producers who took more extreme liberties with what we were doing. We'd have a song and the producer would say, "Let's completely change that around." I think we're more comfortable with that now than we ever were back in the day.
Having said that, we didn't do a lot of that on this new record. We produced it ourselves. We worked very, very slowly. This is probably the slowest we've ever worked on something. Maybe that's something that distinguishes it.
JH: You started writing this in 2008?
JL: Something like that. It's been a number of years. We've been doing other stuff, but we started recording some of these tracks a few years ago. This has been our Chinese Democracy.
JH: There's that saying about the sophomore slump, and how first albums are always better because you have forever to write them. Is taking a few years like doing that first album over again?
JL: Yes, exactly. That's a great peg. This is our second first album.
JH: I like that. It doesn't seem like you're too weighed down by having made 14 other records, though. Do you feel like that's an advantage when you write a new album?
JL: I think that one great advantage is that we're not trying to define who we are. At this point, people are either okay with it or they're not interested in it. Even people who are finding out about us for the first time quickly learn that we have this long history, so what we're doing is kind of settled in some sense. We at least are perceived to know what we're doing.
JH: A lot of bands that've been around as long as you guys have seemed to be phoning it in at this point, but your albums haven't really dropped in quality over the years ...
JL: There's something nice about bands that are nervous. I think our first album sounds very nervous. We probably didn't feel very confident, and we were worried that people wouldn't like it. That's not bad, y'know? It's good to worry about what other people think. I would say and hope that we're still somewhat worried and we don't want people to hate us.
One of the reasons we took so long to make this is that we did write a lot of songs, and sift through them and reject a lot of them because we feel like we don't want the standards to drop.
JH: It seems like Flansburgh was champing at the bit to get back to making the "adult" albums, and he just wanted to rock out and play loud. Were you on the same page on that?
JL: Probably just in terms of volume, he's more comfortable playing loud as a natural thing. For me, I like loud volume, but I can also take it or leave it. The thing with the children's thing was not so much about the volume for me as whenever we had to be at all self-conscious,which was surprisingly not that often. But I feel like we work best when we're not really thinking too hard about who it's for. Obviously, with the kids thing, you do have to worry about who it's for.
I think we were happy to make these records where some of it was going to go over the kids' heads, and the happy result of that is that some of the kids get things that you don't expect them to get. They're smarter than you think. We tried not to filter that we were trying to filter too much.
What amazes me is that kids are attracted to so many things. It's actually the adults who have the problem with challenging material. Kids are actually interested in it.
JH: It reminds me of the whole Rebecca Black phenomenon, where you have this manufactured pop ...
JL: About half the interest in her is negative, right? It's a weird phenomenon of actually exciting a lot of hatred.
JH: Yeah, exactly! But at a certain point, it becomes unironic. Artists have gone on tour and covered this song, and I can't tell if they're kidding ...
JL: That's a very contemporary problem. They can't remember if they're being ironic. The first thing I ever heard about it was that my son and his friends all hated the song, and it was kind of interest to them because they hated it. It was getting negative attention.
JH: Kids are smart, though. It's a completely meaningless song, and they get that.
JL: Oh yeah. I think the emptiness of lyrics like "Today is Friday and tomorrow is Saturday" just had this poker face quality, this almost deadpan quality. Like, "Really? That's your thesis?"
JH: Ha! Yeah. But going back to your new album, are there any songs you're particularly excited about? "Can't Keep Johnny Down" is a great single.
JL: Thanks. You know, it's a very mixed-up record in the best possible sense. There's some possibly misguided ideas that we just pursued to the bitter end. For example, there's one song where the entire band sped up a substantial amount, and the vocal is at regular speed. Some of the people we played it for were like, "Those drums sound a little thin." They didn't get the point of it, so I don't know if that requires an explanation that we did this on purpose.
It's a sound that I like. I always like a narrow canvas. There's so much that has these crazy low ends and super-high high ends. That's one track.
There's another track on the record where there's one song in the left channel and another song in the right channel, and they go together in sort of old-fashioned way. Almost like a showtune or something. That's called "Spoiler Alert."
JH: Talking about extreme high and low ends reminds me of those remastered Rolling Stones albums. And by remastered I mean "completely ruined."
JL: So they basically just compressed the shit out of it, trying to make it sound more contemporary?
JH: Yeah, so it's good that someone's thinking about these things, instead of just turning everything up.
JL: I definitely think there's a default position that is tyrannical. I would say we're just as proud as anybody to go fall in line with "This is what sounds good, so we'll go with that." But when you hear somebody who takes the trouble to look at it a different way and come up with a completely differently approach, it's refreshing. You can't believe how sheeplike the overall culture can be. Everything sounds like everything else. It is a little depressing.
JH: Have you heard anything like that recently?
JL: No, I'm just so out of it all the time. Most of the stuff I like, I'm like, "I've just discovered this great thing," and everybody else already knows about it, inevitably. I heard Das Racist recently. I really like their music.
JH: The other day, I heard a really amazing song and thought it was from a great new band ... turns out it was an old XTC track. Whoops.
JL: Exactly. In some ways it's kind of a pleasure when you think something's new, because you realize it could be new. You could do this now and it would sound really fresh. Flansburgh was talking about hearing this Bob Dylan song, "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" -- I think it's on Blonde -- and he's thinking, "Is this a new Dylan track? This sounds unbelievable." Because he'd never heard the song before. It makes you think you could have something new that sounds as fresh as that.
JH: Yeah, absolutely! So, what are you reading right now?
JL: Well, my wife and I have been on a Russian novel kick, so I'm a little ways into this version of The Brothers Karamazov. It's a weird translation, it's not the current translation that everybody likes now. This is a guy named David McDuff. It's an interesting, wacky version of The Brothers K.
And I just read Nicholson Baker's U & I, which came out twenty years ago. It's about his intense, almost stalker-like obsession with John Updike. He talks about how he wants to be John Updike's friend, even though there's no real basis for a friendship there. It's a very funny book, because it's this intensely confessional-sounding story, where he's admitting to this embarrassing, almost slavish interest in this other writer. It really isn't clear whether this is real or whether he's completely bullshitting.
About
LAUPS (acronym for light autonomous uninterrupted power supply unit) is a new device we are introducing to the world. The technology to capture energy from radio and microwaves (mobile phone and WIFI frequencies) by using standard solenoids and high frequency diodes is now readily available.
Timeline
This successful replication is a hybrid primarily based on typical germanium diode technology in conjunction with solenoids with mu-metal cores. We originally commenced this project with our investments. We are just 1 (one) step away from hitting the final phase in product development. We need to use 3D Printing Services on imaterialize.com to round up our prototype so as to produce another standard prototype 2 before hopes of advancing to a possible mass production in China after we conclude with our prospective investors who have demanded to see a working device alongside any parameters.
Laups Expenditure Summary
This prototype is an alternative to the established solar panel (which converts visible light electromagnetic vibrations). Howbeit, the LAUPS is cheaper and works 24 hours daily making it the new energy frontier for UPS products worldwide. For the great minds who crowd fund this project, you shall receive electronic copies of our device you can produce for your use via a 3D printing service like imaterialize.com as we intend to make It very open to our backers. For those who require a source of electricity whenever they go camping, this will provide power for light loads. A device of this kind requires no external charging for multiple electronic loads and is one tool every 21st century human should possess for emergency electrical uses.
When fully discharged, the LAUPS takes 13hours to recharge completely from typical ambient WIFI and radio sources not more than 20 meters and 100 meters away respectively of combined minimum energy intensities of 50mw per square centimeters.
WIFI, the LAUPS major source of Energy
This self-charging UPS that never requires external charging will support more mobile offices to stay alive in our fast moving world of today.

I'm getting tired of the self-congratulatory notes from potheads. Sure, probably marijuana should be legalized. But how is this issue a major priority? In a world where we have climate change, peak oil, species extinction, geopolitical instability, nuclear proliferation, economic collapse, religious extremism, not to mention the issues of education and health care to concern ourselves with, shouldn't we try to focus on things at that level first -- the really important things? Then stuff like gay marriage and the poor whiny pot smokers.
The first is one of the most basic civil rights enumerated in Constitutional history, and civil rights, in my book, are far more important than the economy. The second is a core freedom - the right to grow a frigging plant in your own backyard. For me, freedom is always primary. It is the core political value. The Dish will continue to cover the economy, climate change (my last column was on the subject), Iraq, Afghanistan, and all sorts of other issues. But the attacks on core freedoms in America are my priority and covering them is my prerogative. And I'm tired of hearing that the basic rights of Americans are unimportant - just because those Americans are gay or, God forbid, smoke a little weed.

WUVA made its flip to “Nash Icon” shortly after 12pm today. Rick Miller, formerly of WKSJ Mobile, WDTW Detroit and WDAF-FM Kansas City will Program and host mornings. Former “Generations 102.3” WZGN Promotions Director/afternoon host Helen Powers will take the same time slot at WUVA. The syndicated Nash Icon programming will fill other local timeslots.
Original Report 9/17: The Charlottesville, VA market is about to lose its only Commercial Urban formatted station as The University of Virginia will flip Urban AC/Classic Hip-Hop “92.7 Kiss-FM” WUVA to Country “92.7 Nash Icon“.
The station is owned by WUVA, Inc., a non-profit organization composed of University of Virginia students and alumni, but operated as a Commercial outlet. While the current format features student personalities, the website for the new format features all of the national “Nash Icon” personalities from Westwood One. The station does have a form for students to join the station.
While WUVA is currently the only Urban formatted station in the market, a new LPFM “101 Jamz” 101.3 WVAI-LP is set to launch in the next few weeks. WUVA will become the third Country station in the Charlottesville market joining Monticello Media's duo of “Hitkicker 99.7” WCYK and Classic Country “94.1 Hank-FM” 1400 WKAV/W231AD that launched last week perhaps due to the pending flip at WUVA.
INSTANT INSIGHT: There's going to be tremendous backlash over this format change as WUVA goes from student programming to syndicated Country (at least in the short-term). However as a stand-alone commercial station up against the two large clusters of Saga and Monticello Media with a niche format, there likely wasn't much revenue coming in to support the station. If plugging in syndication in the short-term while relaunching operations with a format that is more mass-appeal for the market in general, then perhaps this is a long-term solution to keep WUVA in the hands of University of Virginia students for years to come.
Ukip leader Nigel Farage will speak to candidates and followers in Scotland by video link at a general election campaign launch.
The party will launch its Scottish campaign for the forthcoming election at Renfield St Stephens Church Centre in Glasgow on Saturday.
Ukip MEP David Coburn, the party's only elected member in Scotland, and Scottish chairman Arthur Misty Thackeray will join speakers from around the UK.
Blair Smillie, prospective parliamentary candidate for the North Wales constituency of Alyn and Deeside and the great grandson of Labour Party founder member Robert Smillie, will make an appeal to “blue-collar” workers to support Ukip.
Melanie Hurst, prospective candidate for Wansbeck in Northumberland, will talk about women and Ukip.
David Souter, Ukip national head of candidates, will give an overview of the general election campaign and make a new policy announcement.
Explaining Mr Farage's decision to appear by video link, Mr Thackeray said: “Nigel is not really doing any public appearances around the country.
“He is very focused on the campaign for Thanet, as it is obviously very important that we get him elected there, but he will be in Glasgow on screen rather than in person.”

A finally finished project, made by someone who has no idea about 3D modelling, filled with the question "how to accomplish this" and lots of rage-quitting. Although never being close to what my perfectionist self, wanted to deliver, 'twas indeed a learning process, and a gateway to better projects perhaps?
Since I feel like writing about my journey on this I would like to tell my learning process during this project and bear in mind that I only know the stuff about basic modelling but nothing more than that. Main idea behind this was to create something that would look natural and in doing so I had to scrap any ideas that would make her too perfect. While I'm doing texturing the skin, I've started analysing people's skins. Yes, you heard me right. I actually studied in my mind that what makes a human skin different than a normal texture that is literally a painted surface. Why? Just so I could better understand the tools that I am going to use which I had no idea how to use or how to replicate them in a virtual space.
Having the internet on my fingers I decided to search for the material called VraySkinMtl. At first I was delusional enough to expect that when I put this on an object, it would turn out great at the beginning. Spoiler alert, it does not! Apparently for a skin texture, you ought to be teaching your computer to calculate three different layers of the skin just so it would decide to render where the greenish shadowy areas will be. Depending on where light reaches, it shows the colour underneath your skin such as the colour red which happens to be your blood veins. But of course this wasn't enough. ‘twas all about messing with material settings, going back to change the lights and then changing material again and again and again. Because what was on my mind was to shine those pores just to show I can put a detail. But this got interesting because while project was going on, I was doing my research in both real life and internet and guess what. Humans really like to hide their so-called imperfections. So what we do is either put lots of make up on our cheeks or turn the filters/blurs up to eleven. In the end making those pores not visible in most cases. But I wanted that sweet detail and in addition to that, every detail like marks, black spots were preserved.
Another thing was to create specular map. I knew that reflections were important but how would they show themselves? Answer to that was very simple but if you don't know what you're looking for, you're going to waste time with no real progress. Still, ‘tis a trial and error but apparently all I needed was to make sure where pores are won't shine, create an actual bump map (it seems that I was not creating something that has enough detail) and the lights. As in any real life situation, your textures won't shine if light isn't in the right angle so you have to play with them as well. It sounds easy when I say it but making a change and waiting to render it (even if it's a minute) is really nerve breaking, especially when you're just a beginner. I personally prefer to learn by trying it myself so had to press the render button so much I swear to god I can click it with my eyes closed (or could've use the shortcut, but what's learning when all you do is to chose shortcuts!)
For the last part, there comes the hair. While ‘twas the first thing I've start with, it ended up with me re-modelling it seven times the whole time. Although Chloe's hair is gorgeous, it has so many details that you end up trying to fix it by hand. At first I used 3dsmax's Hair and Fur. While it seems to do the job, I could not get it work for some reason. Some parts were clustering together when you wanted it to spread, sometimes there were empty spots which definitely does not look good some parts were lacking some hair. After sixth attempt I've tried little fixes instead of re-doing the whole process but even with my best, I ended up missing some of the core features of her hair. So that's when I switched to Ornatrix, which offered a very easy way which is modelling the hair with planes rather than splines. Also tried to use my original hair splines to groom the hair but for some reason it really messed up with everything but I'm happy how it turned out. In addition to that my VrayHair material has two colours (as Chloe has in LiS) and this plug-in actually makes the whole gradient colour thing follow the strands (which was hair and fur also supposed to do) but more visible, so win-win for me.
There are lots more details I could write, for instance, I never mentioned the part how many times I wanted to quit but I feel it is enough for now and if you read all this I thank you whole heartedly and hope you enjoyed this little project of mine.

Conventional wisdom says that most retractions of papers in scientific journals are triggered by unintentional errors. Not so, according to one of the largest-ever studies of retractions. A survey published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has found that two-thirds of retracted life-sciences papers were stricken from the scientific record because of misconduct such as fraud or suspected fraud — and that journals sometimes soft-pedal the reason.
The survey examined all 2,047 articles in the PubMed database that had been marked as retracted by 3 May this year. But rather than taking journals' retraction notices at face value, as previous analyses have done, the study used secondary sources to pin down the reasons for retraction if the notices were incomplete or vague. These sources included investigations by the US Office of Research Integrity, and evidence reported by the blog Retraction Watch.
The analysis revealed that fraud or suspected fraud was responsible for 43% of the retractions. Other types of misconduct — duplicate publication and plagiarism — accounted for 14% and 10% of retractions, respectively. Only 21% of the papers were retracted because of error (see ‘Bad copy').
Earlier studies had found that the percentage of retractions attributable to error was 1.5–3 times higher. “The secondary sources give a very different picture,” says Arturo Casadevall, a microbiologist at Yeshiva University in New York, and a co-author of the latest study. “Retraction notices are often not accurate.”
Elizabeth Wager, a UK-based medical writer and co-author of a previous study that relied on journal retraction notices, isn't surprised by the finding of hidden misconduct. “We found many notices that seemed deliberately obscure or vague,” she says, speculating that authors and journals may use opaque retraction notices to save face or avoid libel charges.
The latest study shows a ten-fold increase (to about 0.01%) in the proportion of papers retracted owing to fraud since 1975. Previous analyzes have seen a growing trend in retractions in general, but the latest report sheds new light on the extent to which fraud is responsible. It also found a correlation between journal impact factor and the number of fraud-induced retractions, says Ferric Fang, a microbiologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, who led the study.
Influential journals, including Science, Nature, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and Cell, all appear in the top-ten list of publications with retractions because of fraud or suspected fraud (see ‘Top ten retractors'). For some journals, including the two topping the table — The Journal of Biological Chemistry and Anesthesia & Analgesia — the tally was boosted by multiple retractions from the same few individuals, such as anesthesiologist Joachim Boldt, formerly of the Ludwigshafen Clinical Center in Germany. Indeed, Fang and his colleagues found that 38 research groups with five or more retractions accounted for 44% of articles linked to fraud or suspected fraud.
Whether the overall rise in fraud-induced retractions is the result of an increase in misconduct, or simply down to more scrutiny, is an open question, says Fang. It is also unclear whether the high-impact journals have more retractions for fraud because they are checked more closely, or because they are more likely to attract fraudsters. But Fang thinks that the large rewards for publishing in leading journals — which can range from winning grants to receiving tenure — are powerful incentives that could be driving some of the trend. “We need to look at how we have structured the system, so scientists are not given incentives to [commit fraud] quite as strongly,” he says.
The survey found some significant geographical differences. Retracted papers with lead authors based in historical scientific superpowers, such as the United States and Germany, were more likely to be linked to fraud. In emerging scientific powers such as India and China, however, plagiarism and duplication caused more of the retractions. “These trends may reflect differences in incentives, cultural norms and proficiency in English among these countries,” says Fang.
Ivan Oransky, a New York-based journalist and co-founder of Retraction Watch, suggests setting up a ‘transparency index' for journals, to rank them on criteria such as the clarity of their retraction notices. The idea, which he says he would be keen to work on, could provide a much-needed incentive for journals to improve their performance in this area. Data from the current study could also serve as a basis for a retractions database to help scientists avoid wasting time trying to replicate or build on retracted work, he adds.
“I'm not necessarily opposed to the idea, but I have concerns about how such a database could be properly maintained and updated,” says Fang. “Our study is merely a snapshot. Creating an accurate, centralized database that could be used as an ongoing resource would be a considerable undertaking.”

Guitarist Bill Kelliher of Atlanta progressive metallers MASTODON spoke to Kaytie of the Razor 94.7 radio station about the band's latest EP featuring four previously unreleased tracks. "Cold Dark Place" was made available digitally and on CD on September 22 via Reprise Records, followed by the release of a limited-edition ten-inch vinyl picture disc on October 27.
Three of the songs on "Cold Dark Place" — "North Side Star", "Blue Walsh" and "Cold Dark Place" — were recorded during the sessions for MASTODON's 2014 album "Once More 'Round The Sun" and were produced by Nick Raskulinecz. A fourth track, "Toe To Toe", was recorded during the sessions for the band's most recent album, 2017's "Emperor Of Sand", and was produced by Brendan O'Brien.
Regarding how the idea for the "Cold Dark Place" EP came about, Bill said (hear audio below): "When we recorded 'Once More 'Round The Sun', three of the four songs were songs that Brent [Hinds, guitar/vocals] had mostly written. We all kind of arrange everything together as a band, but they were very heavily Brent songs; he wrote the music for 'em and Brann [Dailor, drums] wrote the lyrics, and the rest of us played on it. And I think with 'Once More 'Round The Sun', we had, like, 15, 16 songs, and we're, like… Anything over an hour or… 52 minutes is, like, our cutoff time with records; we don't wanna make records any longer than that. So what we thought was these songs, they kind of sound like they belong together; they don't exactly sound like they'd go on 'Once More 'Round The Sun'. 'Why don't we take those and put them out as an EP later on down the road?' We didn't feel like they were completely finished or mixed or whatever. We wanted to knd of… We didn't wanna rush it. So [we said], 'Let's just wait. And we'll put those out at a later time.' The song 'Toe To Toes' was from the 'Emperor Of Sand' sessions. And I'm glad we didn't put it on that record, 'cause that record's great — it's great the way it is. I mean, it could have maybe been better with that song on it, but it's cool to take that song and add it to the 'Cold Dark Place' EP."
Kelliher described "Toe To Toe" as "a little more straightforward" than the material on "Emperor Of Sand". "It's very catchy; it's a very good song," he said. "I think when we heard it, we were, like… We weren't sure. I was, like, 'I don't know.' I was, like, 'I like it. I think it sounds awesome.' And Brent was, like, 'I don't think it should go on the record.' Honestly, I was, like, 'I think we have enough good songs on the record that that's not gonna make or break it. Maybe we'll take that one off and put it as a single later. Maybe we'll add it to the other songs, remix 'em and put out 'Cold Dark Place'.' And that's what ended up happening."
MASTODON is continuing to tour in support of "Emperor Of Sand", which debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 album chart. The follow-up to 2014's "Once More 'Round The Sun" was recorded at The Quarry Recording Studio in Kennesaw, just outside MASTODON's hometown, with producer Brendan O'Brien (PEARL JAM, NEIL YOUNG, AC/DC, RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE), who first worked with MASTODON on their seminal 2009 album "Crack The Skye".
Protectionist policies proposed by President-elect Donald Trump could result in jobs losses, as companies use more machines instead of humans in order to reduce rising labor costs in the United States, Jefferies forecasts.
"If companies do invest in the U.S. they are going [to] need to make significant productivity gains by trying to lower unit labor costs. Indeed according to a study by Oxford University in 2013, 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of being replaced by robots," wrote Sean Darby, Jefferies' chief global equity strategist.
"Sell humans, buy robots," he added in the note.
Darby says increased "moral suasion" placed on corporations by Trump to produce in the United States at a time when wages are rising, the dollar is strong and land prices are high, could accelerate the trend in automation.

President-elect Donald Trump was not told about unverified reports that Russia has compromising information on him during last week's intelligence briefing, according to a senior intelligence official with knowledge of preparations for the briefing.
A summary of the unverified reports was prepared as background material for the briefing, but not discussed during the meeting, the official said. During Trump's press conference Wednesday morning, the president-elect said he was made aware of the information "outside that meeting."
A 35-page memorandum published by BuzzFeed on Tuesday includes claims that the Russian government has been cultivating, supporting and assisting Trump for five years — even obtaining compromising information in an effort to blackmail him. (BuzzFeed is partially funded by the parent company of NBC News.) The document, which was not prepared by the U.S. government, contains obvious errors. It was originally generated as part of opposition research by anti-Trump Republicans and then shopped by Democrats.

Two U.S. officials told NBC News that materials prepared for Trump in advance of last week's intelligence briefing included damaging allegations from the memorandum — unverified by American intelligence agencies — about his dealings with the Russians.
Officials prepared a two-page summary of the memo for Trump's briefing Friday at Trump Tower in New York. The summary was an "annex," or addendum, included in the "supporting documents" that accompanied the classified briefing report.
While multiple officials say the summary was included in the material prepared for the briefers, the senior official told NBC News that the briefing was oral and no actual documents were left with the Trump team in New York. During the briefing, the president-elect was not briefed on the contents of the summary.
“Intel and law enforcement officials agree that none of the investigations have found any conclusive or direct link between Trump and the Russian government period,” the senior official said.
According to the senior official, the two-page summary about the unsubstantiated material made available to the briefers was to provide context, should they need it, to draw the distinction for Trump between analyzed intelligence and unvetted “disinformation.”
The briefers also had available to them unvetted “disinformation” about the Clinton Foundation, although that was not orally shared with Trump.
The Russian government on Wednesday denied reports that it has compromising information about Trump, dismissing the claims as a "total hoax."
Amid increased interest in the dossier Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected all of the allegations out of hand. Trump later blamed intelligence agencies for allowing the dossier to leak, tweeting: "Are we living in Nazi Germany?"
"The Kremlin does not have compromising information about Trump," Peskov said, according to Russian state-run news agency TASS. "It's a total hoax, absolute fabrication and utter nonsense. The Kremlin does not collect compromising information."
Peskov also called the reports "pulp fiction."
Trump did not respond to the reports directly but sent a tweet appearing to refer to it on Tuesday night.
Early Wednesday, he sent several others that followed Peskov's comments.
Trump has repeatedly cast doubt over findings by American intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the U.S. election with the aim of helping him win.
NBC News reported last week that the gulf between Trump and U.S. intelligence agencies had grown so wide that the two camps couldn't even agree on the scheduled date of a briefing Trump had been due to receive.

Peskov mentioned Trump's initial tweet, and went on to say that some people were “boosting the hysteria and go to any lengths to maintain this state of 'witch hunting.'”
Michael McFaul, who was ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014, told NBC News he was sure Russian officials were "thrilled" to see Americans bickering about the leaked memo. "It doesn't make us look like we are a healthy democracy."
McFaul also said that Trump had contributed to an atmosphere in which "fake news" could flourish because of his past promotion of the unfounded "birther" conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama's birthplace.
In an interview with NBC News before his farewell address Tuesday night in Chicago, Obama said he had not seen the news accounts of Trump's Russian ties but noted that "as a matter of principle and national security, I don't comment on classified information."
Last month, Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats as punishment for Russia's alleged cyberattacks in the run-up to the Nov. 8 election.
The CIA has concluded that the interference was intended to help Trump win, and intelligence officials told NBC News that they believe "with a high level of confidence" that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in the covert campaign.
Trump has been skeptical about the alleged Russian hacks, even as he repeatedly praised Putin.
Constanza Fuentes gets a voluntary flu vaccination from nurse Carla Flores at a subway station in Mexico City, Monday Jan. 27, 2014. Mexican health authorities are worried about a spike in the number of H1N1 flu cases and deaths, in the country that was the epicenter of the 2009 outbreak of the strain. The Health Department says the figures remain well below 2009 levels. (AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo)
There have been 314 confirmed deaths in Mexico from influenza during the first month of 2014, according to the Health Secretariat in the country, and of those, 290 were from what is known as the swine flu, or the AH1N1 strain of the influenza virus. One confirmed flu case was linked to the AH3N2 virus, one from type B influenza and the remaining 22 deaths from other strains of the virus.
Mexico joins the ranks of other countries hit hard by recent flu seasons, like Venezuela, where more than 200 were reported as early as May in 2013.
Thus far, 2,994 influenza cases have been confirmed in the laboratory since January 1, of which 2,544 were of the AH1N1 strain, 144 of the AH3N2 type, 47 of the type B influenza virus and 259 of other strains, the secretariat said. While the numbers may seem high for the first month of the new year, experts indicate the situation is considered normal at this point in time. Though more than 70 deaths were reported during the first week of January, reported cases have declined with each following week.
Though once a cause for alarm, AH1N1 is now considered the seasonal flu as opposed to in 2009 when it was first introduced to Mexico and classified as a pandemic. At that time, more than 70,000 individuals in the Latin American country were affected, and approximately 1,300 people died.
What you need to know about the swine flu
The swine flu hit the world hard in 2009, and since then it has become the most common form of influenza seen in many different countries. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), swine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses. Like human influenza viruses, there are different subtypes and strains of swine influenza viruses, and the main swine influenza viruses circulating in recent years are:
Swine triple reassortant (tr) H1N1 influenza virus.
TrH3N2 virus.
TrH1N2 virus.
The swine flu found in humans, regardless of the strain, is known as a variant virus, which means it is a virus originally found in another species (swine). Prior to the 2009 outbreak, variant flu viruses from swine were uncommon though they did still occur. Despite common assumption, there is no evidence supporting the theory eating raw or undercooked pork–or eating pork at all–can transmit the influenza virus.
That being said, however, the swine flu is transferable from pigs to humans and humans to pigs.
“These infections have been most likely to occur when people are in close proximity to infected pigs, such as in pig barns and livestock exhibits housing pigs at fairs,” states the CDC. “This is thought to happen mainly when an infected pig coughs or sneezes and droplets with influenza virus in them spread through the air. If these droplets land in your nose or mouth, or are inhaled, you can be infected. There also is some evidence that you might get infected by touching something that has virus on it and then touching your own mouth or nose. A third way to possibly get infected is to inhale dust containing influenza virus.”
The Mexican Health Secretariat encourages the public to take preventative measures like good hygiene to prevent the flu and also suggests individuals receive the flu vaccine. Those most at-risk in the Mexican population, according to a report from the Latin American Herald Tribune, are adults between the ages of 35 and 55 who suffer from chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes.
TAMARAC, Florida (CNN) -- "Schlep."
A senior discusses Sen. Barack Obama with organizers of the Great Schelp in Tamarac, Florida, on Sunday.
A Yiddish word meaning to pull, yank or tug, schlep is a good way of describing what it took for Mike Bender to persuade his grandparents to vote for Sen. Barack Obama for president.
Bender's grandparents, Kenny and Selma Furst, 90 and 87 years old, should have been an easy sell to support the Democratic nominee for president.
Like many of the estimated 650,000 Jews living in Florida, the Fursts are lifelong, passionate Democrats and a crucial vote for any Democratic candidate hoping to win the battleground state.
But when Bender -- who is not affiliated with Obama's campaign but supports him -- brought up the idea of voting for Obama over Thanksgiving dinner last year, he was met with an uncharacteristic silence.
"Their reaction was, as they said, 'I'm a little meschugah,' " Bender said, adding that the expression meant "crazy."
For Selma Furst, voting for an African-American for president seemed unthinkable. Watch a "few little known Jewish facts" on Obama »
"I grew up with Jewish people and Italian people, but I never lived in a neighborhood that was black," she said. "Somebody said to me, 'What do you object to about him?' I said, well, truthfully, our colors are different."
Overcoming the prejudices of his grandparents' generation would be difficult, Bender realized. But he was not going to be alone.
Ari Wallach, co-executive director of Jews Vote, a Jewish advocacy group, also said he saw reluctance among some older, traditionally Democratic Jews to support Obama.
American Morning Get the most news in the morning with John Roberts and Kiran Chetry.
Weekdays, 6 a.m. ET see full schedule »
But Wallach said it wasn't just a question of race. He cited a months-long misleading Internet campaign that aimed to convince voters that Obama is a Muslim or that he would reverse the United States' policy of supporting Israel. Obama is Christian and says he backs a strong U.S.-Israel relationship.
"The older demographic particularly were being hit with tons and tons of Obama smear e-mails," Wallach said. "If you really want to talk to them in a way that will bring them over to the Obama side, you want to do it one to one, ideally with people they love. And grandparents love no one more than their grandkids."
And so the Great Schlep was born. The idea was that young, Jewish Democrats would flood Florida and convince their elders that voting for Obama was OK.
To get the word out about the Great Schlep, Wallach and his colleagues turned to comedian Sarah Silverman. Silverman makes the case for Obama in a Web video in which she attempts to show similarities -- some tenuous -- between an African-American man and an older Jewish woman. She raves about the Democratic candidate's brisket and points out that Barack comes from the Hebrew word for "lightning." Watch the Great Schlep »
The video ends with Silverman advising Obama supporters to let their grandparents know that should they fail to vote Democratic in the presidential election in November, maybe they shouldn't expect many more family visits.
The Silverman video quickly became a Web sensation, garnering about 2 million hits in the two weeks since it was posted on thegreatschlep.com, organizers said. Thousands of people pledged to call their relatives in Florida and more than 100 people volunteered to pay their own way to travel to the Sunshine State to campaign for Obama among Jewish voters, Wallach said.
Bender saw the Silverman video on YouTube in Los Angeles, California, where he works as a writer. Despite the humor of Silverman's call to schlep, the video's message resonated with Bender because of the difficulty he faced convincing his own grandparents.
"I thought it was brilliant," Bender said.
He decided to go to Florida and try one more time.
When Bender recently returned to his grandparents' retirement community in Tamarac, Florida, near Fort Lauderdale, he was greeted with several surprises. Months of telephone conversations and his trip had paid off: His grandparents told him shortly after he arrived that they were going to support Obama.
The next surprise was that his schlep had generated interest around their retirement community. A lot of interest. So many other seniors wanted to hear about Obama that the venue for a meeting on the subject had to be changed from the Furst's living room to a ballroom in the community's clubhouse.
An hour before Bender started to make his case about Obama on Sunday, groups of senior citizens were staking out space in the ballroom. Soon there were more than 100 people and no more chairs.
Sporting an Obama T-shirt with Hebrew writing on it, retiree Morty Brill said, "The economy, the war, you think you can trust Republicans to fix them?"
If there were any people in the room with reservations about Barack Obama, they kept those doubts to themselves.
As Bender told the crowd that Obama was not a Muslim and that Obama was a staunch supporter of Israel, he was met with heads nodding in agreement throughout the room.
However, Bender felt the need to drive the point further. If Obama was elected, he said, then Bender would not worry so much about politics and "would have more time to find a nice Jewish girl to marry."
Whether Mike Bender's schlep really changed any minds is anyone's guess, but the applause from the crowd was deafening.

This study investigated the ameliorative effect of black rice anthocyanin (BACN) in senescent mice induced by D-galactose. The male mice were randomly divided into five groups, namely, the normal group, the model group and dosage groups (15, 30 and 60 mg kg(-1) of BACN). The model group and three dosage groups were continuously injected subcutaneously with D-galactose. The results suggested that superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were significantly increased upon black rice anthocyanin treatment, while MDA and the activity of monoamine oxidase (MAO) significantly decreased. The expressions of superoxide dismutase genes (SOD1 and SOD2) in liver were up-regulated in black rice anthocyanin group, while the expression of the MAO-B gene was down-regulated. These findings demonstrated that the ameliorative effect of BACN might be achieved partly by altering endogenous antioxidant enzymatic and aging-related enzymatic activities and regulating SOD1, SOD2 and MAO-B gene expressions.
Is Freedom Just An Illusion? Maybe We Don't Want To Know

The possibility that machines will be able to simulate the human brain is all over the news these days. In the United States, President Obama's Brain Initiative promises $100 million to fund research into "how we think, learn, and remember." In Europe, the Blue Brain Project, headed by Henry Markram, will attempt to recreate the human brain in all of its minute detail so as to engender an artificial mind.
The premise here is that if brains somehow sustain the mind and we deconstruct the brain in detail and we put the information back together in powerful computers, we should be able to recreate consciousness from computer code. Or such is the hope, anyway.
Since the brain integrates external stimuli to give us our experience of reality, would simulated brains be able to recreate reality? And if so, could we be fooled by a simulation, unable to distinguish reality and fantasy?
In his dialogue The Republic, Plato offered the Allegory of the Cave, one of the first meditations on the nature of reality and, more importantly, on how limited our perception of the world is.
The theme has been revisited countless times, for example in the 1999 blockbuster The Matrix. In the 24 centuries separating Plato and Keanu Reeves, we've witnessed the birth of modern science and our growing ability to create mind-bogglingly amazing simulations, virtual allegories that imitate or satirize our world. An obvious question, made famous by Oxford University philosopher Nick Bostrom in 2003, is whether we live in a simulation. And if we do, the next question is, who are the simulators?
In his Allegory, Plato imagined a group of "slaves" chained since birth to a cave. The chained ones could only face forward, toward a wall. Their world was that wall and the images and shadows they could see on it. They were unaware that behind them simulators had made a huge fire and were lifting various objects in front of it. The images and shadows the chained ones saw, their whole reality, were simply projections from these objects. Plato's point was that we are like the chained ones, ignorant of the true nature of reality.
Our senses recreate a small portion of what is out there; only in the pure recesses of the mind, through the power of reason, can we understand the true nature of reality. So, the only perfect circle is the idea of a circle, not the one we draw.
We know that Plato was right, at least in part. Our sensorial perception does give us an incomplete picture of the world, even when amplified by scientific tools such as telescopes and microscopes. Every tool has limits and we can only see as far as it lets us.
I imagine the reader is familiar with the video game The Sims. As the name already says, it is a simulation of reality, where the characters are people doing the things we normally do everyday (well, some activities are pretty weird): go to school, eat, go to the doctor, take care of children and pets, date, etc. Now imagine a hyper-advanced version of the game, where the characters have enough autonomy and ability to self-reflect so as to feel real. Even if, ultimately, the simulators are in control, the characters believe themselves free and independent, responsible for their actions. Clearly, these simulated characters are just a modern version of the chained ones, having the illusion of knowing what their reality is like and, more to the point, having the illusion of personal freedom.
Bostrom suggested something similar, but now we are the chained ones. If simulations continue to grow in sophistication, as they should, we can imagine that, in a not-so-far future, we should be able to create virtual worlds which are practically indistinguishable from the real world, at least as we are able to perceive and measure it. (The simulations would have to grow in detail as we probe deeper into the nature of things, from subatomic particles to the confines of outer space.) We can thus imagine that other intelligent civilizations could be doing the same; or that our descendants are doing it now and we are their game. In this case, we would be nothing but a simulation controlled by the simulators, be they post-human or extraterrestrial.
But here is the thing: if we are truly unable to tell (given that we don't have Keanu Reeves around), does it make a difference if we are a simulation? Does freedom only matter when we are aware that we don't have it?
Note that this is different from having social inequality in the world, with some being freer than others; in the simulation we are all in the same boat, no one freer than any other.
Plato argued that if a chained one had been freed, he would be so terrified that he would quickly run back to the chains and face the wall. He believed, correctly, that only with knowledge can we break the chains and truly ascend to freedom.
We must learn all that we can about the brain, of course. But we must also wonder if there is such a thing as learning too much about how the mind works. Especially if we will have to pay with our freedom.

It's finally the end of August, and training camp is a mere week away. For about a month now, news concerning the Dallas Stars has been slow, as the team is apparently done signing free agents, the sale is moving on slowly behind the scenes and GM Joe works quietly on re-signing James Neal and Matt Niskanen.
But ever since the offseason slowed down for the club, one nagging question has remained: What's going on with Jere Lehtinen?
Today, we (kinda, maybe) have some news. Today, Sportsnet published a story online with the headline "Lehtinen To Retire". The article cited a story from a Finnish publication, which (thanks to Google Translate) reads:
One of the long Finnish Playing career is ending. Jere Lehtinen is seriously considering leaving. Lehtinen, 37, met the Dallas CEO Joe Nieuwendykin last week, but that did not take place, that category should be continued. Lehtinen did not participate in training camp in Dallas. Seriously think about a career in an end, eh? "Yes, you can put it in there. Is it true," Lehtinen said. Summer placements Lehtinen took lightly. Their own words, he spent a difference in the summer. It was a step towards a career in the end.
Obviously, Google Translate is a bit shaky on this one. (I know we have some Finnish-speaking readers out there, this is your time to shine!). But taken for what it's worth, Lehtinen is at least seriously considering retirement at this point, if we are to believe that article.
You'll remember that Mike Heika of the Dallas Morning News reported last week that Jere had met with GM Joe and he had not yet reached a decision, and Joe has no deadline for said decision. However, taking a look at the roster and the fact that the Stars currently have 23 players under contract (with two still unsigned) it appears as if the Stars are fully prepared to move on without Mr. Yellow Skatelaces.
Update: Heika again, after talking with Jere, says he has NOT made a decision yet. [LINK]
Now, this isn't an instance of Nieuwendyk "pushing" Lehtinen out; this is an example of Nieuwendyk takes the steps necessary to be prepared in case Lehtinen decides to retire. More so than with Mike Modano, it appears as if the Stars knew going into the summer that Lehtinen was not going to make a decision until just before training camp.
For many, Jere Lehtinen represented everything that has defined Dallas Stars hockey over the years. While Modano provided the flash and Sergei Zubov was the defensive quarterback, Lehtinen was the perfect combination of defensive prowess and offensive ability. Remember when he was the leading scorer on the Stars for a couple of seasons in a row?
It's going to be sad to see him go. Lehtinen is the last remaining remnant of those glory seasons in 1999 and 2000.
Judging by his comments both last season, this summer and above, it certainly appears as if retirement is what is on his mind.
David R. Woodward Routledge , Nov 23, 2004 - History - 368 pages 0 Reviews The frustrating stalemate on the western front with its unprecedented casualties provoked a furious debate in London between the civil and military authorities over the best way to defeat Germany. The passions aroused continued to the present day. The mercurial and dynamic David Lloyd George stood at the centre of this controversy throughout the war. His intervention in military questions and determination to redirect strategy put him at odds with the leading soldiers and admirals of his day.
Professor Woodward, a student of the Great War for some four decades, explores the at times Byzantine atmosphere at Whitehall by exhaustive archival research in official and private papers. The focus is on Lloyd George and his adversaries such as Lord Kitchener, General Sir William Robertson, and Field Marshall Sir Douglas Haig. The result is a fresh, compelling and detailed account of the interaction between civil and military authorities in total war. Preview this book »

On Thursday, shortly after midnight on the US East Coast, a New Zealand-based rocket company launched an orbital-class rocket from a private launch site for the first time. While relatively small, Rocket Lab's Electron launch vehicle stands at the vanguard of a new class of launchers designed to place increasingly tiny satellites into space. Facing competition from the likes of Virgin Orbit and Vector Space Systems, which are late in the development stage, Rocket Lab is the first small satellite launch company to put a full-size rocket into space.
“We're one of a few companies to ever develop a rocket from scratch and we did it in under four years," said Peter Beck, chief executive and founder of Rocket Lab. "We've worked tirelessly to get to this point. We've developed everything in-house, built the world's first private orbital launch range, and we've done it with a small team."
Although the Electron vehicle made it into space, it "didn't quite reach orbit," according to Beck. Rocket Lab did not release precise details of the launch from Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand but said the vehicle had a "great" first-stage burn, stage separation, second-stage ignition, and fairing separation. Over the coming weeks, Beck said, the company will investigate data from the launch, understand why the vehicle failed to reach orbit, and proceed to the second of three test launches before beginning commercial operations.
The Electron
The Electron rocket is a relatively small vehicle, at 17 meters tall and with a diameter of 1.2 meters. Nine oxygen-kerosene "Rutherford" engines power the vehicle, each with 34,500 pounds of thrust at liftoff. (That is a little less than one-fifth the thrust of each of the nine Merlin 1-D engines that power SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket). When fully functional, the rocket will be able to send up to 150kg to a Sun-synchronous orbit 500km above the Earth.
This is far less than the capacity of orbital rockets operating today, including the Falcon 9, Atlas V, Soyuz, and other commercially available rockets. But in recent years there has been an explosion in demand for the delivery of small satellites weighing anywhere from a few hundred kilograms all the way down to cubesats and a desire to not have to ride-share with larger payloads. Rocket Lab hopes to meet this demand with services costing as little as $5 million per launch.
The new class of low-cost small satellite booster companies plans to launch rapidly, and often, to meet market demand. At full production, Rocket Lab says it will launch more than 50 times a year and is regulated to launch up to 120 times a year. A chief executive of a competitor, Jim Cantrell of Vector Space Systems, recently described the market for smaller launch vehicles as "shooting turkeys in a drum," saying there was incredible demand. In the race to reach the market first with a smaller orbital vehicle, then, Rocket Lab took a big step Thursday.

The DEA has been receiving questions from the public, namely the Hemp Industries Association who sued over the Drug Enforcement Administration's attempt to regulate hemp extracts & derivatives as a Schedule I Drug in the Final Rule – the recent Controlled Substance Code Number (drug code) for marijuana extract made effective January 13, 2017. The DEA has come out and clarified their stance in this memo. You have questions, and Cannabis Life Radio breaks down the answers.
What does and doesn't fall under the drug code? Although the memo says all derivatives of the plant which come from the flowering tops, resin, and leaves of cannabis are considered to be within the Controlled Substances Act's definition of marijuana, the DEA explains that “if a product, such as oil from cannabis seeds, consisted solely of parts of the cannabis plant excluded from the CSA definition of marijuana, such product WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED in the new drug code (7350) or in the drug code for marijuana (7360), even if it contained trace amounts of cannabinoids.”
What is excluded from the CSA definition of marijuana? The memo states the term marijuana “does not include the mature stalks of such plant, fiber produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of such plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such mature stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized seed of such plant which is incapable of germination.”
So CBD oil and other extracts are excluded from the CSA's definition of marijuana, right? Unfortunately this is not true. In the memo, the DEA contradicts the statement with this footnote:
“Nor would such a product (products extracted from the cannabis plant that are excluded from the CSA's definition of marijuana) be included under drug code 7370 (tetrahydrocannabinols). However, as the Ninth Circuit stated in Hemp II, “when Congress excluded from the definition of marijuana ‘mature stalks of such plant, fiber . . . , [and] oil or cake made from the seeds,' it also made an exception to the exception, and included ‘resin extracted from' the excepted parts of the plant in the definition of marijuana, despite the stalks and seed exception.” Id. at 1018. Thus, if an extract of cannabinoids were produced using extracted resin from any part of the cannabis plant (including the parts excluded from the CSA definition of marijuana), such an extract would be included in the CSA definition of marijuana.”
What does this mean? Regardless that an extract uses only parts of the cannabis plant excluded from the CSA's definition of marijuana, it is still included in the CSA's definition of marijuana.
Exemption from the DEA and their clarification
The head of the DEA, Chuck Rosenberg, stated that hemp farmers and hemp that is grown in accordance with the US Farm Bill is safe from the DEA. More specifically, American hemp grown in accordance with the US Farm Bill as well as products derived from it such as hemp CBD oil, hemp CBD isolate, hemp CBD crystals, hemp CBD edibles, hemp CBD water solubles, and any other hemp CBD products protected from DEA.

The Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon by Brad Stone Little, Brown, 372 pp., $28.00
In the mid-1990s, when Amazon emerged as an online bookseller, publishers welcomed the company as a “savior” that could provide an alternative to the stifling market power of that era's dominant chain stores, Barnes & Noble and Borders. Book publishers with exceptional foresight may have understood that they “had to view Amazon as both an empowering retail partner and a dangerous competitor,” as Brad Stone puts it in The Store, his deeply reported, fiercely independent-minded account of Amazon's rise.
Yet at first, Amazon seemed innovative and supportive. The company's founder, Jeff Bezos, a Princeton- educated computer scientist and former Wall Street hedge fund strategist, had married a novelist; he often expressed a passionate devotion to books, particularly science fiction and management guides. In its early days of creative chaos, Amazon seemed to want to use the Internet to expand the potential of readers and publishers alike. Bezos hired writers and editors who supplied critical advice about books and tried to emulate on Amazon's website “the trustworthy atmosphere of a quirky independent bookstore with refined literary tastes,” as Stone puts it.
Among the management books Bezos read devotedly were ones by and about Walmart executives. He became inspired by Walmart's example of delivering low prices to customers and profits to shareholders by wringing every dime possible out of suppliers. By 2004, Amazon had acquired significant market power. It then began to squeeze publishers for more favorable financial terms. If a book publisher did not capitulate to Amazon, it would modify its algorithms to reduce the visibility of the offending publisher's books; within a month, “the publisher's sales usually fell by as much as 40 percent,” Stone reports, and the chastened victim typically returned to the negotiating table.
“Bezos kept pushing for more” and suggested that Amazon should negotiate with small publishers “the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.” This remark—a joke, one of Bezos's lieutenants insisted—yielded a negotiating program that Amazon executives referred to as “the Gazelle Project,” under which the company pressured the most vulnerable publishers for concessions. Amazon's lawyers, presumably nervous that such a direct name might attract an antitrust complaint, insisted that it be recast as the Small Publisher Negotiation Program.
Around this time, Amazon also jettisoned its in-house writers and editors and replaced them with an algorithm, Amabot, that relied on customer data rather than editorial judgment to recommend books. The spread of aggression and automation within Amazon as the company grew larger and larger echoed classics of the science fiction genre to which Bezos was devoted. An anonymous employee bought an ad in a Seattle newspaper to protest the change. “DEAREST AMABOT,” the ad began. “If you only had a heart to absorb our hatred… Thanks for nothing, you jury-rigged rust bucket. The gorgeous messiness of flesh and blood will prevail!”
Will it, though? Over the last decade, Amazon's growing market share and persistent bullying, particularly…

Elmer Police Department Lt. Steven Felice. (Photo: File photo)
ELMER – Police Lt. Steven Felice resigned his position effective Friday in face of a departmental review into a series of "inappropriate posts" the officer made recently on Twitter, according to a joint statement from Salem County Prosecutor John T. Lenahan and Elmer police Chief Patrick Bryan.
Lenahan said the resignation was submitted by letter on Thursday.
Felice declined to comment.
"During the course of the internal affairs investigation, Lieutenant Felice provided me with his resignation and I have honored his request to terminate his employment with the Elmer Police Department," Bryan stated.
Lenahan said the resignation came before an internal administrative review by Bryan could be completed. The Prosecutor's Office would have reviewed the department's finding had the review been completed, he said.
"The resignation of Lieutenant Felice closes the book on this unfortunate matter," Lenahan stated.
The internal review was started over Felice tweeting to U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., a vocal critic of President Trump and his administration. The tweet read: “Your gonna get your a-- beat. Watch your back scumbag. Watch your back at every turn.”
That alleged tweet and others that some people found offensive were circulated on Twitter by various users in apparent screenshots taken of Felice's account.
Felice has deleted his Twitter account.
Felice spent 27 years in law enforcement, including with the Millville Police Department. Elmer hired him in 2007.
Borough Council President Lewis Schneider, who chairs the Public Safety Committee, declined comment.
The Washington, D.C., Capitol Police contacted Bryan and the Prosecutor's Office about the tweet to Moulton. But the congressman did not file a complaint with Capitol Police, Bryan and Moulton said.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Albuquerque neighborhoods atop an underground fuel plume caused by a massive leak on Kirtland Air Force Base can expect to host more monitoring wells in the new year, officials said during a public meeting on the leak Thursday evening.
Swiftly rising water table levels underground have taken 53 of about 150 of the existing wells out of commission, according to the New Mexico Environment Department.
ADVERTISEMENTSkip
“There is a crucial need to install groundwater monitoring wells and sentinel wells to be able to provide continued confidence in the EDB (ethylene dibromide) extent,” said Diane Agnew, a hydrologist with the New Mexico Environment Department.
More than 150 wells have been dug on and around the plume to measure levels of the toxic chemical EDB, which floats atop the groundwater.
The water table was previously rising at two to three feet per year, Agnew said.
It has now risen five feet in the last six months, she said.
If the devices in the wells that test EDB levels are too far underwater, they're no longer effective.
Kate Lynnes, senior advisor on the clean-up for the U.S. Air Force, said there are still enough working wells to monitor the plume for now.
“There's still an adequate network,” Lynnes told the Journal on Friday. “If the water continues to go up at this rate, we're going to need some new ones.”
Lynnes said the work plan for new wells has not been completed, but she estimated that they'll need to put in around 10 more sentinel wells, which sit outside the plume area and are used to determine whether the plume is spreading.
She was unsure of how many monitoring wells would be needed. Those sit atop the plume and measure EDB levels.
Lynnes said drilling of those wells may start at the beginning of 2018.
The majority of Thursday's meeting was spent discussing two recently submitted reports, which largely detail information that was already suspected or known about the leak and resulting plume.
Lynnes detailed the findings of the Risk Assessment report, which analyzed potential adverse health effects of the leak. It found no current or future health concerns on- or off-base for workers and residents of the area.
ADVERTISEMENTSkip
The report examined possible pathways to humans through groundwater, soil and soil vapor. While groundwater is contaminated above legal drinking water limits, there is no way for it to get to humans at this point, Lynnes said.
“We're here to commit to cleaning this plume up. That's why we're here, that's what we're going to do,” Lynnes said. “But we wanted to show that you're safe while we're doing that.”
The other report, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Facility Investigation, is a 4,000-page document containing detailed data taken from the leak.
The reports will be used in eventually identifying final corrective actions for the leak.
Star Trek - The Video Game is on the way, with NAMCO BANDAI and Paramount Pictures tag-teaming on the game, which NAMCO BANDAI will co-publish and distribute in spring 2013, shortly before the May 17 release of J.J. Abrams' Star Trek sequel. Star Trek – The Video Game, which will be set in the Star Trek universe introduced in Star Trek (2009), will be available in the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Windows PC formats.
Designed to provide the ultimate co-op experience, Star Trek – The Video Game will allow players to control both Kirk and Spock, who must work in tandem to stop a familiar and lethal enemy hell-bent on conquering the galaxy. Kirk and Spock grow closer as friends and colleagues in the process, essentially building a bridge between the events of Star Trek (2009) and the sequel. Players will find themselves immersed in an epic adventure along with Kirk and Spock, crisscrossing the universe and its unexplored planets, encountering enemy battleships and utilizing the latest 23rd-century gear and weaponry. BAFTA Award winner Marianne Krawczyk wrote the original script, working closely with Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, co-writers and co-producers of Star Trek (2009) and the in-production sequel.
A pre-alpha-phase version of Star Trek -- The Video Game received widespread acclaim at the 2011 Electronic Entertainment Expo. PlayStation: The Official Magazine and Official Xbox Magazine bestowed "Most Valuable Game" honors upon it, while CNN included it on its "Top 5 Games of E3 2011" list.
"Star Trek continues to be one of the most-beloved entertainment properties around the world," said Carlson Choi, Vice President of Marketing for NAMCO BANDAI Games America, Inc. "NAMCO BANDAI is extremely excited to be teaming up with Paramount Pictures to create the definitive Star Trek interactive experience."

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -- Jesse James is a freak of nature.
Really, there's no other way to describe the 6-foot-7, 272-pound tight end. Coaches and teammates tried their best Saturday to brainstorm other fitting adjectives or ways to encapsulate the junior's ability. But, without fail, they kept returning to that same phrase.
"Jesse is just a freak of nature," fellow Penn State tight end Adam Breneman said. "I don't know how else to describe him."
Added strength coach Dwight Galt: "He's a freak. ... Athletically, talent-wise, there's not another tight end in the country better than him, for sure. He's got speed, he's got strength, he's got agility, he's got size. He's got everything."
The 6-foot-7 Jesse James can bench-press 225 pounds 27 times and he runs the 40-yard dash in about 4.6 seconds. Matthew O'Haren/USA TODAY Sports
James lived up to that billing during Saturday afternoon's annual Lift for Life event, which pit the offense and defense against one another in seven strength competitions while helping raise money to fight kidney cancer. During the 225-pound bench press, the weights exploded off James' chest so quickly it was as if they came from a balloon stand. The tight end's spotter called out "Seven!" before his defensive end opponent reached three.
The reps came so quickly, it was easy to lose count. Once finished, a Penn State trainer turned to James' spotter and asked about the final tally. Upon hearing the answer, he just shook his head and looked confused: "What? ... Twenty-seven?" James' teammates alternated between head-shaking and patting him on the shoulder.
Had James reached that number in any of the last 10 NFL combines, he would've placed within the top five at his position -- and he would've been at the very top in 2008 and 2011. Compared to the most recent combine, his 27 reps were two fewer than first-round offensive tackle Taylor Lewan and one more than first-round defensive tackle Dominique Easley.
"He'll surprise you every day. You never know what's coming with Jesse," Christian Hackenberg said. "It's actually interesting when you get out there with what he does, just how good he is and how fast he is and how strong he is."
It's not easy to overthrow James, who reportedly runs in the 4.6 range and stands as the second-tallest player on the 121-man roster. That might have something to do with his recent addition to the Mackey Award watch list. Of course, the fact he's Penn State's leading returnee with 25 catches and 333 yards doesn't hurt either.
Put simply, yes, the guy's a freak.
"To get a guy that big that does what he does, I haven't seen that," Galt said. "I've been really lucky. I had five tight ends in the NFL at one time, including Vernon Davis and Dan Gronkowski, Rob's brother, and I'll tell you what -- I'll put Jesse James up there with any of them. The kid is really that athletic and that good of a player."
Players spoke in such revered and hyperbolic fashion about James that, at times, it seemed as if they were discussing Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. Tailback Akeel Lynch just laughed when asked about what impressed him most about James and cautioned that it might not sound believable.
While most players dead lift with five or six plates and let out painful groans between each lift, Lynch said, Penn State's tight end takes it a step further. Lynch smiled, bent his knees and pantomimed lifting up and down with ease. "And he puts the max weight you can on a bar," Lynch said. "He's a freak. He's a good guy, but he's a freak."
On Saturday, James performed 12 reps on the dead lift at 495 pounds. And he promised before the event that he planned to take it easy since this was for charity. ("I won't put too much on today, but it'll be fun.") So what exactly is the max weight the junior can dead lift?
"I have no idea," he said matter-of-factly, with a slight shrug. "We haven't found it."
James is one of the last players who would exaggerate his talent. The aw-shucks kid from the small, blue-collar borough of Glassport, Pennsylvania, didn't mind dissecting Hackenberg's improvement or waxing poetic on how the freshman receivers were coming along. But it was as if his white T-shirt grew itchy whenever he was asked about himself.
"I'm not really the person to talk to about that," James said. "That's just how I was raised."
Added offensive guard Miles Dieffenbach: "That's the way he is. Modest guy, really good guy."
Humility might serve him well, but the Nittany Lions need someone to step up in a big to make up for more than 125 receptions of lost production from last season. (Allen Robinson, who caught 97 balls in 2013, is now in the NFL.) James is certainly a candidate to be that player, at least in the end zone, and expectations are soaring for the junior.
It's still to be determined how James' speed and strength will transfer over to the gridiron this season. But at least one thing is for certain.
"He's a freak," Dieffenbach said. "A freak of nature."

Wall Street's power has gone unchallenged for too long!
Starting Saturday June 1st, 2013, Occupy will be holding a homecoming celebration in Zuccotti Park, NYC to occupy the space where our movement began. By day we will celebrate and reconnect with old friends to plan the future of this movement, and by night we will take a militant stand against the NYPD to assert our right to exist in public spaces (nonviolently of course).
If you have questions or need help, please call: +1 (516) 708-4777
Schedule
Saturday, June 1st
9AM: Convergence Begins! Bring your signs, your opinions, your children – bring your willingness to support your fellow human beings and speak truth to power! Bring your books, to rebuild the People's Library… and your willingness to read and share, to compare facts and help identify where things went wrong so we can put things right together!
Noon: Protest In Solidarity with Istanbul Gezi Parki Occupiers. A peaceful international solidarity event, with the goal to direct public attention to Istanbul Gezi Parki protests and consequent police brutality of AKP/Erdoğan government! For more information, see the facebook event.
6PM: People's Assembly! Come be a part of political dissent and talk to others in a non-oppressive, horizontal assembly. We invite performers, musicians, puppeteers and artists to come perform at the assembly. We will be fluid and will respond to the needs of the community in stewarding the assembly. Simply raising your voice in public and saying “Enough!” can be a radically transformative act, and our voice shared together is a mighty thing to behold! For more information on The People's Assembly, visit this facebook event page.
Sleeping on the sidewalk as an act of protest is completely legal.
8PM: Sleep Cell Convergence! Occupy Wall Street changed the conversation by putting our bodies on the line in protest to the corruption we see eroding the very world around us, and while a mass re-occupation effort at Liberty Square will end only with police violence and put us in harm's way in the attempt, smaller groups acting on a temporary basis with greater mobility can succeed far more effectively at spreading our message and challenging the worldview that is tearing us apart.
When the sun sets on Saturday, all who are willing to take hard ground and take a stand will converge together to decide their targets and their tactics autonomously without central direction – a process that can't be predicted and prepared against by the NYPD. No experience necessary – we will be spreading legal training and our experience in what has worked (and what has not worked) in past efforts by mixing NYC sleep-cell activists in each group as-needed, so that locals and visitors, new activists and experienced Sleepful Protestors can work together keeping each other safe and achieving the objective.

9AM: Convergence Begins Again! Each and every day, we will meet in Liberty Plaza to reclaim the public forum and work together to change the world!
2PM: Planning Meeting for Monday, June 3rd Direct Action. We are seeking to re-commit to a weekly direct action in the Financial District, to make our voices echo against the walls of power and overcome them by overcoming the culture that allows them to be in the first place! Join us in determining how together we will stand up to Wall Street and their captured politicians in Washington!
8PM: Sleep Cell Convergence! Liberty Plaza is the home of Occupy Wall Street, but we express our power by direct action, and sleep on the streets as a political action to expose the corrosion that is corrupting our world. Our targets may consistently change, but we can always be found here first as we choose our actions of resistance on a nightly basis!
Monday, June 3rd
9AM: Convergence For Direct Action! While the details of this action are still being planned and will not be finalized before we as a wider whole have come together to agree upon how we are going to work together in resistance on Sunday, we will be meeting at Liberty Plaza at 9AM no matter which target is selected and what the nature of the action is – our resistance effort will be in the heart of the Financial District, and we will meet at Liberty Plaza and march together from there.
8PM: Sleep Cell Convergence! Liberty Plaza is the home of Occupy Wall Street, but we express our power by direct action, and sleep on the streets as a political action to expose the corrosion that is corrupting our world. Our targets may consistently change, but we can always be found here first as we choose our actions of resistance on a nightly basis!

The police acted the very next day. A man was arrested, charged, and is in custody, being held without bond. So this–the alleged shooting of Jordan Russell Davis by Michael David Dunn, is not that–the shooting of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman.
But in so many other aspects of this case, the parallels are undeniable–another 17-year old African-American boy, shot and killed. The alleged assailant, an older white man, said he felt threatened–although the boy he is accused of shooting was reportedly unarmed. Another claim of self-defense to justify the killing, and in a “Stand Your Ground” state. Another pair of grieving parents, losing a child and seeking justice.
And again, that sense–for those of us who know and love them–that this is no country for young black men.
Which is why this week, I am addressing my open letter to whom it may concern.
It's me, Melissa. And if you are like me, this latest news has got you concerned, indeed. Because here we are again. It has been barely a year since the killing of Trayvon Martin resurrected that old angst–long buried, but always there just below the surface. You know that feeling. It's the one that makes us hear about Trayvon, and now Jordan Davis, and reach back across decades into our history, for the name of another boy named Emmett Till.
Then, it was a whistle at a white woman. Now, it's a hooded sweatshirt or music being played loudly from a car.
But always, this one thing has been the same–No presumption of innocence for young black men. No benefit of the doubt. Guilt–not determined by what they did or said–but presumed to be inherent in their very being. They need not wield a weapon to pose a threat. Because, if you are a young, black man, who you are is threat enough. And in yet another case, it seems, that perceived threat is justification enough for someone who would play judge, jury and executioner.
Jordan Russell Davis will be laid to rest today. His father described his son as a typical teenager, who was looking forward to staring his first job, working at McDonald's. He was saving up to buy his first car. The day before he died, his mother says, he gave the Thanksgiving dinner prayer, where he gave thanks for his family.
But before Jordan could be eulogized at his funeral, the defense team for the man who is accused of killing him was already telling a different story about whom this young man was. According to police, Jordan and his three friends were sitting in an SUV at a Jacksonville gas station, when Dunn pulled up next to them and asked them to turn down their music down. Words were exchanged. This is the story Dunn's attorney, Robin Lemonidis, about why her client felt threatened:
“He sees that much of a shotgun coming up over the rim of the SUV…and all he sees are heavily tinted front windows that are up and the back windows that are down, and the car has at least four black men in it, and he doesn't know how old anyone is, and he doesn't know anything, but he knows a shotgun when he sees one because he got his first gun as a gift from his grandparents when he was in third grade.”
Police have found no evidence that Jordan and his friends had any weapon in their car.
But Michael David Dunn, a registered gun owner, did have one. He used his gun to fire eight rounds into the boys' vehicle. Two of those bullets struck and killed Jordan Davis, who was sitting in the backseat. Dunn fled the scene.
These are the facts as we know them today. As the investigation continues, details will no doubt continue to emerge. But as we watch the case unfold, let us be sure, while we are watching, that we continue to see in Jordan Davis what Michael Dunn did not–a human being, instead of a threat.
Sincerely,
Melissa
A 22-car entry featuring LMP1 (LMP900), LMP2, GT1 and GT2 spec machinery will grace the grid for the pilot race in the new Masters Endurance Legends Series at Spa-Francorchamps on September 15-17.
The series, overseen by Europe's Masters Historic Racing, will start a full season in 2018.
The Prototype 1 entry for top class sports prototypes features some extraordinary entries:
Travis Engen will race his 2005 American Le Mans Series Audi R8.
Martin Short's Rollcentre Racing Dallara Judd is also on the list, a car that ran in the 2005 Le Mans Series and Le Mans 24 Hours with Joao Barbosa and Vanina Ickx.
Series Director, Nic Minassian will be sharing a drive with Kriton Lendoudis in a Peugoet 908X from 2011, a factory car run during the 2011 season.
Mathieu Lahaye enters a 2007 Pescarolo 01, prepared by Onroak Automotive.
And the distinctive soundtrack of the Gulf-liveried Lola-Aston Martin will return to the track in the hands of owner Christophe D'Ansembourg, a car which finished 13th at Le Mans in 2009 when Anthony Davidson, Jos Verstappen and Darren Turner shared driving duties.
Swiss driver Michel Frey heads the Prototype 2 entry in his ex TDS Racing Oreca 03, the car that won the Red Bull Ring round of the European Le Mans Series in 2013 when driven by Pierre Thiriet and Mathias Beche. The car was also raced in that year's Le Mans 24 Hours.
A second car that Frey raced in period is also on the grid in the hands of American historic racer Bob Blain, who shares his Oreca with Jonathan Kennard who a few weeks ago made a sensational historic debut at the Silverstone Classic.
Sean Doyle returns to racing action with the Murphy Prototypes Oreca 03 Nissan, the car ran at Le Mans for Karun Chandhok, Warren Hughes and Brendon Hartley, under the banner of the first Irish team in the ELMS.
Historic CanAm racer Peter Schleifer joins the grid in his Pilbeam MP91, a car that American Jeff Bucknum took to Le Mans in 2003, while Mike Furness shares his Courage LC75 with Robin Ward, this car having raced at Le Mans in 2007 as the first Courage built for P2 regulations.
The GT Entry sees another glorious mix.
Romain Rocher will be at the wheel of his Venturi 400 Trophy, a car that raced in the early BPR Global GT Series and came fourth at Jarama, while current ELMS LMP3 racer Morten Dons drives his later Ferrari 575 GTC, which Boris Derichebourg and Christian Pescatori shared in FIA GT races.
Porsche are well represented, with Gilles Petit and Romain Ianetta sharing a 996 RS from the ALMS, Jon Minshaw at the wheel of an ex-Prospeed Richard Westbrook/Alex Davison Porsche 997 GT3 RSR and Paul Daniels in his 997 that came 8th in class in the Spa 24Hrs in 2007.
Morgan enthusiast Adrian van der Kroft drives his ex-Charles Morgan BPR +8 ‘Big Blue', while Karsten Le Blanc's Aston Martin Vantage GT2 takes on Clive Joy's Ferrari 430 GT2 and Steve Zacchia's Ferrari 550, which itself comes from the 2003 season.
Xavier Tancogne brings his Chrysler Viper to the entry with history from FIA GT, Belcar and Euro GT.
Series Director Nic Minassian said: “I am delighted with the entry for this inaugural race at Spa and with the variety and quality of car and drivers that we have. It has been the correct decision to run a race this year after giving teams a long lead-in time and that is proved by the strong line-up we have achieved. We know of more cars and drivers that will be joining us in 2018 and this is a series that will grow and grow. These are great cars from a wonderful era and we are sure that people will be eager to join this latest addition to the world of historic racing.”
The Masters Endurance Legends race will be a 40-minute race on the iconic Spa-Francorchamps and will start a new and exciting chapter for both Masters and historic motor racing. The series will be supported by Technical Director John Gentry, from Spa onwards, to enforce period correctness.

At the Agile on the Beach 2017 conference, run in Cornwall, UK, several hundred speakers and attendees gathered to discuss the latest developments within the field of agile and post-agile software development methodologies. Takeaways included: as the majority of companies work within a complex adaptive system everyone within an organisation must be encouraged to learn and co-evolve; cultivating an environment that promotes psychological safety is vital, and people must feel safe in order to experiment, fail and learn; the use of maps, for example user story mapping, is essential for developing shared understanding throughout an organisation; teams should focus on continuously delivering business value; and we must learn how to effectively adopt and exploit new technologies.
The opening keynote, "Learning Leaders Learn Always", was presented by Diana Larsen, co-founder of FutureWorks Consulting LLC, and focused on the premise that as software development is knowledge work, and knowledge work is learning work, effective learning leads to agility and resilience, which is vital when working within a complex environment. Quoting W. Edwards Deming with "learning is not compulsory, neither is survival", Larsen discussed how the majority of modern business environments are inherently Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous (VUCA) and therefore leaders require courage, compassion and confidence in order to be effective.
Courage can be demonstrated by "learning out loud", and by being willing to be curious and wrong at times. Leaders should attempt to remove obstacles to learning: individually it is not selfish to make time to learn, and people must give themselves "permission to suck" before becoming adept at a new skill. At a team level, psychological safety is vital. Quoting Matt Sakaguchi's recent keynote at QCon New York, Larsen discussed Amy Edmondson's study of the effectiveness of Google's teams, and stated that leaders must cultivate a shared belief that the team is safe in order to allow interpersonal risk taking.
Learning should be iterative, building on what comes before, and this takes confidence. Larsen discussed her Five Rules of Accelerated Learning: keep it alive - this is about the feeling of energy and collaboration; setting first - create an environment that promotes learning; strive for fluency - create simulations that challenge and allow learners to exercise or enhance learning; start obvious and stay obvious; and focus on achieving flow with a good balance between current skill level and the challenge presented. As a closing remark, Larsen recommended the audience strive to continuously learn and give back, with the ultimate goal of encouraging and enabling others to learn effectively.
The first break out session of the day was an interactive workshop on story mapping by Jason Bootle. The workshop began with an introduction to the User Story Mapping technique that was created by Jeff Patton with Peter Economy. Bootle, a freelance product and service designer, stated that "shared documentation does not mean shared understanding" and user story mapping is a collaborative technique to help achieve a consistent vision of the thing being created, a backlog with prioritisation, and a roadmap for future iterations. Pains and opportunities can also be highlighted, allowing user research and design activities to be applied appropriately, and user story mapping also helps in establishing a common language across an organisation.
Shared documentation does not mean shared understanding.
Before a team starts with user story mapping, Bootle suggested that the value proposition be defined, along with core vision and goals, personas or proto-personas, and hypotheses to be validated. For the interactive section of the workshop these key elements were provided up-front, and the attendees formed into small groups to work through several iterations of story mapping. The workshop was fast-paced and contained much opportunity for learning the basics of the technique. The session was concluded with attendees sharing their experiences, and Bootle provided further references for offline exploration.
The afternoon sessions began with "Team Design for Continuous Delivery", presented by John Clapham, a director and consultant at cotelic. Clapham began by proposing that it could appear that the formula for creating great engineering teams is well-known; they must be "cross-functional, T-shaped, pizza-sized and manifesto enabled". However, this is not the reality for many, and the remainder of the talk focused on how to cultivate team traits for effective continuous delivery:
A strong desire to learn and co-evolve An understanding of business imperative, and the autonomy to act on it Safety - to take risk, succeed and fail Ability to manage a high level of interactions Self measurement of achievement
Co-evolution can be witnessed in nature, where animals flourish based on symbiotic relations, and this trait is vital in companies that leverage software to deliver business value, as the ability to learn must be present and evolving throughout all parts of the organisation. Quoting The Lean Enterprise, Clapham suggested "use continuous delivery to reduce the risk of releases, decrease cycle time, and make it economic to work in small batches", and for this to be effective everyone must understand the overall vision and goals that the company is attempting to reach.
In addition to understanding the business imperative, people must be given the autonomy to implement changes. Modern businesses increasingly operate within a complex environment, and Clapham recommended attendees read "Team of Teams", an account of how General Stanley McChrystal -- operating as Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) throughout the US-led counter-insurgency operation in Iraq -- discarded a century of management wisdom and pivoted from a pursuit of mechanical efficiency to organic adaptability.
Clapham also referenced Google's Project Aristotle, an extensive study of employees at Google, which concluded that psychological safety -- the ability to take risks without feeling insecure -- within teams is highly correlated with effectiveness. Other important factors included dependability of team members, structure and clarity of goals and roles, and meaning and impact of work. Clapham also discussed various experiments that utilised sociometric badges to gauge the number, type and quality of interactions. The results frequently demonstrated that a high level of social interactions were correlated with effective results - for example, Bank of America generated a $15 million dollar increase in annual productivity after measuring interactions and modifying break schedules to maximise interaction.
Key takeaways from Clapham's talk included: ask for feedback on your work; be curious and welcome questions; reward (the right) behaviour; ignore your job title, and focus on delivering business value; and think small.
Ilan Kirschenbaum presented "7 Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Teams Do", which was inspired by the popular TED talk "5 Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Kids Do" (and corresponding book). Kirschenbaum's core thesis was that as we now operate in a complex world in which it is most effective to probe-sense-respond; we must encourage teams to experiment, and also make it safe to fail. Kirschenbaum discussed the benefits of encouraging hypothesis creation, experimentation and retrospecting, and cited examples of experiments, such as developers from a command and control-led enterprise meeting the customer face-to-face, developers installing code on live (with appropriate safety), encouraging teams to create a FOSS project, and organising a company-wide hackathon. The final twenty minutes of the session was run as an interactive workshop, where attendees formed into groups and designed experiments they could run within their organisation.
The final keynote of the day was presented by Dan North and James Lewis, and discussed "How to Break the Rules". Quoting Eliyahu Goldratt's work in the seminal book "The Goal", North stated that "technology can bring benefits if, and only if, it diminishes a limitation", and discussed how we are really quite bad a adopting and exploiting new technology. A series of rules were presented on how to effectively adopt a technology:
What is the power of the technology? What limitation does the technology diminish? What rules enabled us to manage this limitation? What new rules will we need?
Discussing technologies such as Material Requirement Planning (MRP) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), North and Lewis suggested that rules for coping with old/existing process and technology often become policy or law, such as planning monthly and buying in big batches, or maximising utilisation and using cost accounting. Accordingly, when adopting new technology in these areas, organisations will need to adapt in order to re-plan frequently and order for shorter timeframes, and use throughput accounting to measure flow of value holistically. Old rules for coping when adopting cloud or continuous delivery, such as the centralised enforcement of governance and compliance, or the need for manual validation often become part of the structure or culture, and accordingly the organisation must learn how to run inexpensive experiments autonomously, and automate all the stages within a continuous delivery build pipeline.
The first day at the Agile on the Beach conference concluded with a Beach Party at Gyllynvase Beach, during which attendees reflected on the day and shared experiences, stories and Cornish sea shanties over a beach BBQ. Additional information on the conference can be found on the Agile on the Beach website, and videos of the presentations will be uploaded on the AotB YouTube channel over the coming weeks.

REUTERS/Dominick Reuter The winter holidays are finally over, and we're kicking off 2014's first uninterrupted week of trading.
In the U.S., we'll get new stats on the labor market, consumer credit, and the massive services sector.
Yes it's cold, and the weather is likely to impact the comparability of some of the December data.
"The coldness contrasted with unusual mildness in December 2012 and December 2011," noted High Frequency Economics' Jim O'Sullivan.
"Extreme cold and a major storm likely hampered construction, as well as activity in the leisure and accommodation industries," said Citi's Peter D'Antonio.

Top Story
Remembering Fiscal Drag: In what might've been his final speech as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke argued that the U.S. economic recovery would've been much more robust had it not been for the fiscal drag. From his speech: "To illustrate the extent of fiscal tightness, at the current point in the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment at all levels of government had increased by nearly 600,000 workers; in contrast, in the current recovery, government employment has declined by more than 700,000 jobs, a net difference of more than 1.3 million jobs. There have been corresponding cuts in government investment, in infrastructure for example, as well as increases in taxes and reductions in transfers. Although long-term fiscal sustainability is a critical objective, excessively tight near-term fiscal policies have likely been counterproductive. Most importantly, with fiscal and monetary policy working in opposite directions, the recovery is weaker than it otherwise would be." The good news is that fiscal drag and budget bickering isn't expected to be as bad this year. From Goldman Sachs' Alec Phillips: "The upshot is that while debate on most of these issues is likely to last beyond the end of 2014, there are at least a few areas, such as trade, where agreement might be reached. Perhaps more importantly, the near-term growth outlook depends less on the legislative agenda than it did a year ago, and while yet another debt limit deadline still leaves some uncertainty, the risk of further disruptions from fiscal debates does appear to be gradually declining."
A group of Berlin thieves pulled off an improbable heist early Monday morning, breaking into a German museum with a ladder and carting away a 100-kilogram gold coin named the "Big Maple Leaf" in a wheelbarrow.
Between 3:20 and 3:45 on Monday morning, thieves entered the Bode Museum through a window and stole the coin, which was originally issued by the Royal Canadian Mint. It has a face value of $1-million but, according to current gold prices, could be worth at least $5-million.
Martin Halweg, a spokesman with the German police, told The Globe and Mail that the suspects are believed to have set up a three-metre-long ladder, which enabled them to enter at the back of the Bode next to a set of railway tracks. They then used a wheelbarrow to remove the valuable, which is one in a series of six certified by Guinness World Records because of its size and 999.99/1000 gold purity.

Pictures taken before the burglary show that the coin, which is three centimetres thick and roughly as wide as a car tire, was displayed inside a glass-enclosed, bulletproof cabinet. Like all Canadian gold coins, it bears the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse side.
The coin has been on display since 2010 and was part of the Munzkabinett collection, Berlin's most important archive of coinage, which includes more than 540,000 objects.
No other thefts have been announced.
A Berlin police communiqué said a museum security staffer alerted police after 4 a.m.
Quoting unnamed police sources, the German newspaper Bild said that the thieves took advantage of construction work at the museum and that the chances of its recovery are slim because the coin could be promptly melted.
Police later had to interrupt service on the S-Bahn rapid-transit system after they discovered the ladder on rail tracks near the Bode, which is at the tip of an island on the Spree River, in the middle of the German capital.
It is not clear how this seemingly old-hat operation eluded the museum's high-tech alarm system.

The police communiqué asked the public to report any occurrence where someone had offered to sell large, unusual volumes of gold.
The big coin exhibited by the Berlin museum was on loan from an owner who had purchased it from the Royal Canadian Mint.
The mint had made six of them in 2007 to promote a new line of high-purity bullion.
A Royal Canadian Mint spokesman said five of the giant coins were sold while the sixth remains in a vault in Ottawa.
When asked what the thieves could do with the coin, police spokesman Winfred Wenzel told the German newspaper Die Welt: "Either they were hired to do it by someone who wanted to have the coin, but it's more likely that it will be melted down."
Excerpted from Wild Fermentation…
Growing up in New York City, experiencing my Jewish heritage largely through food, I developed a taste for sour pickles. Most of what is sold in stores as pickles, and even what home canners pickle, are preserved in vinegar. My idea of a pickle is one fermented in a brine solution. Pickle-making requires close attention. My first attempt at brine pickle-making resulted in soft, unappealing pickles that fell apart, because I abandoned it for a few days, and perhaps because the brine was not salty enough, and because of the heat of the Tennessee summer. And and and. “Our perfection lies in our imperfection.” There are, inevitably, fermentation failures. We are dealing with fickle life forces, after all.
I persevered though, compelled by a craving deep inside of me for the yummy garlic-dill sour pickles of Guss's pickle stall on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and Zabar's on the Upper West Side and Bubbie's in upscale health food stores elsewhere. As it turns out, brine pickles are easy. You just need to give them regular attention in the summer heat, when cucumbers are most abundant.
One quality prized in a good pickle is crunchiness. Fresh tannin-rich grape leaves placed in the crock are effective at keeping pickles crunchy. I recommend using them if you have access to grape vines. I've also seen references in various brine pickle recipes to using sour cherry leaves, oak leaves, and horseradish leaves to keep pickles crunchy.
The biggest variables in pickle-making are brine strength, temperature, and cucumber size. I prefer pickles from small and medium cucumbers; pickles from really big ones can be tough and sometimes hollow in the middle. I don't worry about uniformity of size; I just eat the smaller ones first, figuring the larger ones will take longer to ferment.
The strength of brine varies widely in different traditions and recipe books. Brine strength is most often expressed as weight of salt as a percentage of weight of solution, though sometimes as weight of salt as a percentage of volume of solution. Since in most home kitchens we are generally dealing with volumes rather than weights, the following guideline can help readers gauge brine strength: Added to 1 quart of water, each tablespoon of sea salt (weighing about .6 ounce) adds 1.8% brine. So 2 tablespoons of salt in 1 quart of water yields a 3.6% brine, 3 tablespoons yields 5.4%, and so on. In the metric system, each 15 milliliters of salt (weighing 17 grams) added to 1 liter of water yields 1.8% brine.
Some old-time recipes call for brines with enough salt to float an egg. This translates to about a 10% salt solution. This is enough salt to preserve pickles for quite some time, but they are too salty to consume without a long desalinating soak in fresh water first. Low-salt pickles, around 3.5% brine, are “half-sours” in delicatessen lingo. This recipe is for sour, fairly salty pickles, using around 5.4% brine. Experiment with brine strength. A general rule of thumb to consider in salting your ferments: more salt to slow microorganism action in summer heat; less salt in winter when microbial action slows.

Facebook may have unintentionally leaked users' personal information to third parties, a security firm discovered. The leak may be one of the most significant privacy missteps by the social-networking giant.
Certain Facebook applications are leaking "access tokens" to third parties, such as advertisers, giving them access to personal-profile data such as chat logs and photographs, Symantec's Nishant Dosti wrote on the Symantec Security Response blog on May 10. Most access tokens expire in two hours, but some tokens work offline and remain valid until the user changes the password, Doshi said.
Users are encouraged to change their passwords immediately, according to Symantec. Changing the password invalidates these tokens and is equivalent to "changing the lock," on the Facebook profile, Doshi wrote on the Symantec blog.
Access tokens act like "spare keys" to the user's account, giving recipients the ability to access user profiles and perform certain actions, such as reading and posting Wall posts and accessing friend pages. Offline tokens work even when the user is not logged into Facebook and give applications and anyone else holding them access to the profile data at all times.
"We estimate that as of April 2011, close to 100,000 applications were enabling this leak," Doshi wrote. The Symantec team estimated that since 2007, when Facebook launched applications, "hundreds of thousands of applications" could have leaked "millions" of these tokens.
Facebook IFRAME applications were leaking the tokens to advertisers and analytic platforms, Symantec said. During the application-installation process, users are prompted to grant permissions to certain actions, such as writing to the wall and accessing profile data. Once the user has clicked on "Allow," the application receives an access token, the so-called spare key. If the application is using Facebook's older authentication system and used certain deprecated parameters in the code, then Facebook sends the access token to the application's host. The token appears in the HTTP referrer field, which is often sent onto advertisers and analytics companies.
"The repercussions of this access-token leakage are seen far and wide," wrote Symantec researcher Nishant Doshi in a blog post.
There's no good way to estimate exactly how many access tokens were leaked, but the good news is that it was unlikely most developers even knew they had this access, according to Symantec's Doshi. Symantec informed Facebook of the problem early last month, and the social-networking giant took "corrective action" to "eliminate the issue."
Facebook acknowledged that there had been an issue and that it had been fixed, but that the Symantec post was inaccurate because the information was never shared with unauthorized parties.
The company alluded to the situation when announcing an update to its developer roadmap in a May 11 post on the Facebook developer blog. Facebook has been "working with Symantec to identify issues in our authentication flow to ensure that they are more secure," Natik Shah, a member of the Facebook Platform team, wrote on the blog.
By default, Facebook uses OAUTH 2.0 for its authentication scheme to secure applications, but many applications continue to use an older authentication system and HTTP. "Because of the number of apps using our legacy auth system, we need to be thoughtful about this transition [to OAUTH 2.0]," Shah said.
After working with Symantec, Facebook has decided all developers will have to switch their sites and applications to the more secure system by Sept. 1. The updates to the software-development kit will be available July 1 and all applications must support the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) by Oct. 1 so that those using HTTPS will be able to use applications as well.
"We believe these changes create better and more secure experiences for users of your app," Shah wrote.
Users install 20 million Facebook applications every day, according to Facebook.
ITS activists have dressed as policemen and sex workers in Kiev; as marathon runners and Muslim men in London; and as nuns and maids in Paris. Femen, a Ukrainian women's movement, mostly fights against pornography and prostitution—yet all its protestors demonstrate topless. Why are some feminists going bare-breasted?
Part of the reason is that most legal avenues have already been pursued, with marked success. British women gained the Equal Pay Act in 1970; their French sisters won the right to abortion in 1975; and by 1980 American women could sue for sexual harassment. Yet women's bodies have become objectified on a scale “as never before”, says Kat Banyard, co-founder of UK Feminista, a British feminist movement. The female body is the new battleground, from campaigns against Page 3 girls and “lads' mags”, to the SlutWalk marches, during which women claim their right to undress without insult.

Femen forms part of this fresh wave of feminist protest. Its early demonstrations targeted Ukraine's sex industry and macho culture. Topless protests are intended to ridicule (mostly) male voyeurism. By stripping, Femen says, women expose their vulnerability but also use their naked bodies as weapons. Its grand aim is to give new meaning to the nude female, as a political tool instead of a sex object. “It no longer works to promote yoghurts and cars”, says Inna Shevchenko, the leader of Femen's Paris branch and training centre. When the group first protested in 2008, activists dressed provocatively, but did not show their breasts; when one did on a whim in Kiev, Femen realised the media attention that nudity could garner. Alice Schwarzer, a leading German feminist, thinks that the protests work so long as the message gets more attention than the flesh.
This view is not universally held. Hind Makki, a Muslim feminist blogger, balks at their methods: “It is regressive to make yourself look like a sex toy,” she says. Others predict that media interest in protests by topless feminists will wane. That seems unlikely.

UPDATED 4:20 P.M | The West Seattle Bridge reopened this afternoon, following nearby crashes that were blamed by police on road de-icer.
Three cars spun out on the curve next to the Nucor steel mill, where eastbound traffic turns downhill toward the high bridge, said Steve Pratt, road-maintenance director for the Seattle Department of Transportation.
The crashes happened shortly after a midday application of salt solution de-icer.
“The only thing I can assume is, perhaps the (road) deck is a little too warm,” Pratt said.
Pratt said the city was trying to treat the bridge corridor before tonight's Seahawks game and afternoon rush hour, and SDOT was hearing reports that a cold front would reach the city by 1 p.m.
He was thinking about Nov. 22, 2010, when freezing rain stranded cars on the Alaskan Way Viaduct, and road crews couldn't salt the road decks because the stalled traffic was blocking them. So on Monday, he said he wanted to get a jump on the forecast freeze.
“I'm going to put this in the category of ‘no good deed goes unpunished,' ” he said.
City officials also blamed high car speed for the wrecks. The posted limit is 40 mph near the steel mill and 45 mph on the bridge.
Pratt, who was doing other work in West Seattle at the time, said he drove onto the high bridge from the Delridge Way onramp, trouble free. But when crashes began, the police closed the entire high bridge route, including the Delridge onramp, as an apparent precaution.
SDOT has used salt solution for more than three years and has never had a problem like this.
The de-icer used Monday is called FreezGard, an opaque brown liquid containing magnesium chloride. It takes five to 10 minutes to crystallize on the pavement, said Pratt. Meantime, it goes on slightly slippery, “particularly if vehicles are exceeding the posted speed limit,” said SDOT spokesman Rick Sheridan. Many years ago, the curve at the steel mill wasn't treated at all, so that when vapor from the steel mill condensed, a sheet of ice invariably caused spin-outs on any frosty morning.
Usually, the city applies salt solution overnight. Just before noon Monday, the air was 43 degrees and the road deck 38 degrees, said Pratt.
He said the city will think twice before applying salt solution in the daytime. Another idea that's been discussed is a rolling slowdown, where a vehicle behind the de-icing truck slows the drivers behind it for several minutes.
Crashes occurred between noon and 1 p.m. The bridge reopened to traffic in both directions around 3 p.m., after crews dropped sand to improve traction.
The city has applied liquid salt compound since December 2009, following the city's slow ice response in December 2008 when SDOT under then-mayor Greg Nickels avoided salt, and some streets took days to thaw.
In a Portland, Ore., courtroom, the witness identified as "Jack Doe No. 4" testifies uneasily about being an 11-year-old Boy Scout alone with his troop leader in 1983.
"He grabbed my hand, and he slid it up his leg into his shorts," the witness said.
The troop leader, Timur Dykes, had already admitted to a Scout official that he had molested 17 boys. Still parents were not notified and Dykes continued to work with the Scouts. In a deposition he confessed to abusing Jack Doe No. 4.
Dykes are asked what he did that could be considered molestation.
"I handled his genitals," Dykes said.
But the former troop leader isn't on trial, reports CBS News correspondent John Blackstone. The case is against the Boy Scouts, who kept confidential files on Dykes and on thousands of molesters, intended to keep them out of scouting but keep the incidents quiet.
"They wanted to just get the guy to go away," said Patrick Boyle, an investigative journalist. "And let's hope he doesn't show up again. So that means very frequently, nobody told the police."
Now the secrecy is being lifted in an Oregon courtroom.
"The Perversion Files," as the Scouts called them, have rarely been seen publicly -- but now, 20,000 pages have been admitted as evidence in the trial.
"It's shocking to read case after case of sex abuse of men preying on boys," Boyle said. "What's also shocking - you realize how much the Scouts knew."
In a written statement, the Boy Scouts of America says it can't comment on the case in Oregon but says the files are used to track those "not eligible for … membership" and are just one way to "ensure a safe and healthy experience for … Scouts."
However Jack Doe No. 4 says because neither parents nor police were notified the perversion files did nothing to protect him. The abuse haunts him to this day.
"I can't sleep," he said. "Sometimes I go days without sleeping."
He's suing the Boy Scouts for $14 million, saying they should have used the perversion files not to protect the organization -- but to protect the boys.
The Pac-12 blog's official stance on the Rose Bowl: It's awesome. Has been since 1902. If you've ever been to one, you are nodding.
If you are not nodding, you are either ignorant of the Rose Bowl experience or are untroubled by being wrong. And I mean that in the nicest possible way.
Our position on this is unambiguous. When the BCS power brokers meet in Hollywood, Fla., this week with the intention of transforming the college football postseason, the Rose Bowl must be given special status. Why? If you were to request a list from the sports' cognoscenti on the greatest traditions in college football, most would rate the Rose Bowl No. 1.
Some ACC, Big 12 and SEC fans might be shrugging. Their conferences don't play in the Rose Bowl, other than in a couple of BCS-mandated exceptional cases. Why should they care?
Well, I don't live in Egypt, but I care about the pyramids. We're talking about history, folks, about tradition, about maintaining a connection to the past. If our postseason endgame somehow ends the Rose Bowl, it would be like knocking down the Washington Monument because we feel like we can build a bigger and better pointy thing in our nation's capital.
We know that one of the four options that will be discussed -- as first reported by USA Today -- is the "Four Teams Plus" plan. It would make the Rose Bowl an automatic part of a "playoff" that would determine the national champion.
The four highest-ranked teams at the end of the regular season would meet in semifinals unless the Big Ten or Pac-12 champion, or both, were among the top four. Those leagues' teams still would meet in the Rose, and the next highest-ranked team or teams would slide into the semis. The national championship finalists would be selected after those three games.
This plan has been widely ridiculed, and for good reason. It's ridiculous. It continues to add subjectivity to the process instead of having more decided on the field of play. That's what we are trying to get rid of.
As I've said before, it doesn't seem that complicated to have a four-team playoff set, then let the Rose Bowl choose next, likely the best available teams from the Pac-12 and Big Ten.
Why should the Rose Bowl get priority? Because it's the Rose Bowl.
Should there be flexibility to the Big Ten-Pac-12 matchup? Perhaps. It's already happened without great loss of life (though there has been a bit of wincing, particularly one year in Berkeley). It might be unavoidable. The game itself, however, is the most sacred relic.
The hope here is this won't end up being only a Jim Delany and Larry Scott crusade. The Big Ten and Pac-12 commissioners obviously have the most at stake among all the pooh-bahs in Florida, but there's no reason for SEC don Mike Slive et al to go all Sun Tzu on the Rose Bowl just to score an Art of War point.
It would be great if Slive et al would take the high-grounded position and recognize the Rose Bowl's special status in college football.
There will be a lot of smart folks in Florida. Let's hope they are smart enough not to drive a carelessly placed wingtip into the game they are charged with protecting.
It was the end of the fourth round. That's when you knew you were bearing witness to something truly spectacular. Both men, now having spent twenty minutes brutalizing each other with every limb, refusing to give a single inch. Of course, it would all end minutes later, and Robbie Lawler would mark the first successful defense of his welterweight title against Rory MacDonald by forcing the young Canadian to quit in the fifth and final round.
But we didn't know that then, and neither did they. They were too busy maintaining some level of consciousness and struggling to breath out of shattered noses and Chelsea Smiles. In that moment, there was no one else in the world except these two men, staring into one another's soul through blood shot eyes.
No one will ever know MacDonald to the degree Lawler does. The same goes for Lawler. Over the course of those nearly 23 minutes of suffering, each won a small piece of the other's heart and soul. No heartfelt conversation with your father, no late-night liaison with a former lover, nothing can compare to the level of intimacy Lawler and MacDonald experienced that night.
That's a weird thing to conceptualize, that you only truly know a person after they spend nearly a half hour trying to incapacitate you physically. It's something that, for the vast majority of human beings on earth, we will never experience.
That's why their clash at UFC 189 was the clear-cut winner for Last Word on Sports' Fight of the Year. There was no other option. Out of the literally hundreds of rounds, the back and forth wars, the title fights, there was only one fight in 2015 that elevated the sport of mixed martial arts from spectacle to existential experience.
We watch sports and look up to athletes because they do what we cannot. Whether through sheer physical talent, or the insane amount of hours they spend perfecting their craft, we can't do what they do. So we live vicariously through our favorites, cheering them on through adversity and celebrating their victories as they come.
Fighting is different. We've all been in a scuffle at some point in our lives, but compared to sports like basketball and football, we never experience the level of sheer human violence that two trained fighters are capable of delivering to one another. To that end, the UFC has done a tremendous job at allowing fans unprecedented access to its athletes.
The moment between the fourth and fifth round of their title fight, the opportunity that fighters have to sit down and attempt to catch their breath and receive advice from their trainers, was instead used to further assert their dominance. Not through words, nor physical action, but instead in a look.
Lawler sprays blood from his mouth as he spits to the canvas before meeting eyes with MacDonald, who, barely standing at this point, doesn't hesitate or divert his glare for a second. They were in that moment. Something that lasted less than five seconds, yet will stand the test of time as one of the defining moments of modern MMA. Courage, will, tenacity, violence, strength, bravery; any number of words could be used to describe their fight, but none manage to encompass the sheer power of that moment.
Had referee John McCarthy not separated them, it's possible the fight would have just carried over into the fifth round, with neither fighter complaining about the lack of a round-break. They wanted to end each other, by any means necessary.
That we were there to witness it in some capacity is something truly special, and not likely to be replicated soon.

Hold this thought: ‘There are big lies, damn big lies and big data science'.
Statistics is a science. Some argue that it is the oldest of sciences. It can be traced back in history to the days of Augustus Caesar, and before.
In 1998, Lynn Billard, in a paper that laid out the role of the Statistician and Statistics, wrote that “no science began until man mastered the concepts and arts of counting, measuring, and weighting”.[1]
I first became aware of the role of the statistician when I was studying a combination of philosophy, politics and economics. Later, my first two managers were also enthusiastic and pedagogic members of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS), a society whose aim is “advancing the science and application of statistics, and promoting use and awareness for public benefit”.
The RSS do a good job of raising awareness about statistics and statisticians. But maybe they aren't getting enough people's attention.
After all, many people seem to think that statistical methods and quantitative analysis were born somewhere around 2001. Which, and sorry for raining on anyone's parade, is not in fact the case.
To me a statistician is like a true artist.
Let me explain what I mean by that.
Picasso was perhaps the greatest painter of the 20th century.
He is down on record as saying that “It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child”. But that's not the same as a child painting, with little or no technique, skill or experience.
Picasso projected the visions of a child, through the hands of a genius. Picasso could paint like Raphael, but also as “a child”. He could paint like anyone. Many would argue that he was a true artist.
Which isn't the same as splodging some abstract and random colourful shapes on canvas. That doesn't automatically make someone an artist. Not in any modern formal sense. Although, that said, in the age of Postmodern Nonsense[2], anything can be anything. Which however still does not make it a fact.
Those people who watched the American television medical drama House might also make this connection.
In this series, Hugh Laurie played the part of Dr Gregory House.
In entertainment terms, Laurie convinced viewers that he was a credible physician. Only thing is, he wasn't a physician. He was an actor pretending to be a physician, and he did a great job. He learned his lines well, and he knew how to interpret them to perfection. But as an actor, not as a doctor.
So why do we think Big Data is more than just a new name for a collection of old ideas, and why do we think that data science is forward looking and statistics is just dealing with the past? Why do we lend more credibility to rebranding than to historical fact?
More to the point why do people clamour to self-define themselves as data scientists rather than as the more recognizable, measurable and manageable role of statistician? A modern statistician who can both interpret the past and try to correctly forecast the future?
I am well aware that there has been a proclivity to hire enthusiastic amateurs or certificate-harvesters in place of trained, experienced and qualified professionals – especially if ‘the price is right' – overtrained, experienced and qualified professionals. But it is a proclivity firmly planted in the absurd, incoherent and irrational. As absurd as the dialectic notion that two-a-halfpenny qualifications are more important than knowledge and experience.
So, call me old fashioned. But when I need a haircut I will go to a hairdresser or a barber, and not to a hair artiste or a mop-follicle scientist.
When I need a person who really knows how to do a wide range of statistics, I will hire a professional and experienced Statistician.
It's not exactly rocket surgery.
A good statistician will understand that “not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts”. A quote which is variously attributed to either Albert Einstein or William Bruce Cameron.
So, getting down to fundamentals. Why would a Statistician prefer to call themselves Data Scientists, and why are some Data Scientists oblivious to or misinformed about the nature of contemporary Statistics and Statisticians?
I think the biggest problem is in the way that the IT industry relentlessly flogs new fads. It's new lamps for old, but no matter how much obfuscation and marketing is churned into the mixture, it's still a massive dose of flimflam and hyperbole.
The other ‘big' problem is in how so many people are willing to jump on the flimflam trend wagon in order to wing their way into a ‘data scientist' niche. Or rebrand themselves as data scientists as a reaction to the IT industry's crude ‘downgrading' of the role of statistician – quite often backed by a long concatenation of meaningless clichés, logical fallacies, inaccuracies and blatant misrepresentation.
Using the past to predict or shape the future is nothing new. So why do people pretend that it is new?
Finally, I think it's clear where this is leading. My prediction for 2016 is that Big Data will not kill the Statistician?
My prediction for 2026 is that the ‘data scientists' of the day will be criticising the next Big Data-like fad and especially its evangelists. Hopefully they will be able to make it clear that this is about something with a very long and rich history.
That said, I think the predicament and the ‘challenge' we face with much of the industry hype and the unquestioning zeal of many big data and data science ‘evangelists' can be summed up by two absolutely fabulous quotes from Ben Goldacre in Bad science: “These corporations run our culture, and they riddle it with bullshit”, and “You cannot reason people out of a position that they did not reason themselves into”.
Thanks for reading.

University of Dayton graduate Marjorie Corcoran was an acclaimed physicist and a professor at Rice University in Houston, Texas.
Corcoran died in a bicycle-train accident around 8:30 a.m. the morning of Feb. 3. She was struck while crossing the tracks by a Metro light rail train in Houston.
Corcoran graduated in 1972 from UD with a Bachelor of Science with honors; she then went on to receive her Ph.D. from Indiana University. Her career led her to work in the particle physics community with a focus in CP violation.
Her obituary included this line as a teaching moment, “She would want everyone to know that conservation of momentum works, and when a train and bicycle collide, the train always wins.”

During her life, Corcoran was a role model to young women physicists, so much so that just last month she co-organized a conference for undergraduate women in physics sponsored by the American Physical Society. She made it a point to teach undergraduate classes so she could influence their career choices.

She also worked with high school physics teachers during summers to show them exciting elements of physics to take back to the classroom and engage their students, according to her obituary. Corcoran believed that all children are born scientists, but by making math a science lesson plans less than exciting, educators fail in nurturing their natural talent.
Corcoran was a faculty member for 35 years at Rice University in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. During her employment she held many roles such as, the first Speaker of the Rice Faculty Senate and chair of the Physics and Astronomy Department.

Say what you want about the NFL, but they certainly know how to generate pageviews.
News recently broke that the league is investigating whether or not the New England Patriots used deflated balls in their 45-7 victory over the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship Game. At one point in the third quarter, the referees stopped play, inspected a football, and replaced it with another. Early Monday morning, local Indianapolis beat writer Bob Kravitz broke the story that the Patriots might have tampered with the footballs, and while it would in no way affect the outcome of the game, should the allegations prove true, there will be some form of repercussions.
I didn't think much about it when I went to bed last night, figuring that it was just some hack trying to get his name out there and generate some controversy. But when I woke up this morning and discovered that the investigation is in fact going to happen, I could only react in one way:
This is brilliant. Absolutely, certifiably BRILLIANT. The NFL strikes again.
There's absolutely no denying that the vast, the vast majority of football fans hate the Patriots. And I only use the word "hate" here because there simply isn't a word in the English language that describes just how despised this franchise is outside of New England. There just isn't any way to accurately portray how deeply our beloved Patriots are loathed by pretty much everybody. I'd even go so far to say that, for some fans, hating the Patriots is even more enjoyable than rooting for whatever sadsack group of misfits they have hitched their wagon to. And while said haters are always quick to point to SpyGate or Belichick's demeanor or Tom Brady's fashion sense as the main reason behind their fury, the fact of the matter is that there is one reason - and one reason only - why the Patriots are so universally disliked, and that reason is because they are good. They consistently win games. They have been dominant for 15 straight years now, occupy a large amount of media time, and are difficult to avoid if you consider yourself an NFL fan. Yeah, their coach is standoffish and their quarterback is a prettyboy who takes his fashion very seriously, but the only reason anybody cares about that is because the Patriots win games. If New England didn't win, nobody would care, and there isn't any disputing that. They aren't unique in that, every team that wins a lot is hated, but it's especially relevant in a league specifically designed to prevent this kind of run. And so, because of that the Patriots are hated far more than most.
However, the major problem with the "you win a lot, so I hate you" narrative is one that makes it more or less impossible for fans to come away from that situation without coming across as butthurt and whiny. There is also no real logical reasoning behind it other than petty jealousy and consistently being on the receiving end of a New England-generated beatdown. Thus, when something like SpyGate comes around - an actual, tangible, legitimate reason to not only hate the Patriots, but irrationally justify why they have been so successful for so long - people cling to it like a life raft in a monsoon and will never, at any point, let go. I get it, and I don't blame them; in fact, I encourage it. Hating other teams is fun, and I would never want to deprive somebody of that smug, self-righteous feeling that you get when you have successfully trolled somebody else or gotten under an opposing fan's skin. I will take issue with those out there who truly and genuinely believe that SpyGate is the sole reason for the Patriots' string of success, but those people are few and far between and also wear tinfoil hats as they try to disprove the moon landing. For the most part, I tell Pats haters to take SpyGate and run with it. Bringing that up constantly has to be a lot of fun.
The problem with that, though, is that should the Patriots win Super Bowl XLIX, one of anti-Patriots Nation's favorite lines - the Patriots haven't won a Super Bowl since SpyGate - suddenly goes away. That beautiful, glorious nugget of hate is no longer applicable. The Patriots will be able to silence a lot of haters should they find a way to win against the Seattle Seahawks, and that, I'm sure, has a lot of people fired up about this matchup.
Enter DeflateGate.
I'm trying to make sense of all of this and how this is even a thing, but I just can't. If both teams submit their game balls to the refs hours before the game, the balls are all inspected and then marked, and are then kept with an official member of the staff as the game goes on, I just can't figure out when or how the Patriots would be able to deflate footballs during the course of the game. I don't know, maybe they did, or maybe there is something I'm missing here. But to be honest, at this point, what the NFL discovers is completely irrelevant; the storyline has been created and is fully and deeply embedded in the psyche of every single Patriots hater on the planet.
Take a step back and look at this whole thing for a second; can you think of a single scenario in which anyone just lets this go? If the NFL comes back and says that everything was completely legit, there was absolutely nothing wrong with any of the footballs, and the matter is officially closed, will that really mark the end of people associating this upcoming Super Bowl with DeflateGate? Of course not; this is going to be a nonstop running storyline for the next two weeks, and probably longer, regardless of the outcome. I mean just think about the term "deflated balls;" I can think of at least 40 jokes off the top of my head that can build off that phrase and I'm not even trying. Why would any Patriots hater in his or her right mind pay a lick of attention to what the actual ruling is? Why wouldn't you take that and run it into the ground? How happy must this investigation make you if you hate the Patriots? It just opens up so many more avenues for jackassery that were previously closed. Whether you decide to go full-on DeflateGate Truther (The Colts win that game with regulation balls. Think about all the drops! Think about Vinatieri's kick! Think about Luck's inaccuracy! None of those things happen if the Patriots didn't cheat like the classless bunch of jerks that they are), Thinly-Veiled Objective Observer (I mean obviously the Patriots being a bunch of cheaters ultimately didn't affect the outcome of this game, but to sit here and say that it had zero impact on how things shook out is simply ignorant. A deflated football has a bigger impact than you'd think), or the What Do You Expect Dismisser (just another classless move from the most despicable franchise in all of professional sports), you're going to absolutely love every second of it and make no apologies about it. Deflated balls are now forever attached to this Super Bowl (man is that phrase a comedic goldmine) regardless of how any of this plays out, and so any of you hoping that the NFL will simply dismiss all of it and allow us all to get back to breaking down the game itself should realize that that just isn't going to happen. The trolls have been fed, and they are lapping up every greasy drop of it.
And to all that, I say Thank You. Thank you so very, very much.
I personally love it when stuff like this happens. The Patriots are just so deep inside of everybody's heads that they completely consume their every waking thought. The notion of the New England Patriots even existing on this planet is enough to send a fair number of people into a rage. I don't hate anything as much as some people hate the Patriots, and hopefully I never will. That's serious power and control right there. That's more evidence of just how good this team is than any stat or win/loss record could ever be. That the Patriots have been so good for so long that their haters will go to great lengths just to make sure that the rest of the strangers on social media they will never meet know that they think that the Patriots are cheaters... it's just so damn wonderful I want to start dancing right here in my living room. My favorite team is in your favorite team's kitchen and they are eating all of your food. Then they are going to put on your robe and take a nap in your bed while you take to the internet to express your rage over what a disgrace they are to make yourself feel better.
So more Tweets, I say! More Facebook posts! More comments! More articles! More trolling! More Cheatriots! More Belicheat! MORE! MORE!
And while you guys do all that, we'll be busy preparing for the Super Bowl.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday that a Democratic television ad showing minority children in Virginia being chased down the road by a man in a pickup truck with a Confederate flag and bumper sticker for a Republican candidate is “political racism.”
“Frankly, the only people I see stoking political racism right now are the people and the groups that are running ads like the one you saw take place in Virginia earlier this week,” Sanders said during Tuesday's briefing. “That's the type of thing that I think really is a problem.”
A liberal group called the Latino Victory Fund, which is supporting Democratic nominee Ralph Northam in the Virginia gubernatorial race, released the "American nightmare" ad this week targeting Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie.
The pickup truck in the ad displays a “Gillespie for governor” bumper sticker and a "Don't tread on me" license plate as children attempt to outrun the driver. It's in reference to the violence in Charlottesville this summer, where a white supremacist driver plowed into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one.
DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN AD IMPLIES GILLESPIE SUPPORTERS ARE CONFEDERATES WHO ATTACK MINORITY KIDS
Sanders brought up the ad amid questions about White House chief of staff's comments on Fox News' "The Ingraham Angle" on Monday that “the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War."
NBC reporter Hallie Jackson asked Sanders if the White House is willing to acknowledge Kelly's comments were “deeply offensive to some folks.”
Sanders responded by slamming the media for pushing the narrative that they are a “racially charged and divided White House.”
“Because you don't like history doesn't mean that you mean you can erase it and pretend that it didn't happen,” Sanders said. “And I think that's the point that Gen. Kelly was trying to make it. And to try to create something and push a narrative that simply doesn't exist is just frankly outrageous and absurd.”

A top Toyota executive has provided insight into what we can expect from the updated Scion FR-S that's expected to land as a 2017 model.
Speaking with Australian website Motoring, Toyota chief engineer Tetsuya Tada revealed that the update will cover every single part of the car. For starters, the coupe will be given a minor facelift that will bring a new front bumper with a revised air dam as well as new-look lights on both ends. Certain markets — including Japan — will be able to order a carbon fiber roof panel at an extra cost, though whether the option will be offered in the United States isn't known at this point.
The current FR-S' 2.0-liter flat-four engine will benefit from a slight increase in power that will be complemented by brake and suspension modifications. However, Tada again downplayed the possibility of introducing a turbocharged FR-S.
“I think turbo is a really easy solution. I always say that we try to show something new, always something challenging,” explained the engineer. He pointed out that fitting the coupe with the Subaru WRX's turbocharged flat-four wouldn't be good for fuel economy and CO2 emissions.
There is a catch: While a conventional, exhaust-driven turbocharger has been ruled out for packaging reasons, Tada is open to the idea of fitting the FR-S with an electric turbocharger. Sister company Subaru has recently hinted it's also looking at fitting its STI-tuned models with an electric turbo.
The updated Scion FR-S will land in showrooms in time for the 2017 model year, meaning it will likely be introduced at a major auto show either later this year or early next year. It will be slightly more expensive than the outgoing model, a move that will make room for the production version of the S-FR concept that was previewed at this year's Tokyo Motor Show.
What's next?
Tada explained that the development of the FR-S is an on-going process. The facelifted model detailed above is currently undergoing shakedown testing, and his team has already started working on a brand-new version of the coupe that's expected to hit the market in about three years.
Progressives have been gunning for Dr. Ben Carson ever since his speech at the National Prayer breakfast last month. For failing to extoll the virtues of The One, Carson was branded a race traitor. The vicious epithets continued after he dared to speak at CPAC. MSNBC's Touré declared that Carson was the GOP's token “black friend” and suggested that the pediatric neurosurgeon owed his success to the government.
So, who better to weigh in on the GOP's race problem than Touré? The stupidity was strong during his appearance on Martin Bashir's show today, but it was compounded exponentially by a graphic of an albino elephant and the phrase, “Blinded by the white.” Really, MSNBC?
As proof of the GOP's diversity troubles, MSNBC in its report cited BuzzFeed's recent exposé decrying the overwhelming whiteness of the Republican leadership. And, as Legal Insurrection points out, BuzzFeed knows what overwhelming whiteness looks like.

Fortunately, MSNBC suffers from no such “blindness,” and new prime time host and white man Chris Hayes, who is set to replace white man Ed Schultz in the networks coveted 8 p.m. slot, is making sure of it. The Columbia Journalism Review notes that Hayes will bring his “hard quotas” to prime time with him, enforcing his general rule that “if there are four people sitting at a table, only two of them can be white men.”
And none of them will be Dr. Carson, we'd wager.
Media magnate Rupert Murdoch is the founder and head of News Corporation, a global media conglomerate. He created Fox Broadcasting Company in 1986.
Who Is Rupert Murdoch? Rupert Murdoch was born on March 11, 1931, in Melbourne, Australia. His father was a famous war correspondent and newspaper publisher. Murdoch inherited his father's papers, the Sunday Mail and the News, and continued to purchase other media outlets over the years. In the 1970s, he started buying American newspapers. Murdoch branched out into entertainment with the purchase of 20th Century Fox Film Corp. in 1985, and later sparked transformation of the cable TV landscape by introducing Fox News. Four years after restructuring his empire into two divisions, 21st Century Fox Inc. and News Corp., Murdoch in 2017 sold much of 21st Century Fox to the Walt Disney Company.

Early Life and Career Keith Rupert Murdoch was born on March 11, 1931, on a small farm about 30 miles south of Melbourne, Australia. Since birth, Murdoch has gone by his middle name, Rupert, the name of his maternal grandfather. His father, Keith Murdoch, was a well-known Australian journalist who owned a number of local and regional newspapers: the Herald in Melbourne, the Courier-Mail in Brisbane and the News and Sunday Mail.

Visit Website The family farm was named Cruden Farm, after the Scottish village from which both of Murdoch's parents had emigrated. The house at Cruden Farm was a stone building with colonial pillars, adorned with original paintings, a grand piano and a library of books, situated amongst green expanses of farmland and bordered by Ghost Gum trees. Murdoch's favorite childhood pastime was horseback riding. His mother later described her son's childhood: "I think it was a very normal childhood, not in any way elaborate or an overindulged one. I suppose he was lucky to be brought up in attractive—you could say aesthetic—surroundings." The son of a well-respected journalist, Murdoch was groomed to enter the world of publishing from a very young age. He remembers, "I was brought up in a publishing home, a newspaper man's home, and was excited by that, I suppose. I saw that life at close range, and after the age of 10 or 12 never really considered any other." Murdoch graduated from Geelong Grammar, a prestigious Australian boarding school, in 1949 before crossing the ocean to attend Worcester College at Oxford University in England. According to one of his early biographers, Murdoch was a "a normal, red-blooded college student who had many friends, chased girls, went on the usual drinking binges, engaged in slapdash horseplay, tried at sports and never had enough money, no doubt due to his gambling." Murdoch's fun-loving youthful ways came to an abrupt end when his father suddenly passed away in 1952, leaving his son the owner of his Adelaide newspapers, the News and the Sunday Mail. After preparing himself with a brief apprenticeship under Lord Beaverbrook at the Daily Express in London, in 1953, a 22-year-old Murdoch returned to Australia to take up the reins of his father's papers.
Newspaper Mogul Immediately upon assuming control of the Sunday Mail and the News, Murdoch immersed himself in all aspects of the papers' daily operations. He wrote headlines, redesigned page layouts and labored in the typesetting and printing rooms. He quickly converted the News into a chronicle of crime, sex and scandal, and while these changes were controversial, the paper's circulation soared. Only three years later, in 1956, Murdoch expanded his operations by purchasing the Perth-based Sunday Times, and revamped it in the sensationalist style of the News. Then, in 1960, Murdoch broke into the lucrative Sydney market by purchasing the struggling Mirror and slowly transforming it into Sydney's best-selling afternoon paper. Encouraged by his success and harboring ambitions of political influence, in 1965 Murdoch founded Australia's first national daily paper, the Australian, which helped to rebuild Murdoch's image as a respectable news publisher. In the fall of 1968, 37 years old and owner of an Australian news empire valued at $50 million, Murdoch moved to London and purchased the enormously popular Sunday tabloid The News of the World. One year later, he purchased another struggling daily tabloid, the Sun, and again oversaw a successful transformation with his formula of reporting heavily on sex, sports and crime. The Sun also attracted readers by including pictures of topless women in its infamous "Page 3" feature. Murdoch next expanded his news empire to the United States, with the 1973 acquisition of a Texas-based tabloid, the San Antonio News. As he had done in Australia and England, Murdoch quickly set out to expand across the country, founding a national tabloid, the Star, in 1974 and purchasing the New York Post in 1976. In 1979, Murdoch founded News Corporation, commonly referred to as News Corp., as a holding company for his various media properties. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Murdoch acquired news outlets around the globe at a dizzying pace. In the United States, he bought up the Chicago Sun-Times, the Village Voice and New York magazine. In England, he acquired the eminently respectable Times and Sunday Times of London. Emergence of Fox It was also during these years that Murdoch began expanding his media empire into television and entertainment. In 1985, he purchased 20th Century Fox Film Corporation as well as several independent television stations and consolidated these companies into Fox, Inc.—which has since become a major American television network. In 1990, he founded Star TV, a Hong Kong-based television broadcasting company. Additionally, after purchasing several prestigious American and British academic and literary publishing companies throughout the late 1980s, he consolidated them into HarperCollins in 1990. Murdoch has also invested in sports; he is a part owner of the Los Angeles Kings NHL franchise, the Los Angeles Lakers NBA franchise and the Staples Center, as well as Fox Sports 1 and the Fox Sports website.
Media Empire With the dawn of the new century, Murdoch continued to expand News Corp's holdings to control more and more of the media people view on a daily basis. In 2005, he purchased Intermix Media, the owner of the popular social networking site MySpace.com. Two years later, in 2007, the longtime newspaper mogul made headlines himself with the purchase of Dow Jones, the owner of the Wall Street Journal. Murdoch has drawn wide criticism for monopolizing control over international media outlets as well as for his conservative political views, which are often reflected in the reporting of Murdoch-controlled outlets such as Fox News. In the 2010 American midterm elections, News Corp donated $1 million each to the Republican Governors Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a group supporting Republican candidates. Critics argued that the owner of major news sources covering the election should not contribute directly to the political campaigns involved. Murdoch's empire, however, was dealt a significant blow in 2011. His London tabloid, The News of the World, was caught up in a phone hacking scandal. Several editors and journalists were brought up on charges for illegally accessing the voicemails of some of Britain's leading figures. Rupert himself was called to testify that same year, and he shut down The News of the World. News Corp later paid damages to some of the individuals who were hacked. Despite this scandal, News Corp retains a significant share of virtually all forms of media across the globe. Murdoch owns many of the books and newspapers people read, the television shows and films they watch, the radio stations they listen to, the websites they visit, and the blogs and social networks they create. In 2013, he announced a significant restructuring of his empire. Murdoch decided to divide his business into two companies—21st Century Fox Inc. and News Corp. This move separated his entertainment holdings from his publishing interests. According to the Los Angeles Times, Murdoch explained that "Both companies will be uniquely positioned to execute on their respective strategic objectives and to lead their industries forward." Although he never could have imagined the power he would one day wield, this kind of influence was exactly what Murdoch sought as a young publisher building his empire. "I sensed the excitement and the power," he recalls. "Not raw power, but the ability to influence at least the agenda of what was going on." And after six decades working in the media, Murdoch has said that he could not imagine his life any other way. "If you're in the media, particularly newspapers, you are in the thick of all the interesting things that are going on in a community, and I can't imagine any other life that one would want to dedicate oneself to," he said. New Leadership and Sale to Disney In June 2015, news broke that Murdoch would be handing over the leadership of 21st Century Fox to his son James. Murdoch would remain with the organization as executive co-chairman, sharing the role with his oldest son, Lachlan. In July 2016, Roger Ailes, chairman and CEO of Fox News and the Fox Television Stations Group, resigned due to a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Fox television host Gretchen Carlson. Murdoch announced he would assume Ailes's role temporarily. Amid the restructuring of 21st Century Fox, the company engaged in talks with Walt Disney over the sale of its properties. While discussions were said to have ended by November 2017, they reportedly renewed within a few weeks, with Fox considering offers for its movie and cable networks and international divisions. In mid-December, terms of an agreement were reached in which Disney would purchase most of 21st Century Fox in an all-stock transaction valued at around $52.4 billion. Murdoch, who retained control of Fox News, the Fox broadcast network and the FS1 sports cable channel, said he would spin those assets into a newly listed company. In February 2018, a Wired cover story revealed details of an ongoing feud between Murdoch and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The feud reportedly dated back to at least 2007, with accusations that Murdoch's News Corp. had tried to ignite a scandal involving the presence of sexual predators on Facebook. Later, in a 2016 meeting, Murdoch took Zuckerberg to task for changing Facebook's news feed algorithm, giving the social platform the power to dramatically affect traffic for other sites. News Corp. reportedly threatened to retaliate via lobbying efforts and by launching an anti-Facebook campaign through its many outlets. While still awaiting approval of his massive deal with Disney, Murdoch sought to increase 21st Century Fox's stake in the U.K.-based Sky News. However, that transaction faced a roadblock from politicians and regulators over concerns about 21st Century Fox's monopoly on the British news market, despite the company's insistence that Sky News would retain editorial independence.
While working unpaid for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Paul Manafort mused about how he could use his new prominence to get financially “whole,” and offered to give private political briefings to a Russian billionaire who had recently sued him.
That's according to Manafort's own emails with a business associate, which are currently being examined by investigators and are described in a new report from the Washington Post's Tom Hamburger, Rosalind Helderman, Carol Leonnig, Adam Entous.
Furthermore, at least one email appears to use some sort of code, with Manafort's associate apparently referring to the Russian billionaire — Oleg Deripaska — as the person “who gave you the biggest black caviar jar several years ago,” saying they should discuss his situation more in person.
Manafort's spokesperson says the briefing never ended up happening. But at a time when Manafort is under a great deal of legal scrutiny in the investigation into potential collusion with Russia, the revelations raise further questions about just how he was using his position.
It was reported earlier this week that Manafort was wiretapped by the federal government at some points in 2016 and 2017, and that special counsel Robert Mueller's team has told him to expect an indictment.
The emails in question
There are three key emails described in the Post story. They are:
1) An April email sent in the opening days of Manafort's work for Trump in which Manafort ‘referred to his positive press and growing reputation and asked, “How do we use to get whole?”'
2) A July 7, 2016, email in which Manafort told his Ukrainian business associate Konstantin Kilimnik to let Deripaska know that he could give him private briefings on the presidential campaign. “If he needs private briefings we can accommodate,” Manafort wrote, according to the Post.
3) A July 29, 2016 email in which Kilimnik appeared to speak in code to Manafort about a meeting he'd just had with Deripaska. Kilimnik said he'd met with the person “who gave you the biggest black caviar jar several years ago.” He also wrote that it would take time to explain this “long caviar story.” He and Manafort then set up a meeting in New York, which took place a few days later.
Manafort was working on the Trump campaign during all of these email exchanges (and indeed, he used his official campaign email account for them, according to Politico's Josh Dawsey). He was fired from the campaign in mid-August.
What's going on here?
It's long seemed strange that when Paul Manafort worked on Donald Trump's presidential campaign, he agreed to do so unpaid — despite being in millions of dollars' worth of debt.
The backstory here relates to Manafort's finances and long business relationship with Deripaska, the billionaire in question.
Deripaska is a Russian oligarch and aluminum magnate who Manafort has known since at least 2004 and done a good deal of consulting work for over the years. The Wall Street Journal's Brett Forrest recently chronicled what's known of their relationship, and according to his account, Deripaska helped set Manafort up for what turned out to be years of lucrative work for pro-Russian political parties in Ukraine.
Crucially, though, the two had a falling out — in 2014, Deripaska sued Manafort in a Cayman Islands court and claimed he had cheated him of millions of dollars.
So by the time Manafort was on the Trump campaign, he seems to have been trying to figure out how to repair his relationship with Deripaska. That's how the offer of “private briefings” came in.
The question is what happened next. The coded language Kilimnik apparently used to refer to Deripaska — he referred the person “who gave you the biggest black caviar jar several years ago” — suggests there is a “story” there that Manafort and Kilimnik later discussed in person.
And special counsel Mueller's investigators are likely very interested in just what that story is, as they try to put Manafort in more and more legal jeopardy in an apparent attempt to get him to turn on his onetime allies.

A senior U.S. military official Monday credited President Obama for having a prominent role in pushing and shaping the plan to get Osama bin Laden. “In the final weeks and really months of this, his personal interest and direction and attention pushed the case to a new level that enabled real action,” the official told reporters. “And I think that role is quite important.”
On Tuesday, White House officials began to offer more details on exactly how Obama had shaped the final assault plan. In particular, the President, they said, urged the Pentagon to revisit the number of helicopters it planned to bring into Pakistani airspace on the mission. One of those extra helicopters later played a role in the mission.
The president made his concerns known in a briefing about 10 days before the assault on the bin Laden compound. According to senior aides, Obama felt that the special operations COA, or course of action, was too risky. Under the COA at that time, only two helicopters would enter Pakistani airspace, leaving little backup if something went wrong. “I don't want you to plan for an option that doesn't allow you to fight your way out,” the President told operational planners at the meeting, according to the notes of one participant.
So the plan was revised. Ultimately, four helicopters flew into Pakistani airspace, including two refueling helicopters that carried additional personnel. In the end, the extra forces didn't need to fight their way out of the compound, but a backup helicopter did play a key role in the operation. One of the two primary assault helicopters, an HH-60 Pave Hawk lost its lift, landed hard and had to be destroyed. The backup landed to lift its passengers to safety. “The President created the ‘fight your way out' option,” explained an administration official.

I represent Eritrea, a country known otherwise as an open prison; the North Korea of Africa - Luwam Estifanos
The 25-year-old now lives in Norway, where she lobbies the international community to highlight the conditions in her home country.
Here is her dramatic story, as told at the One Young World summit in Dublin last week:
“I represent a humble but nevertheless oppressed and enslaved people; I represent a nation, whose current human rights record is beyond poor. I represent Eritrea, a country known otherwise, as an open prison; referred to as the North Korea of Africa by Human Rights Watch.
In an era where human rights is highly valued and guarded, Eritreans suffer severe human rights abuses in all forms.
The youth are forcefully conscripted to an indefinite military service, where their labour is exploited and they survive with just $10 a month. Worse, women conscripts are subject to sexual assault, by higher ranks in the military.
Underage conscription to the open ended military service, is a standard practice; random roundups and arbitrary arrests of civilians, is a routine occurrence. Freedom of press is non-existent and mere uttering of displeasure against the regime can land you in prison. Conscripts are prohibited from exercising their faith. Possessing holy books, can lead to severe punishments. As a result, the youth are fleeing the country en masse.
This is also my story.
I was conscripted in the military at the age of 16. Four years later I fled through a dangerous route from my country, surviving the shoot to kill policy at the border.
My father was an anonymous writer for the opposition and the Government was starting to find out who he was and he was not safe. He went to a conference in Norway in 2008 and applied for asylum. My mother and youngster sister were following him over in 2010 when my mother paid a smuggler $4,000 to get me out too.
It was scary. I knew it was a matter of life and death but I was confident as we paid so much money the route would be smooth. It wasn't.
We were shot at as we crossed the border and had to hide under a tree until it was over. Then we started off on foot at 7pm and walked across the desert until 6am. I was so dehydrated I thought I would die. I was scared.
There were bodies and skeletons around us. I wanted to go back but he said we couldn't. We'd be shot.
When I got to Sudan I was even more scared because of human trafficking. Women were being tortured and raped. I stayed there with a cousin one year and seven months, too scared to go outside. Norway had refused my application.
Then I went to Uganda and stayed with a friend. It was beautiful. It was the first time I felt safe.
In 2012 I was finally accepted in Norway as a refugee and I lobby the world to know about the modern day slavery that is going on in Eritrea and bring the sad reality of Eritrea and Eritreans to light.
In July this year, my colleagues and I initiated a campaign against the National Slavery in Eritrea. I gave my testimonies at the UN headquarters in Geneva, in the process up to the establishment of a Commission of inquiry. Its job is to investigate the human rights violations in Eritrea. This is only the second time after North Korea; it has been established on a country not engaged in civil war.
I do this, for the young Eritrean man, who is languishing in jail. He could have been Meb, the Eritrean American athlete, who recently won the Boston Marathon; inspiring thousands. Or the young Eritrean woman, serving in the military and being sexually harassed. She could have been Mieraf, winner of the 2014 European championships in Zurich, who escaped to Sweden through treacherous routes. Or the young girl, who got shot at the border, trying to escape. She could have been me.
The One Young World in Dublin was amazing. Everybody has a story to and everybody is doing something positive in their community."

At Florida rally president refers to attack in Sweden that did not happen, possibly confusing it with Sehwan in Pakistan
Donald Trump appeared to invent a terrorist attack in Sweden during a campaign-style rally in Florida on Saturday, inviting questions that he may have confused the Scandinavian country with a city in Pakistan.
With thousands of supporters gathered in an aircraft hangar in Melbourne, Florida, Trump used his speech to talk about migration in Europe and linked it to terror attacks in Brussels, Nice and Paris. He then added Sweden to the list, incorrectly stating that an attack had happened there on Friday.
Trump told supporters: “We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden.”
“Sweden, who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what's happening in Brussels. You look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris.”
Kellyanne Conway blames refugees for 'Bowling Green massacre' that never happened Read more
There were questions about whether Trump had confused Sweden with Sehwan in Pakistan, where more than 85 people were killed in a suicide bombing at the Sufi shrine on Thursday.
Some Swedes were baffled by the comments. One of Sweden's official Twitter accounts, controlled by a different citizen each week, currently a school librarian, said:
@sweden / Emma (@sweden) No. Nothing has happened here in Sweden. There has not ben any terrorist attacks here. At all. The main news right now is about Melfest. ->
Sweden's foreign ministry spokeswoman, Catarina Axelsson, said the government wasn't aware of any “terror-linked major incidents”.
She told the Associated Press that the Swedish embassy in Washington contacted the State Department on Sunday to request clarification of Trump's remarks and was waiting for an answer.
The former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted: “Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound.”
The source of Trump's remark is unclear, but it came after Fox News aired an interview with film-maker Ami Horowitz, whose latest documentary examines whether high crime rates in areas of Sweden is linked to its previous open-door policy on people fleeing war and persecution.
According to the 2016 Swedish Crime Survey, crime rates in Sweden have stayed relatively stable over the last decade, with some fluctuations. In 2015, there were 112 cases of lethal violence in Sweden, an increase of 25 cases compared with 2014, but assaults, threats, sexual offences, car theft, burglary and harassment all reduced compared to the previous year – as did anxiety about crime in society.
Trump's comments come after Kellyanne Conway, one of his senior advisers, was ridiculed for blaming two Iraqi refugees for a massacre that never happened.
At the start of February Conway cited the fictitious “Bowling Green massacre” in an interview backing the travel ban imposed on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries.
Two Iraqi men living in Bowling Green, Kentucky, were arrested in 2011 over a failed attempt to send money and weapons to al-Qaida in Iraq. They are currently serving life sentences for federal terrorism offences, but there was no massacre, nor were they accused of planning one.
On 29 January, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, referred three times to an attack in Atlanta – where a string of bombings were carried out in 1996 and 1997.
Later, in an email to ABC News, he wrote that he “clearly meant Orlando”.
Forty-nine people were killed and more injured in the attack at Pulse, a gay nightclub in the Floridian city in June. It was carried out by Omar Mateen, a US citizen born in New York to Afghan parents. Afghanistan is not on the list of countries under Trump's travel ban.
Trump has repeatedly accused what he described as the “dishonest media” of producing “fake news”. He repeated the attack on Saturday stating: “When the media lies to people I will never ever let them get away with it.”
He added: “We are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live and what to believe,” he said. “We are free, independent people and we will make our own choices.”
After Trump's remarks in Florida, the Swedish news outlet Aftonbladet posted a story about crime that really had occurred in Sweden on Friday. Non-fake news it ran included: “Due to harsh weather in northern parts of Sweden the road E10 was closed between Katterjakk and Riksgransen” and “a man died in hospital, after an accident in the workplace earlier that day”.
It added: “OK let's not be fake news, this story took place in the autumn, but was reported Friday before lunchtime and we thought you would like it. A wooden moose got the attention of a lovesick moose bull.”

Another Twitter user posted a picture of famous Swedish export Abba, writing: “Four extremists responsible for #swedenincident are still at large, if you see these people phone @realDonaldTrump at once.”
Ridley Scott To Direct New Version Of Seminal Sci-Fi Film ‘Blade Runner'
LOS ANGELES, CA, AUGUST 18, 2011—Three-time Oscar-nominated director Ridley Scott is set to helm a follow up to his own ground-breaking 1982 science fiction classic “Blade Runner” for Warner Bros-based financing and production company Alcon Entertainment (“The Blind Side,” “The Book of Eli”).
Alcon co-founders and co-Chief Executive Officers Broderick Johnson and Andrew Kosove will produce with Bud Yorkin and Cynthia Sikes Yorkin, along with Ridley Scott. Frank Giustra and Tim Gamble, CEO's of Thunderbird Films, will serve as executive producers.
The filmmakers have not yet revealed whether the theatrical project will be a prequel or sequel to the renowned original.
Alcon and Yorkin recently announced that they are partnering to produce “Blade Runner” theatrical sequels and prequels, in addition to all television and interactive productions.
The original film, which has been singled out as the greatest science-fiction film of all time by a majority of genre publications, was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.” The film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1993 and is frequently taught in university courses. In 2007, it was named the 2nd most visually influential film of all time by the Visual Effects Society.
State Kosove and Johnson: “It would be a gross understatement to say that we are elated Ridley Scott will shepherd this iconic story into a new, exciting direction. We are huge fans of Ridley's and of the original ‘Blade Runner.' This is once in a lifetime project for us.”
Scott is represented by David Wirtschafter at WME and David Nochinson at Ziffren Brittenham.
Released by Warner Bros. almost 30 years ago, “Blade Runner” was adapted by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples from Philip K. Dick's groundbreaking novel “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” and directed by Scott following his landmark “Alien.” The film was nominated for two Academy Awards (Best Visual Effects, and Best Art Direction). Following the filming of “Blade Runner,” the first of Philip K. Dick's works to be adapted into a film, many others of Dick's works were likewise adapted, including “Total Recall,” “A Scanner Darkly,” “Minority Report,” “Paycheck,” and the recent “The Adjustment Bureau,” among others.
“After the first glass of absinthe you see things as you wish they were. After the second you see them as they are not. Finally you see things as they really are, and that is the most horrible thing in the world. I mean disassociated. Take a top hat. You think you see it as it really is. But you don't because you associate it with other things and ideas.If you had never heard of one before, and suddenly saw it alone, you'd be frightened, or you'd laugh. That is the effect absinthe has, and that is why it drives men mad. Three nights I sat up all night drinking absinthe, and thinking that I was singularly clear-headed and sane. The waiter came in and began watering the sawdust.The most wonderful flowers, tulips, lilies and roses, sprang up, and made a garden in the cafe. “Don't you see them?” I said to him. “Mais non, monsieur, il n'y a rien.”

Kobe Bryant may not have played in his last All-Star Game in Los Angeles after all.
Not if AEG president and CEO Tim Leiweke has anything to say about it.
Leiweke and AEG just finished up throwing this year's NBA All-Star Game and are otherwise engaged with the task of bringing the NFL back to Los Angeles, but they're already thinking about bidding to host the NBA All-Star Weekend again as soon as 2013.
"I think we're going to go right back after it," Leiweke said Thursday night, after accepting the Executive of the Year award at the L.A. Sports Awards. "We'll work with the Lakers and the Clippers to see if either of them want to host it.
"Neither one of them have hosted an All-Star Game in a long time. If either of them want to do it, we'd certainly be partners with them and that would add a twist to the bid. But I think the league, the players, the team owners, everyone had such a great time, and for the city to have a $100 million economic impact like we did here, it would certainly be great to get them right back here."
Orlando is set to host the 2012 All-Star Game, but Leiweke said AEG would focus on a 2013 bid and then go from there.

DETROIT - Lyft said Friday that it is setting up its own unit to develop autonomous vehicle technology, but its approach will be different from other companies and partnerships working on self-driving cars.
The San Francisco-based ride-hailing service says it will open its network, inviting automakers and tech companies to use it to haul passengers and gather data. It may even share computer software and sensor technology.
Raj Kapoor, the company's chief strategy officer, says Lyft is pursuing the open strategy as a way to lead and bring the environmental and safety benefits of autonomous vehicles to market faster. Lyft brings network expertise to the table, he said. "We believe this is inevitable where the world is going. We need to be playing this role," he said.
Despite ride-sharing apps, traditional carpooling still popular
Like other tech companies and automakers, Lyft has established partnerships with companies like Google's Waymo autonomous vehicle operation and with General Motors. It does not want to produce cars, but wants to make a standardized system for use on its network.
Just how it would make money off the system is yet to be determined, but it likely would take a cut of passenger fares from everyone who uses its network or shares its system. For example, General Motors, which has invested $500 million in Lyft, would be invited to run its own autonomous vehicles on Lyft's network. Data gathered by GM and vehicles from other companies would be used to help build high-definition maps that are needed for the vehicles to navigate streets across the world. The data also would be used to develop computers that would make decisions to run the autonomous vehicles.
Lyft is calling its unit "Level Five," the industry term for fully-autonomous vehicles. It expects to have 200 employees working on the vehicles in Palo Alto, California, by the end of the year.
The company, which carries passengers in 350 cities worldwide, says even when autonomous vehicles are in operation, it will still have humans in the driver's seat. In many places, detailed maps won't be available to guide the autonomous vehicles, so humans will still be needed.
If there is one convenient media
put-down for the “Occupy Movement” it is that it has no coherent
set of demands, no apparent leader and no clear organization.
For
Canadian commentators, including government representatives like
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, the additional complacent comment is
(paraphrasing): “the movement may make sense in the United States
where disparities are so apparent, but we are not an unfair society.
The complaints of the 99% against the 1% do not apply to us.”
So much of what is now known under the
general heading of “occupy” -- with its local manifestations
of #occupywallstreet, #occupylondon, #occupybaystreet, #occupyottawa,
and so on -- put me in mind of a powerful speech I heard in the fall
of 2001. It was mere weeks after the attacks on the World Trade
Centre, Pentagon and hijacking of civilian aircraft. I had been
invited to present to a conference in Michigan of the Environmental
Grantmakers. It is an influential group of US Foundations, and the
invitation was unusual in that the grantmakers do not like to have
poor supplicants (such as Sierra Club of Canada) right at the
banquet. Clear rules were set out that I could not ask for support
at the gathering, but, still, I was asked to talk about Canada-US
issues.
Traveling there was all made worthwhile
through the rare privilege of hearing the keynote speaker. Bill
Moyers was seared raw with the emotion of 9-11 and the response of
the Bush administration. His speech began with extolling the fact
that the heroes of 9-11 were all in the public service; that despite
the decades of exultation of the private sector over government
service (the great mantras of the Reagan-Thatcher legacy) in crisis,
it was the public health service, the firefighters and the police who
risked their lives and were now lauded.
He reviewed in meticulous detail how in
response to the attacks on the twin towers George Bush's government
had expanded perqs for the wealthy. Taxes on the super rich were
reduced to spur on the economy so badly rattled by the attacks (as if
any evidence existed that such an approach helped anyone but the
super rich to become super richer). Americans were urged to go out
and buy cars, that much I had seen on the TV news. But I had not
realized that, as Bill Moyers put it, “the deductions for the three
martini lunches are back.” If Naomi Klein had already written
Shock Doctrine at that point I would have been thinking. “Ah
yes, this is how they do it.”
Moyers' crescendo of anger (which I
am I recalling from memory) cascaded with, “These guys know that
sacrifice is for suckers; the class war was waged over the last
decade and they declared themselves the winners long ago.”
Since then, the gluttony of the one
percent has worsened. The gambling economy, aptly named “casino
capitalism,” has allowed the creation of fictitious economic
activity – making money out of nothing. Buying and selling bad
debt paper with little or no equity to back it up. Inventing more
clever and interesting derivatives, and hedge funds. The worst of the
worst is typified by Goldman Sachs that actually encouraged their
clients to buy investments which GS then bet their own money would
fail. Former New York Time journalist, Christopher Hedges, discussed Goldman Sachs's ongoing raiding of the public purse in a speech on Thursday in New York City's Zuccotti Park, just prior to being arrested:
“Goldman
Sachs, which received more subsidies and bailout-related funds than
any other investment bank because the Federal Reserve permitted it to
become a bank holding company under its “emergency situation,”
has used billions in taxpayer money to enrich itself and reward its
top executives. It handed its senior employees a staggering $18
a billion in 2009, $16 billion in 2010 and $10 billion in 2011 in
mega-bonuses. This massive transfer of wealth upwards by the Bush and
Obama administrations, now estimated at $13 trillion to $14 trillion,
went into the pockets of those who carried out fraud and criminal
activity rather than the victims who lost their jobs, their savings
and often their homes.”
Yes, the abuse was worse in the U.S.,
but no thanks to our banks -- or to the Harper government. The
banks wanted to merge and go global. But the previous Liberal
government and former Finance minister Paul Martin refused to allow
it, although the Canadian business community and the banks went
ballistic.
Still, in Canada, the gap between the
richest and the poorest has widened. And the rate at which it is
widening is faster than in the U.S. We know from good and solid
research, such as that in Spirit Level: Why greater equality makes
societies stronger (Wilkinson and Pickett, Bloomsbury Press,
2009) that the healthiest, most resilient societies are those with a
strong and secure middle class, and the lowest gap between rich and
poor. And yet the compassionate framework of the social safety net
in Canada is being eroded nearly daily.
That growing gap only scratches the
surface of why the occupy movement is important. As cities tire of
the encampments, the pressure is on to remove the protests.
Ironically, it is the presence of the homeless, those with mental health
and drug addiction issues that have posed a huge challenge to those
setting up camps. The Occupy Ottawa protesters have spoken openly of
the challenge they face as street people join the outdoor village,
offering free food and a non-judgemental space. The death of a
homeless woman in the Vancouver camp points to the need to ensure
safety within the protest, not shut them down.
We are all the one percent when it
comes to the wealth of the planet, the triumph of consumption over survival. This conflict has been described by economist David Korten
as the struggle between “life and money.” The climate crisis is
driven by the same blind forces that think the NASDAQ and the Dow are
measures worth valuing. If we are, as most scientists attest, so
disrupting global climate as to threaten our children's future,
what sense is there in a good investment portfolio? If you have no
religious frame of reference, forgive me and please accept this bit
of scripture as at least thought provoking, “for what does it
benefit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul?"
Of course, the occupy movement is
outside politics and leaderless. How could it not be? The so-called
leaders are all co-opted by the giant scam called global economic
growth.
To speak in such terms will no doubt be
denounced as heresy by the economic priesthood -- whether Harper, or
Obama or Cameron. So protesters gather in encampments, in a loose
affiliation of people reaching out in various ways, trying to
articulate that something is rotten at the core of modern society --
that we seem to be unwillingly engaged in a global suicide mission.
No one wants to be the first to say,
“Excuse me, but are the lunatics running the asylum? Can't we
have a healthy economy, and yes, even capitalism and corporate
profits, that serves the interests of communities and that accepts
its marching orders from democratically elected governments?”
Let Greens be the first. Let our
policies light the way for those who are ready to face the threats to
our future, clear-eyed and unafraid. #Occupyyourfuture. Bring tents.
Muay Thai gloves: 6 tips on how to buy a great boxing gloves
Picking the right Muay Thai gloves is a single most important decision you have to make when you start completing your training gear. A pair of a good quality boxing gloves will serve you for years protecting your wrists and knuckles from injuries. A pair of a cheap mitts may lose its shape pretty quickly and will offer a poor protection for your hands.
A pair of a quality gloves with a dense padding will increase your performance and offer a better protection than cheaper gloves. If you are serious about your training then you will have to make an educated choice and pick a proper gloves for a heavy bag and sparring. I hope this guide will help you with this task.
What to look for when buying Thai Boxing gloves?
The Price: a good quality Thai Boxing gloves from an established brand like Fairtex gloves and Twins boxing gloves will cost you anywhere from $70 to $120 (£50-£90). For less than $50 (£40) don't expect to buy a quality product. It is better to spend a few extra bucks on a better product now than to regret it later. A good Muay Thai gloves will offer a greater wrist and knuckle protection and will be more comfortable to wear.
The Quality: multiple layer padding is a must to effectively protect your hands. Cheaper gloves may have only 2 layers while quality gloves will offer 3 or even more layers of a protective foam. Thin padded gloves increase a chance wrist of an injury not only for you but also for your sparring partner. In general, sparring gloves have to be softer than heavy bag gloves.
Thumbs must be well protected to eliminate the risk of a Bennett's fracture. And don't buy an open thumb gloves - those are not for Muay Thai. Leave them for mixed martial artists and grapplers.
Gloves should be stiff around the wrist to prevent it from bending and to protect it from an injury. Wrist sprain is very painful and may put you off training for months.
Muay Thai gloves should have a dense padding around the edge of the glove to protect your hand when blocking and checking kicks. This is very important since kicks in Muay Thai are very powerful and do a lot of damage.
Thai boxing gloves should fit well and have easy to use fastening straps. Gloves must fit tight without restricting blood flow and also offer an extra space for hand wraps. If you don't always use hand wraps a stiff wrist support is necessary.
What else you should know before buying a pair of Thai Boxing Gloves:
First of all, you should know that you need to buy at least two pairs of boxing gloves: one for a heavy bag and Thai pads and another one just for sparring.
The reason for that is simple: punching bags damage your gloves and makes them harder.
This, in turn, reduces the protection level for your hands and definitely makes them less comfortable for your sparring partner's face.
That's why you should buy another pair and get 16 oz boxing gloves with softer padding just for sparring. A pair of gloves for punching bag drills should be lighted, around 12-14 oz, and harder than the one for sparring.
And remember, there is a big difference between Boxing gloves and Muay Thai gloves. Don't buy Boxing gloves for Muay Thai training. Thai boxing gloves are crafted for specific purposes like checking kicks, neck wrestling etc. Get a pair that is specifically dedicated for Thai kickboxing.

Shrinking budgets in the years ahead is leading to questions about what kind of military Canada will have.
Defence spending has increased by about a billion dollars every year under the Harper government, but the military now must get by with less.
National Defence cost the government $22.8 billion in the last fiscal year, almost 10 per cent of total program expenses. The cuts are expected to take $2.5 billion out of the military budget.
For Esprit de Corps magazine editor Scott Taylor, the military must "sacrifice something, whether it's capability, or whether it's manpower, something's going to have to go."
Prime Minister Stephen Harper set out a different challenge in his speech on Oct. 29 welcoming Canada's new chief of defence staff: "Within very real budgetary constraints, Canada needs to maintain a modern, general purpose military capability."
In his speech after his appointment, Gen. Tom Lawson acknowledged that the military would "have to stay within a budget that will be tighter than what we had expected," after what he described as "a wonderful new period where we've had a chance to refurbish many of our capabilities."
When defence spending increased

That period began in 2005, with the Liberal government under Paul Martin announcing in its budget that it would provide the military with $13 billion in new funding over the next five years, which it described as "the largest increase in defence spending in the last 20 years."
Martin had been finance minister 10 years earlier, when the government faced a debt crisis that led to massive cuts in spending by all government departments, including National Defence.
The new direction was the result of an improved financial situation, a changed international climate and a new prime minister more inclined to hand money to the military.
A 2005 white paper set out what the government wanted from all that new funding. The Canadian Forces would be "reorganized and retooled" to carry out both short missions and emergencies as well as longer mission-specific task forces. Full-time troop strength, then 60,000, would increase by 5,000 and new equipment would be purchased. The emphasis was on the army.
The Martin government would soon fall, and although the new Harper government would set its own defence policy, it would carry out the plans for increased spending. They would emphasize Arctic defence and move away from the focus on the army.
In 2008, the Harper government released its Canada First Defence Strategy, which set out plans to spend $490 billion on defence over 20 years.
Defence expert Philippe Lagassé, from the University of Ottawa, described the strategy's "very broad list" of six missions as something "you can pretty much put everything in under the sun." In terms of equipment, especially the major fleets, "the strategy is simply to replace everything you have."
Teeth vs. tail
That was also the year of the global financial crisis, and although the government continued to increase defence spending, and underestimate costs, it soon recognized problems ahead.
Esprit de Corps magazine editor Scott Taylor greets Lt.-Gen Andrew Leslie at the book launch for Taylor's Unreconciled Differences: Turkey, Armenia & Azerbaijan, at Library and Archives Canada in Ottawa, April 2010. (Esprit de Corps)
The government appointed Lt.-Gen. Andrew Leslie to review spending and requirements and recommend where to cut. In his 2011 report, Leslie detailed how headquarters staff had grown by nearly half but the regular forces by only a tenth since 2004.
Spending on consultants and contractors was up $2.7 billion per year.
"We are going to have to reduce overhead and invest in output; we have to become slimmer," Leslie wrote in the report. He recommended a major change in the way the department operates, with major cuts at headquarters and especially to spending on consultants and contractors, while continuing to carry out all current operations.
"In short, we are going to have to reduce the tail of today while investing in the teeth of tomorrow," Leslie wrote.
Lagassé is skeptical about Leslie's approach.
"The department has pushed back a bit, because as easy as it may seem to try and find efficiencies, there aren't that many places you can cut and still keep everything you are doing, as you are doing it," he says.
He told CBC News that the military is concerned "that you can only slash administration so much before it begins to affect your ability to be an effective force, even on the field."
Taylor, a former soldier, notes that the culture at the Department of National Defence is not one that embraces change.

"There's a culture of resistance, a culture of internal empire-building, so these guys are going to push back at everything."
However, Harper has continued to back Leslie's general recommendations. In a June letter to Defence Minister Peter MacKay, which was later leaked to Canadian Press, he made that clear.
"It is important that we reduce the current overhead," he wrote MacKay, adding not to expect "that the defence budget will grow in the next few years."
Two weeks ago, in his speech marking Lawson's appointment as CDS, Harper echoed Leslie: "The Canada First Defence Strategy must continue to advance, and as I've said before, with the constant search for more teeth and less tail."
Impact on troops
For Taylor, that strategy is "a hodge-podge and every direction you look it's going to need huge amounts of money." If the military goes ahead with its current procurement plans, Taylor notes, the operating costs for the new equipment will be huge.
"We just can't move forward in all the directions they say they are going to move forward, not with the amount of money that's in the pot now," Taylor told CBC News.
He says the military also faces retention problems, and that "morale is going into the toilet for the army." Once the training program in Afghanistan is over, the forces will be without a mission. For a soldier, Taylor says, that's like attending hockey practice all the time, without ever playing a game. Despite the dangers, soldiers want to do their job for real.
As well, along with the frontline experience the troops got in Afghanistan came increased pay and rapid promotion, which also means a higher income, Taylor explained.

"Love it, hate it, disagree with it; the mission in Afghanistan was a mission," Taylor said, and it gave soldiers and pilots a sense of purpose. Now, with just training exercises ahead, the fear is they will get bored, which, of course, produces more problems.
While the idea is out there that the absence of a mission like Afghanistan means substantial budgetary savings for the military, Lagassé notes that while the savings are fairly significant, the mission received incremental funding from the House of Commons.
What did come out of the DND budget won't be "sufficient to make up for the cuts DND is being asked to take in, simply because there was that incremental funding."
A more specialized military?
Canada is not alone in facing questions about what kind of military it can afford. In 2010, NATO proposed that its members eliminate some overlapping capabilities, with just one or a few members specializing in some tasks. However, Harper has made clear that he wants to continue with the general-purpose military of the Canada First Defence Strategy.
The government has said it will issue a "reset" of that strategy, which should be made public soon, but Lagassé doesn't expect anything to change except for some numbers.
"We're simply moving forward with an unaffordable strategy that will ultimately leave us with forces that have been devised in an ad hoc manner."
Philippe Lagassé says Canada has 'an unaffordable [military] strategy that will ultimately leave us with forces that have been devised in an ad hoc manner.' (CBC)
If Canada's military were faced with a choice of hoping for new funds in the future or taking the specialization road, Lagassé says, they'd rather wait and hope. For now, he said they will take "a two-pronged approach."
On the one hand, they will be "cutting back on operational readiness in the short term on the assumption they probably won't be deployed on any major operation for some time."
At the same time, the military keeps going with its procurement programs, "even though they are unaffordable, and eventually force the government to be in a bind and have to give you more."
Lagassé points to the huge $35-billion shipbuilding program.
"If it so happens you can't build the number of ships you stated you were going to build with the amount of money you'd been given, then given the amount of attention the government has drawn to the shipbuilding strategy, you can force their hand and force them to give you a top-up in order to ensure that you can build an additional number of ships."
Faced with situations like this in the past, Lagassé notes that the Canadian Forces ultimately made it through and did their jobs, which he said is "somewhat their curse."
"Even when they're dealt a relatively difficult circumstance, they seem to make it through, never really forcing the government into a crisis situation, where they have to resolve the problem once and for all."
A man and his 3-year-old son were bitten by a coyote Wednesday evening outside their home in Irvine, authorities said.
At 6:20 p.m., a man in his mid-40s was working in his garage in the 70 block of Forbes in the Portola Springs neighborhood, when a coyote appeared and bit the boy, who was playing outside, said Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Steve Concialdi.
The boy was bitten on his right knee, and jumped onto his father, who was bent over.
“At first (the father) thought he was playing before he realized he (the boy) was bitten,” Concialdi said.
The father was a bit next in his buttocks.
Orange County Fire Authority firefighter paramedics responded and cared for the wounds. The man drove himself and his son to Hoag Hospital Irvine for further medical attention.
The coyote ran off before officers with the Irvine Police Department's Animal Services Division arrived. A search for the animal was being conducted Wednesday evening, Irvine police official, Lt. Cathy Scherer said.
Several coyote sightings have been reported in Irvine this year, putting residents on edge. In May, a 3-year-old girl and a woman were both bitten in separate incidents while walking on a sidewalk.
In June, a 2-year-old boy was bitten in his knee and suffered a leg bruise near a playground in the 200 block of Borrego, and and another young boy on Keepsake was bitten several times.
Last month, Irvine animal control officers patrolled the Portola Springs and Pavilion Park neighborhoods with paintball guns to deter coyotes from engaging in human contact. The guns were loaded with yellow paintball markers intended only to sting the animals and scare them off.
The practice, known as “hazing” or “fear conditioning” is an alternative to trapping or killing the animals, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.
One coyote that may have been looking for food in front of a home was hazed in the patrol. Another ran off after officers yelled and flashed their lights at it.
Wildlife officials advise people not to feed coyotes or leave trash lying around, which serves as an invitation to the animals.

In many ways, Jon Pirulli-Almond enjoyed a pretty typical afternoon last Saturday. He chilled out in his red wagon. He played with a new Batman toy. He squirted his parents (and passersby) with a water pistol.
But there was nothing ordinary about the venue - or the boy's attire. It's a safe bet that Jon was the only 3-year-old in Washington, D.C. frolicking at a gay pride parade while wearing a shirt emblazoned with the message: "My Two Daddies (Can Beat Up Your One)."
His two fathers (Brent Almond, known as "Daddy" to John) and Nicholas Pirulli (aka "Papa") proudly hoisted their son, who was winning over the crowd with both his fashion message and his squirt gun prowess.
"It was so affirming and encouraging to hear everyone cheer when (we) walked by, and I've never gotten so many high-fives in my life," Almond said. "It was hard to stop smiling throughout the whole march."
Almond, a 44-year-old graphic designer, and Pirulli, a 46-year-old attorney, are among a small but growing number of same-sex parents in this country. According to the Center for Family and Demographic Research, about one in six same-sex households include children. There are reportedly almost 2 million U.S. children being raised by same-sex parents, many of them in states that don't allow gays to marry.

Almond and Pirulli, who had a commitment ceremony in 2003, are hoping to legally marry later this year. "I don't know that being legally married will change our day-to-day lives, but it will be nice to know there are safeguards in place, just in case," Almond said. "It will be especially neat to have Jon involved."
With same-sex marriage gaining momentum (a recent poll shows a slim majority of Americans support it and 12 states now allow it), same-sex parenting has become a hot-button topic - even at the highest levels of the U.S. judicial system. When the Supreme Court took up the issue of same-sex marriage in March, Justice Antonin Scalia claimed that experts were debating whether raising a child in a single-sex family is "harmful to the child or not."
Scalia may have been alluding to a 2012 study conducted by Mark Regnerus, a University of Texas at Austin professor who found that children of a gay or lesbian parent may be more likely to have social and emotional problems.
But that conclusion is false, according to experts. The methodology of Regnerus' study waswidely criticized by sociologists and even his own colleagues called it "bad science."
"The preponderance of the available evidence is that children of same-sex parents turn out just as well as other kids," said Debra Umberson, a sociology professor at University of Texas at Austin.
The social science on same-sex parenting is limited but some of the existing evidence is compelling. University of Virginia psychologist Charlotte Patterson recently invited both straight and same-sex couples to play with their respective children on a blanket with toys. Video showed that same-sex parents were more collaborative and egalitarian in their interactions with their children, while heterosexual parents retreated to conventional roles - mothers were more interactive while fathers were content to just play with the toys themselves.
Almond says he's not surprised by the study. He recounted a time he passed by a toddler soccer league and saw all the dads huddled on the sidelines and all the moms sequestered under the trees. Gay parents, he said, generally don't restrict themselves to one role.
"I can hang with the moms in the kitchen or I can go hang out with the dads on the sidelines depending on what my kid needs me for," he said.
When it comes to the well-being of kids, experts say stability and money trump sexual orientation. Susan Brown, a sociology professor at Bowling Green University, said that children fare better when their parents don't have to worry about basic financial needs and are in a committed relationship. To that end, marriage is key.
"Marriage has symbolic value as a public statement and public union," Brown said. "So (same-sex) marriage stands to enhance a child's well-being."
In March, the American Academy of Pediatrics officially endorsed same-sex marriage, citing researchshowing that parents' sexual orientation has no bearing on a child's well-being. The policy said that if two same-sex parents want to marry, "it is in the best interests of their children that legal and social institutions allow and support them to do so."
The Supreme Court is expected to rule on same-sex marriage cases this month.
Almond and Pirulli, who have been together for almost two decades, took methodical steps so they could adopt. Anticipating the home study process, they moved from D.C. to the suburbs to get a house, a big yard and a dog. They chose Maryland over Virginia because the latter does not allow unmarried couples to adopt.
The process was long and gut-wrenching. They were matched quickly with a mother but she changed her mind two days before the couple was supposed to be united with the baby. In adoption parlance, that's called a "disruption." Pirulli called it devastating.
"Brent had never seen me cry before that," Pirulli said of the ordeal.
They were then referred to an attorney in Portland, Ore., who found a match in 2009. The mother went into labor a month early and the couple caught the first plane to the Pacific Northwest. That night, they met Jon just a few hours after his birth and spent the night with him in the hospital. There was no maternal change of heart this time and the couple has had Jon ever since.

On their son's first birthday, Almond launched a blog "Designer Daddy," where he riffs on everything from "cool toys and doodads" to being an adoptive parent and gay father. He has since joined a father bloggers group where he commiserates with other men about the struggles of raising a three-year-old.
He has even taken classes on parenting, including one called "Managing Anger" - a class, Almond says, made up almost entirely of toddler parents.
"As a gay dad, I don't have a lot of peers, so these classes and the dad bloggers group have helped me establish my community of peers," Almond said.
While Almond and Pirulli say that most of the parenting challenges they face have nothing to do with their sexual orientation, both admit that they worry about what Jon might encounter as the adopted son of two gay men.
"Kids can be cruel," Pirulli said.
Pondering that hypothetical scenario, Almond decided to arm his son with lyrics to fend off any potential bullies. And so he wrote the song, "My Two Daddies (Can Beat Up Your One)" - the battle cry of a picked-on kid proclaiming that "some folks may get fretful or not understand my life but my parents love each other... There just ain't no wife." (Watch Almond perform the song below).
Almond calls the song (which is available on iTunes and raises money for the LGBT advocacy group Family Equity Council) "a love letter to my son - with a smidge of me working through my insecurities as a father."
On Monday, the day after Father's Day, Almond and Pirulli will once again get on a plane to Portland. They will take Jon for his annual visit with his birth parents. During the trip, Jon will also spend time with his biological brother who was adopted by a foster family.
Jon's two dads used to worry about the trip - how his birth parents would perceive them and how their young son might handle it. But their insecurities have dissipated since 2009.
"We occasionally talk about adoption but he doesn't ask questions like 'Why don't I have a mom?'" Pirulli said. "But it's going to happen soon."
"I have a script I've written and I ran it by an adoption social worker," Almond said. "But we have to be confident. He's ours. Our highest priority is him."
SPRINGFIELD -- Before being named Springfield's most wanted criminal this month, Scott Laclair was already one of CVS's most unwanted customers.
In a one-month spree, Laclair allegedly shoplifted more than $1,400 worth of merchandise, including $1,052 in condoms, from two CVS stores in Springfield, according to police and court records.
On seven occasions, he allegedly walked into a store, filled a basket with merchandise and walked out. On six occasions, no one stopped him, records show.
Laclair, 40, is being held on $50,000 bail after allegedly knocking down a 79-year-old man and stealing $400 from him. He was arrested Dec. 14 after his photo appeared on the Springfield Police Department's Facebook page, with a note from Sgt. John Delaney: "Let's get this guy before he robs again."
In addition to assault and robbery charges, Laclair is facing four shoplifting cases from earlier this year. No stranger to the court system, he has picked up convictions for armed robbery, heroin distribution, receiving stolen property, shoplifting and other charges during a 25-year criminal career, records show.
He was allegedly shoplifting from Kohl's department store in West Springfield at the time of his latest arrest. Captured after a chase along the Connecticut River, Laclair was wearing three pairs of sweatpants -- two of them stolen from Kohl's, police said. He was also carrying a pair of wire cutters used to remove security tags from merchandise, police said.

Laclair needed no tools while targeting CVS stores on Belmont Avenue and State Street earlier this year, according to court records. Between April 5 and April 27, he allegedly stole $1,490 in merchandise by filling up one or two shopping baskets and carrying them out the front door, the records show.
On April 17, for example, he walked into the Belmont Avenue CVS at 7:28 a.m. and headed for the family planning section; there, he picked up five boxes of Trojan Magnum extra-large condoms, at $28.49 each, and 10 boxes of other condoms, at $15.79 each, and then walked out, according to a statement given by CVS to police.
The total loss was $305.35, including the cost of the plastic basket, the statement said.
Three days later, he returned to the Belmont Avenue store at 7:30 a.m. and took two plastic baskets. He went to the oral care section, picking up eight boxes of Crest 3D whitening toothpaste, before moving on to family planning, where he took four packs of Trojan Magnum condoms, at $27.49 each, and four packs of other condoms, at $15.79 each, the records show.
The total loss was $320.96, including two plastic baskets, CVS said.
He also visited the grocery sections at both stores.
On April 5, he left the Belmont Avenue CVS with five large packages of beef jerky, at $11.99 each, five smaller packages, at $6.99 each, and 20 boxes of assorted "movie-sized candy" at $1.77 each. The total loss, including the basket, was $140.77, CVS said.
Four days later, he walked out of the State Street store with 12 large packages of beef jerky, at $2.85 each, and 20 boxes of movie-sized candy, at $1.77 each, for a total loss, including the basket, of $129.28, records show.
Not every trip ended so well for Laclair, however.
On April 21, a manager at the Belmont Avenue store stopped him walking out with 45 boxes of Colgate toothpaste in two baskets, records show. "He admitted to the theft and handed over the baskets full of product," an employee wrote in statement to police.
Laclair's luck was better on April 27. He left the State Street store with $332.75 in condoms, his largest haul of the month, records show.
The alleged thefts from CVS during April represent just one of the four shoplifting cases pending against Laclair in Springfield.
Eventually, CVS obtained a no-trespassing order against Laclair, who lives within walking distance of the Belmont Avenue store. But the order did not prevent him from allegedly walking out with another basket of condoms last month, records show.
"He has been trespassed by CVS and is on store security video for the second time in less than a week," an employee noted in a loss report from Nov. 15.
Laclair is due back in Springfield District Court for a pretrial hearing on Jan. 13.
"My City Was Gone" is a song by the rock group The Pretenders. The song originally appeared in October 1982 as the B-side to the single release of "Back on the Chain Gang";[1] the single was the first release for the band following the death of founding bandmember James Honeyman-Scott. The song was included on the album Learning to Crawl released in early 1984, and it became a radio favorite in the United States. It is sometimes referred to as "The Ohio Song" for its constant reference to the state, though it is not part of the song's title. The song's final title was chosen because there had already been a song called "Ohio" by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.
The song was written by Pretenders leader Chrissie Hynde,[2] and reflected her growing interest in environmental and social concerns; the lyrics take the form of an autobiographical lament, with the singer returning to her childhood home of Ohio and discovering that rampant development and pollution had destroyed the "pretty countryside" of her youth. The song makes a number of specific references to places in and around Akron, Ohio including South Howard Street (line 5), the historic center of Akron which was leveled to make way for an urban plaza with three skyscrapers and two parking decks (line 8).
The opening bass riff from this song "was something that Tony Butler used to play just as a warm-up," said Steve Churchyard, the engineer for the record.[3]
Use by Rush Limbaugh [ edit ]
The instrumental opening of the song (before Hynde's vocals appear at about 40 seconds) has been used as the opening theme 'bumper' for Rush Limbaugh's popular American talk radio program since 1984, during his days at KFBK in Sacramento, California. Limbaugh said in 2011 that he chose it because of the irony of a conservative using such an anti-conservative song, though he mainly liked its "unmistakable, totally recognizable bass line."[4]
In 1999, Rolling Stone magazine reported that, according to Hynde's manager, Limbaugh had neither licensed the song nor asked permission to use it. According to Rolling Stone, EMI took action after Limbaugh told a pair of reporters in 1997 that "it was icing on the cake that it was [written by] an environmentalist, animal rights wacko and was an anti-conservative song. It is anti-development, anti-capitalist and here I am going to take a liberal song and make fun of [liberals] at the same time."[5] EMI issued a cease and desist request that Limbaugh stop using the song, which he did. When Hynde found out during a radio interview, she said that her parents loved and listened to Limbaugh and she did not mind its use. A usage payment was agreed upon which she donated to PETA.[4][5] She later wrote to the organization saying, "In light of Rush Limbaugh's vocal support of PETA's campaign against the Environmental Protection Agency's foolish plan to test some 3,000 chemicals on animals, I have decided to allow him to keep my song, 'My City Was Gone', as his signature tune..."[5]

As my twitter followers probably know, the last couple days I've been having fun learning Google's Go language. My goal is to build something in the FlockDB universe, but for now I'm just getting familiar with things. For those who aren't familiar with it, Go is Google's attempt to build a modern system programming language. A modern day C, if you will.
Go has some pretty neat features. And it has some annoying limitations. I'll blog about those when I get more familiar with it. One thing that I can definitively say is that it is both young and there appears to be a strong will to keep it slim and focused. The result is a comparatively lacking framework (or set of built-in packages as they are called). For example, there's no built-in Set .
Please keep in mind that I don't really know what I'm doing.
My goal tonight was to benchmark various Set implementation, in the hope that I'd not only find a good implementation but also familiarize myself with Go. I want to be very clear: I have specific requirements for my Set. I'm therefore focusing on testing against my use-case. What is my use-case? Basically I want to populate a collection with integers and explicitly remove all duplicates on demand. In other words, I only care about unique values when I care about unique values - the rest of the time, duplicates are ok. Ordering isn't important. Here's an example of how I might use it:
func Load(users []User) ([]int) { ids := new(MySpecialCollection) for user := range users { for id := range.user.friendIds { ids.Add(id) } } ids.RemoveDuplicates() return ids; }
So, I want to get all the unique ids of all the user's friends. Ids are removed once at the end and then the "set" is returned.
We'll begin by defining an interface:
type Set interface { Add(value int) Contains(value int) (bool) Length() (int) RemoveDuplicates() }
We only really care about Add and RemoveDuplicates . However, the Contains and Length methods will help us test our implementation (kinda pointless to see which runs faster if we don't also test that they actually work!)
The first implementation uses a map (Go's built-in hashtable type). This is our baseline because it's the simplest most obvious solution. Here's the implementation:
type HashSet struct { data map[int]bool } func (this *HashSet) Add(value int) { this.data[value] = true } func (this *HashSet) Contains(value int) (exists bool) { _, exists = this.data[value] return } func (this *HashSet) Length() (int) { return len(this.data) } func (this *HashSet) RemoveDuplicates() {} func NewSet() (Set) { return &HashSet{make(map[int] bool)} }
If this is your first time looking at Go, you might be a little lost. First we define our type called HashSet and define a private member data (it's private because the name starts with a lowercase letter) which is a map. One really cool thing about Go is that you don't have to explicitly implement an interface. Simply implement its methods and it can safely be cast to it (it's awesome!) Methods are defined as functions with a receiver (this *HashSet) . All of the implementations are pretty straighforward. RemoveDuplicates does nothing because duplicates are never added (that's just a basic property of a hash/map).
Two things about the above code worth exploring. First, the Contains method is somewhat funky. In Go, methods can return multiple values. Getting a value from a map ( this.data[value] ) returns two values. The actual value at the key, and true/false on whether the value existed. We discard the actual value by assigning it to the magic variable _ and assign whether the value existed or not to the exists variable - which is actually a named returned parameter. The other thing is the NewSet function. Functions like this is how you do a constructor. I think it kinda sucks. Within our "constructor" we actually initialize our map using the special make . make is something else which I think sucks about Go. Three built-in types need to be instantiated with make , all the other types are instantiated with new (or the &TYPE{} syntax we are using here, which is syntactical sugar for new and is similar to C#'s constructor initializers).
We'll create two tests to make sure our implementation works:
import( "testing" "rand" ) func TestCanAddUniqueValues(t *testing.T) { values := []int{5,4,3,9,1,2,8} set := NewSet() for _,v := range values { set.Add(v) } set.RemoveDuplicates() Assert(t, set.Length() == len(values), "Wrong length") for _,v := range values { Assert(t, set.Contains(v), "Missing value") } } func TestUniqueRemovesDuplicates(t *testing.T) { values := []int{5,4,3,5,2,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,2} uniques := []int{5,4,3,2,1} set := NewSet() for _,v := range values { set.Add(v) } set.RemoveDuplicates() Assert(t, set.Length() == len(uniques), "Wrong length") for _,v := range uniques { Assert(t, set.Contains(v), "Missing value") } } func Assert(t *testing.T, condition bool, message string) { if (!condition) { t.Fatal(message) } }
Testing in Go isn't particularly pretty. But, at least we'll be able to make sure that whenever RemoveDuplicates is called on our set, that duplicates are, in fact, removed.
Now comes the interesting part. Go has built-in benchmarking capabilities, and it's pretty neat. Rather than define a Test function, we define a Benchmark method, like so:
func BenchmarkSmallSetWithFewCollisions(b *testing.B){ for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ { set := NewSet() for j := 0; j < 100; j++ { set.Add(rand.Int() %700) } } } }
If you look at the first for loop, you'll notice that we are looping b.N times. b is the parameter which is passed into our function. The way it works is that the engine will loop through our code as many times as it needs to until it feels comfortable that it has an accurate measurement for the cost of a single iteration. This'll become more clear briefly.
My goal was to test the performance of a small, medium and large set (100, 5000 and 100000 items) and for each of those, with a small, medium and large number of duplicates. The above code will generate a set of 100 values, where a given value can be between 0 and 699 - so duplicates are pretty rare. Here's what all 9 benchmarks look like:
func benchmark(b *testing.B, size int, fill int) { for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ { set := NewSet() for j := 0; j < size; j++ { set.Add(rand.Int() % fill) } } } func BenchmarkSmallSetWithFewCollisions(b *testing.B){ benchmark(b, 100, 700) } func BenchmarkSmallSetWithMoreCollisions(b *testing.B){ benchmark(b, 100, 100) } func BenchmarkSmallSetWithManyCollisions(b *testing.B){ benchmark(b, 100, 25) } func BenchmarkMediumSetWithFewCollisions(b *testing.B){ benchmark(b, 5000, 35000) } func BenchmarkMediumSetWithMoreCollisions(b *testing.B){ benchmark(b, 5000, 5000) } func BenchmarkMediumSetWithManyCollisions(b *testing.B){ benchmark(b, 5000, 1250) } func BenchmarkLargeSetWithFewCollisions(b *testing.B){ benchmark(b, 100000, 700000) } func BenchmarkLargeSetWithMoreCollisions(b *testing.B){ benchmark(b, 100000, 100000) } func BenchmarkLargeSetWithManyCollisions(b *testing.B){ benchmark(b, 100000, 25000) }
And, here's the output from running this against our simple HashSet implementation:
set.BenchmarkSmallSetWithFewCollisions 50000 52600 ns/op set.BenchmarkSmallSetWithMoreCollisions 50000 42991 ns/op set.BenchmarkSmallSetWithManyCollisions 50000 31406 ns/op set.BenchmarkMediumSetWithFewCollisions 1000 2663531 ns/op set.BenchmarkMediumSetWithMoreCollisions 1000 1703337 ns/op set.BenchmarkMediumSetWithManyCollisions 1000 1411807 ns/op set.BenchmarkLargeSetWithFewCollisions 50 54807860 ns/op set.BenchmarkLargeSetWithMoreCollisions 50 48436380 ns/op set.BenchmarkLargeSetWithManyCollisions 50 34149020 ns/op
The first column is the benchmark that was run. The 2nd column is how many iterations it ran (or the value of b.N ). The last column is the time it took (in nanoseconds) per loop. From the above, we can tell that the more collisions there are, the faster the code (I'd guess that's because it has to insert less values into the map).
For my second implementation, I decided to use an array and scan the array for a duplicate before adding it. The interesting method here is Add and Contains :
func (this *RealtimeArraySet) Add(value int) { if this.Contains(value) == false { this.data = append(this.data, value) } } func (this *RealtimeArraySet) Contains(value int) (exists bool) { for _, v := range this.data { if v == value { return true } } return false }
And, here are the results:
set.BenchmarkSmallSetWithFewCollisions 100000 22390 ns/op set.BenchmarkSmallSetWithMoreCollisions 100000 19421 ns/op set.BenchmarkSmallSetWithManyCollisions 100000 17037 ns/op set.BenchmarkMediumSetWithFewCollisions 100 19248020 ns/op set.BenchmarkMediumSetWithMoreCollisions 100 12210990 ns/op set.BenchmarkMediumSetWithManyCollisions 500 5158366 ns/op set.BenchmarkLargeSetWithFewCollisions 1 7482466000 ns/op set.BenchmarkLargeSetWithMoreCollisions 1 4660109000 ns/op set.BenchmarkLargeSetWithManyCollisions 1 1785185000 ns/op
For small sets, this is much faster. For large sets, it's much slower. This isn't really a surprise. Doing a linear search in the array just can't scale with large sets.
The last implementation I did was to allow duplicates to get added to the array, but to remove them when explicitly told to:
func (this *OnDemandArraySet) Add(value int) { //the append method will automatically grow our array if needed this.data = append(this.data, value) } func (this *OnDemandArraySet) RemoveDuplicates() { length := len(this.data) - 1 for i := 0; i < length; i++ { for j := i + 1; j <= length; j++ { if (this.data[i] == this.data[j]) { this.data[j] = this.data[length] this.data = this.data[0:length] length-- j-- } } } }
We remove duplicates by comparing every value to every other value. This leans heavily on Go slices. You can think of a Go slice as a movable window above an array. Slices are really efficient. When we find a duplicate, we replace it with the last element and shrink by 1. So, if we have: [1,2,3,2,5,6] it'll become [1,2,3,6,5] (the 6 overwrites the duplicate 2 and the slice is shrunk). Again, all of this is efficient - we aren't creating copies of array, just playing with pointers. The results:
set.BenchmarkSmallSetWithFewCollisions 200000 12362 ns/op set.BenchmarkSmallSetWithMoreCollisions 200000 12425 ns/op set.BenchmarkSmallSetWithManyCollisions 200000 12430 ns/op set.BenchmarkMediumSetWithFewCollisions 5000 682792 ns/op set.BenchmarkMediumSetWithMoreCollisions 2000 720831 ns/op set.BenchmarkMediumSetWithManyCollisions 2000 706491 ns/op set.BenchmarkLargeSetWithFewCollisions 100 12645380 ns/op set.BenchmarkLargeSetWithMoreCollisions 100 12682960 ns/op set.BenchmarkLargeSetWithManyCollisions 100 12863000 ns/op
Under all circumstances, this is a clear winner. In the simplest case it's 4.25x faster than the map and 1.8x faster than the original array implementation. In the most complex case it's 2.6x faster than the map and 138x faster than the original array implementation. (I did play with pre-allocating the underlying structures with different sizes, it didn't change anything.)
Beyond raw speed, we can also measure how much memory each approach takes. For this, I simply enabled Go's memoryprofile and looped through each set a fixed number of times. To be honest, I'm not positive what all the values mean, but I extracted the three which seemed the most relevant:
HashSet Alloc = 1227039448 TotalAlloc = 2249302288 HeapInuse = 1241645056 RealTimeArraySet Alloc = 1033523080 TotalAlloc = 1033574400 HeapInuse = 1047220224 OnDemandArraySet Alloc = 3631414928 TotalAlloc = 3631466248 HeapInuse = 3659673600
No huge surprise here. Since the fastest implementation doesn't discard duplicates until we tell it to, it takes the most amount of memory. The RealTimeArraySet takes the least amount of memory because duplicates are discarded, and there's little overhead to the underlying structure (an array). I'm quite surprised at how close the memory footprint of the map is to the array.

Margaret Jusinski first got to know her investment broker through the breakfasts he provided when he visited her public school in the leafy suburbs of New Jersey, where she teaches middle-school children computer coding and how to build robots made of Legos.
After the bagels, muffins and coffee, the broker made his sales pitch — and Ms. Jusinski bought it. So did many of her colleagues.
The teachers only recently learned how much those meals actually cost them.
Had she been able to choose a simpler, less expensive plan instead of the broker's costly offering, Ms. Jusinski would have approximately 20 percent more in savings, according to an analysis performed for The New York Times. One colleague would have a balance 50 percent fatter. The list goes on.
“It is a heartbreaking situation for everyone,” said Ms. Jusinski, a mother of two girls who turns 50 on Sunday. “Especially for the staff members who were looking to retire within the next few years.”
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office officially published a series of 41 newly granted patents for Apple Inc. today. In this particular report we cover Apple's granted patent relating to possible future iDevices like the iPhone having sidewall flexible displays that could represent virtual buttons to replace physical buttons for iDevice controls including special ones for gaming.
Granted Patent: Side Wall Displays
Apple's newly granted patent covers their invention relating to flexible displays, and more particularly, to electronic devices with flexible displays.
Apple notes that the flexible displays may include one or more flexible layers and may be mounted under a transparent display cover layer such as a layer of clear glass or plastic. For example, a flexible display may be mounted on the underside of a cover layer. Flexible displays may include a touch-sensitive layer that allows a user to provide touch input to an electronic device. Display pixels on a flexible display may be used to display visual information to the user.
Apple further notes that the housing and flexible display may be configured to form planar front and rear surfaces and sidewall surfaces for the device. A flexible display may be mounted so that at least a first portion of the flexible display is mounted on the front surface of the device and forms part of the front surface. The flexible display may have a bend that allows a second portion of the flexible display to cover some of the sidewall surfaces of the device.
Apple later notes that active portions of the sidewall display edges of an electronic device may be used to create virtual user interface controls such as buttons. The buttons or other user input interface elements may be reconfigured during use of the electronic device. For example, the user input interface elements on the sidewall of an electronic device may be repurposed for supporting user input operations in different operating modes of the electronic device. Virtual buttons on the edge of a device may be provided in place of tactile input/output components such as physical buttons and switches or may be formed as part of a dummy button structure or other mechanical feature.
And finally, Apple notes that during operation of an electronic device, a virtual button may be, for example, a virtual volume button for controlling audio output volume and may be repurposed based on user input to become a virtual camera shutter button for taking a picture or may be reconfigured to serve as a controller for another device function. Images displayed on the flexible display may indicate to a user which function is currently being performed by the virtual button. Predetermined inputs to the touch-sensitive layer on the edge of the device (e.g., tapping, sliding, swiping, or other motions of an external object such as a finger across the edge of the device) may be used to change the operating mode of the device.
Apple's patent FIG. 14 noted above is a perspective view of an illustrative electronic device showing how virtual sidewall buttons may form a portion of a gaming controller when the device is operated in a landscape position.

England: Measles outbreak reported in Leeds and Liverpool
There is a measles outbreak reported in Leeds and Liverpool, according to the NHS yesterday. While they offer no specifics on cases and locations on their social media posts, NHS advises people to ensure they and their children are vaccinated.
Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and sometimes lead to serious complications. The measles virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
The initial symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you're infected.
These can include:
cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough
sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light
a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40C (104F)
small greyish-white spots on the inside of the cheeks
A few days later, a red-brown blotchy rash will appear. This usually starts on the head or upper neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body.
Measles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems.
Once you've had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus and it's highly unlikely you'll get it again.
Celebrate Christmas and New Year's Eve in Rome
However, measles can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (encephalitis).

Remember all the news reports suggesting, without evidence, that the Clinton Foundation's fund-raising created conflicts of interest? Well, now the man who benefited from all that innuendo is on his way to the White House. And he's already giving us an object lesson in what real conflicts of interest look like, as authoritarian governments around the world shower favors on his business empire.
Of course, Donald Trump could be rejecting these favors and separating himself and his family from his hotels and so on. But he isn't. In fact, he's openly using his position to drum up business. And his early appointments suggest that he won't be the only player using political power to build personal wealth. Self-dealing will be the norm throughout this administration. America has just entered an era of unprecedented corruption at the top.
The question you need to ask is why this matters. Hint: It's not the money, it's the incentives.
True, we could be talking about a lot of money — think billions, not millions, to Mr. Trump alone (which is why his promise not to take his salary is a sick joke). But America is a very rich country, whose government spends more than $4 trillion a year, so even large-scale looting amounts to rounding error. What's important is not the money that sticks to the fingers of the inner circle, but what they do to get that money, and the bad policy that results.
Normally, policy reflects some combination of practicality — what works? — and ideology — what fits my preconceptions? And our usual complaint is that ideology all too often overrules the evidence.
LONDON
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has said he “pretty much” supported Britain leaving the EU during a televised interview Sunday.
“This government - Cameron government - repeatedly used the EU for political cover for its own decision-making,” Assange said on ITV's Peston on Sunday show.
"For example, the European Arrest Warrant, we think here in the United Kingdom that you have a right to a fair trial that includes, evidence, judges and charges, but in my case, we don't have any of that," he said.
The 44-year-old Australian whistleblower took refuge inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, 2012, in an attempt to avoid extradition to Sweden. Ecuador granted Assange political asylum in 2012, despite pressure from Britain.
Assange was out on bail when he claimed asylum in Ecuador's London embassy after losing his appeal in the U.K. Supreme Court against extradition to Sweden, where a judicial investigation was initiated against him in connection with allegations of sexual misconduct. However, he was not formally charged.
In 2015, Swedish prosecutors dropped the two sexual assault claims against Assange but the rape accusation remains.
BMW is set to roll out an evo kit for its M6 GT3 for next year, having recently tested the updated package at Lausitzring.
FIA GT3 regulations permit one update kit during each car's homologation period, although the modifications are subject to approval by the FIA.
BMW stated the aim of the upgrade is to improve drivability with a focus on amateur and less-experienced drivers, as well as improving reliability and durability of parts.
Details on what components have been changed has not been provided by the German manufacturer.
“The BMW M6 GT3 will remain the flagship in the BMW customer racing product range and our top model for the prestigious 24-hour races at the Nürburgring and Spa-Francorchamps in 2018 and beyond,” BMW Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt said.
“We are working on an evo package, to provide our customer racing teams with an even better car.
“The latest tests at the Lausitzring showed that we have made a big step forward, particularly in terms of drivability.”
Factory driver Philipp Eng was behind the wheel during the tests earlier this month and noted a considerable improvement in performance compared to the current specification, which was rolled out in 2016.
“The tests with the new evo package for 2018 were great fun,” Eng said. “Thanks to the updates, the BMW M6 GT3 is significantly easier and more comfortable to drive. It is also more consistent.
“All this makes it less tiring for the driver in the cockpit. Drivability is really an important key to success. Congratulations to the BMW engineers, who have really done a very good job with the evo package.”
The car is expected to go through the FIA's Balance of Performance tests at Ladoux in September, ahead of its re-homologation for next year, which will be applicable for all major GT3 championships worldwide, including the Blancpain GT Series, IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship and Pirelli World Challenge.
FOR 30 years, the tradition has been for each newly elected president of the Is lamic Republic to travel at once to Mashad, Iran's main “holy” city, to thank Ali bin Mussa, the only one of Shiism's 12 imams buried in Iranian soil.
When he was first elected president four years ago, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made much of the Mashad trip by spreading rumors about his “secret” connections with the imams. This year, the state-owned media were presented his new pilgrimage as a “working visit” during which the imam would review and approve the president-elect's program.
But Ahmadinejad was forced at the last minute to scrub the trip. Angry Mashadis, many of whom believe Ahmadinejad stole the election, were determined to give him a rough reception. Despite the presence of some 15,000 Basij security men in the city, the authorities couldn't guarantee the president's safety — let alone deliver the enthusiastic, welcoming crowds that he requires for propaganda purposes.
The canceled pilgrimage is the latest sign of trouble in the wake of Ahmadinejad's controversial re-election.
Last Friday, his visit to Shiraz, Iran's cultural capital, was called off on “security grounds.” On Monday, the Foreign Ministry canceled what was to be the first-ever visit by an Iranian leader to Libya.
Planned a year in advance, that trip was to feature Ahmadinejad signing a “treaty of friendship and cooperation” with the African Union and addressing a summit of African leaders. (Yesterday, it was announced that the visit would happen, somewhat shortened — but then it was called off again.)
On Tuesday, it was announced that yet another of Ahmadinejad's “historic visits” was off — he will not travel to Sharm-el-Sheik in Egypt to address the summit of the nonaligned movement after all.
Since 2007, Ahmadinejad has campaigned to lead the “nonaligned” group and to host its next summit in Tehran in 2012. His “brother,” Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, has visited a dozen capitals to win support for the Iranian bid — efforts now clearly all in vain. Wounded politically at home, perhaps mortally, Ahmadinejad is in no position to claim an international leadership position.
Another long-planned trip, visits with six leftist leaders in their Latin American capitals, already postponed once because of the election imbroglio, was definitively back-burnered yesterday.
With his re-election approved by the Council of the Guardians of the Constitution, Ahmadinejad may be out of immediate danger. But he's a diminished figure even if he manages to hang on.
Four years ago, he won as a populist candidate who owed no debt of gratitude to “Supreme Guide” Ali Khamenei (who had tacitly endorsed another candidate). His prestige was further enhanced when, in a second round of voting, he crushed former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, a grandee of the Khomeinist nomenklatura. Ahmadinejad could claim that he was his own man, relying on no establishment cabals.
The June 12 election changed all that. Whatever the truth of allegations about massive fraud, the fact is that many Iranians, perhaps a majority, believe that Ahmadinejad didn't win. To many, his re-election seems merely the result of plotting by a power clique centered on Khamenei.
“Ahmadinejad is president not because people voted for him, but because Khamenei says so,” notes Tehran analyst Saeed Hajjarian.
Worse still, the authorities have had to deploy tens of thousands of security agents, kill dozens of protestors and imprison more than 4,000 dissidents to prevent Ahmadinejad's victory from being challenged by millions of protest marchers every day.
He governs thanks to the say-so of the “supreme guide” and the batons and bayonets of the security agents — not what populist Ahmadinejad had hoped.
His legitimacy is challenged at all levels of Iranian society, including every segment of the Khomeinist establishment. He has to invoke Khamenei's authority in support of every move he makes. He is the first Islamic Republic president to have split the Khomeinist camp so deeply, and perhaps permanently.
With the presidency's loss of legitimacy, the “republic” part of the “Islamic Republic” may have gone forever. The emerging system could be called an “imamate,” with the “supreme guide,” who now calls himself “the living imam,” running the show. In that case, the re-elected president no longer needs to go to Mashad to communicate with an imam who died 1,200 years ago.
Amir Taheri's new book is “The Persian Night: Iran Under the Khomeinist Revolution.”

Oklahoma City, OK — Ruth Temple called out Oklahoma police officers Sunday night after her boyfriend started acting strangely.
That 9-1-1 Call would eventually lead to Temple's boyfriend, Darrell Gatewood's death.
Police say they were called to the residence because Gatewood was breaking glasses and other things inside the apartment. When police arrived, they found Gatewood lying on broken glass on the floor of the apartment.
At one point, Gatewood appeared to be “shadow boxing” and throwing punches in the air, police said. A clearly mentally distraught Gatewood was then dragged into the street and pepper sprayed and tasered.
“They kept saying you're resisting and fighting. So they kept pulling the trigger on the taser over and over again,” said witness Leeann Mize.
“They should have restrained him inside the house because they could have.” Mize urged. “They could have put his hands in handcuffs and put him in the back of the police car but instead they drug him out and electrocuted him in a puddle of water.”
“He would release, Taser again, release, Taser again.” said Mize. “It was scary and out of line. They killed a husband, a father and a grandfather in front of the grandbabies, wife and the daughter.”
“They kept tasing him until his heart blew out… It was too much. They did too much,” Mize added. “He was not a bad person,” said Mize. “Yes he had a record and none of it was violent. He was a family man. He was a good sweet family man.”
“I wish I never called the police,” said his girlfriend. “They shouldn't have tased him.”
Gatewood's death has led to three police officers being suspended pending an investigation.
The official cause of death has yet to be determined.
“In this case we don't know what caused him to die,” said Oklahoma City police Capt. Paco Balderrama. “We're not saying that the Taser was the cause,” he added. “We're saying that a Taser was one of the things that was utilized to try to get the person into custody, but there were also many other factors ultimately contributing to the death of that person.”
Gatewood has a history of drug abuse, and his family believes he was acting under the influence of K-2, a synthetic version of marijuana.
We often ask, “why didn't that cop use a taser instead of his gun?” However, it is important to remember that while a person is less likely to die from a taser shock than a gun shot, they are still an often fatal weapon and should be treated as such.
According to Amnesty International, between 2001 and 2008, 351 people in the United States died from being shocked by police tasers. Electronic Villiage has documented another 283 taser-related deaths in the United States from 2009-2014. That means there have been at least 634 documented taser-related deaths in America since 2001. You can view the list here.
There are 50,000 volts of electricity that shoot out of a police issued Taser and into their target. The American Heart Association has been vocal about the fact that tasers can cause cardiac arrest and death.
Can't get that new song out of your head? You've probably got an earworm, which “tends to be this little fragment, often a bit of the chorus of the song, that just plays and replays like it's stuck on loop in your head,” says Elizabeth Margulis, director of the Music Cognition Lab at the University of Arkansas and author of On Repeat: How Music Plays the Mind. The quirky YouTube hit “What Does the Fox Say?” by Ylvis, Starship's “We Built This City,” and The Baha Men's “Who Let the Dogs Out?” are just a few tunes known to spawn earworms, according to Margulis. (Check out this SciFri segment for more on earworms.)
Related Segment Why Do Some Songs Stick in Our Heads?
The phenomenon is quite common. For instance, a study from the Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition found that more than 91 percent of people reported having an earworm at least once a week, while about a quarter had them more than once a day.
As frequent as earworms may be, however, what triggers them and why they occur still remain mysteries. That's mainly because earworms—which tend to last eight seconds—are by definition involuntary, and therefore tracking them in a scientific setting can be a near-impossible task. Researchers have yet to develop consistent methods of inducing earworms in test subjects. The data that researchers have culled on the subject so far come from surveys of a few thousand people or from small diary studies—but participants can be unreliable in recalling how often they get earworms, for how long, what they were doing at the time, what might have caused the earworm to disappear, and so on.
Music cognition research suggests that earworms could have something to do with how music affects the brain's motor cortex, according to Margulis. When people listen to music, “there's a lot of activity in the motor planning regions,” she says. “People are often imaginatively participating even while they're sitting still.”
[Is MSG actually bad for you?]
Repetitive listening could also breed earworms. Indeed, 90 percent of the time, we listen to music we've heard before, says Margulis, and “when you've heard [a song] the fourth or fifth time, [one] note carries with it just so clearly the implications of the next note. You can almost feel exactly what's going to happen next.”
A song's structure might contribute to brain burrowing, too. “There are general patterns of characteristics for songs that frequently get stuck, such as being simple, repetitive, and having some mild incongruity,” James Kellaris, a professor of marketing at the University of Cincinnati who's conducted research on the influence of music on memory, wrote in an email.
“Fundamentally, an earworm is your brain singing.”
In one study, researchers led by Victoria Williamson, a visiting professor at Switzerland's Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts and a fellow at the University of Sheffield, analyzed more than 50 different musical features and found that earworm songs—tunes that were mentioned by at least three different people in her survey—tend to have notes with longer durations but smaller pitch intervals. This makes sense, she says, because these are two main features that make songs easier to sing, even for the musically untrained. “Fundamentally, an earworm is your brain singing,” Williamson says. Earworm songs also have a certain amount of built-in predictability, coupled with enough novelty to pique a listener's interest.
While almost everyone gets earworms at some point, Williamson's research has found that people with neuroticism and non-clinical levels of obsessive compulsion experience them more often, and for longer periods of time. “These people tend to have more repeated thought processes in general, so it's perhaps not a huge surprise that these are reflected in their experiences of mental music as well,” she says.
[Meet the unsung women of science.]
Earworm susceptibility also has an idiosyncratic component—experiencing them seems to involve being in the right mood (or wrong one, depending on your opinion of the earworm) at the right time. “In addition to traits of songs and traits of people (such as being mildly neurotic or having high exposure levels to music), situation comes into play as a third factor,” Kellaris wrote. “It appears that earworms are more likely to bite when the victim is tired, stressed, or idle.”
Despite the complaints of sufferers, however, the majority of our earworms are actually somewhat enjoyable or neutral experiences, according to Williamson. Her research has shown that people consider only about 30 percent of earworms to be “annoying.” “We're more inclined to remember the things that annoy us,” she says. “So if you ask somebody about an earworm, they'll tell you about the one that annoyed them yesterday. They won't tell you the three or four they briefly had in their head which they didn't really notice, or [which] just kept them company as they walked around.”
Once an earworm lodges in your psyche, how do you get rid of it? Williamson says the best method is for people to distract themselves with other music or to do something that involves language—perhaps tackle a crossword or start a conversation with somebody. A second technique seems counterintuitive: Engage with the earworm song itself by listening to it repeatedly so as to exhaust the earworm or “complete it,” says Williamson. Because earworms are only fragments of music, listening to the entire track might relieve a person of repeating the same part in her head.
So go ahead, interact with that earworm! And let us know which are your favorite or least favorite ones. We'll try to keep them out of our heads.
Below is a playlist of some earworm songs you've already told us about through Twitter and Facebook. Listener beware!
*This article was updated on May 28, 2014 to reflect the following correction: The original text stated that a study led by Victoria Williamson found that “91 percent of people reported having an earworm at least once a week, while about a quarter had them more than once a day.” That finding was actually reported in a study led by Lassi A. Liikkanen.

In June 1916, an Indian living in California wrote a letter to The New York Times emphasizing how profoundly Indians in the United States had been influenced by the political values of their adoptive country.
“Residence in the U.S. has not made [Indians]…who returned home ‘imbued with revolutionary ideas' but it has made them republicans.” He added, “The whole country has been stirred by their vision of a United States of India.”
The writer of the letter was Ram Chandra, the editor of Hindustan Gadar, the newspaper of the San Francisco-based Gadar Party. The party took its name from the Urdu word for “mutiny” or “revolt.” (The word is sometimes transliterated as “Ghadar.”) In its inaugural issue in November 1913, the newspaper had stated the party's intentions clearly: “To bring about a rising…because the people can no longer bear the oppression and tyranny practiced under English rule.”
Most of the members of the Gadar Party were Punjabi, though their sympathizers were drawn from across India. Many of them had served in the British army or police services in places like Hong Kong and Shanghai and had moved to the United States to work as farm laborers or on building the railroads. A few were students at U.S. universities.
As India celebrates the 65th anniversary of its independence from Britain, the role of the Gadar Party and other Indians in the United States in helping the cause is garnering increased attention. Some of the new work is the result of African-American scholars examining the influence of the Indian struggle for freedom on the U.S. civil rights movement. Long before Martin Luther King began to study Gandhi's works, African-American groups had established links with visiting Indian freedom fighters. Among them was Lala Lajpat Rai, who spent five years starting in 1915 as a political exile in the United States. He counted W.E.B. Du Bois among his friends, and also met with Booker T. Washington.
Other research into the subject represents the growing Indian-American community's attempt to prove that its history in the United States is longer and more nuanced than is commonly known. These include a recent book by the historian Maia Ramnath, “Haj to Utopia: How the Ghadar Movement Charted Global Radicalism and Attempted to Overthrow the British Empire.”
Another initiative in this direction is the South Asian American Digital Archive, which was founded in Philadelphia in 2008 “to document and provide access to the diverse and relatively unknown stories of South Asian Americans.” Its collections chronicle a wide range of community experiences, and include several documents and photographs that throw light on the links between Indian-Americans and the Indian independence struggle.
“Historians will undoubtedly debate the legacy of the Gadar Party's contributions to the overall freedom struggle for years to come,” said Samip Mallick, 31, the archive's executive director, in an e-mail interview with India Ink. “But, symbolically, it is a really unique, extraordinary and inspiring story. The story of the Gadar Party is the story of a new immigrant population advocating for their own political enfranchisement, both through their support for decolonization around the world and through their fight for civil rights in their new home country.”
Here are excerpts from that interview:
Q.
How did the Gadar Party influence India's freedom struggle?
A.
The Hindustan Gadar Party started off as a San Francisco-based anti-colonial political organization, which advocated the complete independence of India from British rule. The specifics of its founding are slightly murky, but it's clear that in 1913, a group of activists based on the Pacific Coast, including Har Dayal and Sohan Singh Bhakna, were organizing migrant laborers (most of whom were Punjabi Sikhs) and helped found what would later be known as the Gadar Party, its aim being the overthrow of British colonial rule of India through revolutionary means. The Gadar Party published a newspaper titled Gadr in Urdu, followed by a Gurmukhi editions and apparently Gujarati editions. Copies of the newspaper as well as the party's pamphlets were disseminated throughout the world, including Japan, China, Hong Kong, Burma and the Philippines, and eventually Gadar bases sprung up in those areas, as well. Gadar leaders also often wrote of the mistreatment of Indian immigrants in the U.S., which tells us that this was more than simply a nationalist organization.

The Gadar Party received considerable support from the German Foreign Office, which arranged funds and armaments in a plot to incite a pan-Indian revolution (later known as the “Annie Larsen affair”) in 1915. The conspiracy was discovered by British and American intelligence, and led to the Hindu-German Conspiracy Trial of 1917, in which 29 party members were convicted in the District Court in San Francisco.
The Gadar Party continued to exist after the trial, and in 1920 began to publish the Independent Hindustan, a journal containing editorials, essays and news items relating to the global movement for Indian independence. In 1923, the party began to publish The United States of India, for several years. The full runs of these publications are available online through our Web site.
Q.
Which other organizations in the U.S. supported Indian independence?
A.
Alongside the Gadar Party was the India Home Rule League based in New York, founded by Lala Lajpat Rai, which advocated “home rule” for India. The I.H.R.L. produced a monthly journal from 1918 onward titled Young India. When Lajpat Rai left the U.S. in 1919, the editorship duties were handed off to Jabez T. Sunderland, a Unitarian minister who was a close associate of Rai and a longtime advocate for Indian independence. Another critical organization was Friends of Freedom for India, which was closely associated with the Gadar Party and led by Agnes Smedley and Sailendranath Ghose. Their mission, according to its own membership ads, was “to maintain the right of asylum for political refugees from India” and “to present the case for the independence of India.”

Incidentally, all three groups – the Gadar Party, the I.H.R.L., and the F.F.I. – enjoyed support from Irish nationalists, and published articles from Irish/Irish-American supporters. Other supporters of Indian freedom who traveled and lectured in the U.S. include Rabindranath Tagore, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, Ram Manohar Lohia and Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit.
Q.
What was the U.S. government's position on the Indian freedom struggle?
A.
This is a pretty complex question, but it seems that before WWI, the U.S. government took a formal position of neutrality whenever possible, even while maintaining surveillance on the activities of Indians in the U.S. who advocated for independence. A few key American political figures like William Jennings Bryan, a member of the Anti-Imperialist league, wrote against British rule in India (Bryan's 1906 essay “British Rule in India” was actually reprinted and circulated by the Gadar Party), but this wasn't official state policy by any means. During WWI, the U.S. worked with British authorities to crack down the activity of Indian revolutionaries in the U.S., on the grounds that the Gadar radicals' relationship with the German government was a violation of the neutrality laws. This resulted in the Hindu-German Conspiracy case of 1917.

Advocates for India's freedom made much of President Woodrow Wilson's “Fourteen Points” speech during WWI, which called for “a free, open-minded, and impartial adjustment of all colonial claims,” seeing this as a step forward towards decolonization and publishing praise for the president in Young India and various Gadar pamphlets. But even while most knew Wilson didn't have India at the forefront of his mind when making such a claim, as historian Erez Manela puts it in “The Wilsonian Moment,” Wilson's claim became part of their “rhetorical arsenal” for independence.
Q.
What explains the recent spurt of books about the links between Indians in the U.S. and the freedom movement?
A.
Part of the reason is that connections are being drawn between Asian-American Studies and what has traditionally been known as “area studies.” Also, transnational or diaspora studies, once seen as a footnote, has given us new focal points for examining the history of the freedom movement in India. The frame for analysis isn't so nationally bound anymore.
However, while it is true that there are a number of new academic works on the Gadar Party and transnational involvement in the freedom struggle, there has been ongoing interest for many years in keeping these histories alive, beginning with even those who were themselves involved in the freedom struggle and worried that the tremendous sacrifices they made fighting for India's independence would be forgotten and lost to history.
In 1953, writing from Mexico City, former Gadar Party member Pandurang Khankoje wrote to Bhagwan Singh Gyanee, asking the past leader for information to keep the story of Gadar alive. “People in India are anxious to know about you all,” Khankhoje said. “We are getting old and the history of our movement should not get lost.”
In the U.S. there have been a number of individuals, including T.S. Sibia, Jane Singh, Ved Prakash Vatuk, Irene Joshi, and others who have independently researched and worked to raise awareness about these important histories. There have also been organizations formed such as the Hindustan Gadar Party Memorial Committee to draw public attention to and publicly commemorate these histories. One of their major efforts was for the dedication of the building at 5 Wood Street in San Francisco as Gadar Memorial Hall, which is now owned and operated by the Indian Consular Office.
What is unique now, from the perspective of our work, is the opportunity provided by the digital medium to unify and provide universal access to dispersed archival materials in a way that was completely unimaginable even five or 10 years ago.
Q.
How did the South Asian American Digital Archive go about collecting its materials?
A.
Materials in the archive come to us generally in two ways. First are the materials that are held by individuals in their private collections. These are materials that have been collected over the years related to an individual's family history or their own lives. Materials such as these would often stay in the basement or attic where they are kept and the important stories contained within these materials would not be widely shared. We work closely with such individuals to provide digital access to photographs, letters, journals and other such objects through our website while the original copies remain with their current owner.
Second are materials in institutions or archival repositories around the country. Few materials related to South Asian Americans are included in existing archives. For the vast majority of repositories, materials related to our community fall outside the scope of their collecting efforts. The materials that are available in archives are spread widely in collections across the country, making it difficult even for individual researchers to find the materials they need for their work and especially difficult for members of the community to access them. We have collaborated with a number of institutions to provide digital access to materials in their collections that are relevant to South Asian American history, but that may have otherwise been overlooked.
An example of such a collaboration is with the University of Pennsylvania Rare Book and Manuscript Library, which has a series of correspondence between Har Dayal, one of the leaders of the Gadar Party, and his close friend Van Wyck Brooks as part of their collection of Brooks's papers. Collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania allowed us to provide digital access to these letters and allow users anywhere in the world to read Har Dayal's words in his own hand for the very first time.

There's such a beautiful little irony to the realization that the guy from Fun. is singing backup for the guy from Joyce Manor. The guy from Joyce Manor is Barry Johnson, who, since 2008, has specialized in finely observed and wistful little lyrical details, and who has crammed those details into songs that often clock in at under 90 seconds. Joyce Manor are a pop-punk band, at least in theory, but they've only really glancingly nodded at the “pop” side of that equation. They sing about relationships and sentimentality and being a completely lost young person, the way pop-punk bands do. But their songs are brief and headlong rushes — LPs ending in under 20 minutes, songs that barely ever bother to repeat the chorus twice. And Johnson's voice is not exactly a melodic instrument. It's a strangulated blurt — capable of conveying emotion but not really the sort of thing that can pound a hook home.
The guy from Fun., meanwhile, is Nate Ruess. (Usually, when we talk about a guy from Fun. on this site, it's Jack Antonoff. Not this time. This time, it's Nate Ruess.) Ruess is a big deal. He's had a #1 hit. He's sung the hook on an Eminem track. And whatever you think of Fun.'s songs (I think they're pretty good, generally), the man can sing, in that blown-out, operatic, Freddie Mercury Jr. kind of way. And yet here Ruess is, on Joyce Manor's fourth album, Cody, singing ahh-ahh backing harmonies and buried deep in the mix. (The album's two credited backing vocalists are Ruess and Phoebe Bridgers, a Los Angeles singer-songwriter who opened for Julien Baker on tour pretty recently.) It's an odd pairing, but it makes its own kind of sense. Cody immediately registers as Joyce Manor's best album, and it achieves that distinction, in part, by cleaning up the band's sound and giving it some melodic focus. You can't really do that if Barry Johnson is the only guy on the mic the whole time. Ruess' parts are minor, but they make a big difference, and plus it's fun to think about him being on this album.
It might be a stretch to think of Ruess taking a supporting role on the album, but it's not that shocking to think about him being on the album. Joyce Manor are, within their own world, an important band, one with a real fanbase. They're four albums deep into their career (even if all those albums could fit onto a single CD). They play big rooms. They generated a whole lot of punk-scene controversy a couple of years ago when they asked fans not to stagedive at their shows. A year and a half ago, I watched them draw a not-bad crowd to a Coachella mainstage — something that not too many guitar-driven acts at that festival can accomplish. But more to the point, they've done all this while playing a defiant, hard-edged, willfully obtuse, and personal form of pop-punk — a genre that's fallen from commercial dominance in the past decade or so — and proved that there's still plenty of life in the form. Pop-punk didn't need saving; there are hundreds of bands out there in the Bandcamp hinterlands putting their absolute hearts into it with no thought of becoming Blink-182 or Fall Out Boy. But for those of us who have largely lost touch with the stuff, it's great to see a band finding new, creative things to do with that sound and, as a result, blowing the fuck up.
And now Joyce Manor finally sound like a band who have blown the fuck up, who have real resources to make their sound bigger and better. Maybe there's a contradiction in cheering for a knotty, idiosyncratic band to become poppier and more accessible, but on Cody, Joyce Manor make the leap, and they do it without compromising the things that made them special in the first place. The version of Joyce Manor we hear on Cody is one that's comfortable enough to record a four-minute song, or to let its album's runtime creep past the 25-minute mark. Their hooks are bigger and sharper and cleaner. Rob Schnapf produced the album, and he's an old hand at cleaning up underground sensations and making them bigger and cleaner. (He co-produced Mellow Gold for Beck and Either/Or and XO for Elliott Smith. He knows what he's doing.) And finally, rather than bashing their way through the songs like they can't wait for them to be over, Joyce Manor have slowed down and given their whole attack room to breathe. They pull neat little production tricks, like adding a tambourine when the second verse comes in. They have bits that get stuck in your head now. That's something new.
And the bits that you get stuck in your head are also the ones that flex Barry Johnson's deep and specific lyrical powers. This one, from the album opener and first single “Fake ID” has been sticking with me since I first heard it: “What do you think about Kanye West? / I think that he's great, I think he's the best / Yeah, I think he's better than John Steinbeck / I think he's better than Phil Hartman.” He's not singing from his own perspective; he's inhabiting the sort of drunken chatter you can hear on a night out, the lines that rattle around in your head even when the rest of the night is a blur. And a minute after singing about Kanye, he's singing about a friend who died. Other times, he's more direct, as on the fluttering acoustic please-stay reverie “Do You Really Want To Get Better?”: “Could you see me in your life? Could you try?” Or he's interrogating his own failings and being utterly merciless about it: “I'm 26 and I still live with my parents / Oh, I can't do laundry / Christ, I can't do dishes / What'll I do without you?”
That song about being 26 is “Stairs,” the longest-ever Joyce Manor song at four minutes and change. It might be the most complicated, too. It ends with Johnson, or his character, telling a loved one some disturbing things: “I'll lock you in my room / And I'll tie you to the sheets / Cuz I could watch you sleep for weeks.” It's a big, messy, tangled-up, confused sentiment, and I'm pretty sure Johnson understands that it's wrong. But Joyce Manor have found a way to make that messiness sting and resonate. Cody might present a cleaned-up version of this band, but this is a band that can only clean up so much, no matter who's singing backup.
Cody is out 10/7 on Epitaph.

The Miami Hurricanes have lost their second major player to injury in the past week, and this one is doubly distressing to the Hurricanes' passing game as No. 7 Miami (10-1, 7-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) gets ready to face No. 1 Clemson (11-1, 7-1) on Saturday night in the ACC Championship Game.
Five days after senior tight end Christopher Herndon sustained a season-ending knee injury on Friday at Pittsburgh, sophomore receiver Ahmmon Richards, who last year broke Canes' legend Michael Irvin's freshman school receiving record, injured his knee Wednesday morning during practice and was carted off Greentree Field.
The Miami Herald first reported the injury Wednesday afternoon, and the University of Miami sent out a release Wednesday evening saying Richards “sustained a meniscus injury in his left knee during practice today and will miss the remainder of the season.''
Richards will undergo surgery this week, UM said.

SHARE COPY LINK The Miami Hurricanes are making their first appearance in the ACC Championship game against Clemson on Saturday. Coaches of both teams believe the winner gets into the College Football Playoff.
Richt declined to discuss Richards' newest injury when approached by the Herald regarding Richards after practice Wednesday, saying he wouldn't answer any questions.
Between Herndon (470 yards and four touchdowns) and Richards (439 yards and three touchdowns), the two accounted for 909 receiving yards and seven touchdowns.
The 6-1, 190-pound Richards, a 2016 freshman All-American who had 934 receiving yards in 2016, has been plagued by hamstring injuries all season, and also at times had issues with an ankle and his achilles' tendon, according to Richt recently.
Dish Network has been looking to make serious inroads in the mobile market and it looks like the company has identified an appealing new option. Dish on Monday announced that it is challenging SoftBank's plans for a Sprint merger with a bid of its own — $25.5 billion in total, which consists of $17.3 billion in cash and $8.2 billion in stock. The proposed Dish deal would give Sprint shareholders $7.00 per share, which represents a healthy premium over SoftBank's offer of $4.03 per share. Sprint shares were up more than 12.5% in Monday's pre-market session on the news. Dish's full press release follows below.
DISH Network Proposes Merger with Sprint Nextel Corporation for $25.5 Billion
U.S. technology leader with track record of disrupting entrenched incumbents presents superior alternative to pending SoftBank proposal – DISH offers more cash and a greater ownership stake
Sprint shareholders would receive $7.00 per share, consisting of $4.76 in cash and stock representing approximately 32% in a company with a significantly enhanced strategic position
Creates an industry-leading spectrum portfolio and the only company that can offer customers a fully-integrated, nationwide bundle of in- and out-of-home video, broadband and voice services
Delivers substantial synergies and growth opportunities estimated at $37 billion in net present value, including an estimated $11 billion in cost savings
Conference call today at 8:00 a.m. EDT
Monday, April 15, 2013 4:30 am MDT
ENGLEWOOD, Colo.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ: DISH) today announced that it has submitted a merger proposal to the Board of Directors of Sprint Nextel Corporation (NYSE: S) for a total cash and stock consideration of $25.5 billion. The DISH proposal clearly represents superior value to Sprint shareholders, including greater ownership in a combined company that is better positioned for the future with more spectrum, products, subscribers, financial scale and new opportunities.
DISH is offering Sprint shareholders a total consideration of $25.5 billion, consisting of $17.3 billion in cash and $8.2 billion in stock. Sprint shareholders would receive $7.00 per share, based upon DISH's closing price on Friday, April 12, 2013. This consists of $4.76 per share in cash and 0.05953 DISH shares per Sprint share. The cash portion of DISH's proposal represents an 18% premium over the $4.03 per share implied by the SoftBank proposal, and the equity portion represents approximately 32% ownership in the combined DISH/Sprint versus SoftBank's proposal of a 30% interest in Sprint alone. Together this represents a 13% premium to the value of the existing SoftBank proposal.
“The DISH proposal clearly presents Sprint shareholders with a superior alternative to the pending SoftBank proposal,” said Charlie Ergen, Chairman of DISH Network. “Sprint shareholders will benefit from a higher price with more cash while also creating the opportunity to participate more meaningfully in a combined DISH/Sprint with a significantly-enhanced strategic position and substantial synergies that are not attainable through the pending SoftBank proposal.”
Mr. Ergen continued, “A transformative DISH/Sprint merger will create the only company that can offer customers a convenient, fully-integrated, nationwide bundle of in- and out-of-home video, broadband and voice services. Additionally, the combined national footprints and scale will allow DISH/Sprint to bring improved broadband services to millions of homes with inferior or no access to competitive broadband services. This unique, combined company will have a leadership position in video, data and voice and the necessary broadband spectrum to provide customers with rich content everywhere, all the time.”
The proposed combination will result in synergies and growth opportunities estimated at $37 billion in net present value, including an estimated $11 billion in cost savings.
DISH has provided additional information regarding the proposed merger via a dedicated transaction microsite that can be accessed at www.CompleteDishSolution.com.

Hitting is not easy. But, you already knew that.
Have you ever been in a hitting slump? Maybe you're experiencing one right now and can't even buy a hit. From tee ball all the way up to the Major Leagues, every hitter is going to suffer a slump at some point during their career. But, rest assured, your next hitting streak is one pitch away.
Keep in mind that the best players in the world deal with hitting slumps. There's a reason that professionals have hitting coaches. You're not alone. With that said, there is no master key when it comes to getting out of a slump. Every player has their personal preferences and tactics on how to deal with a bad hitting streak.
The JustBats.com team has experience playing baseball and softball at all levels. After collecting information from former players and current coaches, these are the eight (8) best tips we've gathered for getting out of a hitting slump.
Don't overthink it
A majority of the time, a hitting slump is not due to improper mechanics or a physical deficiency. More often than not, poor performance at the plate all starts with your thoughts and visualization before you even step into the batter's box. You are your own worst enemy. As the legendary Yogi Berra once said, "Baseball is 90% mental, and the other half is physical."
Some players who go 0 for 4 fall into the trap of thinking they're immediately in a slump and try to get back on track. When, in fact, they never got off track. Never, ever start to feel sorry for yourself or walk back to the dugout pouting. You need to stay positive and believe in yourself, no matter the circumstances. Take it one bat at a time and don't dwell on any previous pitch. A great hitter will learn to handle failure and accept it as part of the game. If you attack each pitcher with a tremendous amount of self-confidence and truly feel as if you're going to get on base, then there is a greater chance that you will.
Use a swing analyzer
Now, if you're confident that your mental state is in tip-top shape and you're worried your mechanics or hitting fundamentals are lacking, then you will benefit from using a swing analyzer. In this day and age, if you're not utilizing technology and sabermetrics during your training sessions, you will fall behind. Remove all guesswork from your batting practice sessions and analyze real-time data about swing speed, time to impact, bat attack angle, power, quickness, and much more. Train smart, develop good habits, and get out of your hitting slump fast by using a swing tracker.

Hit the batting cages
As cliche as it sounds, practice makes perfect. The more repetitions you get in at the batting cage, the more comfortable you will feel during your next at bat. Getting a feel for solid contact and being able to hear the ball crack against your barrel will do wonders for your confidence. Get back to the feeling you had before you were ever in a slump. Worry about only what you can control, and that is your work ethic and attitude. Also, when a player is dealing with a bad streak, they're more likely to hack at bad pitches. Be patient, stay calm, and wait for your pitch.
The one tip for hitting that Hall of Famer George Brett gives to young players.
Practice visualization
Before we dive into the practice of visualizing, watch MLB All-Star Evan Longoria discuss the power and importance of using visualization in baseball.
Studies show that seeing is believing and using the power of visualization will have positive outcomes. It is truly an effective form of practice and should be used by players of all ages, regardless if they're experiencing a hitting slump. Evan Longoria hit the nail on the head when he said, "Visualization is another one of those tools that can give you that added confidence and an advantage over the next guy." If you visualize and mentally prepare yourself more than your competitors, the game will start to simplify.
Hustle hard
Hard work is the best remedy for a lot of problems. Ensure that hustling is always a top priority in both practice and games. Just because you may or may not be in a hitting slump does not give you an excuse to drop your head and lollygag. In fact, it should cause you to do the opposite and hustle even harder. One of the greatest hitters of all-time, Pete Rose, was famously known by his nickname 'Charlie Hustle.' If he ever got beaned, Rose would make it a point to sprint to first base. We've all heard the phrase, "Sprint it out!" That is exactly what you need to do if you're in a slump. It puts all of the pressure on the defense to make a play. Who knows, maybe that bunt up the third baseline will be the end to your worries if you hustle to first.
Watch film
Can you get live footage of batting practice? Great. How about live footage of a game at-bat? Even better. If you have a coach or a parent who is willing to watch film and break it down with you, that's the best. Once you find some game footage, go back and put yourself in one of the at bats that you did not like. Critique yourself and find any and all flaws you may see. Focus on your swing, not as a whole but in sections. Give yourself a second look at each pitch and ask yourself what you could have done better. Recognize the problem (if there is one) and then immediately go to the batting cage to work on that aspect of your game or swing. Try to hone in on one or two drills and master them. Don't spread yourself too thin by going out and working on 10 different drills at once. Bruce Lee once said, "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times."
Get your eyes checked
This is not a joke. When was the last time you got your eyes checked by an optometrist? Never? Your eyes are constantly changing, most likely for the worse.
You'd be surprised how many players go their entire careers without getting their eyes checked to find out that they needed contact lenses the entire time. If you can't see the stitches on the ball very well, there's a good chance your batting average will suffer significantly.
Have the right equipment
Having the right baseball bat or softball bat is a vital part of every player's game. Deciding between length, weight, material, balance, and brand can be a bit overwhelming at times. The JustBats.com Bat Resource Guide can help; it's a buying guide that will walk you through the process of finding, selecting, and caring for your bat so that you can swing with confidence. Questions such as "What is the drop?", "Which barrel diameter do I need to use?", and "How do I determine the length and weight that I should be using?" are all answered. For the latter, you can use the handy weight and height chart below to help find the length that is best for you or your player.

Omid Kokabee (Persian: امید کوکبی; born 1982) is an Iranian experimental laser physicist at the University of Texas at Austin who was arrested in Iran after returning from the United States to visit his family in January 30, 2011.[1] He was initially charged with "gathering and colluding against national security" but later, after being acquitted from the primary charges, he was put on trial for “communicating with a hostile government (USA)” and “illegitimate/illegal earnings”.[2][3] Even though he repeatedly denied all charges against himself, he was finally sentenced to ten years in prison.
In September 2013, the American Physical Society announced Kokabee as a co-recipient of its 2014 Andrei Sakharov Prize for "his courage in refusing to use his physics knowledge to work on projects that he deemed harmful to humanity in the face of extreme physical and psychological pressure".[4]
In November 2013, Amnesty International released a public statement declaring Kokabee a "prisoner of conscience, held solely for his refusal to work on military projects in Iran and as a result of spurious charges related to his legitimate scholarly ties with academic institutions outside of Iran." In that statement Amnesty asked for "his immediate and unconditional release".[5]
In October 2014, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) awarded Kokabee its 2014 Scientific Freedom and Responsibility Award "for his courageous stand and willingness to endure imprisonment rather than violate his moral stance that his scientific expertise not be used for destructive purposes and for his efforts to provide hope and education to fellow prisoners".[6]
Life and education [ edit ]
Kokabee is from Iran's mostly Sunni Muslim Turkmen ethnic group.[2][7] He was ranked 29th in the Iranian university entrance exam, which is held annually with more than one million participants. He entered Sharif University of Technology in 2000 and completed a double major undergraduate program in Applied Physics and Mechanical Engineering. In 2007, he went to Spain to obtain his master's degree in Photonics at Polytechnic University of Catalonia at the Institute of Photonic Sciences, ICFO, in Barcelona. Omid started his PhD studies at the University of Texas at Austin in 2010. He has published more than twenty collaborative papers including seven journal publications, among which lies his publications in Optics Letters.
Arrest and imprisonment [ edit ]
During winter break in 2011, Kokabee traveled to Iran to visit with his family. He was arrested at Imam Khomeini International Airport on his return trip to the United States in February 2011,[7] and was subjected to solitary confinement for 36 days after his arrest.[8] In an open letter, Kokabee claimed that the authorities were trying to obtain his collaboration for the Iranian nuclear program by threatening him and his family.[9]
After 15 months of detention without trial and postponement of two trials in July and October 2011, Kokabee went on trial in Tehran on May 13, 2012. According to his lawyer, Saeed Khalili, Kokabee was charged with having relations with a hostile country and receiving illegitimate funds.[10] Kokabee attended trial before judge Abolqasem Salavati with a group of 10 to 15 people in the same session, under the collective charge of collaborating with Israeli authorities. While other prisoners declared themselves guilty in a TV broadcast, Kokabee consistently denied all charges and did not speak in court.[9] He was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment. The sentence was confirmed in an appeal trial on August 19, 2012.
Several physics associations, including the American Physical Society, the International Optics Society SPIE, the Optical Society of America, and the European Optical Society, have lodged protests against his imprisonment. The open letters to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, note that Kokabee was not politically active and was not associated with any political movement in Iran. However, he is an expert in laser technology, and as indicated in a Nature news article,[11] this expertise may have led to an attempt to intimidate him to work for the Iranian nuclear program, in the area of laser isotope separation.
Since 2007, a number of U.S.-Iranian dual nationals or Americans of Iranian ancestry have faced arrest, imprisonment or criminal charges when visiting Iran (examples being Radio Farda correspondent Parnaz Azima, Roxana Saberi, Ali Shakeri,[12] Esha Momeni, Haleh Esfandiari, and Kian Tajbakhsh).
Omid said:[citation needed]
Is it a sin that I don't want, under any circumstances, to get involved in security and military activities? ... I have just turned 30 years old after spending two years in prison, when I am eager to pursue scientific research.
Nature received copies of the letters from Kokabee's contacts, who asked to remain anonymous because of fear of retribution.
Omid and another inmate, Mehdi Khodaei, translated the book, The Atlas of Human Rights by Andrew Fagan in Persian and made it available for public on the internet for download in 2015.
On November 24, 2015 Omid was transferred to Taleghani Hospital, in Tehran, suffering from kidney stones.[13] He was released on parole on 29 August 2016. This does not amount to a full release since he can still be brought back to prison for the remaining three years of his sentence should the judiciary decide to revoke his parole. However, he is free to leave Iran while on parole.[14]
Activism and recognition [ edit ]
In July 2013, a meeting took place in Barcelona (where Kokabee obtained his master's degree) entitled "Knowledge in jail: Why are there hundreds of scientists in the prisons of the world?" The discussion was organized by the Science and Technology section of the Ateneu Barcelonès. Kokabee's case received special attention. SPIE Past President María Yzuel of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona decried situations wherein scientists and researchers are controlled in their academic years, recalling memories of colleagues who were monitored or controlled by the Franco government.[15]
On September 23, 2013, the American Physical Society, the principal professional society of United States physicists, announced that Kokabee has been selected as a co-recipient of its 2014 Andrei Sakharov Prize, which recognizes outstanding leadership of scientists upholding human rights. He was cited for "his courage in refusing to use his physics knowledge to work on projects that he deemed harmful to humanity in the face of extreme physical and psychological pressure".[4]
On November 16, 2013, Amnesty International sponsored an event in Washington, DC entitled "Iran: Silencing Scientists and Squelching Scholarship." The panel discussion was billed as a dialogue on how to address the issue of repression of academic freedom in Iran; featuring the case of Omid Kokabee. On November 19, 2013, Amnesty International released a public statement declaring Kokabee a "prisoner of conscience, held solely for his refusal to work on military projects in Iran and as a result of spurious charges related to his legitimate scholarly ties with academic institutions outside of Iran." With that statement, Amnesty launched a campaign calling for his immediate and unconditional release.[5]
On October 27, 2014, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the largest general science association in the world, selected Kokabee as the recipient of the 2014 Scientific Freedom and Responsibility Award "for his courageous stand and willingness to endure imprisonment rather than violate his moral stance that his scientific expertise not be used for destructive purposes and for his efforts to provide hope and education to fellow prisoners".[16]

I love Independence Day. And Will Smith. How could you not? I even watched, and possibly enjoyed, Hancock. I'm a monster.
But there's a huge technical flaw in Independence Day that I just can't overlook: Jeff Goldblum somehow magically writes a “computer virus” that infects alien systems. What, the aliens just happened to have a USB port available to plug in some malicious stick? They happened to be running Microsoft Windows? They happened to use x86? I didn't know that evolution of species on other world's included Microsoft, and 32-bit Intel processors.
It's impossible. There is no way that scenario could ever work. I would have liked to be in the meeting during movie production where it was decided that this was the best path, just so I could have punched every person in the face. Except Will Smith. Never Will.
In my mind, the movie has always ended with Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum failing to inject the virus, looking surprised about their incompetence, and then dying along with the rest of the human race. I literally don't even know how the movie really ends, because all I can see is rage.
When SNL returns on September 27th, it'll be heading into its 40th season; break out the candles for the really big birthday cake (FYI: Chris Pratt is hosting, so get extra-psyched).
In the meantime, the Internet is ablaze with news of this upcoming season's additions to the cast and writing staff. Last week, we learned that Michael Che will join Colin Jost and his perfect hair at the Weekend Update desk. (Che isn't exactly a freshman to SNL—he was already a writer, but he'll be a newbie at the Update desk.)
And, DON'T WORRY. CECILY STRONG ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE. I needed this confirmed for me 15 times as I breathed into a paper bag because I love Cecily. She's returning as a cast-member where she'll have more opportunities to appear in sketches and sing amazing songs with Li'l Baby Aidy.
Along with the news of Che joining the cast, a new featured player was announced today, and a few talented young writers joined the show a couple of weeks ago. Two of those writers happen to be ladies. Phew. Liz Lemon would be proud.
It's a solid new team—poised to make the 40th season of SNL that much stronger. So who are these new additions and where did they come from? Don't worry, we've rounded them up in a neat little list for you.
1. Michael Che, Weekend Updater
Last spring, he left his writing gig at SNL to join The Daily Show, where he worked as a correspondent. Though his time on camera there was brief (he actually only appeared in seven sketches), he's well known as a stand-up comedian. Hopefully, he'll stick around SNL for more than just seven sketches, though. When he fills the chair at the Update desk, he'll be the first African-American do to so (also, not as exciting, this marks the first time two males have anchored the desk together).
2. Natasha Rothwell, Writer
If you're not as up to date on your SNL breaking news as I am, let me help you out with Rothwell. Last year, executive producer Lorne Michaels held a secret audition to add a new female cast member to the crew. He ultimately went with Sasheer Zamata, but Rothwell was one of the other females in the room. Clearly she did something right, because now she's part of the writing staff. She comes to the show from the Upright Citizens Brigade in NYC, where she's done everything from acting to writing, and directing. Plus, she's been featured on Nick Cannon's Wild n' Out.
3. Alison Rich, Writer
Rich used to write for Billy On The Street. Do you need to know anything else about her to deem her fabulous? If so, here's the scoop: she won the UCB NBC Diversity Showcase, and then won the IFC “Out of the Box” development deal for her web-series Incognito (which she wrote with Andrew Law, who now writes for Seth Meyers).
4. Streeter Seidell, Writer
First off, how great is his name? Seidell comes to the show from CollegeHumor.com, where he edited the homepage. He was also a writer for the sadly canceled Trophy Wife. He's also written for Mental Floss, Men's Fitness, and CosmoGirl. (Supposedly, this is the article.).
5. Nick Rutherford, Writer
Here's the thing about Rutherford—he and his buddies might be the second-coming of Lonely Island. He's part of a sketch group called Good Neighbor which also happens to include SNL cast-members Kyle Mooney and Beck Bennett, and SNL segment director Dave McCary. Joining the show as a writer only seems to point towards the planets aligning in just the right way, and maybe soon we'll get the second coming of “I'm On A Boat.”
6. Jeremy Beiler, Writer
This guy already has an Emmy nomination under his belt for Inside Amy Schumer. Along with writing, he's also appeared as a reporter on The Onion News Network, played a hotel doorman in Men In Black 3, and a computer tech guy in both Blue Bloods and The Blacklist. His screen credits could mean he'll be a contender to jump behind the Update Desk as a correspondent. Writers have been known to do that, you know. (Right, John Mulaney?)
7. Pete Davidson, Featured Player
Deadline.com announced today that Davidson would be SNL's newest featured player. The 20-year-old New Yorker, kicked off his career at the ripe old age of 16, and really got into the game at 19 when he blew everyone's minds at the Montreal Comedy Festival. From there, he landed a guest-starring role on Brooklyn Nine-Nine and also appeared on Wild ‘N Out and Guy Code. This morning, Davidson retweeted a warm welcome from SNL, making his upcoming stint official. Earlier this year, during a stand-up routine on Jimmy Kimmel, he joked, “I just turned 20 and it's over.” How wrong he was.

Chinese coal-fired electricity generation is expected to flatten through 2040 as renewables fill the gap caused by increased energy demand, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) International Energy Outlook 2017.
According to the study, coal accounted for more than 72% of China's energy generation in 2015. By 2040, however, coal's share of generation will have decreased to only 47% while the generation shares of renewables and nuclear increase. Regardless of the gains for renewables and nuclear, coal, natural gas, and petroleum are still expected to make up a majority of China's energy mix in 2040.
“EIA expects electricity generated from natural gas to grow by 6.5% between 2015 and 2040, with an addition of 70 GW of natural gas capacity. To support continued development, some energy-intensive urban areas such as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan area and the northeast region of China will be encouraged to replace coal with natural gas,” an EIA press release notes.
China is currently working to reduce its dependence on coal and as a part of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the nation vowed to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in energy consumption to roughly 20% by 2030. The nation is also working to reach goals set in its 13th Five-Year Plan by canceling or postponing 150 GW of new coal capacity and retiring up to 20 GW of older plants.
Currently, wind and solar make up a very small portion of the nation's energy mix. Solar power accounts for just 0.5% and wind 2.7%. “EIA projects solar capacity to grow to more than 300 GW by 2040, or by more than 6% per year from 2015 to 2040. Similarly, EIA expects nearly 280 GW of wind capacity to come online between 2015 and 2040, a growth rate of about 4% per year,” according to the release.
China currently has 38 operational nuclear power reactors and 19 more under construction. Under the nation's Five-Year Plan, an additional 58 GW of nuclear is expected to be added to the grid by 2020.

The urge to tweet may be harder to resist than cigarettes or alcohol, according to new research from an American university.
The scientists at Chicago University's Booth Business School used BlackBerrys fitted with devices to log around 8,000 reports about participants' willpower and everyday desires.
The survey of 250 people found that while sleep and sex were the two things that were craved most, urges tweeting and keep track of social media were harder to resist - and people were more likely to cave into them.
The results, which will soon be published in the journal Psychological Science, suggest alcohol and cigarettes prompt much lower levels of desire, despite being highly addictive substances.
"Desires for media may be comparatively harder to resist because of their high availability and also because it feels like it does not 'cost much' to engage in these activities, even though one wants to resist," Dr Wilhelm Hofmann, leading the study, told The Guardian.
"With cigarettes and alcohol there are more costs – long-term as well as monetary – and the opportunity may not always be the right one. So, even though giving in to media desires is certainly less consequential, the frequent use may still 'steal' a lot of people's time."
The study also showed that the more participants tried to resist doing something, the higher their craving to do so became - so they were more likely to cave in the next time around, with willpower becoming lower throughout the day.

The Spokane Chiefs announced Tuesday that Stanley Cup champion, Olympic silver medalist and World Cup gold medalist Adam Deadmarsh has joined the team as an assistant coach.
“When you have an opportunity to bring someone of Adam's caliber into your organization, you jump at it,” said Chiefs' General Manager Scott Carter. “He will be a great asset for our players' development, both on and off the ice. Adam is a great role model for our guys.”
Deadmarsh, 42, played 567 NHL games over 10 seasons with the Quebec Nordiques, Colorado Avalanche and Los Angeles Kings. He was a first round (14th overall) pick by Quebec in 1993 and scored 373 points during his NHL career, including 184 goals, while piling on 819 penalty minutes. He tallied 40-plus points and 99-plus penalty minutes in five-straight seasons with Colorado from 1995-2000. Deadmarsh added 26 goals and 40 assists for 66 points in 105 career NHL playoff games, including five goals and 12 assists in 22 games during Colorado's Stanley Cup run in 1996.
“I am very excited to be joining the Chiefs organization and family,” added Deadmarsh. “I look forward to assisting the coaching staff in any way I can. The Chiefs have an amazing fan base with tremendous enthusiasm and excitement for the game. I look forward to joining the staff and players in that environment.”
A dual Canadian-American citizen, Deadmarsh competed for Team USA in international play, winning a gold medal at the 1996 World Cup of Hockey and a silver medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics.
Before making the leap to the NHL, he played 220 games over four seasons with the Portland Winter Hawks and represented the United States at the World Junior Championship three times, including as team captain in 1995.
Deadmarsh added coaching experience to his resume as an assistant with the Avalanche from 2009-2012.

Ahead of what promises to be the shiniest superhero movie of all time, heres a rundown of Joss Whedons top 5 moments.: Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly, Serenity, Dollhouse. Moments all spoiled below.wasnt a huge hit and low ratings threatened its demise early after just one season, but Fox decided to give it chance and a stay of execution following their mistake to ditch Firefly early. The first season ended with the episode Epitaph One (1:13), which introduces a new set of characters several years in the future. The technology used to wipe minds and imprint people with various personalities has snowballed out of control following a worldwide army-building plan  one phone call wipes a persons mind and programs them to kill everyone who hasnt been wiped! The broken world is divided into those who picked up the phone and those who didnt. It was a bold move for Dollhouse, since it set an end-game, telling the audience where things were headed and would be impossible to reverse. So season two, set in present day, had a sense of dread and inevitability to it. Fortunately the risk paid off and the post-apocalyptic feel (season two also ended with such an episode, entitled Epitaph Two) turned out to be far more compelling than anything else. Were essentially presented with a zombie survival story, which throws in an array of cool alterations, such as characters who imprint themselves with skills and abilities to better fight their enemies (Matrix-style). Yes, the show was inevitably axed after season two, but similar to how Buffy lives on in print, Dollhouse is now set to continue in comic book form, following the barely touched upon Epitaph characters ( as previewed here ). Sign me up!often ran the risk of becoming farfetched nonsense, so Whedon kept the show grounded in emotion (the cornerstone of any decent drama). In season five, Buffy returns home one day to find her mother dead on the couch. What follows is undoubtedly the most emotional episode of television Ive ever seen. So much so that vampires couldnt be further from my mind. The Body (5.16) shows characters we know experiencing terrible loss. The performances are outstanding (in particular is perfect), the script is heart-wrenching, every camera angle tells a story, and the absence of music is horribly unsettling. The Body grounded an uber-supernatural show in painful reality, focussing on nothing more than real human emotion to tell a story.Buffy the Vampire Slayers spinoffwas forever in the shadow of its big sister, but the one thing it did better was darkness. From the off, Angel was meaner and manlier than its predecessor. Forget high school, trendy clubs and social get-togethers; introducing a vampire private investigator, gritty Los Angeles nightlife and car chases. It was a vital move and one that meant Angel went places BtVS couldnt touch. Never was this truer than in season twos Reunion (2.10) which saw vampire duo Darla and Drusilla pay a visit to the home of Holland Manners. Packed full of lawyers, its the perfect scene for a massacre. Yes, these are morally corrupt, demon-representing lawyers, but they are very obviously human. Angel is faced with the opportunity to save the day just like always. Holland says very clearly: Angel, people are going to die! At that, Angel utters And yet somehow, I just cant seem to care. The doors are locked and Angel walks away, giving Darla and Drusilla their massacre. Buffy stood for one point above all  never kill a human. This was Angel at its peak  going to a place that should find him on the end of a wooden stake. Not only does he let the massacre happen, but he locks the doors, becoming an active participant. Reunion was followed by the brilliant Redefinition (2.11), which took the show even darker. Season two is, without a doubt, Angel at its very best.Buffy the Vampire Slayers message was clear from the off  female empowerment. Heres a teenage girl with incredible strength and responsibility. Season seven (the shows final arc) focused more on that theme than any other, taking things back to basics. The introduction of misogynistic demon Caleb () was no coincidence. His woman-hating rants and fear of equality hammer home the message. The shows finale saw Buffy share her powers with every potential slayer in the world. The result was an army of empowered women, who came together to fight legions of vampires. BtVS started with a strong woman fighting the forces of darkness, and it concluded the exact same way:And misbehave he did. Poor oldwas axed way head of its time and sank into history as a failed sci-fi western TV show that very few people watched. But those few people refused to stay quiet. Outraged by their beloved shows quick dismissal, they fought for its return and what they got was a Hollywood blockbuster and Whedons feature film directorial debut. Picking up shortly after Fireflys final episode,keeps the TV feel and quirky characters, while also introducing new fans to the verse. It has almost everything you could want from a smart sci-fi movie, from thought-provoking themes (religion, power, birth, death et al), to compelling characters. And then theres witty dialogue, epic space battles, heroic last stands, hand-to-hand combat, and space zombies galore! Everyone thought Firefly and the crew of Serenity were dead. But as Mr. Whedon said: You cant take the sky from me.
(6th UPDATE) 'We have decided to close any kind of mining operation in functional watersheds,' says Environment Secretary Gina Lopez
Published 12:30 PM, February 02, 2017
Editor's Note: In an earlier version of this story, Platinum Development Corporation was in the list of companies with mining operations to be closed, based on a DENR list. The company, however, was excluded in the final list later posted on the DENR website. We have made the necessary correction.
MANILA, Philippines (6th UPDATE) – The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) announced the closure of 23 mining operations in several areas in the country on Thursday, February 2.
"We have decided to close any kind of mining operation in functional watersheds," Environment Secretary Gina Lopez said at a press conference on Thursday.
The environment department released what was supposed to be final list of its mining audit at 4:45 pm Thursday, which includes Ore Asia Mining and Development Corporation in Bulacan, and Benguet Corporation, the country's oldest mining company.
Ore Asia Mining and Development Corporation was earlier listed under suspended mining firms.
The DENR posted a final, corrected list on its website on Friday, February 3.
Below is the final list of mining firms whose operations were ordered closed in the following areas:
Benguet
Benguet Corporation
Bulacan
Ore Asia Mining and Development Corporation
Zambales
BenguetCorp Nickel Mines Incorporated
Eramen Minerals Incorporated
LNL Archipelago Minerals Incorporated
Zambales Diversified Metals Corporation
Homonhon
Mt Sinai Mining Exploration and Development Corporation
Emir Minerals Corporation
TechIron Mineral Resources Incorporated
Dinagat Islands
AAMPHIL Natural Resources Exploration
Oriental Synergy Mining Corporation
SinoSteel Philippines HY Mining Corporation
Kromico, Incorporated
Oriental Vision Mining Philippines Corporation
Wellex Mining Corporation
Libjo Mining Corporation
Surigao del Norte
ADNAMA Mining Resources Corporation
Claver Mineral Development Corporation
Hinatuan Mining Corporation
CTP Construction and Mining Corporation
Carrascal Nickel Corporation
Marcventures Mining and Development Corporation
Platinum Group Metals Corporation
The environment secretary said these firms can still appeal the decision before the Office of the President.
The DENR had given the closure order two days ago, so Lopez said these firms should not be operating unless they appeal the decision.
"[The] closure becomes final when the President says it is," Lopez told reporters. She said that in closing down these mines, she wants to make a statement that "water is important."
She also insisted that a green economy actually creates more jobs.
"When I was in Marrakesh, what they showed very clearly is that when you go environmental, it's not really a job loss, it's a transformation of the kind of job you have," Lopez explained.
She added: "It means transforming the way we uplift our economy…. An area development approach, with the benefit of the people living there as the prime reason for being, is our way out of poverty. I'm convinced about this, and I feel doing it this way will give us better GDP, it will even jack up the stock market, but we got to do it the right way, and we have to make the right choices."
'Government's fault'
While talking about the mines in Dinagat Islands, Lopez blamed the government and the DENR itself for not helping the communities affected by the mining operations.
She repeated this when asked why she decided to close the mines immediately instead of imposing fines and penalties first.
"Because as a matter of principle, you shouldn't have mines in a watershed. With a suspension, they can operate again, but I don't think they should ever operate a mine in a watershed."
Asked why these mining operations were approved by the DENR's Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) in the first place, Lopez said it's the MGB's mistake.
"They made a mistake, and if they made a mistake, I'm not going to continue it….I have my own principles and my own understanding of the Constitution, and if somebody has made a mistake in the past, I'm not going to follow that mistake, I would rather rectify it," she said.
On Thursday, Lopez also announced the suspension of the following mining firms:
Berong Nickel Corporation
OceanaGold Phils Incorporated
Lepanto Consolidated Mining Corporation

Following are my prepared notes for my talk on the Netroots Nation panel, Why Can't Apple Make Your iPhone in America? except cleaned up to make me look better:
We used to make things here, and then came free trade and then China opened up, and we moved a lot of manufacturing there, esoecially electronics. We say Apple here, because Apple is the most obvious, and because the supposed values of Apple conflict dramatically with what we now know about the working conditions of the people who make their products. But we mean ALL OF THEM.
We used to think that China got so much business because labor was cheap. The elites, benefiting from that, said take advantage of the low prices, and our workers can move on to better more productive pursuits.
Of course, intentionally undercutting the wages of our own workers was bad enough. And using that as a wedge to break unions was bad enough. But the story of our trade deal with China is much worse than that.
Not too long ago stories about the working conditions of Chinese electronics workers started to be heard. We started hearing about protests, strikes, and then about suicides at these factories.
The reports reached wide audiences from a New York Times report, How the U.S. Lost Out on iPhone Work
This report hilited Steve Jobs telling President Obama that these jobs are never coming back, and the reason was not the lower cost of labor. The reason was that in China they could make workers do things that they can't make them do here. They can make them live in dorms where they wake them up at midnight to stand for hours on assembly lines, or use neurotoxins that let them clean many more screens in a day. They can dump horrible stuff into the environment. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Ask Chen Guangcheng the blind lawyer who just arrived in the US about how people are treated there.
The business advantage China offers is not low wages, it is that in China the people do not have a say, and here people have a say.
When people have a say they want better pay, health care, retirement, vacations, sick pay, protections, worker safety, clean environment and taxes to support the country – things like that – the very things China offers to let our businesses escape from.
So what China offers is that China is “business-friendly.” Because people there do not have a say, so they can't ask for the things people should have.
Corporate conservatives here say we should be more business friendly, we should lower wages, lower taxes, stop taking care of the environment, stop all those pesky health and safety and environmental inspections, stop telling businesses what they can and cannot do, and all the rest. They say we should be more like China.
What they are saying is that we should abandon the benefits that democracy brought to We, the People – the 99%
in order to enrich a few people – the 1%.
When we opened up our borders to goods from China, and let this treatment of workers and the environment offer advantages to our elites, we made democracy a competitive disadvantage.
But wait, there's more.
There is another difference to consider. Look what China offers our business leaders. Chinas provide them with this exploited labor force at little cost. Beyond that China also subsidizes the manufacturing that is done there. They spend a great deal on manipulating their currency to keep prices of goods made there very low. They will build you a factory, pay for your electricity, and so much more.
China offers our business leaders an amazing deal – a deal that they can't refuse. The owners and managers of our companies get really, really rich if they play along with China. Nerver mind if the companies go away later, they're rich.
China offers these things to our business leaders for a reason. This is the reason : China sees itself as a country, and we no longer do.
China competes with us as a country. But our businesses see themselves as GLOBALIZED, not as part of a country.
So since we – at least our businesses – no longer see themselves as part of a country we are not responding to this competition. We are not mobilizing to fight back.
In fact, China has essentially recruited our own business leaders to fight against our own government.
Look at the effects on our country since we entered into this deal with China.
They are luring our businesses to move our jobs, factories, industries and technologies there for the private gain of a few, at the expense of us as a country, and we let that happen.
The trade imbalance is bankrupting us as a country. It has already drained trillions from our economy, weakening us and strengthening them.
They are smart, they do this as a NATIONAL strategy, as a country competing with us as a country, and the result is that in a competition between countries we may have already lost.
There are many things we can do about this. China can still be a partner, and there are many things we can help lift the wages and open things up for working people there.
We can require American companies to behave in the interest of their own country and of our democratic system, for one thing.
We can immediately require that imports not exceed exports by issuing import licenses based on exports.
We can demand that China actually trade with us, using that huge accumulated trade surplus to buy goods and services made here. This is dramatically in their interest – imagine what would happen to our economy if China started actually trading with us, buying American-made goods. Then the thriving American economy would boost the purchases of Chinese goods in return! That they don't do this, and instead use those resources against us, manipulating currency, subsidizing companies, tells us they are not playing an economic game, they are playing a nationalist game of strategic domination. As a country.
Unfortunately, as I said, China's trade strategy has helped create a situation where many of our own elites are fighting against our government.
This is an approximate answer I gave to a question in the Q&A:
There is high unemployment in Silicon Valley, higher than Flint, almost 1/4-1/3 of the big office buildings are empty, the downtowns have dozens of vacant storefront, and cities like Stockton have as many empty houses as cities li9ke Flint. The difference is this is all newer, so it looks better, doesn't LOOK like blight, but really it is the same thing as what is going on in the rust belt.

What does whole cluster (or whole berry) fermentation mean in winemaking? There really isn't anything new about whole cluster fermentation –it is a technique that has been around for centuries (indeed, long before the advent of the de-stemming machine it was really the only way to make wine). In Beaujolais, France it is the preferred technique for making Gamay grapes into wine. New or not, it does seem that many New World Pinot Noir winemakers are calling out "whole cluster" on their labels these days. if you have not yet tried a whole cluster wine, now is the time. The wines are as chaste and elegant as Queen Victoria but with a beguiling fresh-fruitiness that has no peer in ordinary wine.
I asked Flowers Winery's Dave Keatley, who makes wine with a blend of regular and whole cluster fermentation and describes them as "luscious and profound," to share the inside story on just how challenging it is to make one of these wines. Turns out, making wine with whole clusters is physically demanding, stressful, fraught with challenges and just plain risky. Winemakers have to manage tricky biochemical processes such as carbonic maceration and more pesky things such as this grape stems--and they don't play nice when mistreated. What follows is Dave's take on the business of whole cluster winemaking:
How much more labor-intensive is whole cluster fermentation that regular fermentation?
The process is more nuanced, more labor intensive, and requires more attention that a destemmed wine. The pump-over has to be done by hand, so during fermentation, we must drain juice from the bottom of the ferment and use gravity to return it to the top of the ferment. The effect is that of a “pump-over” in that the fermentation juice is cycled through the tank and given some oxygen but has none of the negative implications of using a pump.
We also do not like to employ stainless steel punchdown devices in the ferment- not only are they ineffective in accomplishing the goal of extraction--but they could also lacerate stems and release more astringency into the ferment. The biggest challenges in the fermentation are those presented during the peak of fermentation. Controlling temperature is vital to preventing green and stemmy qualities in the wine, so have to physically move whole cluster ferments to a cooler room for the peak of ferment to help control the temperature.
What can go wrong during this type of winemaking?
The biggest challenge and the thing that can absolutely go wrong is that the ferment could develop acetic acid bacteria which could lead to ethyl acetate. The most effective way to control the development of acetic acid bacteria is to manage the cap well- using dry ice to keep the headspace inert and try to extract some juice in the early stages of cold soak. A runaway high temperature ferment could also be a serious challenge. Again, because the tank can't mix, the ferment could be one temperature in one place, and much warmer in a small pocket. This is why we cycle the juice throughout the ferment.
What is your reason for making wine this way? What are you hoping to achieve?
Personally, I really enjoy the velvet texture of wines that have a component of whole cluster fermentation. These are also wines that are built for serious aging, and that reward someone for laying these wines down. I feel that whole cluster wines go through many different growth stages of intrigue, but when they click, they are luscious, integrated, profound and cerebral.
What is the best way to enjoy a whole cluster wine---with a specific food, on its own, kayaking with your dog?
I made a great lamb shank the other night and opened up a bottle, and it was a pretty great pairing! I also like whole cluster wines in front of a fire after a day of skiing, but kayaking with a dog sounds great too.

My wife and I have a joke. We tell it when we are out in public, at an airport or a restaurant or concert, and I need to use the bathroom. When I stand up to find a restroom I say to her, “Okay, honey, if I'm not out in five minutes, come look for me.”
We always laugh but, actually, it's not that funny. The “joke” plays on the fact that I'm a gender non-conforming and genderqueer person, and bathrooms are not safe spaces for me. This has always been true, but in the current political climate, when states are passing laws regulating the use of bathrooms by trans and gender non-confirming people, we've been telling this joke more.
Sometimes gallows humor is all you have.
Here's what happens when I go into a public restroom. I am female-bodied, but dress in a way that fits my own understanding of my gender identity which, while not male, definitely trends masculine. Dressed down I wear jeans and oxford shirts with baseball caps. Dressed up I prefer khakis and dress shirts. Bow ties are my favorite accessories. And my hair is cut short enough that the woman who cuts my hair charges me for a “men's cut” because she doesn't think I should have to pay more than a man for the same haircut.
Like I said, though, I'm not male. Unlike my trans brothers who have transitioned female-to-male, I have been clear that that was not the right path for me. I'm genderqueer and for me that means I feel happy to live in my body as it is. How I dress and carry that body, though, is often at stark contrast with what the world expects. It's been that way since I was a 3 year old telling my mom that overalls were better than dresses
So, when I go to use the women's bathroom, the bathroom of the sex to which I was assigned at birth, things get interesting. Unlike trans men and trans women who wish to use a bathroom that is different from the one they were assigned to at birth, but which fits their true gender, I just want to use the women's room. But like my trans brothers and sisters, this is not always a safe experience for me.
Here's what happens. I walk up to the bathroom, with it's picture of a woman in a dress, and I push open the door. Sometimes it starts there. A woman is coming out and she looks at me, looks up at the door, and looks confused. I push on anyway. Sometimes she will helpfully say, “I'm sorry, sir, this is the women's room.” I have learned to say, “yes…I know” and keep walking without waiting for a response.
I use the bathroom as quickly as possible. I don't know what the supporters of bathroom bill think trans and gender non-conforming people are doing in there, but I can assure you it's not exciting. In fact, I can testify that most of the time we get out as soon as humanly possible. Then I wash my hands, carefully avoiding the mirror-reflected gazes of the woman next to me. I say nothing, unless something is said to me. And then I leave.
I am lucky in that the worst that has ever happened to me in a women's room is that I've been embarrassed. Friends of mine have not been so lucky. One was pulled out by force by a man who believed she was going to harm his wife. He had thought she was a man. Other friends have come out to find a standing with a police officer who then demands to see their ID. And I've certainly thought about how to best defend myself if someone gets violent. Everyone I know who is gender non-conforming has had those thoughts.
That's why I try to avoid public bathrooms as much as possible. Believe me, if there is any way to get around it, I will. I suspect this is true of most trans, genderqueer, and gender non-conforming folks. For all the fears around us wanting to use the bathroom, the reality is that we're far more afraid to use it than you know. I've learned not to drink water before I have to fly in order to avoid airport restrooms. I change my clothes before I get to my gym. I've walked back to my house rather than use a restaurant bathroom.
Sometimes, though, I get lucky. I'll find a place with gender-neutral, single-stall restrooms. That's like hitting the bathroom lottery. When I came to the church I now serve, I was thrilled to find three gender-neutral bathrooms on the first floor and another upstairs. But this is rare.
The reality is that I spend far more time thinking of bathrooms than I ever thought possible. And for someone who grew up hearing that it was good manners to not talk about anything related to bathrooms, writing about this is particularly odd territory. But now is a kairos time in bathrooms. This is the time when we have to tell our stories, stories that maybe even our closest friends don't know.
And so, friends, I'm telling you this story. I'm telling you that no trans or gender non-conforming person wants to use the bathroom for any other reason than you do. I'm telling you that this has never been about sexual predators (who don't need bathrooms to hurt people, and who won't be discouraged by an anti-trans bathroom law), but about harming trans people. I'm telling you that I'd like to spend a whole lot less time thinking about bathrooms than I do.
And I'm also telling you this. I'm telling you that going into a restroom makes me afraid. I'm a former rugby player, I've studied judo, and I routinely dead-lift more than most grown men weigh. But multiple times a week I am too scared to take care of a basic human need in a public place.
The other night I read about a woman who has decided to bring her gun into restrooms from now on in order to “protect” herself from “perverts” who come in. To be clear, that meant anyone that she thought didn't belong in a women's room. Shoot first. Ask questions later.
I joked with my wife, “So, that's how I'm going to die. I'm going to go into a Target bathroom with that woman and she's going to think I'm a dude and shoot me.”
This time my wife didn't laugh.

“Football is not a matter of life and death,” said Bill Shankly. “It is much more important than that.” He was wrong, of course. It's simply part of the entertainment business.
The most revealing aspect of Shankly's quote is how thoroughly it's been taken out of context over the years.
Referencing the friendly rivalry between Liverpool and Everton fans, here's what the legendary former Reds manager actually said in full.
Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share
“I am not saying they love each other. Oh, no. Football is not a matter of life and death… it's much more important than that. And it's more important to them than that. But I've never seen a fight at a derby game. Shouting and bawling… yes. But they don't fight each other. And that says a lot for them.”
So an oft-repeated quip about the “life and death” importance of football is really about how supporters of two clubs from the same town get along reasonably well.
Talk about your mixed messages. It's an apt metaphor for how the A-League is going – decent football, dodgy administration.
What's the biggest story in Australian football right now? Is it table-toppers Sydney FC meeting moneybags Melbourne City at Allianz Stadium tonight?
Is it Brisbane Roar taking on Melbourne Victory in what is at least the 40th competitive meeting between the two sides at Suncorp Stadium on Sunday?
Or is it Football Federation Australia allegedly tapping up Sky Blues coach Graham Arnold for the Socceroos role – a move which prompted Sydney FC chief executive Danny Townsend to write about Arnold on Twitter, “He is a contracted coach and it is clear our priority is to keep him”.

Ah yes, the FFA. It wouldn't be an average week in Australian football if we didn't talk about their influence on the game.
It says much about the way head office runs things that no one seems to find it problematic when clubs like Sydney FC and Melbourne Victory are rewarded for domestic success by potentially having their head coach spirited away midway through the season.
And perhaps that's as it should be. After all, the World Cup is bigger than the A-League, is it not?
But if the governing body that controls the A-League can only treat it as an afterthought, then why should they expect anyone else to view it differently?
Hang on a second! Let's take stock here.
Haven't I criticised the FFA enough? Shouldn't I acknowledge that running a football competition is hard, that finances are tight and that everyone involved has the best of intentions?
Wouldn't it be better if I just didn't comment on any of this negativity at all?

Yeah, nah.
Because the A-League is part of the entertainment business, and right now we're so focused on governance, very few of us are being entertained by any actual football.
It's why Alex Brosque roasted the FFA over lacklustre attendances. It's why Townsend pinpoints “scheduling/fixtures” as the number one reason Sydney FC can't get more fans through the gate.
It's why the biggest stories are always about coaches and Congresses, but rarely about action on the pitch.
“Write about the football!” say readers in the comments section. But then when anyone does, no one comments on it.
You don't want to talk about the football. You want to talk about the big topics.
Right now, those topics are around governance and who will coach the Socceroos.

And that's a problem for the FFA, because despite their (mis)handling of both the Congress and the national team coaching position, we should really be talking about what's happening on the pitch.
I'll be at the Roar game on Sunday, despite the fact I've now seen this same fixture more times than any other game.
The A-League is stale. It needs expansion teams.
It needs to get back to what it's supposed to be doing – entertaining us.
And it needs us not to turn a blind eye, but to keep speaking the truth. Because football belongs to all of us. Not just the FFA.

During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims fast daily between dawn and sunset and the break-the-fast dinner, called the iftar, is traditionally a festive and spiritual event.
OTTAWA—Prime Minister Stephen Harper may have made Canadian history Monday night, inviting Muslim leaders to 24 Sussex to break the Ramadan fast.
U.S. President Barack Obama hosts an iftar annually at the White House. But Harper's office says Monday is the first time one has been held at 24 Sussex.
In his speech at the dinner, Harper says his house ultimately belongs to all Canadians and hopes everyone can share in the blessings of the month. He also notes that according to tradition those who host an iftar bring goodness upon themselves.
The Conservative government's relationship with the Muslim community has been tense, with major flare-ups over issues such as a new bill banning face veils during citizenship ceremonies.
Harper has also been criticized for focusing more on radical elements within Islam than on reaching out to mainstream Muslims in the aftermath of terrorist attacks linked to radicalization.
But in his speech Monday he paid tribute to the contributions of the community.

I don't know how for certain if he said that, but I wouldn't doubt it: 1. One can be racist and still view slavery as wrong. Realize the time period Abe lived in. 2. He wanted to win the presidency. He KNEW he wasn't getting the Southern vote, so he figured that he wouldn't get far by making the whites in the north feel unsettled. Once again, most people in the North in that time period were racist but still anti-slavery. Saying whites and blacks were equal in that time period would have cost him the northern vote, which he needed. Civil rights were not a widely-addressed issue until the middle of the 20th century.

posted 12:02 PM Here is the debate, in its entirety. It is very clear that Lincoln was trying to placate the "Butternuts" of southern Illinois (who in many ways had a pro-Southern viewpoint), most especially because of the well-known fact that several blacks (including Douglass) were campaigning for Lincoln in northern Ill. The debate makes it obvious, though, that he thought blacks had equal rights before the law and political expediency didn't prevent him from saying so. Taking only part of the quote and chopping out the rest that doesn't support one's viewpoint is very deceptive.

Ding Dong! Merrily on High Definition TV
posted 01:11 PM Not only were there interesting deletions, but there were insertions as well. The relevant part actually reads quote: Now, gentlemen, I don't want to read at any greater length, but this is the true complexion of all I have ever said in regard to the institution of slavery and the black race. This is the whole of it, and anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro, is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words, by which a man can prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut horse. I will say here, while upon this subject, that I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so. I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races. There is a physical difference between the two, which, in my judgment, will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position. I have never said anything to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man. I agree with Judge Douglas he is not my equal in many respectscertainly not in color, perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment. But in the right to eat the bread, without the leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.
While certainly racist by today's standards, it certainly was not at that time. Compare this to the interesting insertions mentioned in the OP about holding office and intermarriage. Lincoln did not mention these at all in the debates. Now, the part just before what I've quoted is Lincoln quoting an earlier speech where he explains his thoughts on freeing the slaves. It's interested in his admission of his own racism and that of the majority and that, right or wrong, you cannot simply ignore a majority view: quote: What next? Free them, and make them politically and socially our equals? My own feelings will not admit of this; and if mine would, we well know that those of the great mass of white people will not. Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment, is not the sole question, if, indeed, it is any part of it. A universal feeling, whether well or ill-founded, cannot be safely disregarded. We cannot, then, make them equals. It does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted; but for their tardiness in this, I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the South. pinqy

Amelia Nicol grew up in the relative isolation of Grand County, but "I've always had an interest in where the world is heading," she says. When the then-twenty-year-old moved to Denver a few months ago, she got the chance to put that interest in action, shaving her hair into a Mohawk and getting involved with the city's radical anarchist community, a cultural underground of young people who thrive off the grid, living on food scavenged from dumpsters, sleeping in houses with dozens of roommates, relying on their road bikes the way a Hells Angel depends on his Harley, and protesting the authoritarian demands of capitalism whenever possible. "I came to the 4/20 rally in April," Nicol recalls. "I sat in the park and lit dollar bills on fire."
Read a Q&A with Amelia Nicol, after she was released on bail.
Soon after, she heard about the March Against Police Terror being planned by a number of groups, including the Anarchist Black Cross. Over the past year, metro police departments have been involved in a number of controversial incidents that have brought out protesters ("The Watcher," May 19). Marvin Booker, a 54-year-old street preacher, was tased and choked to death in a Denver jail last summer; in February, Oleg Gidenko, a twenty-year-old-Russian immigrant sitting in a parked truck, was shot to death by Aurora cops.

On the afternoon of Friday, May 6, Nicol joined an estimated 150 other March Against Police Terror protesters in Sunken Gardens Park, where they found an impressive number of riot-geared cops waiting for them. Since they're anarchists, the protesting groups had not applied for a permit; instead, they simply filled the streets, blocking traffic while holding giant banners of Marvin Booker and shouting, "No justice, no peace! Fuck the police!"
"The police presence was at times so overwhelming that they easily outnumbered the amount of marchers," recalls Dave Shapiro-Strano, an organizer with Anarchist Black Cross.
The Denver Police Department had set up a staging area in the Denver Health parking lot, assigning three Rapid Deployment Vehicles to "shadow" the march, in case any mass arrests or riot control were needed. Officer Martin Tritschler, a member of the DPD Gang Unit, later testified that the department was "wanting to keep them safe, keep them from getting hit by cars."
"It really surprised me," says Nicol, describing the police response. "We were being peaceful, and they had police officers just lining the streets. I was like, 'If that's not indicative of the problem, I don't know what is.'"
The protesters marched up to Colfax, then over to the 16th Street Mall, then down Speer Boulevard. "The march attempted to go down Santa Fe, but there was a scuffle with the police," remembers Strano, "so we headed west toward Kalamath."
By now the march had been going on for a few hours, and the organizers decided it was time to disperse. They began loudly chanting a countdown from ten, a tactic they'd agreed upon earlier that day; the plan was for everyone to run in different directions when the countdown got to one, confusing the police. But in the chaos of the protesters' sprinting away, there was an explosion.
Some dismissed the sound as a cheap firework; others assumed it was an Improvised Explosive Device, or even a Molotov cocktail. "At first I thought [the police] shot a tear-gas can at us," says Strano.
According to Tritschler, a young girl with a Mohawk had pulled out a six-inch long white tube and lit a fuse, then hurled the object at a group of officers. DPD Sergeant Thomas Sherwood was driving by in his police cruiser; the object exploded inches from his windshield.
"I was running away, and then I heard the firework go off," remembers Nicol. "I was running down an alley, and then I heard them yell behind me, 'Mohawk, Mohawk!' There was a car parked at the end of the alley, and I was like, 'Oh, fuck.'"
The cops pushed her to the pavement and bound her wrists with riot cuffs that cut into her skin. "My wrists were bleeding for days," she says. "I still have scars." The restraints forced her to bend her feet and legs awkwardly. "The whole time, I was like, 'Fuck you! Do your worst!,'" Nicol remembers, "and they definitely did."
Nicol was taken to the Van Cise-Simonet Detention Center a few blocks away. Four days later, the Denver District Attorney's Office announced that she was being charged with two counts of attempted murder of police officers and possession of an incendiary device, among other felonies and misdemeanors. She was facing a possible prison sentence of 90 to 120 years; her bond was set at $50,000. For the first four weeks, Nicol refused any attempts to post bond.
On Wednesday, June 8, about twenty anarchists assembled outside the Denver DA's office to protest the incarceration of Nicol, who had celebrated her 21st birthday in jail. "Amelia has been charged with a host of violent felonies, including two counts of attempted murder of law enforcement officers," proclaimed ABC's Strano. "These charges are completely fictitious. The Denver DA has overcharged Amelia Nicol to a horrifically startling degree."
As Strano spoke, a cadre of bicycle cops watched from across the street.
"Police are waging war on communities in this city," Strano continued. "Reports of brutality, murder and rape by police officers across the metro area expose the atrocious nature of our justice system. And the message that the police and the DA are sending is, if you are going to speak up, you are going to end up like Amelia Nicol."
Strano didn't know Nicol before her arrest, but he's now pushing her cause aggressively. "We're the primary support team for Amelia," he explains. "We're helping coordinate political and social support campaigns for her, putting pressure on the DA, raising money for stamps, envelopes, writing paper or anything else she needs."
Although Nicol has received letters from anarchists around the country supporting her, she was waiting for a shipment of stamps and envelopes before she wrote back. "I've had money on commissary for the past couple weeks," she explained last week, "but I refuse to spend it, because it's all part of their moneymaking scheme. That's how the rich man funds his army."
About two weeks into her incarceration, Nicol was moved into solitary confinement; apparently her cellmates complained about her reluctance to shower. She passed the time writing letters on scraps of paper and reading a copy of Dune that she was pleased to find in a collection of what she describes as "a bunch of crappy romance novels."
On June 9, Nicol got to leave her cell to attend her preliminary hearing.
A dozen or so anarchists, freegans and political activists joined as many police officers in the courtroom, where Tritschler testified that he felt the concussion blast of a "deep, low-order explosive" that reminded him of a "grenade simulator." He was an authority on the subject, he said, based on his military training in explosive technology, as well as the DPD's post-9/11 explosive training.
But when cross-examined by Nicol's defense attorney, Harvey Steinberg, Tritschler eventually admitted that the explosion was probably an M-80 firecracker — though he debated with Steinberg about whether an M-80 was a harmless, commercial firework or a dangerous explosive.
The only evidence found of the explosive were pieces of cardboard, Steinberg pointed out; if the explosion had occurred inches from Sherwood's police car and no damage was done, there was no possible way that the "explosive device" could potentially end someone's life. "This case has been incredibly overcharged," the attorney told the judge. "There is no basis or premise for attempted murder or engaging in a riot based on the evidence presented."
Judge Andrew J. Armatas agreed and dropped most of the felony charges, leaving only possession of an incendiary device — which Steinberg says will be a "fertile issue for litigation" during Nicol's arraignment on June 27. All of the misdemeanor charges remain, including a charge of resisting arrest and third-degree assault. Her bond was reduced to $5,000.
When the two attempted-murder charges were dropped, Nichol's supporters broke out in applause. Saying they were being "ridiculous," the judge told them to be quiet, and threatened them with arrest if they didn't stop immediately. They did, but as they left the courthouse, they were "shadowed" by half a dozen officers.
The following morning, Strano and ABC paid a bail bondsman $530 so that Nicol could bond out of jail. She's now wearing an ankle bracelet...and a Mohawk.
